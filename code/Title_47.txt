    the country to which the officer drawing them up belongs; they may

    ports where customary working hours are other than those
    hereinabove mentioned, the engineers in charge are vested with
    authority to regulate the hours of such employees so as to agree
    with prevailing working hours in said ports where inspections are
    to be made, but nothing contained in this proviso shall be
    construed in any manner to alter the length of a working day for
    the engineers in charge and radio engineers or the overtime pay
    herein fixed: and Provided further, That, in the alternative, an
    entity designated by the Commission may make the inspections
    referred to in this paragraph.

    certification of individuals to perform transmitter installation,
    operation, maintenance, and repair duties in the private land
    mobile services and fixed services (as defined by the Commission by

-STATUTE-
    (a) Chairman; duties; vacancy
      The member of the Commission designated by the President as
    chairman shall be the chief executive officer of the Commission. It
    shall be his duty to preside at all meetings and sessions of the
    Commission, to represent the Commission in all matters relating to
    legislation and legislative reports, except that any commissioner
    may present his own or minority views or supplemental reports, to
    represent the Commission in all matters requiring conferences or
    communications with other governmental officers, departments or
    agencies, and generally to coordinate and organize the work of the
    Commission in such manner as to promote prompt and efficient
    disposition of all matters within the jurisdiction of the
    Commission. In the case of a vacancy in the office of the chairman
    of the Commission, or the absence or inability of the chairman to
    serve, the Commission may temporarily designate one of its members
    to act as chairman until the cause or circumstance requiring such
    designation shall have been eliminated or corrected.
    (b) Organization of staff
      From time to time as the Commission may find necessary, the
    Commission shall organize its staff into (1) integrated bureaus, to
    function on the basis of the Commission's principal workload
    operations, and (2) such other divisional organizations as the
    Commission may deem necessary. Each such integrated bureau shall
    include such legal, engineering, accounting, administrative,
    clerical, and other personnel as the Commission may determine to be
    necessary to perform its functions.
    (c) Delegation of functions; exceptions to initial orders; force,
      effect and enforcement of orders; administrative and judicial
      review; qualifications and compensation of delegates; assignment
      of cases; separation of review and investigative or prosecuting
      functions; secretary; seal
      (1) When necessary to the proper functioning of the Commission
    and the prompt and orderly conduct of its business, the Commission
    may, by published rule or by order, delegate any of its functions
    (except functions granted to the Commission by this paragraph and
    by paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of this subsection and except any
    action referred to in sections 204(a)(2), 208(b), and 405(b) of
    this title) to a panel of commissioners, an individual
    commissioner, an employee board, or an individual employee,
    including functions with respect to hearing, determining, ordering,
    certifying, reporting, or otherwise acting as to any work,
    business, or matter; except that in delegating review functions to
    employees in cases of adjudication (as defined in section 551 of
    title 5), the delegation in any such case may be made only to an
    employee board consisting of two or more employees referred to in
    paragraph (8) of this subsection. Any such rule or order may be
    adopted, amended, or rescinded only by a vote of a majority of the
    members of the Commission then holding office. Except for cases
    involving the authorization of service in the instructional
    television fixed service, or as otherwise provided in this chapter,
    nothing in this paragraph shall authorize the Commission to provide
    for the conduct, by any person or persons other than persons
    referred to in paragraph (2) or (3) of section 556(b) of title 5,
    of any hearing to which such section applies.
      (2) As used in this subsection the term "order, decision, report,
    or action" does not include an initial, tentative, or recommended
    decision to which exceptions may be filed as provided in section
    409(b) of this title.
      (3) Any order, decision, report, or action made or taken pursuant
    to any such delegation, unless reviewed as provided in paragraph
    (4) of this subsection, shall have the same force and effect, and
    shall be made, evidenced, and enforced in the same manner, as
    orders, decisions, reports, or other actions of the Commission.
      (4) Any person aggrieved by any such order, decision, report or
    action may file an application for review by the Commission within
    such time and in such manner as the Commission shall prescribe, and
    every such application shall be passed upon by the Commission. The
    Commission, on its own initiative, may review in whole or in part,
    at such time and in such manner as it shall determine, any order,
    decision, report, or action made or taken pursuant to any
    delegation under paragraph (1) of this subsection.
      (5) In passing upon applications for review, the Commission may
    grant, in whole or in part, or deny such applications without
    specifying any reasons therefor. No such application for review
    shall rely on questions of fact or law upon which the panel of
    commissioners, individual commissioner, employee board, or
    individual employee has been afforded no opportunity to pass.
      (6) If the Commission grants the application for review, it may
    affirm, modify, or set aside the order, decision, report, or
    action, or it may order a rehearing upon such order, decision,
    report, or action in accordance with section 405 of this title.
      (7) The filing of an application for review under this subsection
    shall be a condition precedent to judicial review of any order,
    decision, report, or action made or taken pursuant to a delegation
    under paragraph (1) of this subsection. The time within which a
    petition for review must be filed in a proceeding to which section
    402(a) of this title applies, or within which an appeal must be
    taken under section 402(b) of this title, shall be computed from
    the date upon which public notice is given of orders disposing of
    all applications for review filed in any case.
      (8) The employees to whom the Commission may delegate review
    functions in any case of adjudication (as defined in section 551 of
    title 5) shall be qualified, by reason of their training,
    experience, and competence, to perform such review functions, and
    shall perform no duties inconsistent with such review functions.
    Such employees shall be in a grade classification or salary level
    commensurate with their important duties, and in no event less than
    the grade classification or salary level of the employee or
    employees whose actions are to be reviewed. In the performance of
    such review functions such employees shall be assigned to cases in
    rotation so far as practicable and shall not be responsible to or
    subject to the supervision or direction of any officer, employee,
    or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting
    functions for any agency.
      (9) The secretary and seal of the Commission shall be the
    secretary and seal of each panel of the Commission, each individual
    commissioner, and each employee board or individual employee
    exercising functions delegated pursuant to paragraph (1) of this
    subsection.
    (d) Meetings
      Meetings of the Commission shall be held at regular intervals,
    not less frequently than once each calendar month, at which times
    the functioning of the Commission and the handling of its work load
    shall be reviewed and such orders shall be entered and other action
    taken as may be necessary or appropriate to expedite the prompt and
    orderly conduct of the business of the Commission with the
    objective of rendering a final decision (1) within three months
    from the date of filing in all original application, renewal, and
    transfer cases in which it will not be necessary to hold a hearing,
    and (2) within six months from the final date of the hearing in all
    hearing cases.
    (e) Managing Director; appointment, functions, pay
      The Commission shall have a Managing Director who shall be
    appointed by the Chairman subject to the approval of the
    Commission. The Managing Director, under the supervision and
    direction of the Chairman, shall perform such administrative and
    executive functions as the Chairman shall delegate. The Managing
    Director shall be paid at a rate equal to the rate then payable for
    level V of the Executive Schedule.

      (1) The Schedule of Application Fees established under this

    Index since April 7, 1986, amounts to at least $5.00 in the case of
    fees under $100.00, or 5 percent in the case of fees of $100.00 or
    more. All fees which require adjustment will be rounded upward to
    the next $5.00 increment. The Commission shall transmit to the
    Congress notification of any such adjustment not later than 90 days

    section. Such penalty shall be 25 percent of the amount of the
    application fee which was not paid in a timely manner.

    Sec. 159. Regulatory fees

-STATUTE-
    (a) General authority
      (1) Recovery of costs
        The Commission, in accordance with this section, shall assess
      and collect regulatory fees to recover the costs of the following
      regulatory activities of the Commission: enforcement activities,
      policy and rulemaking activities, user information services, and
      international activities.
      (2) Fees contingent on appropriations
        The fees described in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be
      collected only if, and only in the total amounts, required in
      Appropriations Acts.
    (b) Establishment and adjustment of regulatory fees
      (1) In general
        The fees assessed under subsection (a) of this section shall - 
          (A) be derived by determining the full-time equivalent number
        of employees performing the activities described in subsection
        (a) of this section within the Private Radio Bureau, Mass Media
        Bureau, Common Carrier Bureau, and other offices of the
        Commission, adjusted to take into account factors that are
        reasonably related to the benefits provided to the payor of the
        fee by the Commission's activities, including such factors as
        service area coverage, shared use versus exclusive use, and
        other factors that the Commission determines are necessary in
        the public interest;
          (B) be established at amounts that will result in collection,
        during each fiscal year, of an amount that can reasonably be
        expected to equal the amount appropriated for such fiscal year
        for the performance of the activities described in subsection
        (a) of this section; and
          (C) until adjusted or amended by the Commission pursuant to
        paragraph (2) or (3), be the fees established by the Schedule
        of Regulatory Fees in subsection (g) of this section.
      (2) Mandatory adjustment of schedule
        For any fiscal year after fiscal year 1994, the Commission
      shall, by rule, revise the Schedule of Regulatory Fees by
      proportionate increases or decreases to reflect, in accordance
      with paragraph (1)(B), changes in the amount appropriated for the
      performance of the activities described in subsection (a) of this
      section for such fiscal year. Such proportionate increases or
      decreases shall - 
          (A) be adjusted to reflect, within the overall amounts
        described in appropriations Acts under the authority of
        paragraph (1)(A), unexpected increases or decreases in the
        number of licensees or units subject to payment of such fees;
        and
          (B) be established at amounts that will result in collection
        of an aggregate amount of fees pursuant to this section that
        can reasonably be expected to equal the aggregate amount of
        fees that are required to be collected by appropriations Acts
        pursuant to paragraph (1)(B).

      Increases or decreases in fees made by adjustments pursuant to
      this paragraph shall not be subject to judicial review. In making
      adjustments pursuant to this paragraph the Commission may round
      such fees to the nearest $5 in the case of fees under $1,000, or
      to the nearest $25 in the case of fees of $1,000 or more.
      (3) Permitted amendments
        In addition to the adjustments required by paragraph (2), the
      Commission shall, by regulation, amend the Schedule of Regulatory
      Fees if the Commission determines that the Schedule requires
      amendment to comply with the requirements of paragraph (1)(A). In
      making such amendments, the Commission shall add, delete, or
      reclassify services in the Schedule to reflect additions,
      deletions, or changes in the nature of its services as a
      consequence of Commission rulemaking proceedings or changes in
      law. Increases or decreases in fees made by amendments pursuant
      to this paragraph shall not be subject to judicial review.
      (4) Notice to Congress
        The Commission shall - 
          (A) transmit to the Congress notification of any adjustment
        made pursuant to paragraph (2) immediately upon the adoption of
        such adjustment; and
          (B) transmit to the Congress notification of any amendment
        made pursuant to paragraph (3) not later than 90 days before
        the effective date of such amendment.
    (c) Enforcement
      (1) Penalties for late payment
        The Commission shall prescribe by regulation an additional
      charge which shall be assessed as a penalty for late payment of
      fees required by subsection (a) of this section. Such penalty
      shall be 25 percent of the amount of the fee which was not paid
      in a timely manner.
      (2) Dismissal of applications for filings
        The Commission may dismiss any application or other filing for
      failure to pay in a timely manner any fee or penalty under this
      section.
      (3) Revocations
        In addition to or in lieu of the penalties and dismissals
      authorized by paragraphs (1) and (2), the Commission may revoke
      any instrument of authorization held by any entity that has
      failed to make payment of a regulatory fee assessed pursuant to
      this section. Such revocation action may be taken by the
      Commission after notice of the Commission's intent to take such
      action is sent to the licensee by registered mail, return receipt
      requested, at the licensee's last known address. The notice will
      provide the licensee at least 30 days to either pay the fee or
      show cause why the fee does not apply to the licensee or should
      otherwise be waived or payment deferred. A hearing is not
      required under this subsection unless the licensee's response
      presents a substantial and material question of fact. In any case
      where a hearing is conducted pursuant to this section, the
      hearing shall be based on written evidence only, and the burden
      of proceeding with the introduction of evidence and the burden of
      proof shall be on the licensee. Unless the licensee substantially
      prevails in the hearing, the Commission may assess the licensee
      for the costs of such hearing. Any Commission order adopted
      pursuant to this subsection shall determine the amount due, if
      any, and provide the licensee with at least 30 days to pay that
      amount or have its authorization revoked. No order of revocation
      under this subsection shall become final until the licensee has
      exhausted its right to judicial review of such order under
      section 402(b)(5) of this title.
    (d) Waiver, reduction, and deferment
      The Commission may waive, reduce, or defer payment of a fee in
    any specific instance for good cause shown, where such action would
    promote the public interest.
    (e) Deposit of collections
      Moneys received from fees established under this section shall be
    deposited as an offsetting collection in, and credited to, the
    account providing appropriations to carry out the functions of the
    Commission.
    (f) Regulations
      (1) In general
        The Commission shall prescribe appropriate rules and
      regulations to carry out the provisions of this section.
      (2) Installment payments
        Such rules and regulations shall permit payment by installments
      in the case of fees in large amounts, and in the case of fees in
      small amounts, shall require the payment of the fee in advance
      for a number of years not to exceed the term of the license held
      by the payor.
    (g) Schedule
      Until amended by the Commission pursuant to subsection (b) of
    this section, the Schedule of Regulatory Fees which the Federal
    Communications Commission shall, subject to subsection (a)(2) of
    this section, assess and collect shall be as follows:

    Sec. 160. Competition in provision of telecommunications service

-STATUTE-
    (a) Regulatory flexibility
      Notwithstanding section 332(c)(1)(A) of this title, the
    Commission shall forbear from applying any regulation or any
    provision of this chapter to a telecommunications carrier or
    telecommunications service, or class of telecommunications carriers
    or telecommunications services, in any or some of its or their
    geographic markets, if the Commission determines that - 
        (1) enforcement of such regulation or provision is not
      necessary to ensure that the charges, practices, classifications,
      or regulations by, for, or in connection with that
      telecommunications carrier or telecommunications service are just
      and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably
      discriminatory;
        (2) enforcement of such regulation or provision is not
      necessary for the protection of consumers; and
        (3) forbearance from applying such provision or regulation is
      consistent with the public interest.
    (b) Competitive effect to be weighed
      In making the determination under subsection (a)(3) of this
    section, the Commission shall consider whether forbearance from
    enforcing the provision or regulation will promote competitive
    market conditions, including the extent to which such forbearance
    will enhance competition among providers of telecommunications
    services. If the Commission determines that such forbearance will
    promote competition among providers of telecommunications services,
    that determination may be the basis for a Commission finding that
    forbearance is in the public interest.
    (c) Petition for forbearance
      Any telecommunications carrier, or class of telecommunications
    carriers, may submit a petition to the Commission requesting that
    the Commission exercise the authority granted under this section
    with respect to that carrier or those carriers, or any service
    offered by that carrier or carriers. Any such petition shall be
    deemed granted if the Commission does not deny the petition for
    failure to meet the requirements for forbearance under subsection
    (a) of this section within one year after the Commission receives
    it, unless the one-year period is extended by the Commission. The
    Commission may extend the initial one-year period by an additional
    90 days if the Commission finds that an extension is necessary to
    meet the requirements of subsection (a) of this section. The
    Commission may grant or deny a petition in whole or in part and
    shall explain its decision in writing.
    (d) Limitation
      Except as provided in section 251(f) of this title, the
    Commission may not forbear from applying the requirements of
    section 251(c) or 271 of this title under subsection (a) of this
    section until it determines that those requirements have been fully
    implemented.
    (e) State enforcement after Commission forbearance
      A State commission may not continue to apply or enforce any
    provision of this chapter that the Commission has determined to
    forbear from applying under subsection (a) of this section.

-STATUTE-
      (a) It shall be the duty of every common carrier engaged in
    interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio to furnish
    such communication service upon reasonable request therefor; and,
    in accordance with the orders of the Commission, in cases where the
    Commission, after opportunity for hearing, finds such action
    necessary or desirable in the public interest, to establish
    physical connections with other carriers, to establish through
    routes and charges applicable thereto and the divisions of such
    charges, and to establish and provide facilities and regulations
    for operating such through routes.
      (b) All charges, practices, classifications, and regulations for
    and in connection with such communication service, shall be just
    and reasonable, and any such charge, practice, classification, or
    regulation that is unjust or unreasonable is declared to be
    unlawful: Provided, That communications by wire or radio subject to
    this chapter may be classified into day, night, repeated,
    unrepeated, letter, commercial, press, Government, and such other
    classes as the Commission may decide to be just and reasonable, and
    different charges may be made for the different classes of
    communications: Provided further, That nothing in this chapter or
    in any other provision of law shall be construed to prevent a
    common carrier subject to this chapter from entering into or
    operating under any contract with any common carrier not subject to
    this chapter, for the exchange of their services, if the Commission
    is of the opinion that such contract is not contrary to the public
    interest: Provided further, That nothing in this chapter or in any
    other provision of law shall prevent a common carrier subject to
    this chapter from furnishing reports of positions of ships at sea
    to newspapers of general circulation, either at a nominal charge or
    without charge, provided the name of such common carrier is
    displayed along with such ship position reports. The Commission may
    prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary in the
    public interest to carry out the provisions of this chapter.

    on its own system and points on the system of its connecting
    carriers or points on the system of any other carrier subject to
    this chapter when a through route has been established, whether
    such charges are joint or separate, and showing the
    classifications, practices, and regulations affecting such charges.
    Such schedules shall contain such other information, and be printed
    in such form, and be posted and kept open for public inspection in
    such places, as the Commission may by regulation require, and each
    such schedule shall give notice of its effective date; and such
    common carrier shall furnish such schedules to each of its
    connecting carriers, and such connecting carriers shall keep such

    and to the public, which shall be published in such form and
    contain such information as the Commission may by regulations
    prescribe.
      (2) The Commission may, in its discretion and for good cause

    thereunder; and no carrier shall (1) charge, demand, collect, or
    receive a greater or less or different compensation for such
    communication, or for any service in connection therewith, between
    the points named in any such schedule than the charges specified in
    the schedule then in effect, or (2) refund or remit by any means or
    device any portion of the charges so specified, or (3) extend to
    any person any privileges or facilities in such communication, or
    employ or enforce any classifications, regulations, or practices
    affecting such charges, except as specified in such schedule.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 204. Hearings on new charges; suspension pending hearing;
      refunds; duration of hearing; appeal of order concluding hearing

-STATUTE-
      (a)(1) Whenever there is filed with the Commission any new or
    revised charge, classification, regulation, or practice, the
    Commission may either upon complaint or upon its own initiative
    without complaint, upon reasonable notice, enter upon a hearing
    concerning the lawfulness thereof; and pending such hearing and the
    decision thereon the Commission, upon delivering to the carrier or
    carriers affected thereby a statement in writing of its reasons for
    such suspension, may suspend the operation of such charge,
    classification, regulation, or practice, in whole or in part but
    not for a longer period than five months beyond the time when it
    would otherwise go into effect; and after full hearing the
    Commission may make such order with reference thereto as would be
    proper in a proceeding initiated after such charge, classification,
    regulation, or practice had become effective. If the proceeding has
    not been concluded and an order made within the period of the
    suspension, the proposed new or revised charge, classification,
    regulation, or practice shall go into effect at the end of such
    period; but in case of a proposed charge for a new service or a
    revised charge, the Commission may by order require the interested
    carrier or carriers to keep accurate account of all amounts
    received by reason of such charge for a new service or revised
    charge, specifying by whom and in whose behalf such amounts are
    paid, and upon completion of the hearing and decision may by
    further order require the interested carrier or carriers to refund,
    with interest, to the persons in whose behalf such amounts were
    paid, such portion of such charge for a new service or revised
    charges as by its decision shall be found not justified. At any
    hearing involving a new or revised charge, or a proposed new or
    revised charge, the burden of proof to show that the new or revised
    charge, or proposed charge, is just and reasonable shall be upon
    the carrier, and the Commission shall give to the hearing and
    decision of such questions preference over all other questions
    pending before it and decide the same as speedily as possible.
      (2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Commission
    shall, with respect to any hearing under this section, issue an
    order concluding such hearing within 5 months after the date that
    the charge, classification, regulation, or practice subject to the
    hearing becomes effective.
      (B) The Commission shall, with respect to any such hearing
    initiated prior to November 3, 1988, issue an order concluding the
    hearing not later than 12 months after November 3, 1988.
      (C) Any order concluding a hearing under this section shall be a
    final order and may be appealed under section 402(a) of this title.
      (3) A local exchange carrier may file with the Commission a new
    or revised charge, classification, regulation, or practice on a
    streamlined basis. Any such charge, classification, regulation, or
    practice shall be deemed lawful and shall be effective 7 days (in
    the case of a reduction in rates) or 15 days (in the case of an
    increase in rates) after the date on which it is filed with the
    Commission unless the Commission takes action under paragraph (1)
    before the end of that 7-day or 15-day period, as is appropriate.
      (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this
    section, the Commission may allow part of a charge, classification,
    regulation, or practice to go into effect, based upon a written
    showing by the carrier or carriers affected, and an opportunity for
    written comment thereon by affected persons, that such partial
    authorization is just, fair, and reasonable. Additionally, or in
    combination with a partial authorization, the Commission, upon a
    similar showing, may allow all or part of a charge, classification,
    regulation, or practice to go into effect on a temporary basis
    pending further order of the Commission. Authorizations of
    temporary new or increased charges may include an accounting order
    of the type provided for in subsection (a) of this section.

    whereupon a statement of the complaint thus made shall be forwarded
    by the Commission to such common carrier, who shall be called upon
    to satisfy the complaint or to answer the same in writing within a
    reasonable time to be specified by the Commission. If such common
    carrier within the time specified shall make reparation for the
    injury alleged to have been caused, the common carrier shall be
    relieved of liability to the complainant only for the particular
    violation of law thus complained of. If such carrier or carriers

    shall appear to be any reasonable ground for investigating said
    complaint, it shall be the duty of the Commission to investigate
    the matters complained of in such manner and by such means as it
    shall deem proper. No complaint shall at any time be dismissed
    because of the absence of direct damage to the complaint.
      (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Commission shall,
    with respect to any investigation under this section of the
    lawfulness of a charge, classification, regulation, or practice,
    issue an order concluding such investigation within 5 months after
    the date on which the complaint was filed.
      (2) The Commission shall, with respect to any such investigation
    initiated prior to November 3, 1988, issue an order concluding the
    investigation not later than 12 months after November 3, 1988.
      (3) Any order concluding an investigation under paragraph (1) or

-STATUTE-
    (a) Hearing
      The Commission may from time to time, as may be necessary for the
    proper administration of this chapter, and after opportunity for
    hearing, make a valuation of all or of any part of the property
    owned or used by any carrier subject to this chapter, as of such
    date as the Commission may fix.
    (b) Inventory
      The Commission may at any time require any such carrier to file
    with the Commission an inventory of all or of any part of the
    property owned or used by said carrier, which inventory shall show
    the units of said property classified in such detail, and in such
    manner, as the Commission shall direct, and shall show the
    estimated cost of reproduction new of said units, and their
    reproduction cost new less depreciation, as of such date as the
    Commission may direct; and such carrier shall file such inventory
    within such reasonable time as the Commission by order shall
    require.
    (c) Original cost
      The Commission may at any time require any such carrier to file
    with the Commission a statement showing the original cost at the
    time of dedication to the public use of all or of any part of the
    property owned or used by said carrier. For the showing of such
    original cost said property shall be classified, and the original
    cost shall be defined, in such manner as the Commission may
    prescribe; and if any part of such cost cannot be determined from
    accounting or other records, the portion of the property for which
    such cost cannot be determined shall be reported to the Commission;
    and, if the Commission shall so direct, the original cost thereof
    shall be estimated in such manner as the Commission may prescribe.
    If the carrier owning the property at the time such original cost
    is reported shall have paid more or less than the original cost to
    acquire the same, the amount of such cost of acquisition, and any
    facts which the Commission may require in connection therewith,
    shall be reported with such original cost. The report made by a
    carrier under this subsection shall show the source or sources from
    which the original cost reported was obtained, and such other
    information as to the manner in which the report was prepared, as
    the Commission shall require.
    (d) Easement, license or franchise
      Nothing shall be included in the original cost reported for the
    property of any carrier under subsection (c) of this section on
    account of any easement, license, or franchise granted by the
    United States or by any State or political subdivision thereof,
    beyond the reasonable necessary expense lawfully incurred in
    obtaining such easement, license, or franchise from the public
    authority aforesaid, which expense shall be reported separately
    from all other costs in such detail as the Commission may require;
    and nothing shall be included in any valuation of the property of
    any carrier made by the Commission on account of any such easement,
    license, or franchise, beyond such reasonable necessary expense
    lawfully incurred as aforesaid.
    (e) Improvements; changes in condition
      The Commission shall keep itself informed of all new
    construction, extensions, improvements, retirements, or other
    changes in the condition, quantity, use, and classification of the
    property of common carriers, and of the cost of all additions and
    betterments thereto and of all changes in the investment therein,
    and may keep itself informed of current changes in costs and values
    of carrier properties.
    (f) Additional information; access to records and data
      For the purpose of enabling the Commission to make a valuation of
    any of the property of any such carrier, or to find the original
    cost of such property, or to find any other facts concerning the
    same which are required for use by the Commission, it shall be the
    duty of each such carrier to furnish to the Commission, within such
    reasonable time as the Commission may order, any information with
    respect thereto which the Commission may by order require,
    including copies of maps, contracts, reports of engineers, and
    other data, records, and papers, and to grant to all agents of the
    Commission free access to its property and its accounts, records,
    and memoranda whenever and wherever requested by any such duly
    authorized agent, and to cooperate with and aid the Commission in
    the work of making any such valuation or finding in such manner and
    to such extent as the Commission may require and direct, and all
    rules and regulations made by the Commission for the purpose of
    administering this section shall have the full force and effect of
    law. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, with the reasons
    therefor, the records and data of the Commission shall be open to
    the inspection and examination of the public. The Commission, in
    making any such valuation, shall be free to adopt any method of
    valuation which shall be lawful.

    construction, acquisition, or operation of (1) a line within a
    single State unless such line constitutes part of an interstate
    line, (2) local, branch, or terminal lines not exceeding ten miles
    in length, or (3) any line acquired under section 221 of this
    title: Provided further, That the Commission may, upon appropriate
    request being made, authorize temporary or emergency service, or
    the supplementing of existing facilities, without regard to the
    provisions of this section. No carrier shall discontinue, reduce,
    or impair service to a community, or part of a community, unless
    and until there shall first have been obtained from the Commission
    a certificate that neither the present nor future public
    convenience and necessity will be adversely affected thereby;
    except that the Commission may, upon appropriate request being
    made, authorize temporary or emergency discontinuance, reduction,
    or impairment of service, or partial discontinuance, reduction, or
    impairment of service, without regard to the provisions of this
    section. As used in this section the term "line" means any channel
    of communication established by the use of appropriate equipment,
    other than a channel of communication established by the
    interconnection of two or more existing channels: Provided,
    however, That nothing in this section shall be construed to require
    a certificate or other authorization from the Commission for any
    installation, replacement, or other changes in plant, operation, or
    equipment, other than new construction, which will not impair the
    adequacy or quality of service provided.
    (b) Notification of Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and
      State Governor
      Upon receipt of an application for any such certificate, the
    Commission shall cause notice thereof to be given to, and shall
    cause a copy of such application to be filed with, the Secretary of
    Defense, the Secretary of State (with respect to such applications
    involving service to foreign points), and the Governor of each
    State in which such line is proposed to be constructed, extended,
    acquired, or operated, or in which such discontinuance, reduction,
    or impairment of service is proposed, with the right to those
    notified to be heard; and the Commission may require such published
    notice as it shall determine.
    (c) Approval or disapproval; injunction
      The Commission shall have power to issue such certificate as
    applied for, or to refuse to issue it, or to issue it for a portion
    or portions of a line, or extension thereof, or discontinuance,
    reduction, or impairment of service, described in the application,
    or for the partial exercise only of such right or privilege, and
    may attach to the issuance of the certificate such terms and
    conditions as in its judgment the public convenience and necessity
    may require. After issuance of such certificate, and not before,
    the carrier may, without securing approval other than such
    certificate, comply with the terms and conditions contained in or
    attached to the issuance of such certificate and proceed with the
    construction, extension, acquisition, operation, or discontinuance,
    reduction, or impairment of service covered thereby. Any
    construction, extension, acquisition, operation, discontinuance,
    reduction, or impairment of service contrary to the provisions of
    this section may be enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction
    at the suit of the United States, the Commission, the State
    commission, any State affected, or any party in interest.
    (d) Order of Commission; hearing; penalty
      The Commission may, after full opportunity for hearing, in a
    proceeding upon complaint or upon its own initiative without
    complaint, authorize or require by order any carrier, party to such
    proceeding, to provide itself with adequate facilities for the
    expeditious and efficient performance of its service as a common
    carrier and to extend its line or to establish a public office; but
    no such authorization or order shall be made unless the Commission
    finds, as to such provision of facilities, as to such establishment
    of public offices, or as to such extension, that it is reasonably
    required in the interest of public convenience and necessity, or as
    to such extension or facilities that the expense involved therein
    will not impair the ability of the carrier to perform its duty to
    the public. Any carrier which refuses or neglects to comply with
    any order of the Commission made in pursuance of this subsection
    shall forfeit to the United States $1,200 for each day during which
    such refusal or neglect continues.
    (e) Provision of universal service
      (1) Eligible telecommunications carriers
        A common carrier designated as an eligible telecommunications
      carrier under paragraph (2), (3), or (6) shall be eligible to
      receive universal service support in accordance with section 254
      of this title and shall, throughout the service area for which
      the designation is received - 
          (A) offer the services that are supported by Federal
        universal service support mechanisms under section 254(c) of
        this title, either using its own facilities or a combination of
        its own facilities and resale of another carrier's services
        (including the services offered by another eligible
        telecommunications carrier); and
          (B) advertise the availability of such services and the
        charges therefor using media of general distribution.
      (2) Designation of eligible telecommunications carriers
        A State commission shall upon its own motion or upon request
      designate a common carrier that meets the requirements of
      paragraph (1) as an eligible telecommunications carrier for a
      service area designated by the State commission. Upon request and
      consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity,
      the State commission may, in the case of an area served by a
      rural telephone company, and shall, in the case of all other
      areas, designate more than one common carrier as an eligible
      telecommunications carrier for a service area designated by the
      State commission, so long as each additional requesting carrier
      meets the requirements of paragraph (1). Before designating an
      additional eligible telecommunications carrier for an area served
      by a rural telephone company, the State commission shall find
      that the designation is in the public interest.
      (3) Designation of eligible telecommunications carriers for
        unserved areas
        If no common carrier will provide the services that are
      supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms under
      section 254(c) of this title to an unserved community or any
      portion thereof that requests such service, the Commission, with
      respect to interstate services or an area served by a common
      carrier to which paragraph (6) applies, or a State commission,
      with respect to intrastate services, shall determine which common
      carrier or carriers are best able to provide such service to the
      requesting unserved community or portion thereof and shall order
      such carrier or carriers to provide such service for that
      unserved community or portion thereof. Any carrier or carriers
      ordered to provide such service under this paragraph shall meet
      the requirements of paragraph (1) and shall be designated as an
      eligible telecommunications carrier for that community or portion
      thereof.
      (4) Relinquishment of universal service
        A State commission (or the Commission in the case of a common
      carrier designated under paragraph (6)) shall permit an eligible
      telecommunications carrier to relinquish its designation as such
      a carrier in any area served by more than one eligible
      telecommunications carrier. An eligible telecommunications
      carrier that seeks to relinquish its eligible telecommunications
      carrier designation for an area served by more than one eligible
      telecommunications carrier shall give advance notice to the State
      commission (or the Commission in the case of a common carrier
      designated under paragraph (6)) of such relinquishment. Prior to
      permitting a telecommunications carrier designated as an eligible
      telecommunications carrier to cease providing universal service
      in an area served by more than one eligible telecommunications
      carrier, the State commission (or the Commission in the case of a
      common carrier designated under paragraph (6)) shall require the
      remaining eligible telecommunications carrier or carriers to
      ensure that all customers served by the relinquishing carrier
      will continue to be served, and shall require sufficient notice
      to permit the purchase or construction of adequate facilities by
      any remaining eligible telecommunications carrier. The State
      commission (or the Commission in the case of a common carrier
      designated under paragraph (6)) shall establish a time, not to
      exceed one year after the State commission (or the Commission in
      the case of a common carrier designated under paragraph (6))
      approves such relinquishment under this paragraph, within which
      such purchase or construction shall be completed.
      (5) "Service area" defined
        The term "service area" means a geographic area established by
      a State commission (or the Commission under paragraph (6)) for
      the purpose of determining universal service obligations and
      support mechanisms. In the case of an area served by a rural
      telephone company, "service area" means such company's "study
      area" unless and until the Commission and the States, after
      taking into account recommendations of a Federal-State Joint
      Board instituted under section 410(c) of this title, establish a
      different definition of service area for such company.
      (6) Common carriers not subject to State commission jurisdiction
        In the case of a common carrier providing telephone exchange
      service and exchange access that is not subject to the
      jurisdiction of a State commission, the Commission shall upon
      request designate such a common carrier that meets the
      requirements of paragraph (1) as an eligible telecommunications
      carrier for a service area designated by the Commission
      consistent with applicable Federal and State law. Upon request
      and consistent with the public interest, convenience and
      necessity, the Commission may, with respect to an area served by
      a rural telephone company, and shall, in the case of all other
      areas, designate more than one common carrier as an eligible
      telecommunications carrier for a service area designated under
      this paragraph, so long as each additional requesting carrier
      meets the requirements of paragraph (1). Before designating an
      additional eligible telecommunications carrier for an area served
      by a rural telephone company, the Commission shall find that the
      designation is in the public interest.

      The Commission shall examine into transactions entered into by
    any common carrier which relate to the furnishing of equipment,
    supplies, research, services, finances, credit, or personnel to
    such carrier and/or which may affect the charges made or to be made
    and/or the services rendered or to be rendered by such carrier, in
    wire or radio communication subject to this chapter, and shall
    report to the Congress whether any such transactions have affected
    or are likely to affect adversely the ability of the carrier to
    render adequate service to the public, or may result in any undue
    or unreasonable increase in charges or in the maintenance of undue
    or unreasonable charges for such service; and in order to fully
    examine into such transactions the Commission shall have access to
    and the right of inspection and examination of all accounts,
    records, and memoranda, including all documents, papers, and
    correspondence now or hereafter existing, of persons furnishing
    such equipment, supplies, research, services, finances, credit, or
    personnel. The Commission shall include in its report its
    recommendations for necessary legislation in connection with such
    transactions, and shall report specifically whether in its opinion
    legislation should be enacted (1) authorizing the Commission to
    declare any such transactions void or to permit such transactions
    to be carried out subject to such modification of their terms and
    conditions as the Commission shall deem desirable in the public
    interest; and/or (2) subjecting such transactions to the approval
    of the Commission where the person furnishing or seeking to furnish
    the equipment, supplies, research, services, finances, credit, or
    personnel is a person directly or indirectly controlling or
    controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with,
    such carrier; and/or (3) authorizing the Commission to require that

    (b) Wire telephone and telegraph services
      The Commission shall investigate the methods by which and the
    extent to which wire telephone companies are furnishing wire
    telegraph service and wire telegraph companies are furnishing wire
    telephone service, and shall report its findings to Congress,
    together with its recommendations as to whether additional
    legislation on this subject is desirable.
    (c) Exclusive dealing contracts
      The Commission shall examine all contracts of common carriers
    subject to this chapter which prevent the other party thereto from
    dealing with another common carrier subject to this chapter, and
    shall report its findings to Congress, together with its
    recommendations as to whether additional legislation on this
    subject is desirable.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 219. Reports by carriers; contents and requirements generally

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Commission is authorized to require annual reports from
    all carriers subject to this chapter, and from persons directly or
    indirectly controlling or controlled by, or under direct or
    indirect common control with any such carrier, to prescribe the
    manner in which such reports shall be made, and to require from
    such persons specific answers to all questions upon which the
    Commission may need information. Except as otherwise required by
    the Commission, such annual reports shall show in detail the amount
    of capital stock issued, the amount and privileges of each class of
    stock, the amounts paid therefor, and the manner of payment for the
    same; the dividends paid and the surplus fund, if any; the number
    of stockholders (and the names of the thirty largest holders of
    each class of stock and the amount held by each); the funded and
    floating debts and the interest paid thereon; the cost and value of
    the carrier's property, franchises, and equipment; the number of
    employees and the salaries paid each class; the names of all
    officers and directors, and the amount of salary, bonus, and all
    other compensation paid to each; the amounts expended for
    improvements each year, how expended, and the character of such
    improvements; the earnings and receipts from each branch of
    business and from all sources; the operating and other expenses;
    the balances of profit and loss; and a complete exhibit of the
    financial operations of the carrier each year, including an annual
    balance sheet. Such reports shall also contain such information in
    relation to charges or regulations concerning charges, or
    agreements, arrangements, or contracts affecting the same, as the
    Commission may require.
      (b) Such reports shall be for such twelve months' period as the
    Commission shall designate and shall be filed with the Commission
    at its office in Washington within three months after the close of
    the year for which the report is made, unless additional time is
    granted in any case by the Commission; and if any person subject to
    the provisions of this section shall fail to make and file said
    annual reports within the time above specified, or within the time
    extended by the Commission, for making and filing the same, or
    shall fail to make specific answer to any question authorized by
    the provisions of this section within thirty days from the time it
    is lawfully required so to do, such person shall forfeit to the
    United States the sum of $1,200 for each and every day it shall
    continue to be in default with respect thereto. The Commission may
    by general or special orders require any such carriers to file
    monthly reports of earnings and expenses and to file periodical
    and/or special reports concerning any matters with respect to which
    the Commission is authorized or required by law to act. If any such
    carrier shall fail to make and file any such periodical or special
    report within the time fixed by the Commission, it shall be subject
    to the forfeitures above provided.

    SUBCHAPTER II - COMMON CARRIERS
    Part I - Common Carrier Regulation

-HEAD-
    Sec. 220. Accounts, records, and memoranda

-STATUTE-
    (a) Forms
      (1) The Commission may, in its discretion, prescribe the forms of
    any and all accounts, records, and memoranda to be kept by carriers
    subject to this chapter, including the accounts, records, and
    memoranda of the movement of traffic, as well as of the receipts
    and expenditures of moneys.
      (2) The Commission shall, by rule, prescribe a uniform system of
    accounts for use by telephone companies. Such uniform system shall
    require that each common carrier shall maintain a system of
    accounting methods, procedures, and techniques (including accounts
    and supporting records and memoranda) which shall ensure a proper
    allocation of all costs to and among telecommunications services,
    facilities, and products (and to and among classes of such
    services, facilities, and products) which are developed,
    manufactured, or offered by such common carrier.
    (b) Depreciation charges
      The Commission may prescribe, for such carriers as it determines
    to be appropriate, the classes of property for which depreciation
    charges may be properly included under operating expenses, and the
    percentages of depreciation which shall be charged with respect to
    each of such classes of property, classifying the carriers as it
    may deem proper for this purpose. The Commission may, when it deems
    necessary, modify the classes and percentages so prescribed. Such
    carriers shall not, after the Commission has prescribed the classes
    of property for which depreciation charges may be included, charge
    to operating expenses any depreciation charges on classes of
    property other than those prescribed by the Commission, or after
    the Commission has prescribed percentages of depreciation, charge
    with respect to any class of property a percentage of depreciation
    other than that prescribed therefor by the Commission. No such
    carrier shall in any case include in any form under its operating
    or other expenses any depreciation or other charge or expenditure
    included elsewhere as a depreciation charge or otherwise under its
    operating or other expenses.
    (c) Access to information; burden of proof; use of independent
      auditors
      The Commission shall at all times have access to and the right of
    inspection and examination of all accounts, records, and memoranda,
    including all documents, papers, and correspondence now or
    hereafter existing, and kept or required to be kept by such
    carriers, and the provisions of this section respecting the
    preservation and destruction of books, papers, and documents shall
    apply thereto. The burden of proof to justify every accounting
    entry questioned by the Commission shall be on the person making,
    authorizing, or requiring such entry and the Commission may suspend
    a charge or credit pending submission of proof by such person. Any
    provision of law prohibiting the disclosure of the contents of
    messages or communications shall not be deemed to prohibit the
    disclosure of any matter in accordance with the provisions of this
    section. The Commission may obtain the services of any person
    licensed to provide public accounting services under the law of any
    State to assist with, or conduct, audits under this section. While
    so employed or engaged in conducting an audit for the Commission
    under this section, any such person shall have the powers granted
    the Commission under this subsection and shall be subject to
    subsection (f) of this section in the same manner as if that person
    were an employee of the Commission.
    (d) Penalty for failure to comply
      In case of failure or refusal on the part of any such carrier to
    keep such accounts, records, and memoranda on the books and in the
    manner prescribed by the Commission, or to submit such accounts,
    records, memoranda, documents, papers, and correspondence as are
    kept to the inspection of the Commission or any of its authorized
    agents, such carrier shall forfeit to the United States the sum of
    $6,000 for each day of the continuance of each such offense.
    (e) False entry; destruction; penalty
      Any person who shall willfully make any false entry in the
    accounts of any book of accounts or in any record or memoranda kept
    by any such carrier, or who shall willfully destroy, mutilate,
    alter, or by any other means or device falsify any such account,
    record, or memoranda, or who shall willfully neglect or fail to
    make full, true, and correct entries in such accounts, records, or
    memoranda of all facts and transactions appertaining to the
    business of the carrier, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,
    and shall be subject, upon conviction, to a fine of not less than
    $1,000 nor more than $5,000 or imprisonment for a term of not less
    than one year nor more than three years, or both such fine and
    imprisonment: Provided, That the Commission may in its discretion
    issue orders specifying such operating, accounting, or financial
    papers, records, books, blanks, or documents which may, after a
    reasonable time, be destroyed, and prescribing the length of time
    such books, papers, or documents shall be preserved.
    (f) Confidentiality of information
      No member, officer, or employee of the Commission shall divulge
    any fact or information which may come to his knowledge during the
    course of examination of books or other accounts, as hereinbefore
    provided, except insofar as he may be directed by the Commission or
    by a court.
    (g) Use of other forms; alterations in prescribed forms
      After the Commission has prescribed the forms and manner of
    keeping of accounts, records, and memoranda to be kept by any
    person as herein provided, it shall be unlawful for such person to
    keep any other accounts, records, or memoranda than those so
    prescribed or such as may be approved by the Commission or to keep
    the accounts in any other manner than that prescribed or approved
    by the Commission. Notice of alterations by the Commission in the
    required manner or form of keeping accounts shall be given to such
    persons by the Commission at least six months before the same are
    to take effect.
    (h) Exemption; regulation by State commission
      The Commission may classify carriers subject to this chapter and
    prescribe different requirements under this section for different
    classes of carriers, and may, if it deems such action consistent
    with the public interest, except the carriers of any particular
    class or classes in any State from any of the requirements under
    this section in cases where such carriers are subject to State
    commission regulation with respect to matters to which this section
    relates.
    (i) Consultation with State commissions
      The Commission, before prescribing any requirements as to
    accounts, records, or memoranda, shall notify each State commission
    having jurisdiction with respect to any carrier involved, and shall
    give reasonable opportunity to each such commission to present its
    views, and shall receive and consider such views and
    recommendations.
    (j) Report to Congress on need for further legislation
      The Commission shall investigate and report to Congress as to the
    need for legislation to define further or harmonize the powers of
    the Commission and of State commissions with respect to matters to
    which this section relates.

    Sec. 222. Privacy of customer information

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      Every telecommunications carrier has a duty to protect the
    confidentiality of proprietary information of, and relating to,
    other telecommunication carriers, equipment manufacturers, and
    customers, including telecommunication carriers reselling
    telecommunications services provided by a telecommunications
    carrier.
    (b) Confidentiality of carrier information
      A telecommunications carrier that receives or obtains proprietary
    information from another carrier for purposes of providing any
    telecommunications service shall use such information only for such
    purpose, and shall not use such information for its own marketing
    efforts.
    (c) Confidentiality of customer proprietary network information
      (1) Privacy requirements for telecommunications carriers
        Except as required by law or with the approval of the customer,
      a telecommunications carrier that receives or obtains customer
      proprietary network information by virtue of its provision of a
      telecommunications service shall only use, disclose, or permit
      access to individually identifiable customer proprietary network
      information in its provision of (A) the telecommunications
      service from which such information is derived, or (B) services
      necessary to, or used in, the provision of such
      telecommunications service, including the publishing of
      directories.
      (2) Disclosure on request by customers

      proprietary network information, upon affirmative written request

      (3) Aggregate customer information
        A telecommunications carrier that receives or obtains customer
      proprietary network information by virtue of its provision of a
      telecommunications service may use, disclose, or permit access to
      aggregate customer information other than for the purposes
      described in paragraph (1). A local exchange carrier may use,
      disclose, or permit access to aggregate customer information
      other than for purposes described in paragraph (1) only if it
      provides such aggregate information to other carriers or persons
      on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms and conditions upon
      reasonable request therefor.
    (d) Exceptions
      Nothing in this section prohibits a telecommunications carrier
    from using, disclosing, or permitting access to customer
    proprietary network information obtained from its customers, either
    directly or indirectly through its agents - 
        (1) to initiate, render, bill, and collect for
      telecommunications services;
        (2) to protect the rights or property of the carrier, or to
      protect users of those services and other carriers from
      fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to, such
      services;
        (3) to provide any inbound telemarketing, referral, or
      administrative services to the customer for the duration of the
      call, if such call was initiated by the customer and the customer
      approves of the use of such information to provide such service;
      and
        (4) to provide call location information concerning the user of
      a commercial mobile service (as such term is defined in section
      332(d) of this title) or the user of an IP-enabled voice service
      (as such term is defined in section 615b of this title) -

        emergency or trauma care facility, in order to respond to the
        user's call for emergency services;
          (B) to inform the user's legal guardian or members of the
        user's immediate family of the user's location in an emergency
        situation that involves the risk of death or serious physical
        harm; or

        emergency services in response to an emergency.

    telecommunications carrier that provides telephone exchange service

    as a provider of such service on a timely and unbundled basis,
    under nondiscriminatory and reasonable rates, terms, and
    conditions, to any person upon request for the purpose of
    publishing directories in any format.
    (f) Authority to use location information
      For purposes of subsection (c)(1) of this section, without the
    express prior authorization of the customer, a customer shall not
    be considered to have approved the use or disclosure of or access
    to - 
        (1) call location information concerning the user of a
      commercial mobile service (as such term is defined in section
      332(d) of this title) or the user of an IP-enabled voice service

    information pertaining to subscribers of other carriers) on a
    timely and unbundled basis, under nondiscriminatory and reasonable
    rates, terms, and conditions to providers of emergency services,
    and providers of emergency support services, solely for purposes of

    shall be fined in accordance with title 18 or imprisoned not more
    than two years, or both.
      (2) Whoever knowingly - 
        (A) within the United States, by means of telephone, makes

      to be used for an activity prohibited by subparagraph (A), shall
      be fined not more than $50,000 or imprisoned not more than six
      months, or both.

      (3) It is a defense to prosecution under paragraph (2) of this
    subsection that the defendant restricted access to the prohibited
    communication to persons 18 years of age or older in accordance
    with subsection (c) of this section and with such procedures as the
    Commission may prescribe by regulation.
      (4) In addition to the penalties under paragraph (1), whoever,
    within the United States, intentionally violates paragraph (1) or
    (2) shall be subject to a fine of not more than $50,000 for each

    violation shall constitute a separate violation.
      (B) A fine under this paragraph may be assessed either - 
        (i) by a court, pursuant to civil action by the Commission or
      any attorney employed by the Commission who is designated by the
      Commission for such purposes, or
        (ii) by the Commission after appropriate administrative
      proceedings.

    (c) Restriction on access to subscribers by common carriers;
      judicial remedies respecting restrictions
      (1) A common carrier within the District of Columbia or within
    any State, or in interstate or foreign commerce, shall not, to the
    extent technically feasible, provide access to a communication
    specified in subsection (b) of this section from the telephone of
    any subscriber who has not previously requested in writing the
    carrier to provide access to such communication if the carrier
    collects from subscribers an identifiable charge for such
    communication that the carrier remits, in whole or in part, to the
    provider of such communication.
      (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), no cause of action may
    be brought in any court or administrative agency against any common
    carrier, or any of its affiliates, including their officers,
    directors, employees, agents, or authorized representatives on
    account of - 
        (A) any action which the carrier demonstrates was taken in good
      faith to restrict access pursuant to paragraph (1) of this
      subsection; or
        (B) any access permitted - 
          (i) in good faith reliance upon the lack of any
        representation by a provider of communications that
        communications provided by that provider are communications
        specified in subsection (b) of this section, or
          (ii) because a specific representation by the provider did
        not allow the carrier, acting in good faith, a sufficient
        period to restrict access to restrict access to communications
        described in subsection (b) of this section.

      (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, a provider
    of communications services to which subscribers are denied access
    pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection may bring an action
    for a declaratory judgment or similar action in a court. Any such
    action shall be limited to the question of whether the
    communications which the provider seeks to provide fall within the
    category of communications to which the carrier will provide access
    only to subscribers who have previously requested such access.
    (d) Sending or displaying offensive material to persons under 18
      Whoever - 
        (1) in interstate or foreign communications knowingly - 
          (A) uses an interactive computer service to send to a
        specific person or persons under 18 years of age, or
          (B) uses any interactive computer service to display in a
        manner available to a person under 18 years of age,

      any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other
      communication that is obscene or child pornography, regardless of
      whether the user of such service placed the call or initiated the
      communication; or
        (2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility under
      such person's control to be used for an activity prohibited by
      paragraph (1) with the intent that it be used for such activity,

    shall be fined under title 18 or imprisoned not more than two
    years, or both.
    (e) Defenses
      In addition to any other defenses available by law:
        (1) No person shall be held to have violated subsection (a) or
      (d) of this section solely for providing access or connection to
      or from a facility, system, or network not under that person's
      control, including transmission, downloading, intermediate
      storage, access software, or other related capabilities that are
      incidental to providing such access or connection that does not
      include the creation of the content of the communication.
        (2) The defenses provided by paragraph (1) of this subsection
      shall not be applicable to a person who is a conspirator with an
      entity actively involved in the creation or knowing distribution
      of communications that violate this section, or who knowingly
      advertises the availability of such communications.
        (3) The defenses provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection
      shall not be applicable to a person who provides access or
      connection to a facility, system, or network engaged in the
      violation of this section that is owned or controlled by such
      person.
        (4) No employer shall be held liable under this section for the
      actions of an employee or agent unless the employee's or agent's
      conduct is within the scope of his or her employment or agency
      and the employer (A) having knowledge of such conduct, authorizes
      or ratifies such conduct, or (B) recklessly disregards such
      conduct.
        (5) It is a defense to a prosecution under subsection (a)(1)(B)
      or (d) of this section, or under subsection (a)(2) of this
      section with respect to the use of a facility for an activity
      under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section that a person - 
          (A) has taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective, and
        appropriate actions under the circumstances to restrict or
        prevent access by minors to a communication specified in such
        subsections, which may involve any appropriate measures to
        restrict minors from such communications, including any method
        which is feasible under available technology; or
          (B) has restricted access to such communication by requiring
        use of a verified credit card, debit account, adult access
        code, or adult personal identification number.

        (6) The Commission may describe measures which are reasonable,
      effective, and appropriate to restrict access to prohibited
      communications under subsection (d) of this section. Nothing in
      this section authorizes the Commission to enforce, or is intended
      to provide the Commission with the authority to approve,
      sanction, or permit, the use of such measures. The Commission
      shall have no enforcement authority over the failure to utilize
      such measures. The Commission shall not endorse specific products
      relating to such measures. The use of such measures shall be
      admitted as evidence of good faith efforts for purposes of
      paragraph (5) in any action arising under subsection (d) of this
      section. Nothing in this section shall be construed to treat
      interactive computer services as common carriers or
      telecommunications carriers.
    (f) Violations of law required; commercial entities, nonprofit
      libraries, or institutions of higher education
      (1) No cause of action may be brought in any court or
    administrative agency against any person on account of any activity
    that is not in violation of any law punishable by criminal or civil
    penalty, and that the person has taken in good faith to implement a
    defense authorized under this section or otherwise to restrict or
    prevent the transmission of, or access to, a communication
    specified in this section.
      (2) No State or local government may impose any liability for
    commercial activities or actions by commercial entities, nonprofit
    libraries, or institutions of higher education in connection with
    an activity or action described in subsection (a)(2) or (d) of this
    section that is inconsistent with the treatment of those activities
    or actions under this section: Provided, however, That nothing
    herein shall preclude any State or local government from enacting
    and enforcing complementary oversight, liability, and regulatory
    systems, procedures, and requirements, so long as such systems,
    procedures, and requirements govern only intrastate services and do
    not result in the imposition of inconsistent rights, duties or
    obligations on the provision of interstate services. Nothing in
    this subsection shall preclude any State or local government from
    governing conduct not covered by this section.
    (g) Application and enforcement of other Federal law
      Nothing in subsection (a), (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in
    the defenses to prosecution under subsection (a) or (d) of this
    section shall be construed to affect or limit the application or
    enforcement of any other Federal law.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 224. Pole attachments

-STATUTE-
    (a) Definitions
      As used in this section:
      (1) The term "utility" means any person who is a local exchange
    carrier or an electric, gas, water, steam, or other public utility,
    and who owns or controls poles, ducts, conduits, or rights-of-way
    used, in whole or in part, for any wire communications. Such term
    does not include any railroad, any person who is cooperatively
    organized, or any person owned by the Federal Government or any
    State.
      (2) The term "Federal Government" means the Government of the
    United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof.
      (3) The term "State" means any State, territory, or possession of
    the United States, the District of Columbia, or any political
    subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof.
      (4) The term "pole attachment" means any attachment by a cable
    television system or provider of telecommunications service to a
    pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way owned or controlled by a
    utility.
      (5) For purposes of this section, the term "telecommunications
    carrier" (as defined in section 153 of this title) does not include
    any incumbent local exchange carrier as defined in section 251(h)
    of this title.
    (b) Authority of Commission to regulate rates, terms, and
      conditions; enforcement powers; promulgation of regulations
      (1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section,
    the Commission shall regulate the rates, terms, and conditions for
    pole attachments to provide that such rates, terms, and conditions
    are just and reasonable, and shall adopt procedures necessary and
    appropriate to hear and resolve complaints concerning such rates,
    terms, and conditions. For purposes of enforcing any determinations
    resulting from complaint procedures established pursuant to this
    subsection, the Commission shall take such action as it deems
    appropriate and necessary, including issuing cease and desist
    orders, as authorized by section 312(b) of this title.
      (2) The Commission shall prescribe by rule regulations to carry
    out the provisions of this section.
    (c) State regulatory authority over rates, terms, and conditions;
      preemption; certification; circumstances constituting State
      regulation
      (1) Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to, or to
    give the Commission jurisdiction with respect to rates, terms, and
    conditions, or access to poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way
    as provided in subsection (f) of this section, for pole attachments
    in any case where such matters are regulated by a State.
      (2) Each State which regulates the rates, terms, and conditions
    for pole attachments shall certify to the Commission that - 
        (A) it regulates such rates, terms, and conditions; and
        (B) in so regulating such rates, terms, and conditions, the
      State has the authority to consider and does consider the
      interests of the subscribers of the services offered via such
      attachments, as well as the interests of the consumers of the
      utility services.

      (3) For purposes of this subsection, a State shall not be
    considered to regulate the rates, terms, and conditions for pole
    attachments - 
        (A) unless the State has issued and made effective rules and
      regulations implementing the State's regulatory authority over
      pole attachments; and
        (B) with respect to any individual matter, unless the State
      takes final action on a complaint regarding such matter - 
          (i) within 180 days after the complaint is filed with the
        State, or
          (ii) within the applicable period prescribed for such final
        action in such rules and regulations of the State, if the
        prescribed period does not extend beyond 360 days after the
        filing of such complaint.
    (d) Determination of just and reasonable rates; "usable space"
      defined
      (1) For purposes of subsection (b) of this section, a rate is
    just and reasonable if it assures a utility the recovery of not
    less than the additional costs of providing pole attachments, nor
    more than an amount determined by multiplying the percentage of the
    total usable space, or the percentage of the total duct or conduit
    capacity, which is occupied by the pole attachment by the sum of
    the operating expenses and actual capital costs of the utility
    attributable to the entire pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way.
      (2) As used in this subsection, the term "usable space" means the
    space above the minimum grade level which can be used for the
    attachment of wires, cables, and associated equipment.
      (3) This subsection shall apply to the rate for any pole
    attachment used by a cable television system solely to provide
    cable service. Until the effective date of the regulations required
    under subsection (e) of this section, this subsection shall also
    apply to the rate for any pole attachment used by a cable system or
    any telecommunications carrier (to the extent such carrier is not a
    party to a pole attachment agreement) to provide any
    telecommunications service.
    (e) Regulations governing charges; apportionment of costs of
      providing space
      (1) The Commission shall, no later than 2 years after February 8,
    1996, prescribe regulations in accordance with this subsection to
    govern the charges for pole attachments used by telecommunications
    carriers to provide telecommunications services, when the parties
    fail to resolve a dispute over such charges. Such regulations shall
    ensure that a utility charges just, reasonable, and
    nondiscriminatory rates for pole attachments.
      (2) A utility shall apportion the cost of providing space on a
    pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way other than the usable space
    among entities so that such apportionment equals two-thirds of the
    costs of providing space other than the usable space that would be
    allocated to such entity under an equal apportionment of such costs
    among all attaching entities.
      (3) A utility shall apportion the cost of providing usable space
    among all entities according to the percentage of usable space
    required for each entity.
      (4) The regulations required under paragraph (1) shall become
    effective 5 years after February 8, 1996. Any increase in the rates
    for pole attachments that result from the adoption of the
    regulations required by this subsection shall be phased in equal
    annual increments over a period of 5 years beginning on the
    effective date of such regulations.
    (f) Nondiscriminatory access
      (1) A utility shall provide a cable television system or any
    telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to any
    pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way owned or controlled by it.
      (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a utility providing electric
    service may deny a cable television system or any
    telecommunications carrier access to its poles, ducts, conduits, or
    rights-of-way, on a non-discriminatory (!1) basis where there is
    insufficient capacity and for reasons of safety, reliability and
    generally applicable engineering purposes.

    (g) Imputation to costs of pole attachment rate
      A utility that engages in the provision of telecommunications
    services or cable services shall impute to its costs of providing
    such services (and charge any affiliate, subsidiary, or associate
    company engaged in the provision of such services) an equal amount
    to the pole attachment rate for which such company would be liable
    under this section.
    (h) Modification or alteration of pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-
      way
      Whenever the owner of a pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way
    intends to modify or alter such pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-
    way, the owner shall provide written notification of such action
    to any entity that has obtained an attachment to such conduit or
    right-of-way so that such entity may have a reasonable opportunity
    to add to or modify its existing attachment. Any entity that adds
    to or modifies its existing attachment after receiving such
    notification shall bear a proportionate share of the costs incurred
    by the owner in making such pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way
    accessible.
    (i) Costs of rearranging or replacing attachment
      An entity that obtains an attachment to a pole, conduit, or right-
    of-way shall not be required to bear any of the costs of
    rearranging or replacing its attachment, if such rearrangement or
    replacement is required as a result of an additional attachment or
    the modification of an existing attachment sought by any other
    entity (including the owner of such pole, duct, conduit, or right-
    of-way).

-HEAD-
    Sec. 225. Telecommunications services for hearing-impaired and
      speech-impaired individuals

-STATUTE-
    (a) Definitions
      As used in this section - 
      (1) Common carrier or carrier
        The term "common carrier" or "carrier" includes any common
      carrier engaged in interstate communication by wire or radio as
      defined in section 153 of this title and any common carrier
      engaged in intrastate communication by wire or radio,
      notwithstanding sections 152(b) and 221(b) of this title.
      (2) TDD
        The term "TDD" means a Telecommunications Device for the Deaf,
      which is a machine that employs graphic communication in the
      transmission of coded signals through a wire or radio
      communication system.
      (3) Telecommunications relay services
        The term "telecommunications relay services" means telephone
      transmission services that provide the ability for an individual
      who has a hearing impairment or speech impairment to engage in
      communication by wire or radio with a hearing individual in a
      manner that is functionally equivalent to the ability of an
      individual who does not have a hearing impairment or speech
      impairment to communicate using voice communication services by
      wire or radio. Such term includes services that enable two-way
      communication between an individual who uses a TDD or other
      nonvoice terminal device and an individual who does not use such
      a device.
    (b) Availability of telecommunications relay services
      (1) In general
        In order to carry out the purposes established under section
      151 of this title, to make available to all individuals in the
      United States a rapid, efficient nationwide communication
      service, and to increase the utility of the telephone system of
      the Nation, the Commission shall ensure that interstate and
      intrastate telecommunications relay services are available, to
      the extent possible and in the most efficient manner, to hearing-
      impaired and speech-impaired individuals in the United States.
      (2) Use of general authority and remedies
        For the purposes of administering and enforcing the provisions
      of this section and the regulations prescribed thereunder, the
      Commission shall have the same authority, power, and functions
      with respect to common carriers engaged in intrastate
      communication as the Commission has in administering and
      enforcing the provisions of this subchapter with respect to any
      common carrier engaged in interstate communication. Any violation
      of this section by any common carrier engaged in intrastate
      communication shall be subject to the same remedies, penalties,
      and procedures as are applicable to a violation of this chapter
      by a common carrier engaged in interstate communication.
    (c) Provision of services
      Each common carrier providing telephone voice transmission
    services shall, not later than 3 years after July 26, 1990, provide
    in compliance with the regulations prescribed under this section,
    throughout the area in which it offers service, telecommunications
    relay services, individually, through designees, through a
    competitively selected vendor, or in concert with other carriers. A
    common carrier shall be considered to be in compliance with such
    regulations - 
        (1) with respect to intrastate telecommunications relay
      services in any State that does not have a certified program
      under subsection (f) of this section and with respect to
      interstate telecommunications relay services, if such common
      carrier (or other entity through which the carrier is providing
      such relay services) is in compliance with the Commission's
      regulations under subsection (d) of this section; or
        (2) with respect to intrastate telecommunications relay
      services in any State that has a certified program under
      subsection (f) of this section for such State, if such common
      carrier (or other entity through which the carrier is providing
      such relay services) is in compliance with the program certified
      under subsection (f) of this section for such State.
    (d) Regulations
      (1) In general
        The Commission shall, not later than 1 year after July 26,
      1990, prescribe regulations to implement this section, including
      regulations that - 
          (A) establish functional requirements, guidelines, and
        operations procedures for telecommunications relay services;
          (B) establish minimum standards that shall be met in carrying
        out subsection (c) of this section;
          (C) require that telecommunications relay services operate
        every day for 24 hours per day;
          (D) require that users of telecommunications relay services
        pay rates no greater than the rates paid for functionally
        equivalent voice communication services with respect to such
        factors as the duration of the call, the time of day, and the
        distance from point of origination to point of termination;
          (E) prohibit relay operators from failing to fulfill the
        obligations of common carriers by refusing calls or limiting
        the length of calls that use telecommunications relay services;
          (F) prohibit relay operators from disclosing the content of
        any relayed conversation and from keeping records of the
        content of any such conversation beyond the duration of the
        call; and
          (G) prohibit relay operators from intentionally altering a
        relayed conversation.
      (2) Technology
        The Commission shall ensure that regulations prescribed to
      implement this section encourage, consistent with section 157(a)
      of this title, the use of existing technology and do not
      discourage or impair the development of improved technology.
      (3) Jurisdictional separation of costs
        (A) In general
          Consistent with the provisions of section 410 of this title,
        the Commission shall prescribe regulations governing the
        jurisdictional separation of costs for the services provided
        pursuant to this section.
        (B) Recovering costs
          Such regulations shall generally provide that costs caused by
        interstate telecommunications relay services shall be recovered
        from all subscribers for every interstate service and costs
        caused by intrastate telecommunications relay services shall be
        recovered from the intrastate jurisdiction. In a State that has
        a certified program under subsection (f) of this section, a
        State commission shall permit a common carrier to recover the
        costs incurred in providing intrastate telecommunications relay
        services by a method consistent with the requirements of this
        section.
    (e) Enforcement
      (1) In general
        Subject to subsections (f) and (g) of this section, the
      Commission shall enforce this section.
      (2) Complaint
        The Commission shall resolve, by final order, a complaint
      alleging a violation of this section within 180 days after the
      date such complaint is filed.
    (f) Certification
      (1) State documentation
        Any State desiring to establish a State program under this
      section shall submit documentation to the Commission that
      describes the program of such State for implementing intrastate
      telecommunications relay services and the procedures and remedies
      available for enforcing any requirements imposed by the State
      program.
      (2) Requirements for certification
        After review of such documentation, the Commission shall
      certify the State program if the Commission determines that - 
          (A) the program makes available to hearing-impaired and
        speech-impaired individuals, either directly, through
        designees, through a competitively selected vendor, or through
        regulation of intrastate common carriers, intrastate
        telecommunications relay services in such State in a manner
        that meets or exceeds the requirements of regulations
        prescribed by the Commission under subsection (d) of this
        section; and
          (B) the program makes available adequate procedures and
        remedies for enforcing the requirements of the State program.
      (3) Method of funding
        Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the
      Commission shall not refuse to certify a State program based
      solely on the method such State will implement for funding
      intrastate telecommunication relay services.
      (4) Suspension or revocation of certification
        The Commission may suspend or revoke such certification if,
      after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission
      determines that such certification is no longer warranted. In a
      State whose program has been suspended or revoked, the Commission
      shall take such steps as may be necessary, consistent with this
      section, to ensure continuity of telecommunications relay
      services.
    (g) Complaint
      (1) Referral of complaint
        If a complaint to the Commission alleges a violation of this
      section with respect to intrastate telecommunications relay
      services within a State and certification of the program of such
      State under subsection (f) of this section is in effect, the
      Commission shall refer such complaint to such State.
      (2) Jurisdiction of Commission
        After referring a complaint to a State under paragraph (1), the
      Commission shall exercise jurisdiction over such complaint only
      if - 
          (A) final action under such State program has not been taken
        on such complaint by such State - 
            (i) within 180 days after the complaint is filed with such
          State; or
            (ii) within a shorter period as prescribed by the
          regulations of such State; or

          (B) the Commission determines that such State program is no
        longer qualified for certification under subsection (f) of this
        section.

    Sec. 226. Telephone operator services

-STATUTE-
    (a) Definitions
      As used in this section - 
        (1) The term "access code" means a sequence of numbers that,
      when dialed, connect the caller to the provider of operator
      services associated with that sequence.
        (2) The term "aggregator" means any person that, in the
      ordinary course of its operations, makes telephones available to
      the public or to transient users of its premises, for interstate
      telephone calls using a provider of operator services.
        (3) The term "call splashing" means the transfer of a telephone
      call from one provider of operator services to another such
      provider in such a manner that the subsequent provider is unable
      or unwilling to determine the location of the origination of the
      call and, because of such inability or unwillingness, is
      prevented from billing the call on the basis of such location.
        (4) The term "consumer" means a person initiating any
      interstate telephone call using operator services.
        (5) The term "equal access" has the meaning given that term in
      Appendix B of the Modification of Final Judgment entered August
      24, 1982, in United States v. Western Electric, Civil Action No.
      82-0192 (United States District Court, District of Columbia), as
      amended by the Court in its orders issued prior to October 17,
      1990.
        (6) The term "equal access code" means an access code that
      allows the public to obtain an equal access connection to the
      carrier associated with that code.
        (7) The term "operator services" means any interstate
      telecommunications service initiated from an aggregator location
      that includes, as a component, any automatic or live assistance
      to a consumer to arrange for billing or completion, or both, of
      an interstate telephone call through a method other than - 
          (A) automatic completion with billing to the telephone from
        which the call originated; or
          (B) completion through an access code used by the consumer,
        with billing to an account previously established with the
        carrier by the consumer.

        (8) The term "presubscribed provider of operator services"
      means the interstate provider of operator services to which the
      consumer is connected when the consumer places a call using a
      provider of operator services without dialing an access code.
        (9) The term "provider of operator services" means any common
      carrier that provides operator services or any other person
      determined by the Commission to be providing operator services.
    (b) Requirements for providers of operator services
      (1) In general
        Beginning not later than 90 days after October 17, 1990, each
      provider of operator services shall, at a minimum - 
          (A) identify itself, audibly and distinctly, to the consumer
        at the beginning of each telephone call and before the consumer
        incurs any charge for the call;
          (B) permit the consumer to terminate the telephone call at no
        charge before the call is connected;
          (C) disclose immediately to the consumer, upon request and at
        no charge to the consumer - 
            (i) a quote of its rates or charges for the call;
            (ii) the methods by which such rates or charges will be
          collected; and
            (iii) the methods by which complaints concerning such
          rates, charges, or collection practices will be resolved;

          (D) ensure, by contract or tariff, that each aggregator for
        which such provider is the presubscribed provider of operator
        services is in compliance with the requirements of subsection
        (c) of this section and, if applicable, subsection (e)(1) of
        this section;
          (E) withhold payment (on a location-by-location basis) of any
        compensation, including commissions, to aggregators if such
        provider reasonably believes that the aggregator (i) is
        blocking access by means of "950" or "800" numbers to
        interstate common carriers in violation of subsection (c)(1)(B)
        of this section or (ii) is blocking access to equal access
        codes in violation of rules the Commission may prescribe under
        subsection (e)(1) of this section;
          (F) not bill for unanswered telephone calls in areas where
        equal access is available;
          (G) not knowingly bill for unanswered telephone calls where
        equal access is not available;
          (H) not engage in call splashing, unless the consumer
        requests to be transferred to another provider of operator
        services, the consumer is informed prior to incurring any
        charges that the rates for the call may not reflect the rates
        from the actual originating location of the call, and the
        consumer then consents to be transferred; and
          (I) except as provided in subparagraph (H), not bill for a
        call that does not reflect the location of the origination of
        the call.
      (2) Additional requirements for first 3 years
        In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (1),
      during the 3-year period beginning on the date that is 90 days
      after October 17, 1990, each presubscribed provider of operator
      services shall identify itself audibly and distinctly to the
      consumer, not only as required in paragraph (1)(A), but also for
      a second time before connecting the call and before the consumer
      incurs any charge.
    (c) Requirements for aggregators
      (1) In general
        Each aggregator, beginning not later than 90 days after October
      17, 1990, shall - 
          (A) post on or near the telephone instrument, in plain view
        of consumers -

          the provider of operator services;
            (ii) a written disclosure that the rates for all operator-
          assisted calls are available on request, and that consumers
          have a right to obtain access to the interstate common
          carrier of their choice and may contact their preferred
          interstate common carriers for information on accessing that
          carrier's service using that telephone; and
            (iii) the name and address of the enforcement division of
          the Common Carrier Bureau of the Commission, to which the
          consumer may direct complaints regarding operator services;

          (B) ensure that each of its telephones presubscribed to a
        provider of operator services allows the consumer to use "800"
        and "950" access code numbers to obtain access to the provider
        of operator services desired by the consumer; and
          (C) ensure that no charge by the aggregator to the consumer
        for using an "800" or "950" access code number, or any other
        access code number, is greater than the amount the aggregator
        charges for calls placed using the presubscribed provider of
        operator services.
      (2) Effect of State law or regulation
        The requirements of paragraph (1)(A) shall not apply to an
      aggregator in any case in which State law or State regulation
      requires the aggregator to take actions that are substantially
      the same as those required in paragraph (1)(A).
    (d) General rulemaking required
      (1) Rulemaking proceeding
        The Commission shall conduct a rulemaking proceeding pursuant
      to this subchapter to prescribe regulations to - 
          (A) protect consumers from unfair and deceptive practices
        relating to their use of operator services to place interstate
        telephone calls; and
          (B) ensure that consumers have the opportunity to make
        informed choices in making such calls.
      (2) Contents of regulations
        The regulations prescribed under this section shall - 
          (A) contain provisions to implement each of the requirements
        of this section, other than the requirements established by the
        rulemaking under subsection (e) of this section on access and
        compensation; and
          (B) contain such other provisions as the Commission
        determines necessary to carry out this section and the purposes
        and policies of this section.
      (3) Additional requirements to be implemented by regulations
        The regulations prescribed under this section shall, at a
      minimum - 
          (A) establish minimum standards for providers of operator
        services and aggregators to use in the routing and handling of
        emergency telephone calls; and
          (B) establish a policy for requiring providers of operator
        services to make public information about recent changes in
        operator services and choices available to consumers in that
        market.
    (e) Separate rulemaking on access and compensation
      (1) Access
        The Commission,(!1) shall require - 

          (A) that each aggregator ensure within a reasonable time that
        each of its telephones presubscribed to a provider of operator
        services allows the consumer to obtain access to the provider
        of operator services desired by the consumer through the use of
        an equal access code; or
          (B) that all providers of operator services, within a
        reasonable time, make available to their customers a "950" or
        "800" access code number for use in making operator services
        calls from anywhere in the United States; or
          (C) that the requirements described under both subparagraphs
        (A) and (B) apply.
      (2) Compensation
        The Commission shall consider the need to prescribe
      compensation (other than advance payment by consumers) for owners
      of competitive public pay telephones for calls routed to
      providers of operator services that are other than the
      presubscribed provider of operator services for such telephones.
      Within 9 months after October 17, 1990, the Commission shall
      reach a final decision on whether to prescribe such compensation.
    (f) Technological capability of equipment
      Any equipment and software manufactured or imported more than 18
    months after October 17, 1990, and installed by any aggregator
    shall be technologically capable of providing consumers with access
    to interstate providers of operator services through the use of
    equal access codes.
    (g) Fraud
      In any proceeding to carry out the provisions of this section,
    the Commission shall require such actions or measures as are
    necessary to ensure that aggregators are not exposed to undue risk
    of fraud.
    (h) Determinations of rate compliance
      (1) Filing of informational tariff
        (A) In general
          Each provider of operator services shall file, within 90 days
        after October 17, 1990, and shall maintain, update regularly,
        and keep open for public inspection, an informational tariff
        specifying rates, terms, and conditions, and including
        commissions, surcharges, any fees which are collected from
        consumers, and reasonable estimates of the amount of traffic
        priced at each rate, with respect to calls for which operator
        services are provided. Any changes in such rates, terms, or
        conditions shall be filed no later than the first day on which
        the changed rates, terms, or conditions are in effect.
        (B) Waiver authority
          The Commission may, after 4 years following October 17, 1990,
        waive the requirements of this paragraph only if - 
            (i) the findings and conclusions of the Commission in the
          final report issued under paragraph (3)(B)(iii) state that
          the regulatory objectives specified in subsection (d)(1)(A)
          and (B) of this section have been achieved; and
            (ii) the Commission determines that such waiver will not
          adversely affect the continued achievement of such regulatory
          objectives.
      (2) Review of informational tariffs
        If the rates and charges filed by any provider of operator
      services under paragraph (1) appear upon review by the Commission
      to be unjust or unreasonable, the Commission may require such
      provider of operator services to do either or both of the
      following:
          (A) demonstrate that its rates and charges are just and
        reasonable, and
          (B) announce that its rates are available on request at the
        beginning of each call.
      (3) Proceeding required
        (A) In general
          Within 60 days after October 17, 1990, the Commission shall
        initiate a proceeding to determine whether the regulatory
        objectives specified in subsection (d)(1)(A) and (B) of this
        section are being achieved. The proceeding shall - 
            (i) monitor operator service rates;
            (ii) determine the extent to which offerings made by
          providers of operator services are improvements, in terms of
          service quality, price, innovation, and other factors, over
          those available before the entry of new providers of operator
          services into the market;
            (iii) report on (in the aggregate and by individual
          provider) operator service rates, incidence of service
          complaints, and service offerings;
            (iv) consider the effect that commissions and surcharges,
          billing and validation costs, and other costs of doing
          business have on the overall rates charged to consumers; and
            (v) monitor compliance with the provisions of this section,
          including the periodic placement of telephone calls from
          aggregator locations.
        (B) Reports
          (i) The Commission shall, during the pendency of such
        proceeding and not later than 5 months after its commencement,
        provide the Congress with an interim report on the Commission's
        activities and progress to date.
          (ii) Not later than 11 months after the commencement of such
        proceeding, the Commission shall report to the Congress on its
        interim findings as a result of the proceeding.
          (iii) Not later than 23 months after the commencement of such
        proceeding, the Commission shall submit a final report to the
        Congress on its findings and conclusions.
      (4) Implementing regulations
        (A) In general
          Unless the Commission makes the determination described in
        subparagraph (B), the Commission shall, within 180 days after
        submission of the report required under paragraph (3)(B)(iii),
        complete a rulemaking proceeding pursuant to this subchapter to
        establish regulations for implementing the requirements of this
        subchapter (and paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection) that
        rates and charges for operator services be just and reasonable.
        Such regulations shall include limitations on the amount of
        commissions or any other compensation given to aggregators by
        providers of operator service.
        (B) Limitation
          The requirement of subparagraph (A) shall not apply if, on
        the basis of the proceeding under paragraph (3)(A), the
        Commission makes (and includes in the report required by
        paragraph (3)(B)(iii)) a factual determination that market
        forces are securing rates and charges that are just and
        reasonable, as evidenced by rate levels, costs, complaints,
        service quality, and other relevant factors.
    (i) Statutory construction
      Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the
    obligations, powers, or duties of common carriers or the Commission
    under the other sections of this chapter.

                          CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS                      
      Section 2 of Pub. L. 101-435 provided that: "The Congress finds
    that - 
        "(1) the divestiture of AT&T and decisions allowing open entry
      for competitors in the telephone marketplace produced a variety
      of new services and many new providers of existing telephone
      services;
        "(2) the growth of competition in the telecommunications market
      makes it essential to ensure that safeguards are in place to
      assure fairness for consumers and service providers alike;
        "(3) a variety of providers of operator services now compete to
      win contracts to provide operator services to hotels, hospitals,
      airports, and other aggregators of telephone business from
      consumers;
        "(4) the mere existence of a variety of service providers in
      the operator services marketplace is significant in making that
      market competitive only when consumers are able to make informed
      choices from among those service providers;
        "(5) however, often consumers have no choices in selecting a
      provider of operator services, and often attempts by consumers to
      reach their preferred long distance carrier by using a telephone
      billing card, credit card, or prearranged access code number are
      blocked;
        "(6) a number of State regulatory authorities have taken action
      to protect consumers using intrastate operator services;
        "(7) from January 1988 through February 1990, the Federal
      Communications Commission received over 4,000 complaints from
      consumers about operator services;
        "(8) those consumers have complained that they are denied
      access to the interexchange carrier of their choice, that they
      are deceived about the identity of the company providing operator
      services for their calls and the rates being charged, that they
      lack information on what they can do to complain about unfair
      treatment by an operator service provider, and that they are,
      accordingly, being deprived of the free choice essential to the
      operation of a competitive market;
        "(9) the Commission has testified that its actions have been
      insufficient to correct the problems in the operator services
      industry to date; and
        "(10) a combination of industry self-regulation and government
      regulation is required to ensure that competitive operator
      services are provided in a fair and reasonable manner."

      (1) Prohibitions
        It shall be unlawful for any person within the United States,
      or any person outside the United States if the recipient is
      within the United States - 
          (A) to make any call (other than a call made for emergency
        purposes or made with the prior express consent of the called
        party) using any automatic telephone dialing system or an
        artificial or prerecorded voice - 
            (i) to any emergency telephone line (including any "911"
          line and any emergency line of a hospital, medical physician
          or service office, health care facility, poison control
          center, or fire protection or law enforcement agency);
            (ii) to the telephone line of any guest room or patient
          room of a hospital, health care facility, elderly home, or
          similar establishment; or

          which the called party is charged for the call;

          (B) to initiate any telephone call to any residential
        telephone line using an artificial or prerecorded voice to
        deliver a message without the prior express consent of the
        called party, unless the call is initiated for emergency
        purposes or is exempted by rule or order by the Commission
        under paragraph (2)(B);
          (C) to use any telephone facsimile machine, computer, or
        other device to send, to a telephone facsimile machine, an
        unsolicited advertisement, unless - 
            (i) the unsolicited advertisement is from a sender with an
          established business relationship with the recipient;
            (ii) the sender obtained the number of the telephone
          facsimile machine through - 
              (I) the voluntary communication of such number, within
            the context of such established business relationship, from
            the recipient of the unsolicited advertisement, or
              (II) a directory, advertisement, or site on the Internet
            to which the recipient voluntarily agreed to make available
            its facsimile number for public distribution,

          except that this clause shall not apply in the case of an
          unsolicited advertisement that is sent based on an
          established business relationship with the recipient that was
          in existence before July 9, 2005, if the sender possessed the
          facsimile machine number of the recipient before July 9,
          2005; and
            (iii) the unsolicited advertisement contains a notice
          meeting the requirements under paragraph (2)(D),

        except that the exception under clauses (i) and (ii) shall not
        apply with respect to an unsolicited advertisement sent to a
        telephone facsimile machine by a sender to whom a request has
        been made not to send future unsolicited advertisements to such
        telephone facsimile machine that complies with the requirements
        under paragraph (2)(E); or
          (D) to use an automatic telephone dialing system in such a
        way that two or more telephone lines of a multi-line business
        are engaged simultaneously.
      (2) Regulations; exemptions and other provisions
        The Commission shall prescribe regulations to implement the
      requirements of this subsection. In implementing the requirements
      of this subsection, the Commission - 
          (A) shall consider prescribing regulations to allow
        businesses to avoid receiving calls made using an artificial or
        prerecorded voice to which they have not given their prior
        express consent;
          (B) may, by rule or order, exempt from the requirements of
        paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, subject to such conditions
        as the Commission may prescribe - 
            (i) calls that are not made for a commercial purpose; and
            (ii) such classes or categories of calls made for
          commercial purposes as the Commission determines - 
              (I) will not adversely affect the privacy rights that
            this section is intended to protect; and
              (II) do not include the transmission of any unsolicited
            advertisement;

          (C) may, by rule or order, exempt from the requirements of
        paragraph (1)(A)(iii) of this subsection calls to a telephone
        number assigned to a cellular telephone service that are not
        charged to the called party, subject to such conditions as the
        Commission may prescribe as necessary in the interest of the
        privacy rights this section is intended to protect;
          (D) shall provide that a notice contained in an unsolicited
        advertisement complies with the requirements under this
        subparagraph only if - 
            (i) the notice is clear and conspicuous and on the first
          page of the unsolicited advertisement;
            (ii) the notice states that the recipient may make a
          request to the sender of the unsolicited advertisement not to
          send any future unsolicited advertisements to a telephone
          facsimile machine or machines and that failure to comply,
          within the shortest reasonable time, as determined by the
          Commission, with such a request meeting the requirements
          under subparagraph (E) is unlawful;
            (iii) the notice sets forth the requirements for a request
          under subparagraph (E);
            (iv) the notice includes - 
              (I) a domestic contact telephone and facsimile machine
            number for the recipient to transmit such a request to the
            sender; and
              (II) a cost-free mechanism for a recipient to transmit a
            request pursuant to such notice to the sender of the
            unsolicited advertisement; the Commission shall by rule
            require the sender to provide such a mechanism and may, in
            the discretion of the Commission and subject to such
            conditions as the Commission may prescribe, exempt certain
            classes of small business senders, but only if the
            Commission determines that the costs to such class are
            unduly burdensome given the revenues generated by such
            small businesses;

            (v) the telephone and facsimile machine numbers and the
          cost-free mechanism set forth pursuant to clause (iv) permit
          an individual or business to make such a request at any time
          on any day of the week; and
            (vi) the notice complies with the requirements of
          subsection (d) of this section;

          (E) shall provide, by rule, that a request not to send future
        unsolicited advertisements to a telephone facsimile machine
        complies with the requirements under this subparagraph only if -
         
            (i) the request identifies the telephone number or numbers
          of the telephone facsimile machine or machines to which the
          request relates;
            (ii) the request is made to the telephone or facsimile
          number of the sender of such an unsolicited advertisement
          provided pursuant to subparagraph (D)(iv) or by any other
          method of communication as determined by the Commission; and
            (iii) the person making the request has not, subsequent to
          such request, provided express invitation or permission to
          the sender, in writing or otherwise, to send such
          advertisements to such person at such telephone facsimile
          machine;

          (F) may, in the discretion of the Commission and subject to
        such conditions as the Commission may prescribe, allow
        professional or trade associations that are tax-exempt
        nonprofit organizations to send unsolicited advertisements to
        their members in furtherance of the association's tax-exempt
        purpose that do not contain the notice required by paragraph
        (1)(C)(iii), except that the Commission may take action under
        this subparagraph only - 
            (i) by regulation issued after public notice and
          opportunity for public comment; and
            (ii) if the Commission determines that such notice required
          by paragraph (1)(C)(iii) is not necessary to protect the
          ability of the members of such associations to stop such
          associations from sending any future unsolicited
          advertisements; and

          (G)(i) may, consistent with clause (ii), limit the duration
        of the existence of an established business relationship,
        however, before establishing any such limits, the Commission
        shall - 
            (I) determine whether the existence of the exception under
          paragraph (1)(C) relating to an established business
          relationship has resulted in a significant number of
          complaints to the Commission regarding the sending of
          unsolicited advertisements to telephone facsimile machines;
            (II) determine whether a significant number of any such
          complaints involve unsolicited advertisements that were sent
          on the basis of an established business relationship that was
          longer in duration than the Commission believes is consistent
          with the reasonable expectations of consumers;
            (III) evaluate the costs to senders of demonstrating the
          existence of an established business relationship within a
          specified period of time and the benefits to recipients of
          establishing a limitation on such established business
          relationship; and
            (IV) determine whether with respect to small businesses,
          the costs would not be unduly burdensome; and

          (ii) may not commence a proceeding to determine whether to
        limit the duration of the existence of an established business
        relationship before the expiration of the 3-month period that
        begins on July 9, 2005.
      (3) Private right of action
        A person or entity may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or
      rules of court of a State, bring in an appropriate court of that
      State - 
          (A) an action based on a violation of this subsection or the
        regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin such
        violation,
          (B) an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a
        violation, or to receive $500 in damages for each such
        violation, whichever is greater, or
          (C) both such actions.

      If the court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly
      violated this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this
      subsection, the court may, in its discretion, increase the amount
      of the award to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the
      amount available under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.
    (c) Protection of subscriber privacy rights
      (1) Rulemaking proceeding required
        Within 120 days after December 20, 1991, the Commission shall
      initiate a rulemaking proceeding concerning the need to protect
      residential telephone subscribers' privacy rights to avoid
      receiving telephone solicitations to which they object. The
      proceeding shall - 
          (A) compare and evaluate alternative methods and procedures
        (including the use of electronic databases, telephone network
        technologies, special directory markings, industry-based or
        company-specific "do not call" systems, and any other
        alternatives, individually or in combination) for their
        effectiveness in protecting such privacy rights, and in terms
        of their cost and other advantages and disadvantages;
          (B) evaluate the categories of public and private entities
        that would have the capacity to establish and administer such
        methods and procedures;
          (C) consider whether different methods and procedures may
        apply for local telephone solicitations, such as local
        telephone solicitations of small businesses or holders of
        second class mail permits;
          (D) consider whether there is a need for additional
        Commission authority to further restrict telephone
        solicitations, including those calls exempted under subsection
        (a)(3) of this section, and, if such a finding is made and
        supported by the record, propose specific restrictions to the
        Congress; and
          (E) develop proposed regulations to implement the methods and
        procedures that the Commission determines are most effective
        and efficient to accomplish the purposes of this section.
      (2) Regulations
        Not later than 9 months after December 20, 1991, the Commission
      shall conclude the rulemaking proceeding initiated under
      paragraph (1) and shall prescribe regulations to implement
      methods and procedures for protecting the privacy rights
      described in such paragraph in an efficient, effective, and
      economic manner and without the imposition of any additional
      charge to telephone subscribers.
      (3) Use of database permitted
        The regulations required by paragraph (2) may require the
      establishment and operation of a single national database to
      compile a list of telephone numbers of residential subscribers
      who object to receiving telephone solicitations, and to make that
      compiled list and parts thereof available for purchase. If the
      Commission determines to require such a database, such
      regulations shall - 
          (A) specify a method by which the Commission will select an
        entity to administer such database;
          (B) require each common carrier providing telephone exchange
        service, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the
        Commission, to inform subscribers for telephone exchange
        service of the opportunity to provide notification, in
        accordance with regulations established under this paragraph,
        that such subscriber objects to receiving telephone
        solicitations;
          (C) specify the methods by which each telephone subscriber
        shall be informed, by the common carrier that provides local
        exchange service to that subscriber, of (i) the subscriber's
        right to give or revoke a notification of an objection under
        subparagraph (A), and (ii) the methods by which such right may
        be exercised by the subscriber;
          (D) specify the methods by which such objections shall be
        collected and added to the database;
          (E) prohibit any residential subscriber from being charged
        for giving or revoking such notification or for being included
        in a database compiled under this section;
          (F) prohibit any person from making or transmitting a
        telephone solicitation to the telephone number of any
        subscriber included in such database;
          (G) specify (i) the methods by which any person desiring to
        make or transmit telephone solicitations will obtain access to
        the database, by area code or local exchange prefix, as
        required to avoid calling the telephone numbers of subscribers
        included in such database; and (ii) the costs to be recovered
        from such persons;
          (H) specify the methods for recovering, from persons
        accessing such database, the costs involved in identifying,
        collecting, updating, disseminating, and selling, and other
        activities relating to, the operations of the database that are
        incurred by the entities carrying out those activities;
          (I) specify the frequency with which such database will be
        updated and specify the method by which such updating will take
        effect for purposes of compliance with the regulations
        prescribed under this subsection;
          (J) be designed to enable States to use the database
        mechanism selected by the Commission for purposes of
        administering or enforcing State law;
          (K) prohibit the use of such database for any purpose other
        than compliance with the requirements of this section and any
        such State law and specify methods for protection of the
        privacy rights of persons whose numbers are included in such
        database; and
          (L) require each common carrier providing services to any
        person for the purpose of making telephone solicitations to
        notify such person of the requirements of this section and the
        regulations thereunder.
      (4) Considerations required for use of database method
        If the Commission determines to require the database mechanism
      described in paragraph (3), the Commission shall - 
          (A) in developing procedures for gaining access to the
        database, consider the different needs of telemarketers
        conducting business on a national, regional, State, or local
        level;
          (B) develop a fee schedule or price structure for recouping
        the cost of such database that recognizes such differences and -
         
            (i) reflect the relative costs of providing a national,
          regional, State, or local list of phone numbers of
          subscribers who object to receiving telephone solicitations;
            (ii) reflect the relative costs of providing such lists on
          paper or electronic media; and
            (iii) not place an unreasonable financial burden on small
          businesses; and

          (C) consider (i) whether the needs of telemarketers operating
        on a local basis could be met through special markings of area
        white pages directories, and (ii) if such directories are
        needed as an adjunct to database lists prepared by area code
        and local exchange prefix.
      (5) Private right of action
        A person who has received more than one telephone call within
      any 12-month period by or on behalf of the same entity in
      violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection
      may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a
      State bring in an appropriate court of that State - 
          (A) an action based on a violation of the regulations
        prescribed under this subsection to enjoin such violation,
          (B) an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a
        violation, or to receive up to $500 in damages for each such
        violation, whichever is greater, or
          (C) both such actions.

      It shall be an affirmative defense in any action brought under
      this paragraph that the defendant has established and
      implemented, with due care, reasonable practices and procedures
      to effectively prevent telephone solicitations in violation of
      the regulations prescribed under this subsection. If the court
      finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated the
      regulations prescribed under this subsection, the court may, in
      its discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount
      equal to not more than 3 times the amount available under
      subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.
      (6) Relation to subsection (b)
        The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to
      permit a communication prohibited by subsection (b) of this
      section.
    (d) Technical and procedural standards
      (1) Prohibition
        It shall be unlawful for any person within the United States - 
          (A) to initiate any communication using a telephone facsimile
        machine, or to make any telephone call using any automatic
        telephone dialing system, that does not comply with the
        technical and procedural standards prescribed under this
        subsection, or to use any telephone facsimile machine or
        automatic telephone dialing system in a manner that does not
        comply with such standards; or
          (B) to use a computer or other electronic device to send any
        message via a telephone facsimile machine unless such person
        clearly marks, in a margin at the top or bottom of each
        transmitted page of the message or on the first page of the
        transmission, the date and time it is sent and an
        identification of the business, other entity, or individual
        sending the message and the telephone number of the sending
        machine or of such business, other entity, or individual.
      (2) Telephone facsimile machines
        The Commission shall revise the regulations setting technical
      and procedural standards for telephone facsimile machines to
      require that any such machine which is manufactured after one
      year after December 20, 1991, clearly marks, in a margin at the
      top or bottom of each transmitted page or on the first page of
      each transmission, the date and time sent, an identification of
      the business, other entity, or individual sending the message,
      and the telephone number of the sending machine or of such
      business, other entity, or individual.
      (3) Artificial or prerecorded voice systems
        The Commission shall prescribe technical and procedural
      standards for systems that are used to transmit any artificial or
      prerecorded voice message via telephone. Such standards shall
      require that - 
          (A) all artificial or prerecorded telephone messages (i)
        shall, at the beginning of the message, state clearly the
        identity of the business, individual, or other entity
        initiating the call, and (ii) shall, during or after the
        message, state clearly the telephone number or address of such
        business, other entity, or individual; and
          (B) any such system will automatically release the called
        party's line within 5 seconds of the time notification is
        transmitted to the system that the called party has hung up, to
        allow the called party's line to be used to make or receive
        other calls.
    (e) Effect on State law
      (1) State law not preempted
        Except for the standards prescribed under subsection (d) of
      this section and subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection,
      nothing in this section or in the regulations prescribed under
      this section shall preempt any State law that imposes more
      restrictive intrastate requirements or regulations on, or which
      prohibits - 
          (A) the use of telephone facsimile machines or other
        electronic devices to send unsolicited advertisements;
          (B) the use of automatic telephone dialing systems;
          (C) the use of artificial or prerecorded voice messages; or
          (D) the making of telephone solicitations.
      (2) State use of databases
        If, pursuant to subsection (c)(3) of this section, the
      Commission requires the establishment of a single national
      database of telephone numbers of subscribers who object to
      receiving telephone solicitations, a State or local authority may
      not, in its regulation of telephone solicitations, require the
      use of any database, list, or listing system that does not
      include the part of such single national database that relates to
      such State.
    (f) Actions by States
      (1) Authority of States
        Whenever the attorney general of a State, or an official or
      agency designated by a State, has reason to believe that any
      person has engaged or is engaging in a pattern or practice of
      telephone calls or other transmissions to residents of that State
      in violation of this section or the regulations prescribed under
      this section, the State may bring a civil action on behalf of its
      residents to enjoin such calls, an action to recover for actual
      monetary loss or receive $500 in damages for each violation, or
      both such actions. If the court finds the defendant willfully or
      knowingly violated such regulations, the court may, in its
      discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount equal
      to not more than 3 times the amount available under the preceding
      sentence.
      (2) Exclusive jurisdiction of Federal courts
        The district courts of the United States, the United States
      courts of any territory, and the District Court of the United
      States for the District of Columbia shall have exclusive
      jurisdiction over all civil actions brought under this
      subsection. Upon proper application, such courts shall also have
      jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus, or orders affording like
      relief, commanding the defendant to comply with the provisions of
      this section or regulations prescribed under this section,
      including the requirement that the defendant take such action as
      is necessary to remove the danger of such violation. Upon a
      proper showing, a permanent or temporary injunction or
      restraining order shall be granted without bond.
      (3) Rights of Commission
        The State shall serve prior written notice of any such civil
      action upon the Commission and provide the Commission with a copy
      of its complaint, except in any case where such prior notice is
      not feasible, in which case the State shall serve such notice
      immediately upon instituting such action. The Commission shall
      have the right (A) to intervene in the action, (B) upon so
      intervening, to be heard on all matters arising therein, and (C)
      to file petitions for appeal.
      (4) Venue; service of process
        Any civil action brought under this subsection in a district
      court of the United States may be brought in the district wherein
      the defendant is found or is an inhabitant or transacts business
      or wherein the violation occurred or is occurring, and process in
      such cases may be served in any district in which the defendant
      is an inhabitant or where the defendant may be found.
      (5) Investigatory powers
        For purposes of bringing any civil action under this
      subsection, nothing in this section shall prevent the attorney
      general of a State, or an official or agency designated by a
      State, from exercising the powers conferred on the attorney
      general or such official by the laws of such State to conduct
      investigations or to administer oaths or affirmations or to
      compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of
      documentary and other evidence.
      (6) Effect on State court proceedings
        Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed to
      prohibit an authorized State official from proceeding in State
      court on the basis of an alleged violation of any general civil
      or criminal statute of such State.
      (7) Limitation
        Whenever the Commission has instituted a civil action for
      violation of regulations prescribed under this section, no State
      may, during the pendency of such action instituted by the
      Commission, subsequently institute a civil action against any
      defendant named in the Commission's complaint for any violation
      as alleged in the Commission's complaint.
      (8) "Attorney general" defined
        As used in this subsection, the term "attorney general" means
      the chief legal officer of a State.
    (g) Junk fax enforcement report
      The Commission shall submit an annual report to Congress
    regarding the enforcement during the past year of the provisions of
    this section relating to sending of unsolicited advertisements to
    telephone facsimile machines, which report shall include - 
        (1) the number of complaints received by the Commission during
      such year alleging that a consumer received an unsolicited
      advertisement via telephone facsimile machine in violation of the
      Commission's rules;

      Pub. L. 109-21, Sec. 2(h), July 9, 2005, 119 Stat. 362, provided

    by this section."

                    CONGRESSIONAL STATEMENT OF FINDINGS                
      Section 2 of Pub. L. 102-243 provided that: "The Congress finds
    that:
        "(1) The use of the telephone to market goods and services to
      the home and other businesses is now pervasive due to the
      increased use of cost-effective telemarketing techniques.
        "(2) Over 30,000 businesses actively telemarket goods and
      services to business and residential customers.
        "(3) More than 300,000 solicitors call more than 18,000,000
      Americans every day.
        "(4) Total United States sales generated through telemarketing
      amounted to $435,000,000,000 in 1990, a more than four-fold
      increase since 1984.
        "(5) Unrestricted telemarketing, however, can be an intrusive
      invasion of privacy and, when an emergency or medical assistance
      telephone line is seized, a risk to public safety.
        "(6) Many consumers are outraged over the proliferation of
      intrusive, nuisance calls to their homes from telemarketers.
        "(7) Over half the States now have statutes restricting various
      uses of the telephone for marketing, but telemarketers can evade
      their prohibitions through interstate operations; therefore,
      Federal law is needed to control residential telemarketing
      practices.
        "(8) The Constitution does not prohibit restrictions on
      commercial telemarketing solicitations.
        "(9) Individuals' privacy rights, public safety interests, and
      commercial freedoms of speech and trade must be balanced in a way
      that protects the privacy of individuals and permits legitimate
      telemarketing practices.
        "(10) Evidence compiled by the Congress indicates that
      residential telephone subscribers consider automated or
      prerecorded telephone calls, regardless of the content or the
      initiator of the message, to be a nuisance and an invasion of
      privacy.
        "(11) Technologies that might allow consumers to avoid
      receiving such calls are not universally available, are costly,
      are unlikely to be enforced, or place an inordinate burden on the
      consumer.
        "(12) Banning such automated or prerecorded telephone calls to
      the home, except when the receiving party consents to receiving
      the call or when such calls are necessary in an emergency
      situation affecting the health and safety of the consumer, is the
      only effective means of protecting telephone consumers from this
      nuisance and privacy invasion.
        "(13) While the evidence presented to the Congress indicates
      that automated or prerecorded calls are a nuisance and an
      invasion of privacy, regardless of the type of call, the Federal
      Communications Commission should have the flexibility to design
      different rules for those types of automated or prerecorded calls
      that it finds are not considered a nuisance or invasion of
      privacy, or for noncommercial calls, consistent with the free
      speech protections embodied in the First Amendment of the
      Constitution.
        "(14) Businesses also have complained to the Congress and the
      Federal Communications Commission that automated or prerecorded
      telephone calls are a nuisance, are an invasion of privacy, and
      interfere with interstate commerce.
        "(15) The Federal Communications Commission should consider
      adopting reasonable restrictions on automated or prerecorded
      calls to businesses as well as to the home, consistent with the
      constitutional protections of free speech."

    (a) Purpose
      It is the purpose of this section - 
        (1) to put into effect a system of national regulation and
      review that will oversee interstate pay-per-call services; and
        (2) to recognize the Commission's authority to prescribe
      regulations and enforcement procedures and conduct oversight to
      afford reasonable protection to consumers of pay-per-call
      services and to assure that violations of Federal law do not
      occur.
    (b) General authority for regulations
      The Commission by regulation shall, within 270 days after October

      the provision of pay-per-call services;
        (3) include requirements on such carriers to protect against
      abusive practices by providers of pay-per-call services;
        (4) identify procedures by which common carriers and providers
      of pay-per-call services may take affirmative steps to protect
      against nonpayment of legitimate charges; and
        (5) require that any service described in subparagraphs (A) and
      (B) of subsection (i)(1) of this section be offered only through
      the use of certain telephone number prefixes and area codes.
    (c) Common carrier obligations
      Within 270 days after October 28, 1992, the Commission shall, by
    regulation, establish the following requirements for common
    carriers:
      (1) Contractual obligations to comply
        Any common carrier assigning to a provider of pay-per-call
      services a telephone number with a prefix or area code designated
      by the Commission in accordance with subsection (b)(5) of this
      section shall require by contract or tariff that such provider
      comply with the provisions of titles II and III of the Telephone
      Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act [15 U.S.C. 5711 et seq.;
      5721 et seq.] and the regulations prescribed by the Federal Trade
      Commission pursuant to those titles.
      (2) Information availability
        A common carrier that by tariff or contract assigns a telephone
      number with a prefix or area code designated by the Commission in
      accordance with subsection (b)(5) of this section to a provider
      of a pay-per-call service shall make readily available on request
      to Federal and State agencies and other interested persons - 
          (A) a list of the telephone numbers for each of the pay-per-
        call services it carries;
          (B) a short description of each such service;
          (C) a statement of the total cost or the cost per minute and
        any other fees for each such service;
          (D) a statement of the pay-per-call service's name, business
        address, and business telephone; and
          (E) such other information as the Commission considers
        necessary for the enforcement of this section and other
        applicable Federal statutes and regulations.
      (3) Compliance procedures
        A common carrier that by contract or tariff assigns a telephone
      number with a prefix or area code designated by the Commission in
      accordance with subsection (b)(5) of this section to a provider
      of pay-per-call services shall terminate, in accordance with
      procedures specified in such regulations, the offering of a pay-
      per-call service of a provider if the carrier knows or
      reasonably should know that such service is not provided in
      compliance with title II or III of the Telephone Disclosure and
      Dispute Resolution Act [15 U.S.C. 5711 et seq.; 5721 et seq.] or
      the regulations prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission
      pursuant to such titles.
      (4) Subscriber disconnection prohibited
        A common carrier shall not disconnect or interrupt a
      subscriber's local exchange telephone service or long distance
      telephone service because of nonpayment of charges for any pay-
      per-call service.
      (5) Blocking and presubscription
        A common carrier that provides local exchange service shall - 
          (A) offer telephone subscribers (where technically feasible)
        the option of blocking access from their telephone number to
        all, or to certain specific, prefixes or area codes used by pay-
        per-call services, which option - 
            (i) shall be offered at no charge (I) to all subscribers
          for a period of 60 days after the issuance of the regulations
          under subsection (b) of this section, and (II) to any
          subscriber who subscribes to a new telephone number until 60
          days after the time the new telephone number is effective;
          and
            (ii) shall otherwise be offered at a reasonable fee; and

          (B) offer telephone subscribers (where the Commission
        determines it is technically and economically feasible), in
        combination with the blocking option described under
        subparagraph (A), the option of presubscribing to or blocking
        only specific pay-per-call services for a reasonable one-time
        charge.

      The regulations prescribed under subparagraph (A)(i) of this
      paragraph may permit the costs of such blocking to be recovered
      by contract or tariff, but such costs may not be recovered from
      local or long-distance ratepayers. Nothing in this subsection
      precludes a common carrier from filing its rates and regulations
      regarding blocking and presubscription in its interstate tariffs.
      (6) Verification of charitable status
        A common carrier that assigns by contract or tariff a telephone
      number with a prefix or area code designated by the Commission in

      of pay-per-call services that the carrier knows or reasonably
      should know is engaged in soliciting charitable contributions
      shall obtain from such provider proof of the tax exempt status of
      any person or organization for which contributions are solicited.
      (7) Billing for 800 calls
        A common carrier shall prohibit by tariff or contract the use
      of any 800 telephone number, or other telephone number advertised
      or widely understood to be toll free, in a manner that would
      result in - 
          (A) the calling party being assessed, by virtue of completing
        the call, a charge for the call;
          (B) the calling party being connected to a pay-per-call
        service;
          (C) the calling party being charged for information conveyed
        during the call unless - 
            (i) the calling party has a written agreement (including an
          agreement transmitted through electronic medium) that meets
          the requirements of paragraph (8); or
            (ii) the calling party is charged for the information in
          accordance with paragraph (9);

          (D) the calling party being called back collect for the

        conversation services; or
          (E) the calling party being assessed, by virtue of being
        asked to connect or otherwise transfer to a pay-per-call
        service, a charge for the call.
      (8) Subscription agreements for billing for information provided
        via toll-free calls
        (A) In general
          For purposes of paragraph (7)(C)(i), a written subscription

        paragraph unless it - 
            (i) includes a unique personal identification number or

          subscriber-specific identifier be assessed to subscriber's
          source of payment elected pursuant to subparagraph (A)(vi).
        (D) Exceptions

          deaf;
            (ii) for directory services provided by a common carrier or

          evidence of a written agreement that meets the requirements
          of this section.
        (F) Treatment of remedies
          The remedies provided in this paragraph are in addition to
        any other remedies that are available under subchapter V of
        this chapter.
      (9) Charges by credit, prepaid, debit, charge, or calling card in
        absence of agreement
        For purposes of paragraph (7)(C)(ii), a calling party is not
      charged in accordance with this paragraph unless the calling
      party is charged by means of a credit, prepaid, debit, charge, or
      calling card and the information service provider includes in
      response to each call an introductory disclosure message that - 
          (A) clearly states that there is a charge for the call;

        charge whatsoever.
      (10) Bypass of introductory disclosure message

      repeat callers using a bypass mechanism to avoid listening to the
      introductory message: Provided, That information providers shall
      disable such a bypass mechanism after the institution of any
      price increase and for a period of time determined to be
      sufficient by the Federal Trade Commission to give callers
      adequate and sufficient notice of a price increase.

        As used in this subsection, the term "calling card" means an
      identifying number or code unique to the individual, that is

      individual to be charged by means of a phone bill for charges
      incurred independent of where the call originates.
    (d) Billing and collection practices
      The regulations required by this section shall require that any
    common carrier that by tariff or contract assigns a telephone
    number with a prefix or area code designated by the Commission in

      all of such common carrier's telephone subscribers, to all new
      subscribers, and to all subscribers requesting service at a new
      location, a disclosure statement that sets forth all rights and
      obligations of the subscriber and the carrier with respect to the
      use and payment for pay-per-call services, including the right of
      a subscriber not to be billed and the applicable blocking option;

    (e) Liability
      (1) Common carriers not liable for transmission or billing
        No common carrier shall be liable for a criminal or civil
      sanction or penalty solely because the carrier provided
      transmission or billing and collection for a pay-per-call service
      unless the carrier knew or reasonably should have known that such
      service was provided in violation of a provision of, or
      regulation prescribed pursuant to, title II or III of the
      Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act [15 U.S.C. 5711
      et seq.; 5721 et seq.] or any other Federal law. This paragraph
      shall not prevent the Commission from imposing a sanction or
      penalty on a common carrier for a violation by that carrier of a
      regulation prescribed under this section.
      (2) Civil liability
        No cause of action may be brought in any court or
      administrative agency against any common carrier or any of its

      regulations prescribed under this section, title II or III of the
      Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act [15 U.S.C. 5711
      et seq.; 5721 et seq.], or any other Federal law unless the
      complainant demonstrates that the carrier or affiliate did not
      act in good faith.
    (f) Special provisions
      (1) Consumer refund requirements
        The regulations required by subsection (d) of this section
      shall establish procedures, consistent with the provisions of
      titles II and III of the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute
      Resolution Act [15 U.S.C. 5711 et seq.; 5721 et seq.], to ensure
      that carriers and other parties providing billing and collection
      services with respect to pay-per-call services provide
      appropriate refunds to subscribers who have been billed for pay-
      per-call services pursuant to programs that have been found to
      have violated this section or such regulations, any provision of,
      or regulations prescribed pursuant to, title II or III of the
      Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act, or any other
      Federal law.
      (2) Recovery of costs
        The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this section
      shall permit a common carrier to recover its cost of complying
      with such regulations from providers of pay-per-call services,
      but shall not permit such costs to be recovered from local or
      long distance ratepayers.
      (3) Recommendations on data pay-per-call
        The Commission, within one year after October 28, 1992, shall
      submit to the Congress the Commission's recommendations with
      respect to the extension of regulations under this section to
      persons that provide, for a per-call charge, data services that
      are not pay-per-call services.
    (g) Effect on other law
      (1) No preemption of election law
        Nothing in this section shall relieve any provider of pay-per-
      call services, common carrier, local exchange carrier, or any
      other person from the obligation to comply with Federal, State,
      and local election statutes and regulations.
      (2) Consumer protection laws
        Nothing in this section shall relieve any provider of pay-per-
      call services, common carrier, local exchange carrier, or any
      other person from the obligation to comply with any Federal,
      State, or local statute or regulation relating to consumer
      protection or unfair trade.
      (3) Gambling laws
        Nothing in this section shall preclude any State from enforcing
      its statutes and regulations with regard to lotteries, wagering,
      betting, and other gambling activities.
      (4) State authority
        Nothing in this section shall preclude any State from enacting
      and enforcing additional and complementary oversight and
      regulatory systems or procedures, or both, so long as such
      systems and procedures govern intrastate services and do not
      significantly impede the enforcement of this section or other
      Federal statutes.
      (5) Enforcement of existing regulations
        Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the
      Commission from enforcing regulations prescribed prior to October
      28, 1992, in fulfilling the requirements of this section to the
      extent that such regulations are consistent with the provisions
      of this section.

    223 of this title.

      The rules prescribed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section
    shall include rules to implement section 105 of the Communications
    Assistance for Law Enforcement Act [47 U.S.C. 1004] that require
    common carriers - 
        (1) to establish appropriate policies and procedures for the
      supervision and control of its officers and employees - 
          (A) to require appropriate authorization to activate
        interception of communications or access to call-identifying

      or access with or without such authorization; and
        (3) to submit to the Commission the policies and procedures

      paragraphs (1) and (2).
    (c) Commission review of compliance
      The Commission shall review the policies and procedures submitted
    under subsection (b)(3) of this section and shall order a common

    Sec. 230. Protection for private blocking and screening of
      offensive material

-STATUTE-
    (a) Findings
      The Congress finds the following:
        (1) The rapidly developing array of Internet and other
      interactive computer services available to individual Americans
      represent an extraordinary advance in the availability of
      educational and informational resources to our citizens.
        (2) These services offer users a great degree of control over
      the information that they receive, as well as the potential for
      even greater control in the future as technology develops.
        (3) The Internet and other interactive computer services offer
      a forum for a true diversity of political discourse, unique
      opportunities for cultural development, and myriad avenues for
      intellectual activity.
        (4) The Internet and other interactive computer services have
      flourished, to the benefit of all Americans, with a minimum of
      government regulation.
        (5) Increasingly Americans are relying on interactive media for
      a variety of political, educational, cultural, and entertainment
      services.
    (b) Policy
      It is the policy of the United States - 
        (1) to promote the continued development of the Internet and
      other interactive computer services and other interactive media;
        (2) to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that
      presently exists for the Internet and other interactive computer
      services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation;
        (3) to encourage the development of technologies which maximize
      user control over what information is received by individuals,
      families, and schools who use the Internet and other interactive
      computer services;
        (4) to remove disincentives for the development and utilization
      of blocking and filtering technologies that empower parents to
      restrict their children's access to objectionable or
      inappropriate online material; and
        (5) to ensure vigorous enforcement of Federal criminal laws to
      deter and punish trafficking in obscenity, stalking, and
      harassment by means of computer.
    (c) Protection for "Good Samaritan" blocking and screening of
      offensive material
      (1) Treatment of publisher or speaker
        No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be
      treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided
      by another information content provider.
      (2) Civil liability
        No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be
      held liable on account of - 
          (A) any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict
        access to or availability of material that the provider or user
        considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively
        violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not
        such material is constitutionally protected; or
          (B) any action taken to enable or make available to
        information content providers or others the technical means to
        restrict access to material described in paragraph (1).(!1)

    (d) Obligations of interactive computer service
      A provider of interactive computer service shall, at the time of
    entering an agreement with a customer for the provision of
    interactive computer service and in a manner deemed appropriate by
    the provider, notify such customer that parental control
    protections (such as computer hardware, software, or filtering
    services) are commercially available that may assist the customer
    in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. Such
    notice shall identify, or provide the customer with access to
    information identifying, current providers of such protections.
    (e) Effect on other laws
      (1) No effect on criminal law
        Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair the
      enforcement of section 223 or 231 of this title, chapter 71
      (relating to obscenity) or 110 (relating to sexual exploitation
      of children) of title 18, or any other Federal criminal statute.
      (2) No effect on intellectual property law
        Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or expand
      any law pertaining to intellectual property.
      (3) State law
        Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any State
      from enforcing any State law that is consistent with this
      section. No cause of action may be brought and no liability may
      be imposed under any State or local law that is inconsistent with
      this section.
      (4) No effect on communications privacy law
        Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the
      application of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986
      or any of the amendments made by such Act, or any similar State
      law.

      person's deletion of a particular communication or material made
      by another person in a manner consistent with subsection (c) of
      this section or section 230 of this title shall not constitute
      such selection or alteration of the content of the communication.
    (c) Affirmative defense
      (1) Defense
        It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under this section
      that the defendant, in good faith, has restricted access by

      criminal or civil penalty, and that the person has taken in good
      faith to implement a defense authorized under this subsection or
      otherwise to restrict or prevent the transmission of, or access

            (i) the individual concerned, if the individual is an
          adult; or
            (ii) the individual's parent or guardian, if the individual
          is under 17 years of age; and

          (B) shall take such actions as are necessary to prevent
        unauthorized access to such information by a person other than

      information.
      (4) Internet access service
        The term "Internet access service" means a service that enables
      users to access content, information, electronic mail, or other
      services offered over the Internet, and may also include access
      to proprietary content, information, and other services as part
      of a package of services offered to consumers. Such term does not
      include telecommunications services.
      (5) Internet information location tool
        The term "Internet information location tool" means a service
      that refers or links users to an online location on the World
      Wide Web. Such term includes directories, indices, references,

                          CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS                      
      Pub. L. 105-277, div. C, title XIV, Sec. 1402, Oct. 21, 1998, 112
    Stat. 2681-736, provided that: "The Congress finds that - 
        "(1) while custody, care, and nurture of the child resides
      first with the parent, the widespread availability of the
      Internet presents opportunities for minors to access materials
      through the World Wide Web in a manner that can frustrate
      parental supervision or control;
        "(2) the protection of the physical and psychological well-
      being of minors by shielding them from materials that are
      harmful to them is a compelling governmental interest;
        "(3) to date, while the industry has developed innovative ways
      to help parents and educators restrict material that is harmful
      to minors through parental control protections and self-
      regulation, such efforts have not provided a national solution
      to the problem of minors accessing harmful material on the World
      Wide Web;
        "(4) a prohibition on the distribution of material harmful to
      minors, combined with legitimate defenses, is currently the most
      effective and least restrictive means by which to satisfy the
      compelling government interest; and
        "(5) notwithstanding the existence of protections that limit
      the distribution over the World Wide Web of material that is
      harmful to minors, parents, educators, and industry must continue
      efforts to find ways to protect children from being exposed to
      harmful material found on the Internet."

-STATUTE-
    (a) General duty of telecommunications carriers
      Each telecommunications carrier has the duty - 
        (1) to interconnect directly or indirectly with the facilities
      and equipment of other telecommunications carriers; and
        (2) not to install network features, functions, or capabilities
      that do not comply with the guidelines and standards established
      pursuant to section 255 or 256 of this title.
    (b) Obligations of all local exchange carriers
      Each local exchange carrier has the following duties:
      (1) Resale
        The duty not to prohibit, and not to impose unreasonable or
      discriminatory conditions or limitations on, the resale of its
      telecommunications services.
      (2) Number portability
        The duty to provide, to the extent technically feasible, number
      portability in accordance with requirements prescribed by the
      Commission.
      (3) Dialing parity
        The duty to provide dialing parity to competing providers of
      telephone exchange service and telephone toll service, and the
      duty to permit all such providers to have nondiscriminatory
      access to telephone numbers, operator services, directory
      assistance, and directory listing, with no unreasonable dialing
      delays.
      (4) Access to rights-of-way
        The duty to afford access to the poles, ducts, conduits, and
      rights-of-way of such carrier to competing providers of
      telecommunications services on rates, terms, and conditions that
      are consistent with section 224 of this title.
      (5) Reciprocal compensation
        The duty to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for
      the transport and termination of telecommunications.
    (c) Additional obligations of incumbent local exchange carriers
      In addition to the duties contained in subsection (b) of this
    section, each incumbent local exchange carrier has the following
    duties:
      (1) Duty to negotiate
        The duty to negotiate in good faith in accordance with section
      252 of this title the particular terms and conditions of
      agreements to fulfill the duties described in paragraphs (1)
      through (5) of subsection (b) of this section and this
      subsection. The requesting telecommunications carrier also has
      the duty to negotiate in good faith the terms and conditions of
      such agreements.
      (2) Interconnection
        The duty to provide, for the facilities and equipment of any
      requesting telecommunications carrier, interconnection with the
      local exchange carrier's network - 
          (A) for the transmission and routing of telephone exchange
        service and exchange access;
          (B) at any technically feasible point within the carrier's
        network;
          (C) that is at least equal in quality to that provided by the
        local exchange carrier to itself or to any subsidiary,
        affiliate, or any other party to which the carrier provides
        interconnection; and
          (D) on rates, terms, and conditions that are just,
        reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, in accordance with the terms
        and conditions of the agreement and the requirements of this
        section and section 252 of this title.
      (3) Unbundled access
        The duty to provide, to any requesting telecommunications
      carrier for the provision of a telecommunications service,
      nondiscriminatory access to network elements on an unbundled
      basis at any technically feasible point on rates, terms, and
      conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory in
      accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement and the
      requirements of this section and section 252 of this title. An
      incumbent local exchange carrier shall provide such unbundled
      network elements in a manner that allows requesting carriers to
      combine such elements in order to provide such telecommunications
      service.
      (4) Resale
        The duty - 
          (A) to offer for resale at wholesale rates any
        telecommunications service that the carrier provides at retail
        to subscribers who are not telecommunications carriers; and
          (B) not to prohibit, and not to impose unreasonable or
        discriminatory conditions or limitations on, the resale of such
        telecommunications service, except that a State commission may,
        consistent with regulations prescribed by the Commission under
        this section, prohibit a reseller that obtains at wholesale
        rates a telecommunications service that is available at retail
        only to a category of subscribers from offering such service to
        a different category of subscribers.
      (5) Notice of changes
        The duty to provide reasonable public notice of changes in the
      information necessary for the transmission and routing of
      services using that local exchange carrier's facilities or
      networks, as well as of any other changes that would affect the
      interoperability of those facilities and networks.
      (6) Collocation
        The duty to provide, on rates, terms, and conditions that are
      just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, for physical collocation
      of equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled
      network elements at the premises of the local exchange carrier,
      except that the carrier may provide for virtual collocation if
      the local exchange carrier demonstrates to the State commission
      that physical collocation is not practical for technical reasons
      or because of space limitations.
    (d) Implementation
      (1) In general
        Within 6 months after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall
      complete all actions necessary to establish regulations to
      implement the requirements of this section.
      (2) Access standards
        In determining what network elements should be made available
      for purposes of subsection (c)(3) of this section, the Commission
      shall consider, at a minimum, whether - 
          (A) access to such network elements as are proprietary in
        nature is necessary; and
          (B) the failure to provide access to such network elements
        would impair the ability of the telecommunications carrier
        seeking access to provide the services that it seeks to offer.
      (3) Preservation of State access regulations
        In prescribing and enforcing regulations to implement the
      requirements of this section, the Commission shall not preclude
      the enforcement of any regulation, order, or policy of a State
      commission that - 
          (A) establishes access and interconnection obligations of
        local exchange carriers;
          (B) is consistent with the requirements of this section; and
          (C) does not substantially prevent implementation of the
        requirements of this section and the purposes of this part.
    (e) Numbering administration
      (1) Commission authority and jurisdiction
        The Commission shall create or designate one or more impartial
      entities to administer telecommunications numbering and to make
      such numbers available on an equitable basis. The Commission
      shall have exclusive jurisdiction over those portions of the
      North American Numbering Plan that pertain to the United States.
      Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Commission from
      delegating to State commissions or other entities all or any
      portion of such jurisdiction.
      (2) Costs
        The cost of establishing telecommunications numbering
      administration arrangements and number portability shall be borne
      by all telecommunications carriers on a competitively neutral
      basis as determined by the Commission.
      (3) Universal emergency telephone number
        The Commission and any agency or entity to which the Commission
      has delegated authority under this subsection shall designate 9-1-
      1 as the universal emergency telephone number within the United
      States for reporting an emergency to appropriate authorities and
      requesting assistance. The designation shall apply to both
      wireline and wireless telephone service. In making the
      designation, the Commission (and any such agency or entity) shall
      provide appropriate transition periods for areas in which 9-1-1
      is not in use as an emergency telephone number on October 26,
      1999.
    (f) Exemptions, suspensions, and modifications
      (1) Exemption for certain rural telephone companies
        (A) Exemption
          Subsection (c) of this section shall not apply to a rural
        telephone company until (i) such company has received a bona
        fide request for interconnection, services, or network
        elements, and (ii) the State commission determines (under
        subparagraph (B)) that such request is not unduly economically
        burdensome, is technically feasible, and is consistent with
        section 254 of this title (other than subsections (b)(7) and
        (c)(1)(D) thereof).
        (B) State termination of exemption and implementation schedule
          The party making a bona fide request of a rural telephone
        company for interconnection, services, or network elements
        shall submit a notice of its request to the State commission.
        The State commission shall conduct an inquiry for the purpose
        of determining whether to terminate the exemption under
        subparagraph (A). Within 120 days after the State commission
        receives notice of the request, the State commission shall
        terminate the exemption if the request is not unduly
        economically burdensome, is technically feasible, and is
        consistent with section 254 of this title (other than
        subsections (b)(7) and (c)(1)(D) thereof). Upon termination of
        the exemption, a State commission shall establish an
        implementation schedule for compliance with the request that is
        consistent in time and manner with Commission regulations.
        (C) Limitation on exemption
          The exemption provided by this paragraph shall not apply with
        respect to a request under subsection (c) of this section from
        a cable operator providing video programming, and seeking to
        provide any telecommunications service, in the area in which
        the rural telephone company provides video programming. The
        limitation contained in this subparagraph shall not apply to a
        rural telephone company that is providing video programming on
        February 8, 1996.
      (2) Suspensions and modifications for rural carriers
        A local exchange carrier with fewer than 2 percent of the
      Nation's subscriber lines installed in the aggregate nationwide
      may petition a State commission for a suspension or modification
      of the application of a requirement or requirements of subsection
      (b) or (c) of this section to telephone exchange service
      facilities specified in such petition. The State commission shall
      grant such petition to the extent that, and for such duration as,
      the State commission determines that such suspension or
      modification - 
          (A) is necessary - 
            (i) to avoid a significant adverse economic impact on users
          of telecommunications services generally;
            (ii) to avoid imposing a requirement that is unduly
          economically burdensome; or
            (iii) to avoid imposing a requirement that is technically
          infeasible; and

          (B) is consistent with the public interest, convenience, and
        necessity.

      The State commission shall act upon any petition filed under this
      paragraph within 180 days after receiving such petition. Pending
      such action, the State commission may suspend enforcement of the
      requirement or requirements to which the petition applies with
      respect to the petitioning carrier or carriers.
    (g) Continued enforcement of exchange access and interconnection
      requirements
      On and after February 8, 1996, each local exchange carrier, to
    the extent that it provides wireline services, shall provide
    exchange access, information access, and exchange services for such
    access to interexchange carriers and information service providers
    in accordance with the same equal access and nondiscriminatory
    interconnection restrictions and obligations (including receipt of
    compensation) that apply to such carrier on the date immediately
    preceding February 8, 1996, under any court order, consent decree,
    or regulation, order, or policy of the Commission, until such
    restrictions and obligations are explicitly superseded by
    regulations prescribed by the Commission after February 8, 1996.
    During the period beginning on February 8, 1996, and until such
    restrictions and obligations are so superseded, such restrictions
    and obligations shall be enforceable in the same manner as
    regulations of the Commission.
    (h) "Incumbent local exchange carrier" defined
      (1) Definition
        For purposes of this section, the term "incumbent local
      exchange carrier" means, with respect to an area, the local
      exchange carrier that - 
          (A) on February 8, 1996, provided telephone exchange service
        in such area; and
          (B)(i) on February 8, 1996, was deemed to be a member of the
        exchange carrier association pursuant to section 69.601(b) of
        the Commission's regulations (47 C.F.R. 69.601(b)); or
          (ii) is a person or entity that, on or after February 8,
        1996, became a successor or assign of a member described in
        clause (i).
      (2) Treatment of comparable carriers as incumbents
        The Commission may, by rule, provide for the treatment of a
      local exchange carrier (or class or category thereof) as an
      incumbent local exchange carrier for purposes of this section if -
       
          (A) such carrier occupies a position in the market for
        telephone exchange service within an area that is comparable to
        the position occupied by a carrier described in paragraph (1);
          (B) such carrier has substantially replaced an incumbent
        local exchange carrier described in paragraph (1); and
          (C) such treatment is consistent with the public interest,
        convenience, and necessity and the purposes of this section.
    (i) Savings provision
      Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or otherwise
    affect the Commission's authority under section 201 of this title.

    Sec. 252. Procedures for negotiation, arbitration, and approval of
      agreements

-STATUTE-
    (a) Agreements arrived at through negotiation
      (1) Voluntary negotiations
        Upon receiving a request for interconnection, services, or
      network elements pursuant to section 251 of this title, an
      incumbent local exchange carrier may negotiate and enter into a
      binding agreement with the requesting telecommunications carrier
      or carriers without regard to the standards set forth in
      subsections (b) and (c) of section 251 of this title. The
      agreement shall include a detailed schedule of itemized charges
      for interconnection and each service or network element included
      in the agreement. The agreement, including any interconnection
      agreement negotiated before February 8, 1996, shall be submitted
      to the State commission under subsection (e) of this section.
      (2) Mediation
        Any party negotiating an agreement under this section may, at
      any point in the negotiation, ask a State commission to
      participate in the negotiation and to mediate any differences
      arising in the course of the negotiation.
    (b) Agreements arrived at through compulsory arbitration
      (1) Arbitration
        During the period from the 135th to the 160th day (inclusive)
      after the date on which an incumbent local exchange carrier
      receives a request for negotiation under this section, the
      carrier or any other party to the negotiation may petition a
      State commission to arbitrate any open issues.
      (2) Duty of petitioner
        (A) A party that petitions a State commission under paragraph
      (1) shall, at the same time as it submits the petition, provide
      the State commission all relevant documentation concerning - 
          (i) the unresolved issues;
          (ii) the position of each of the parties with respect to
        those issues; and
          (iii) any other issue discussed and resolved by the parties.

        (B) A party petitioning a State commission under paragraph (1)
      shall provide a copy of the petition and any documentation to the
      other party or parties not later than the day on which the State
      commission receives the petition.
      (3) Opportunity to respond
        A non-petitioning party to a negotiation under this section may
      respond to the other party's petition and provide such additional
      information as it wishes within 25 days after the State
      commission receives the petition.
      (4) Action by State commission
        (A) The State commission shall limit its consideration of any
      petition under paragraph (1) (and any response thereto) to the
      issues set forth in the petition and in the response, if any,
      filed under paragraph (3).
        (B) The State commission may require the petitioning party and
      the responding party to provide such information as may be
      necessary for the State commission to reach a decision on the
      unresolved issues. If any party refuses or fails unreasonably to
      respond on a timely basis to any reasonable request from the
      State commission, then the State commission may proceed on the
      basis of the best information available to it from whatever
      source derived.
        (C) The State commission shall resolve each issue set forth in
      the petition and the response, if any, by imposing appropriate
      conditions as required to implement subsection (c) of this
      section upon the parties to the agreement, and shall conclude the
      resolution of any unresolved issues not later than 9 months after
      the date on which the local exchange carrier received the request
      under this section.
      (5) Refusal to negotiate
        The refusal of any other party to the negotiation to
      participate further in the negotiations, to cooperate with the
      State commission in carrying out its function as an arbitrator,
      or to continue to negotiate in good faith in the presence, or
      with the assistance, of the State commission shall be considered
      a failure to negotiate in good faith.
    (c) Standards for arbitration
      In resolving by arbitration under subsection (b) of this section
    any open issues and imposing conditions upon the parties to the
    agreement, a State commission shall - 
        (1) ensure that such resolution and conditions meet the
      requirements of section 251 of this title, including the
      regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section 251
      of this title;
        (2) establish any rates for interconnection, services, or
      network elements according to subsection (d) of this section; and
        (3) provide a schedule for implementation of the terms and
      conditions by the parties to the agreement.
    (d) Pricing standards
      (1) Interconnection and network element charges
        Determinations by a State commission of the just and reasonable
      rate for the interconnection of facilities and equipment for
      purposes of subsection (c)(2) of section 251 of this title, and
      the just and reasonable rate for network elements for purposes of
      subsection (c)(3) of such section - 
          (A) shall be - 
            (i) based on the cost (determined without reference to a
          rate-of-return or other rate-based proceeding) of providing
          the interconnection or network element (whichever is
          applicable), and
            (ii) nondiscriminatory, and

          (B) may include a reasonable profit.
      (2) Charges for transport and termination of traffic
        (A) In general
          For the purposes of compliance by an incumbent local exchange
        carrier with section 251(b)(5) of this title, a State
        commission shall not consider the terms and conditions for
        reciprocal compensation to be just and reasonable unless - 
            (i) such terms and conditions provide for the mutual and
          reciprocal recovery by each carrier of costs associated with
          the transport and termination on each carrier's network
          facilities of calls that originate on the network facilities
          of the other carrier; and
            (ii) such terms and conditions determine such costs on the
          basis of a reasonable approximation of the additional costs
          of terminating such calls.
        (B) Rules of construction
          This paragraph shall not be construed - 
            (i) to preclude arrangements that afford the mutual
          recovery of costs through the offsetting of reciprocal
          obligations, including arrangements that waive mutual
          recovery (such as bill-and-keep arrangements); or
            (ii) to authorize the Commission or any State commission to
          engage in any rate regulation proceeding to establish with
          particularity the additional costs of transporting or
          terminating calls, or to require carriers to maintain records
          with respect to the additional costs of such calls.
      (3) Wholesale prices for telecommunications services
        For the purposes of section 251(c)(4) of this title, a State
      commission shall determine wholesale rates on the basis of retail
      rates charged to subscribers for the telecommunications service
      requested, excluding the portion thereof attributable to any
      marketing, billing, collection, and other costs that will be
      avoided by the local exchange carrier.
    (e) Approval by State commission
      (1) Approval required
        Any interconnection agreement adopted by negotiation or
      arbitration shall be submitted for approval to the State
      commission. A State commission to which an agreement is submitted
      shall approve or reject the agreement, with written findings as
      to any deficiencies.
      (2) Grounds for rejection
        The State commission may only reject - 
          (A) an agreement (or any portion thereof) adopted by
        negotiation under subsection (a) of this section if it finds
        that - 
            (i) the agreement (or portion thereof) discriminates
          against a telecommunications carrier not a party to the
          agreement; or
            (ii) the implementation of such agreement or portion is not
          consistent with the public interest, convenience, and
          necessity; or

          (B) an agreement (or any portion thereof) adopted by
        arbitration under subsection (b) of this section if it finds
        that the agreement does not meet the requirements of section
        251 of this title, including the regulations prescribed by the
        Commission pursuant to section 251 of this title, or the
        standards set forth in subsection (d) of this section.
      (3) Preservation of authority
        Notwithstanding paragraph (2), but subject to section 253 of
      this title, nothing in this section shall prohibit a State
      commission from establishing or enforcing other requirements of
      State law in its review of an agreement, including requiring
      compliance with intrastate telecommunications service quality
      standards or requirements.
      (4) Schedule for decision
        If the State commission does not act to approve or reject the
      agreement within 90 days after submission by the parties of an
      agreement adopted by negotiation under subsection (a) of this
      section, or within 30 days after submission by the parties of an
      agreement adopted by arbitration under subsection (b) of this
      section, the agreement shall be deemed approved. No State court
      shall have jurisdiction to review the action of a State
      commission in approving or rejecting an agreement under this
      section.
      (5) Commission to act if State will not act
        If a State commission fails to act to carry out its
      responsibility under this section in any proceeding or other
      matter under this section, then the Commission shall issue an
      order preempting the State commission's jurisdiction of that
      proceeding or matter within 90 days after being notified (or
      taking notice) of such failure, and shall assume the
      responsibility of the State commission under this section with
      respect to the proceeding or matter and act for the State
      commission.
      (6) Review of State commission actions
        In a case in which a State fails to act as described in
      paragraph (5), the proceeding by the Commission under such
      paragraph and any judicial review of the Commission's actions
      shall be the exclusive remedies for a State commission's failure
      to act. In any case in which a State commission makes a
      determination under this section, any party aggrieved by such
      determination may bring an action in an appropriate Federal
      district court to determine whether the agreement or statement
      meets the requirements of section 251 of this title and this
      section.
    (f) Statements of generally available terms
      (1) In general
        A Bell operating company may prepare and file with a State
      commission a statement of the terms and conditions that such
      company generally offers within that State to comply with the
      requirements of section 251 of this title and the regulations
      thereunder and the standards applicable under this section.
      (2) State commission review
        A State commission may not approve such statement unless such
      statement complies with subsection (d) of this section and
      section 251 of this title and the regulations thereunder. Except
      as provided in section 253 of this title, nothing in this section
      shall prohibit a State commission from establishing or enforcing
      other requirements of State law in its review of such statement,
      including requiring compliance with intrastate telecommunications
      service quality standards or requirements.
      (3) Schedule for review
        The State commission to which a statement is submitted shall,
      not later than 60 days after the date of such submission - 
          (A) complete the review of such statement under paragraph (2)
        (including any reconsideration thereof), unless the submitting
        carrier agrees to an extension of the period for such review;
        or
          (B) permit such statement to take effect.
      (4) Authority to continue review
        Paragraph (3) shall not preclude the State commission from
      continuing to review a statement that has been permitted to take
      effect under subparagraph (B) of such paragraph or from approving
      or disapproving such statement under paragraph (2).
      (5) Duty to negotiate not affected
        The submission or approval of a statement under this subsection
      shall not relieve a Bell operating company of its duty to
      negotiate the terms and conditions of an agreement under section
      251 of this title.
    (g) Consolidation of State proceedings
      Where not inconsistent with the requirements of this chapter, a
    State commission may, to the extent practical, consolidate
    proceedings under sections 214(e), 251(f), 253 of this title, and
    this section in order to reduce administrative burdens on
    telecommunications carriers, other parties to the proceedings, and
    the State commission in carrying out its responsibilities under
    this chapter.
    (h) Filing required
      A State commission shall make a copy of each agreement approved
    under subsection (e) of this section and each statement approved
    under subsection (f) of this section available for public
    inspection and copying within 10 days after the agreement or
    statement is approved. The State commission may charge a reasonable
    and nondiscriminatory fee to the parties to the agreement or to the
    party filing the statement to cover the costs of approving and
    filing such agreement or statement.
    (i) Availability to other telecommunications carriers
      A local exchange carrier shall make available any
    interconnection, service, or network element provided under an
    agreement approved under this section to which it is a party to any
    other requesting telecommunications carrier upon the same terms and
    conditions as those provided in the agreement.
    (j) "Incumbent local exchange carrier" defined
      For purposes of this section, the term "incumbent local exchange
    carrier" has the meaning provided in section 251(h) of this title.

    Sec. 253. Removal of barriers to entry

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      No State or local statute or regulation, or other State or local
    legal requirement, may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting
    the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate
    telecommunications service.
    (b) State regulatory authority
      Nothing in this section shall affect the ability of a State to
    impose, on a competitively neutral basis and consistent with
    section 254 of this title, requirements necessary to preserve and
    advance universal service, protect the public safety and welfare,
    ensure the continued quality of telecommunications services, and
    safeguard the rights of consumers.
    (c) State and local government authority
      Nothing in this section affects the authority of a State or local
    government to manage the public rights-of-way or to require fair
    and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers, on a
    competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis, for use of
    public rights-of-way on a nondiscriminatory basis, if the
    compensation required is publicly disclosed by such government.
    (d) Preemption
      If, after notice and an opportunity for public comment, the
    Commission determines that a State or local government has
    permitted or imposed any statute, regulation, or legal requirement
    that violates subsection (a) or (b) of this section, the Commission
    shall preempt the enforcement of such statute, regulation, or legal
    requirement to the extent necessary to correct such violation or
    inconsistency.
    (e) Commercial mobile service providers
      Nothing in this section shall affect the application of section
    332(c)(3) of this title to commercial mobile service providers.
    (f) Rural markets
      It shall not be a violation of this section for a State to
    require a telecommunications carrier that seeks to provide
    telephone exchange service or exchange access in a service area
    served by a rural telephone company to meet the requirements in
    section 214(e)(1) of this title for designation as an eligible
    telecommunications carrier for that area before being permitted to
    provide such service. This subsection shall not apply - 
        (1) to a service area served by a rural telephone company that
      has obtained an exemption, suspension, or modification of section
      251(c)(4) of this title that effectively prevents a competitor
      from meeting the requirements of section 214(e)(1) of this title;
      and
        (2) to a provider of commercial mobile services.

    Sec. 254. Universal service

-STATUTE-
    (a) Procedures to review universal service requirements
      (1) Federal-State Joint Board on universal service
        Within one month after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall
      institute and refer to a Federal-State Joint Board under section
      410(c) of this title a proceeding to recommend changes to any of
      its regulations in order to implement sections 214(e) of this
      title and this section, including the definition of the services
      that are supported by Federal universal service support
      mechanisms and a specific timetable for completion of such
      recommendations. In addition to the members of the Joint Board
      required under section 410(c) of this title, one member of such
      Joint Board shall be a State-appointed utility consumer advocate
      nominated by a national organization of State utility consumer
      advocates. The Joint Board shall, after notice and opportunity
      for public comment, make its recommendations to the Commission 9
      months after February 8, 1996.
      (2) Commission action
        The Commission shall initiate a single proceeding to implement
      the recommendations from the Joint Board required by paragraph
      (1) and shall complete such proceeding within 15 months after
      February 8, 1996. The rules established by such proceeding shall
      include a definition of the services that are supported by
      Federal universal service support mechanisms and a specific
      timetable for implementation. Thereafter, the Commission shall
      complete any proceeding to implement subsequent recommendations
      from any Joint Board on universal service within one year after
      receiving such recommendations.
    (b) Universal service principles
      The Joint Board and the Commission shall base policies for the
    preservation and advancement of universal service on the following
    principles:
      (1) Quality and rates
        Quality services should be available at just, reasonable, and
      affordable rates.
      (2) Access to advanced services
        Access to advanced telecommunications and information services
      should be provided in all regions of the Nation.
      (3) Access in rural and high cost areas
        Consumers in all regions of the Nation, including low-income
      consumers and those in rural, insular, and high cost areas,
      should have access to telecommunications and information
      services, including interexchange services and advanced
      telecommunications and information services, that are reasonably
      comparable to those services provided in urban areas and that are
      available at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates
      charged for similar services in urban areas.
      (4) Equitable and nondiscriminatory contributions
        All providers of telecommunications services should make an
      equitable and nondiscriminatory contribution to the preservation
      and advancement of universal service.
      (5) Specific and predictable support mechanisms
        There should be specific, predictable and sufficient Federal
      and State mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.
      (6) Access to advanced telecommunications services for schools,
        health care, and libraries
        Elementary and secondary schools and classrooms, health care
      providers, and libraries should have access to advanced
      telecommunications services as described in subsection (h) of
      this section.
      (7) Additional principles
        Such other principles as the Joint Board and the Commission
      determine are necessary and appropriate for the protection of the
      public interest, convenience, and necessity and are consistent
      with this chapter.
    (c) Definition
      (1) In general
        Universal service is an evolving level of telecommunications
      services that the Commission shall establish periodically under
      this section, taking into account advances in telecommunications
      and information technologies and services. The Joint Board in
      recommending, and the Commission in establishing, the definition
      of the services that are supported by Federal universal service
      support mechanisms shall consider the extent to which such
      telecommunications services - 
          (A) are essential to education, public health, or public
        safety;
          (B) have, through the operation of market choices by
        customers, been subscribed to by a substantial majority of
        residential customers;
          (C) are being deployed in public telecommunications networks
        by telecommunications carriers; and
          (D) are consistent with the public interest, convenience, and
        necessity.
      (2) Alterations and modifications
        The Joint Board may, from time to time, recommend to the
      Commission modifications in the definition of the services that
      are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms.
      (3) Special services
        In addition to the services included in the definition of
      universal service under paragraph (1), the Commission may
      designate additional services for such support mechanisms for
      schools, libraries, and health care providers for the purposes of
      subsection (h) of this section.
    (d) Telecommunications carrier contribution
      Every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate
    telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and
    nondiscriminatory basis, to the specific, predictable, and
    sufficient mechanisms established by the Commission to preserve and
    advance universal service. The Commission may exempt a carrier or
    class of carriers from this requirement if the carrier's
    telecommunications activities are limited to such an extent that
    the level of such carrier's contribution to the preservation and
    advancement of universal service would be de minimis. Any other
    provider of interstate telecommunications may be required to
    contribute to the preservation and advancement of universal service
    if the public interest so requires.
    (e) Universal service support
      After the date on which Commission regulations implementing this
    section take effect, only an eligible telecommunications carrier
    designated under section 214(e) of this title shall be eligible to
    receive specific Federal universal service support. A carrier that
    receives such support shall use that support only for the
    provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities and services
    for which the support is intended. Any such support should be
    explicit and sufficient to achieve the purposes of this section.
    (f) State authority
      A State may adopt regulations not inconsistent with the
    Commission's rules to preserve and advance universal service. Every
    telecommunications carrier that provides intrastate
    telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and
    nondiscriminatory basis, in a manner determined by the State to the
    preservation and advancement of universal service in that State. A
    State may adopt regulations to provide for additional definitions
    and standards to preserve and advance universal service within that
    State only to the extent that such regulations adopt additional
    specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms to support such
    definitions or standards that do not rely on or burden Federal
    universal service support mechanisms.
    (g) Interexchange and interstate services
      Within 6 months after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall
    adopt rules to require that the rates charged by providers of
    interexchange telecommunications services to subscribers in rural
    and high cost areas shall be no higher than the rates charged by
    each such provider to its subscribers in urban areas. Such rules
    shall also require that a provider of interstate interexchange
    telecommunications services shall provide such services to its
    subscribers in each State at rates no higher than the rates charged
    to its subscribers in any other State.
    (h) Telecommunications services for certain providers
      (1) In general
        (A) Health care providers for rural areas
          A telecommunications carrier shall, upon receiving a bona
        fide request, provide telecommunications services which are
        necessary for the provision of health care services in a State,
        including instruction relating to such services, to any public
        or nonprofit health care provider that serves persons who
        reside in rural areas in that State at rates that are
        reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in
        urban areas in that State. A telecommunications carrier
        providing service under this paragraph shall be entitled to
        have an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the
        rates for services provided to health care providers for rural
        areas in a State and the rates for similar services provided to
        other customers in comparable rural areas in that State treated
        as a service obligation as a part of its obligation to
        participate in the mechanisms to preserve and advance universal
        service.
        (B) Educational providers and libraries
          All telecommunications carriers serving a geographic area
        shall, upon a bona fide request for any of its services that
        are within the definition of universal service under subsection
        (c)(3) of this section, provide such services to elementary
        schools, secondary schools, and libraries for educational
        purposes at rates less than the amounts charged for similar
        services to other parties. The discount shall be an amount that
        the Commission, with respect to interstate services, and the
        States, with respect to intrastate services, determine is
        appropriate and necessary to ensure affordable access to and
        use of such services by such entities. A telecommunications
        carrier providing service under this paragraph shall - 
            (i) have an amount equal to the amount of the discount
          treated as an offset to its obligation to contribute to the
          mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service, or
            (ii) notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (e) of
          this section, receive reimbursement utilizing the support
          mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.
      (2) Advanced services
        The Commission shall establish competitively neutral rules - 
          (A) to enhance, to the extent technically feasible and
        economically reasonable, access to advanced telecommunications
        and information services for all public and nonprofit
        elementary and secondary school classrooms, health care
        providers, and libraries; and
          (B) to define the circumstances under which a
        telecommunications carrier may be required to connect its
        network to such public institutional telecommunications users.
      (3) Terms and conditions
        Telecommunications services and network capacity provided to a
      public institutional telecommunications user under this
      subsection may not be sold, resold, or otherwise transferred by
      such user in consideration for money or any other thing of value.
      (4) Eligibility of users
        No entity listed in this subsection shall be entitled to
      preferential rates or treatment as required by this subsection,
      if such entity operates as a for-profit business, is a school
      described in paragraph (7)(A) with an endowment of more than
      $50,000,000, or is a library or library consortium not eligible
      for assistance from a State library administrative agency under
      the Library Services and Technology Act [20 U.S.C. 9121 et seq.].
      (5) Requirements for certain schools with computers having
        Internet access
        (A) Internet safety
          (i) In general
            Except as provided in clause (ii), an elementary or
          secondary school having computers with Internet access may
          not receive services at discount rates under paragraph (1)(B)
          unless the school, school board, local educational agency, or
          other authority with responsibility for administration of the
          school - 
              (I) submits to the Commission the certifications
            described in subparagraphs (B) and (C);
              (II) submits to the Commission a certification that an
            Internet safety policy has been adopted and implemented for
            the school under subsection (l) of this section; and
              (III) ensures the use of such computers in accordance
            with the certifications.
          (ii) Applicability
            The prohibition in clause (i) shall not apply with respect
          to a school that receives services at discount rates under
          paragraph (1)(B) only for purposes other than the provision
          of Internet access, Internet service, or internal
          connections.
          (iii) Public notice; hearing
            An elementary or secondary school described in clause (i),
          or the school board, local educational agency, or other
          authority with responsibility for administration of the
          school, shall provide reasonable public notice and hold at
          least one public hearing or meeting to address the proposed
          Internet safety policy. In the case of an elementary or
          secondary school other than an elementary or secondary school
          as defined in section 8801 (!1) of title 20, the notice and
          hearing required by this clause may be limited to those
          members of the public with a relationship to the school.

        (B) Certification with respect to minors
          A certification under this subparagraph is a certification
        that the school, school board, local educational agency, or

          that includes monitoring the online activities of minors and
          the operation of a technology protection measure with respect
          to any of its computers with Internet access that protects
          against access through such computers to visual depictions

          the operation of a technology protection measure with respect
          to any of its computers with Internet access that protects
          against access through such computers to visual depictions
          that are - 
              (I) obscene; or
              (II) child pornography; and

            (ii) is enforcing the operation of such technology
          protection measure during any use of such computers.
        (D) Disabling during adult use
          An administrator, supervisor, or other person authorized by
        the certifying authority under subparagraph (A)(i) may disable
        the technology protection measure concerned, during use by an
        adult, to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful
        purpose.
        (E) Timing of implementation

                (bb) for the second program year after the effective
              date of this subsection in which it is applying for funds
              under this subsection, shall certify that it is in
              compliance with subparagraphs (B) and (C).
            Any school that is unable to certify compliance with such

            (III) Waivers
              Any school subject to subclause (II) that cannot come
            into compliance with subparagraphs (B) and (C) in such
            second year program may seek a waiver of subclause (II)(bb)
            if State or local procurement rules or regulations or

            (I) Failure to submit
              A school that has failed to submit a certification under
            clause (i) may remedy the failure by submitting the
            certification to which the failure relates. Upon submittal
            of such certification, the school shall be eligible for
            services at discount rates under this subsection.

            clause (i) may remedy the failure by submitting the
            certification to which the failure relates. Upon submittal
            of such certification, the library shall be eligible for
            services at discount rates under this subsection.
            (II) Failure to comply

    any qualifying carrier such public switched network infrastructure,
    technology, information, and telecommunications facilities and
    functions as may be requested by such qualifying carrier for the
    purpose of enabling such qualifying carrier to provide
    telecommunications services, or to provide access to information
    services, in the service area in which such qualifying carrier has
    requested and obtained designation as an eligible
    telecommunications carrier under section 214(e) of this title.
    (b) Terms and conditions of regulations
      The regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to this
    section shall -

      applies to take any action that is economically unreasonable or
      that is contrary to the public interest;
        (2) permit, but shall not require, the joint ownership or
      operation of public switched network infrastructure and services
      by or among such local exchange carrier and a qualifying carrier;
        (3) ensure that such local exchange carrier will not be treated
      by the Commission or any State as a common carrier for hire or as
      offering common carrier services with respect to any
      infrastructure, technology, information, facilities, or functions
      made available to a qualifying carrier in accordance with
      regulations issued pursuant to this section;
        (4) ensure that such local exchange carrier makes such
      infrastructure, technology, information, facilities, or functions
      available to a qualifying carrier on just and reasonable terms
      and conditions that permit such qualifying carrier to fully
      benefit from the economies of scale and scope of such local
      exchange carrier, as determined in accordance with guidelines
      prescribed by the Commission in regulations issued pursuant to
      this section;
        (5) establish conditions that promote cooperation between local
      exchange carriers to which this section applies and qualifying
      carriers;
        (6) not require a local exchange carrier to which this section
      applies to engage in any infrastructure sharing agreement for any
      services or access which are to be provided or offered to
      consumers by the qualifying carrier in such local exchange
      carrier's telephone exchange area; and
        (7) require that such local exchange carrier file with the
      Commission or State for public inspection, any tariffs,
      contracts, or other arrangements showing the rates, terms, and
      conditions under which such carrier is making available public
      switched network infrastructure and functions under this section.
    (c) Information concerning deployment of new services and equipment
      A local exchange carrier to which this section applies that has
    entered into an infrastructure sharing agreement under this section
    shall provide to each party to such agreement timely information on
    the planned deployment of telecommunications services and
    equipment, including any software or upgrades of software integral
    to the use or operation of such telecommunications equipment.
    (d) "Qualifying carrier" defined
      For purposes of this section, the term "qualifying carrier" means
    a telecommunications carrier that - 
        (1) lacks economies of scale or scope, as determined in
      accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant
      to this section; and
        (2) offers telephone exchange service, exchange access, and any
      other service that is included in universal service, to all
      consumers without preference throughout the service area for
      which such carrier has been designated as an eligible
      telecommunications carrier under section 214(e) of this title.

-STATUTE-
    (a) General limitation
      Neither a Bell operating company, nor any affiliate of a Bell
    operating company, may provide interLATA services except as
    provided in this section.
    (b) InterLATA services to which this section applies
      (1) In-region services
        A Bell operating company, or any affiliate of that Bell
      operating company, may provide interLATA services originating in
      any of its in-region States (as defined in subsection (i) of this
      section) if the Commission approves the application of such
      company for such State under subsection (d)(3) of this section.
      (2) Out-of-region services
        A Bell operating company, or any affiliate of that Bell
      operating company, may provide interLATA services originating
      outside its in-region States after February 8, 1996, subject to
      subsection (j) of this section.
      (3) Incidental interLATA services
        A Bell operating company, or any affiliate of a Bell operating
      company, may provide incidental interLATA services (as defined in
      subsection (g) of this section) originating in any State after
      February 8, 1996.
      (4) Termination
        Nothing in this section prohibits a Bell operating company or
      any of its affiliates from providing termination for interLATA
      services, subject to subsection (j) of this section.
    (c) Requirements for providing certain in-region interLATA services
      (1) Agreement or statement
        A Bell operating company meets the requirements of this
      paragraph if it meets the requirements of subparagraph (A) or
      subparagraph (B) of this paragraph for each State for which the
      authorization is sought.
        (A) Presence of a facilities-based competitor
          A Bell operating company meets the requirements of this
        subparagraph if it has entered into one or more binding
        agreements that have been approved under section 252 of this
        title specifying the terms and conditions under which the Bell
        operating company is providing access and interconnection to
        its network facilities for the network facilities of one or
        more unaffiliated competing providers of telephone exchange
        service (as defined in section 153(47)(A) of this title, but
        excluding exchange access) to residential and business
        subscribers. For the purpose of this subparagraph, such
        telephone exchange service may be offered by such competing
        providers either exclusively over their own telephone exchange
        service facilities or predominantly over their own telephone
        exchange service facilities in combination with the resale of
        the telecommunications services of another carrier. For the
        purpose of this subparagraph, services provided pursuant to
        subpart K of part 22 of the Commission's regulations (47 C.F.R.
        22.901 et seq.) shall not be considered to be telephone
        exchange services.
        (B) Failure to request access
          A Bell operating company meets the requirements of this
        subparagraph if, after 10 months after February 8, 1996, no
        such provider has requested the access and interconnection
        described in subparagraph (A) before the date which is 3 months
        before the date the company makes its application under
        subsection (d)(1) of this section, and a statement of the terms
        and conditions that the company generally offers to provide
        such access and interconnection has been approved or permitted
        to take effect by the State commission under section 252(f) of
        this title. For purposes of this subparagraph, a Bell operating
        company shall be considered not to have received any request
        for access and interconnection if the State commission of such
        State certifies that the only provider or providers making such
        a request have (i) failed to negotiate in good faith as
        required by section 252 of this title, or (ii) violated the
        terms of an agreement approved under section 252 of this title
        by the provider's failure to comply, within a reasonable period
        of time, with the implementation schedule contained in such
        agreement.
      (2) Specific interconnection requirements
        (A) Agreement required
          A Bell operating company meets the requirements of this
        paragraph if, within the State for which the authorization is
        sought - 
            (i)(I) such company is providing access and interconnection
          pursuant to one or more agreements described in paragraph
          (1)(A), or
            (II) such company is generally offering access and
          interconnection pursuant to a statement described in
          paragraph (1)(B), and
            (ii) such access and interconnection meets the requirements
          of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.
        (B) Competitive checklist
          Access or interconnection provided or generally offered by a
        Bell operating company to other telecommunications carriers
        meets the requirements of this subparagraph if such access and
        interconnection includes each of the following:
            (i) Interconnection in accordance with the requirements of

    (d) Administrative provisions
      (1) Application to Commission
        On and after February 8, 1996, a Bell operating company or its
      affiliate may apply to the Commission for authorization to
      provide interLATA services originating in any in-region State.
      The application shall identify each State for which the
      authorization is sought.
      (2) Consultation
        (A) Consultation with the Attorney General
          The Commission shall notify the Attorney General promptly of
        any application under paragraph (1). Before making any
        determination under this subsection, the Commission shall
        consult with the Attorney General, and if the Attorney General
        submits any comments in writing, such comments shall be
        included in the record of the Commission's decision. In
        consulting with and submitting comments to the Commission under
        this paragraph, the Attorney General shall provide to the
        Commission an evaluation of the application using any standard
        the Attorney General considers appropriate. The Commission
        shall give substantial weight to the Attorney General's
        evaluation, but such evaluation shall not have any preclusive
        effect on any Commission decision under paragraph (3).
        (B) Consultation with State commissions
          Before making any determination under this subsection, the
        Commission shall consult with the State commission of any State
        that is the subject of the application in order to verify the
        compliance of the Bell operating company with the requirements
        of subsection (c) of this section.
      (3) Determination
        Not later than 90 days after receiving an application under
      paragraph (1), the Commission shall issue a written determination
      approving or denying the authorization requested in the
      application for each State. The Commission shall not approve the
      authorization requested in an application submitted under
      paragraph (1) unless it finds that - 
          (A) the petitioning Bell operating company has met the
        requirements of subsection (c)(1) of this section and - 
            (i) with respect to access and interconnection provided
          pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(A) of this section, has fully
          implemented the competitive checklist in subsection (c)(2)(B)
          of this section; or
            (ii) with respect to access and interconnection generally
          offered pursuant to a statement under subsection (c)(1)(B) of
          this section, such statement offers all of the items included
          in the competitive checklist in subsection (c)(2)(B) of this
          section;

          (B) the requested authorization will be carried out in
        accordance with the requirements of section 272 of this title;
        and
          (C) the requested authorization is consistent with the public
        interest, convenience, and necessity.

      The Commission shall state the basis for its approval or denial
      of the application.
      (4) Limitation on Commission
        The Commission may not, by rule or otherwise, limit or extend
      the terms used in the competitive checklist set forth in
      subsection (c)(2)(B) of this section.
      (5) Publication
        Not later than 10 days after issuing a determination under
      paragraph (3), the Commission shall publish in the Federal
      Register a brief description of the determination.
      (6) Enforcement of conditions
        (A) Commission authority
          If at any time after the approval of an application under
        paragraph (3), the Commission determines that a Bell operating
        company has ceased to meet any of the conditions required for
        such approval, the Commission may, after notice and opportunity
        for a hearing - 
            (i) issue an order to such company to correct the
          deficiency;
            (ii) impose a penalty on such company pursuant to
          subchapter V of this chapter; or
            (iii) suspend or revoke such approval.
        (B) Receipt and review of complaints
          The Commission shall establish procedures for the review of
        complaints concerning failures by Bell operating companies to
        meet conditions required for approval under paragraph (3).
        Unless the parties otherwise agree, the Commission shall act on
        such complaint within 90 days.
    (e) Limitations
      (1) Joint marketing of local and long distance services
        Until a Bell operating company is authorized pursuant to
      subsection (d) of this section to provide interLATA services in
      an in-region State, or until 36 months have passed since February
      8, 1996, whichever is earlier, a telecommunications carrier that
      serves greater than 5 percent of the Nation's presubscribed
      access lines may not jointly market in such State telephone
      exchange service obtained from such company pursuant to section
      251(c)(4) of this title with interLATA services offered by that
      telecommunications carrier.
      (2) IntraLATA toll dialing parity
        (A) Provision required
          A Bell operating company granted authority to provide
        interLATA services under subsection (d) of this section shall
        provide intraLATA toll dialing parity throughout that State
        coincident with its exercise of that authority.
        (B) Limitation
          Except for single-LATA States and States that have issued an
        order by December 19, 1995, requiring a Bell operating company
        to implement intraLATA toll dialing parity, a State may not
        require a Bell operating company to implement intraLATA toll
        dialing parity in that State before a Bell operating company
        has been granted authority under this section to provide
        interLATA services originating in that State or before 3 years
        after February 8, 1996, whichever is earlier. Nothing in this
        subparagraph precludes a State from issuing an order requiring
        intraLATA toll dialing parity in that State prior to either
        such date so long as such order does not take effect until
        after the earlier of either such dates.
    (f) Exception for previously authorized activities
      Neither subsection (a) of this section nor section 273 of this
    title shall prohibit a Bell operating company or affiliate from
    engaging, at any time after February 8, 1996, in any activity to
    the extent authorized by, and subject to the terms and conditions
    contained in, an order entered by the United States District Court
    for the District of Columbia pursuant to section VII or VIII(C) of
    the AT&T Consent Decree if such order was entered on or before
    February 8, 1996, to the extent such order is not reversed or
    vacated on appeal. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to
    limit, or to impose terms or conditions on, an activity in which a
    Bell operating company is otherwise authorized to engage under any
    other provision of this section.
    (g) "Incidental interLATA services" defined
      For purposes of this section, the term "incidental interLATA
    services" means the interLATA provision by a Bell operating company
    or its affiliate - 
        (1)(A) of audio programming, video programming, or other
      programming services to subscribers to such services of such
      company or affiliate;
        (B) of the capability for interaction by such subscribers to
      select or respond to such audio programming, video programming,
      or other programming services;
        (C) to distributors of audio programming or video programming
      that such company or affiliate owns or controls, or is licensed
      by the copyright owner of such programming (or by an assignee of
      such owner) to distribute; or
        (D) of alarm monitoring services;
        (2) of two-way interactive video services or Internet services
      over dedicated facilities to or for elementary and secondary
      schools as defined in section 254(h)(5) (!1) of this title;

        (3) of commercial mobile services in accordance with section
      332(c) of this title and with the regulations prescribed by the
      Commission pursuant to paragraph (8) of such section;
        (4) of a service that permits a customer that is located in one
      LATA to retrieve stored information from, or file information for
      storage in, information storage facilities of such company that
      are located in another LATA;
        (5) of signaling information used in connection with the
      provision of telephone exchange services or exchange access by a
      local exchange carrier; or
        (6) of network control signaling information to, and receipt of
      such signaling information from, common carriers offering
      interLATA services at any location within the area in which such
      Bell operating company provides telephone exchange services or
      exchange access.
    (h) Limitations
      The provisions of subsection (g) of this section are intended to
    be narrowly construed. The interLATA services provided under
    subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of subsection (g)(1) of this section
    are limited to those interLATA transmissions incidental to the
    provision by a Bell operating company or its affiliate of video,
    audio, and other programming services that the company or its
    affiliate is engaged in providing to the public. The Commission
    shall ensure that the provision of services authorized under
    subsection (g) of this section by a Bell operating company or its
    affiliate will not adversely affect telephone exchange service
    ratepayers or competition in any telecommunications market.
    (i) Additional definitions
      As used in this section - 
      (1) In-region State
        The term "in-region State" means a State in which a Bell
      operating company or any of its affiliates was authorized to
      provide wireline telephone exchange service pursuant to the
      reorganization plan approved under the AT&T Consent Decree, as in
      effect on the day before February 8, 1996.
      (2) Audio programming services
        The term "audio programming services" means programming
      provided by, or generally considered to be comparable to
      programming provided by, a radio broadcast station.
      (3) Video programming services; other programming services
        The terms "video programming service" and "other programming
      services" have the same meanings as such terms have under section
      522 of this title.
    (j) Certain service applications treated as in-region service
      applications
      For purposes of this section, a Bell operating company
    application to provide 800 service, private line service, or their
    equivalents that - 
        (1) terminate in an in-region State of that Bell operating
      company, and
        (2) allow the called party to determine the interLATA carrier,

    shall be considered an in-region service subject to the
    requirements of subsection (b)(1) of this section.

      company;
        (2) shall maintain books, records, and accounts in the manner

        (3) shall have separate officers, directors, and employees from
      the Bell operating company of which it is an affiliate;
        (4) may not obtain credit under any arrangement that would

      company of which it is an affiliate on an arm's length basis with
      any such transactions reduced to writing and available for public
      inspection.
    (c) Nondiscrimination safeguards
      In its dealings with its affiliate described in subsection (a) of
    this section, a Bell operating company - 
        (1) may not discriminate between that company or affiliate and
      any other entity in the provision or procurement of goods,
      services, facilities, and information, or in the establishment of
      standards; and
        (2) shall account for all transactions with an affiliate

      accounting principles designated or approved by the Commission.
    (d) Biennial audit
      (1) General requirement
        A company required to operate a separate affiliate under this
      section shall obtain and pay for a joint Federal/State audit
      every 2 years conducted by an independent auditor to determine

      (3) Access to documents
        For purposes of conducting audits and reviews under this

          (A) the independent auditor, the Commission, and the State
        commission shall have access to the financial accounts and
        records of each company and of its affiliates necessary to
        verify transactions conducted with that company that are
        relevant to the specific activities permitted under this
        section and that are necessary for the regulation of rates;
          (B) the Commission and the State commission shall have access
        to the working papers and supporting materials of any auditor
        who performs an audit under this section; and

        procedures to ensure the protection of any proprietary
        information submitted to it under this section.
    (e) Fulfillment of certain requests
      A Bell operating company and an affiliate that is subject to the
    requirements of section 251(c) of this title - 
        (1) shall fulfill any requests from an unaffiliated entity for
      telephone exchange service and exchange access within a period no
      longer than the period in which it provides such telephone
      exchange service and exchange access to itself or to its
      affiliates;
        (2) shall not provide any facilities, services, or information
      concerning its provision of exchange access to the affiliate
      described in subsection (a) of this section unless such
      facilities, services, or information are made available to other
      providers of interLATA services in that market on the same terms
      and conditions;
        (3) shall charge the affiliate described in subsection (a) of
      this section, or impute to itself (if using the access for its
      provision of its own services), an amount for access to its
      telephone exchange service and exchange access that is no less
      than the amount charged to any unaffiliated interexchange
      carriers for such service; and
        (4) may provide any interLATA or intraLATA facilities or
      services to its interLATA affiliate if such services or
      facilities are made available to all carriers at the same rates
      and on the same terms and conditions, and so long as the costs
      are appropriately allocated.
    (f) Sunset
      (1) Manufacturing and long distance
        The provisions of this section (other than subsection (e) of
      this section) shall cease to apply with respect to the
      manufacturing activities or the interLATA telecommunications
      services of a Bell operating company 3 years after the date such
      Bell operating company or any Bell operating company affiliate is
      authorized to provide interLATA telecommunications services under
      section 271(d) of this title, unless the Commission extends such
      3-year period by rule or order.
      (2) InterLATA information services
        The provisions of this section (other than subsection (e) of
      this section) shall cease to apply with respect to the interLATA

      period by rule or order.
      (3) Preservation of existing authority
        Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the

      interest, convenience, and necessity.
    (g) Joint marketing
      (1) Affiliate sales of telephone exchange services
        A Bell operating company affiliate required by this section may
      not market or sell telephone exchange services provided by the

      offering the same or similar service to market and sell its
      telephone exchange services.
      (2) Bell operating company sales of affiliate services
        A Bell operating company may not market or sell interLATA
      service provided by an affiliate required by this section within
      any of its in-region States until such company is authorized to
      provide interLATA services in such State under section 271(d) of
      this title.
      (3) Rule of construction
        The joint marketing and sale of services permitted under this
      subsection shall not be considered to violate the
      nondiscrimination provisions of subsection (c) of this section.

    Sec. 273. Manufacturing by Bell operating companies

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authorization
      A Bell operating company may manufacture and provide
    telecommunications equipment, and manufacture customer premises
    equipment, if the Commission authorizes that Bell operating company
    or any Bell operating company affiliate to provide interLATA
    services under section 271(d) of this title, subject to the
    requirements of this section and the regulations prescribed
    thereunder, except that neither a Bell operating company nor any of
    its affiliates may engage in such manufacturing in conjunction with
    a Bell operating company not so affiliated or any of its
    affiliates.
    (b) Collaboration; research and royalty agreements
      (1) Collaboration
        Subsection (a) of this section shall not prohibit a Bell
      operating company from engaging in close collaboration with any
      manufacturer of customer premises equipment or telecommunications
      equipment during the design and development of hardware,
      software, or combinations thereof related to such equipment.
      (2) Certain research arrangements; royalty agreements
        Subsection (a) of this section shall not prohibit a Bell
      operating company from - 
          (A) engaging in research activities related to manufacturing,
        and
          (B) entering into royalty agreements with manufacturers of
        telecommunications equipment.
    (c) Information requirements
      (1) Information on protocols and technical requirements
        Each Bell operating company shall, in accordance with
      regulations prescribed by the Commission, maintain and file with
      the Commission full and complete information with respect to the
      protocols and technical requirements for connection with and use
      of its telephone exchange service facilities. Each such company
      shall report promptly to the Commission any material changes or
      planned changes to such protocols and requirements, and the
      schedule for implementation of such changes or planned changes.
      (2) Disclosure of information
        A Bell operating company shall not disclose any information
      required to be filed under paragraph (1) unless that information
      has been filed promptly, as required by regulation by the
      Commission.
      (3) Access by competitors to information
        The Commission may prescribe such additional regulations under
      this subsection as may be necessary to ensure that manufacturers
      have access to the information with respect to the protocols and
      technical requirements for connection with and use of telephone
      exchange service facilities that a Bell operating company makes
      available to any manufacturing affiliate or any unaffiliated
      manufacturer.
      (4) Planning information
        Each Bell operating company shall provide, to interconnecting
      carriers providing telephone exchange service, timely information
      on the planned deployment of telecommunications equipment.
    (d) Manufacturing limitations for standard-setting organizations
      (1) Application to Bell Communications Research or manufacturers
        Bell Communications Research, Inc., or any successor entity or
      affiliate - 
          (A) shall not be considered a Bell operating company or a
        successor or assign of a Bell operating company at such time as
        it is no longer an affiliate of any Bell operating company; and
          (B) notwithstanding paragraph (3), shall not engage in
        manufacturing telecommunications equipment or customer premises
        equipment as long as it is an affiliate of more than 1
        otherwise unaffiliated Bell operating company or successor or
        assign of any such company.

      Nothing in this subsection prohibits Bell Communications
      Research, Inc., or any successor entity, from engaging in any
      activity in which it is lawfully engaged on February 8, 1996.
      Nothing provided in this subsection shall render Bell
      Communications Research, Inc., or any successor entity, a common
      carrier under this subchapter. Nothing in this subsection
      restricts any manufacturer from engaging in any activity in which
      it is lawfully engaged on February 8, 1996.
      (2) Proprietary information
        Any entity which establishes standards for telecommunications
      equipment or customer premises equipment, or generic network
      requirements for such equipment, or certifies telecommunications
      equipment or customer premises equipment, shall be prohibited
      from releasing or otherwise using any proprietary information,
      designated as such by its owner, in its possession as a result of
      such activity, for any purpose other than purposes authorized in
      writing by the owner of such information, even after such entity
      ceases to be so engaged.
      (3) Manufacturing safeguards
        (A) Except as prohibited in paragraph (1), and subject to
      paragraph (6), any entity which certifies telecommunications
      equipment or customer premises equipment manufactured by an
      unaffiliated entity shall only manufacture a particular class of
      telecommunications equipment or customer premises equipment for
      which it is undertaking or has undertaken, during the previous 18
      months, certification activity for such class of equipment
      through a separate affiliate.
        (B) Such separate affiliate shall - 
          (i) maintain books, records, and accounts separate from those
        of the entity that certifies such equipment, consistent with
        generally acceptable accounting principles;
          (ii) not engage in any joint manufacturing activities with
        such entity; and
          (iii) have segregated facilities and separate employees with
        such entity.

        (C) Such entity that certifies such equipment shall - 
          (i) not discriminate in favor of its manufacturing affiliate
        in the establishment of standards, generic requirements, or
        product certification;
          (ii) not disclose to the manufacturing affiliate any
        proprietary information that has been received at any time from
        an unaffiliated manufacturer, unless authorized in writing by
        the owner of the information; and
          (iii) not permit any employee engaged in product
        certification for telecommunications equipment or customer
        premises equipment to engage jointly in sales or marketing of
        any such equipment with the affiliated manufacturer.
      (4) Standard-setting entities
        Any entity that is not an accredited standards development
      organization and that establishes industry-wide standards for
      telecommunications equipment or customer premises equipment, or
      industry-wide generic network requirements for such equipment, or
      that certifies telecommunications equipment or customer premises
      equipment manufactured by an unaffiliated entity, shall - 
          (A) establish and publish any industry-wide standard for,
        industry-wide generic requirement for, or any substantial
        modification of an existing industry-wide standard or industry-
        wide generic requirement for, telecommunications equipment or
        customer premises equipment only in compliance with the
        following procedure - 
            (i) such entity shall issue a public notice of its
          consideration of a proposed industry-wide standard or
          industry-wide generic requirement;
            (ii) such entity shall issue a public invitation to
          interested industry parties to fund and participate in such
          efforts on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis,
          administered in such a manner as not to unreasonably exclude
          any interested industry party;
            (iii) such entity shall publish a text for comment by such
          parties as have agreed to participate in the process pursuant
          to clause (ii), provide such parties a full opportunity to
          submit comments, and respond to comments from such parties;
            (iv) such entity shall publish a final text of the industry-
          wide standard or industry-wide generic requirement,
          including the comments in their entirety, of any funding
          party which requests to have its comments so published; and
            (v) such entity shall attempt, prior to publishing a text
          for comment, to agree with the funding parties as a group on
          a mutually satisfactory dispute resolution process which such
          parties shall utilize as their sole recourse in the event of
          a dispute on technical issues as to which there is
          disagreement between any funding party and the entity
          conducting such activities, except that if no dispute
          resolution process is agreed to by all the parties, a funding
          party may utilize the dispute resolution procedures
          established pursuant to paragraph (5) of this subsection;

          (B) engage in product certification for telecommunications
        equipment or customer premises equipment manufactured by
        unaffiliated entities only if - 
            (i) such activity is performed pursuant to published
          criteria;
            (ii) such activity is performed pursuant to auditable
          criteria; and
            (iii) such activity is performed pursuant to available
          industry-accepted testing methods and standards, where
          applicable, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties
          funding and performing such activity;

          (C) not undertake any actions to monopolize or attempt to
        monopolize the market for such services; and
          (D) not preferentially treat its own telecommunications
        equipment or customer premises equipment, or that of its
        affiliate, over that of any other entity in establishing and
        publishing industry-wide standards or industry-wide generic
        requirements for, and in certification of, telecommunications
        equipment and customer premises equipment.
      (5) Alternate dispute resolution
        Within 90 days after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall
      prescribe a dispute resolution process to be utilized in the
      event that a dispute resolution process is not agreed upon by all
      the parties when establishing and publishing any industry-wide
      standard or industry-wide generic requirement for
      telecommunications equipment or customer premises equipment,
      pursuant to paragraph (4)(A)(v). The Commission shall not
      establish itself as a party to the dispute resolution process.
      Such dispute resolution process shall permit any funding party to
      resolve a dispute with the entity conducting the activity that
      significantly affects such funding party's interests, in an open,
      nondiscriminatory, and unbiased fashion, within 30 days after the
      filing of such dispute. Such disputes may be filed within 15 days
      after the date the funding party receives a response to its
      comments from the entity conducting the activity. The Commission
      shall establish penalties to be assessed for delays caused by
      referral of frivolous disputes to the dispute resolution process.
      (6) Sunset
        The requirements of paragraphs (3) and (4) shall terminate for
      the particular relevant activity when the Commission determines
      that there are alternative sources of industry-wide standards,
      industry-wide generic requirements, or product certification for
      a particular class of telecommunications equipment or customer
      premises equipment available in the United States. Alternative
      sources shall be deemed to exist when such sources provide
      commercially viable alternatives that are providing such services
      to customers. The Commission shall act on any application for
      such a determination within 90 days after receipt of such
      application, and shall receive public comment on such
      application.
      (7) Administration and enforcement authority
        For the purposes of administering this subsection and the
      regulations prescribed thereunder, the Commission shall have the
      same remedial authority as the Commission has in administering
      and enforcing the provisions of this subchapter with respect to
      any common carrier subject to this chapter.
      (8) Definitions
        For purposes of this subsection:
          (A) The term "affiliate" shall have the same meaning as in
        section 153 of this title, except that, for purposes of
        paragraph (1)(B) - 
            (i) an aggregate voting equity interest in Bell
          Communications Research, Inc., of at least 5 percent of its
          total voting equity, owned directly or indirectly by more
          than 1 otherwise unaffiliated Bell operating company, shall
          constitute an affiliate relationship; and
            (ii) a voting equity interest in Bell Communications
          Research, Inc., by any otherwise unaffiliated Bell operating
          company of less than 1 percent of Bell Communications
          Research's total voting equity shall not be considered to be
          an equity interest under this paragraph.

          (B) The term "generic requirement" means a description of
        acceptable product attributes for use by local exchange
        carriers in establishing product specifications for the
        purchase of telecommunications equipment, customer premises
        equipment, and software integral thereto.
          (C) The term "industry-wide" means activities funded by or
        performed on behalf of local exchange carriers for use in
        providing wireline telephone exchange service whose combined
        total of deployed access lines in the United States constitutes
        at least 30 percent of all access lines deployed by
        telecommunications carriers in the United States as of February
        8, 1996.
          (D) The term "certification" means any technical process
        whereby a party determines whether a product, for use by more
        than one local exchange carrier, conforms with the specified
        requirements pertaining to such product.
          (E) The term "accredited standards development organization"
        means an entity composed of industry members which has been
        accredited by an institution vested with the responsibility for
        standards accreditation by the industry.
    (e) Bell operating company equipment procurement and sales
      (1) Nondiscrimination standards for manufacturing
        In the procurement or awarding of supply contracts for
      telecommunications equipment, a Bell operating company, or any
      entity acting on its behalf, for the duration of the requirement
      for a separate subsidiary including manufacturing under this
      chapter - 
          (A) shall consider such equipment, produced or supplied by
        unrelated persons; and
          (B) may not discriminate in favor of equipment produced or
        supplied by an affiliate or related person.
      (2) Procurement standards
        Each Bell operating company or any entity acting on its behalf
      shall make procurement decisions and award all supply contracts
      for equipment, services, and software on the basis of an
      objective assessment of price, quality, delivery, and other
      commercial factors.
      (3) Network planning and design
        A Bell operating company shall, to the extent consistent with
      the antitrust laws, engage in joint network planning and design
      with local exchange carriers operating in the same area of
      interest. No participant in such planning shall be allowed to
      delay the introduction of new technology or the deployment of
      facilities to provide telecommunications services, and agreement
      with such other carriers shall not be required as a prerequisite
      for such introduction or deployment.
      (4) Sales restrictions
        Neither a Bell operating company engaged in manufacturing nor a
      manufacturing affiliate of such a company shall restrict sales to
      any local exchange carrier of telecommunications equipment,
      including software integral to the operation of such equipment
      and related upgrades.
      (5) Protection of proprietary information
        A Bell operating company and any entity it owns or otherwise
      controls shall protect the proprietary information submitted for
      procurement decisions from release not specifically authorized by
      the owner of such information.
    (f) Administration and enforcement authority
      For the purposes of administering and enforcing the provisions of
    this section and the regulations prescribed thereunder, the
    Commission shall have the same authority, power, and functions with
    respect to any Bell operating company or any affiliate thereof as
    the Commission has in administering and enforcing the provisions of
    this subchapter with respect to any common carrier subject to this
    chapter.
    (g) Additional rules and regulations
      The Commission may prescribe such additional rules and
    regulations as the Commission determines are necessary to carry out
    the provisions of this section, and otherwise to prevent
    discrimination and cross-subsidization in a Bell operating
    company's dealings with its affiliate and with third parties.
    (h) "Manufacturing" defined
      As used in this section, the term "manufacturing" has the same
    meaning as such term has under the AT&T Consent Decree.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 274. Electronic publishing by Bell operating companies

-STATUTE-
    (a) Limitations
      No Bell operating company or any affiliate may engage in the
    provision of electronic publishing that is disseminated by means of
    such Bell operating company's or any of its affiliates' basic
    telephone service, except that nothing in this section shall
    prohibit a separated affiliate or electronic publishing joint
    venture operated in accordance with this section from engaging in
    the provision of electronic publishing.
    (b) Separated affiliate or electronic publishing joint venture
      requirements
      A separated affiliate or electronic publishing joint venture
    shall be operated independently from the Bell operating company.
    Such separated affiliate or joint venture and the Bell operating
    company with which it is affiliated shall - 
        (1) maintain separate books, records, and accounts and prepare
      separate financial statements;
        (2) not incur debt in a manner that would permit a creditor of
      the separated affiliate or joint venture upon default to have
      recourse to the assets of the Bell operating company;
        (3) carry out transactions (A) in a manner consistent with such
      independence, (B) pursuant to written contracts or tariffs that
      are filed with the Commission and made publicly available, and
      (C) in a manner that is auditable in accordance with generally
      accepted auditing standards;
        (4) value any assets that are transferred directly or
      indirectly from the Bell operating company to a separated
      affiliate or joint venture, and record any transactions by which
      such assets are transferred, in accordance with such regulations
      as may be prescribed by the Commission or a State commission to
      prevent improper cross subsidies;
        (5) between a separated affiliate and a Bell operating company -
       
          (A) have no officers, directors, and employees in common
        after the effective date of this section; and
          (B) own no property in common;

        (6) not use for the marketing of any product or service of the
      separated affiliate or joint venture, the name, trademarks, or
      service marks of an existing Bell operating company except for
      names, trademarks, or service marks that are owned by the entity
      that owns or controls the Bell operating company;
        (7) not permit the Bell operating company - 
          (A) to perform hiring or training of personnel on behalf of a
        separated affiliate;
          (B) to perform the purchasing, installation, or maintenance
        of equipment on behalf of a separated affiliate, except for
        telephone service that it provides under tariff or contract
        subject to the provisions of this section; or
          (C) to perform research and development on behalf of a
        separated affiliate;

        (8) each have performed annually a compliance review - 
          (A) that is conducted by an independent entity for the
        purpose of determining compliance during the preceding calendar
        year with any provision of this section; and
          (B) the results of which are maintained by the separated
        affiliate or joint venture and the Bell operating company for a
        period of 5 years subject to review by any lawful authority;
        and

        (9) within 90 days of receiving a review described in paragraph
      (8), file a report of any exceptions and corrective action with
      the Commission and allow any person to inspect and copy such
      report subject to reasonable safeguards to protect any
      proprietary information contained in such report from being used
      for purposes other than to enforce or pursue remedies under this
      section.
    (c) Joint marketing
      (1) In general
        Except as provided in paragraph (2) - 
          (A) a Bell operating company shall not carry out any
        promotion, marketing, sales, or advertising for or in
        conjunction with a separated affiliate; and
          (B) a Bell operating company shall not carry out any
        promotion, marketing, sales, or advertising for or in
        conjunction with an affiliate that is related to the provision
        of electronic publishing.
      (2) Permissible joint activities
        (A) Joint telemarketing
          A Bell operating company may provide inbound telemarketing or
        referral services related to the provision of electronic
        publishing for a separated affiliate, electronic publishing
        joint venture, affiliate, or unaffiliated electronic publisher:
        Provided, That if such services are provided to a separated
        affiliate, electronic publishing joint venture, or affiliate,
        such services shall be made available to all electronic
        publishers on request, on nondiscriminatory terms.
        (B) Teaming arrangements
          A Bell operating company may engage in nondiscriminatory
        teaming or business arrangements to engage in electronic
        publishing with any separated affiliate or with any other
        electronic publisher if (i) the Bell operating company only
        provides facilities, services, and basic telephone service
        information as authorized by this section, and (ii) the Bell
        operating company does not own such teaming or business
        arrangement.
        (C) Electronic publishing joint ventures
          A Bell operating company or affiliate may participate on a
        nonexclusive basis in electronic publishing joint ventures with
        entities that are not a Bell operating company, affiliate, or
        separated affiliate to provide electronic publishing services,
        if the Bell operating company or affiliate has not more than a
        50 percent direct or indirect equity interest (or the
        equivalent thereof) or the right to more than 50 percent of the
        gross revenues under a revenue sharing or royalty agreement in
        any electronic publishing joint venture. Officers and employees
        of a Bell operating company or affiliate participating in an
        electronic publishing joint venture may not have more than 50
        percent of the voting control over the electronic publishing
        joint venture. In the case of joint ventures with small, local
        electronic publishers, the Commission for good cause shown may
        authorize the Bell operating company or affiliate to have a
        larger equity interest, revenue share, or voting control but
        not to exceed 80 percent. A Bell operating company

        No Bell operating company or affiliate thereof shall engage in
      the provision of alarm monitoring services before the date which
      is 5 years after February 8, 1996.
      (2) Existing activities
        Paragraph (1) does not prohibit or limit the provision,
      directly or through an affiliate, of alarm monitoring services by
      a Bell operating company that was engaged in providing alarm
      monitoring services as of November 30, 1995, directly or through
      an affiliate. Such Bell operating company or affiliate may not
      acquire any equity interest in, or obtain financial control of,
      any unaffiliated alarm monitoring service entity after November
      30, 1995, and until 5 years after February 8, 1996, except that
      this sentence shall not prohibit an exchange of customers for the
      customers of an unaffiliated alarm monitoring service entity.
    (b) Nondiscrimination
      An incumbent local exchange carrier (as defined in section 251(h)
    of this title) engaged in the provision of alarm monitoring
    services shall - 
        (1) provide nonaffiliated entities, upon reasonable request,
      with the network services it provides to its own alarm monitoring
      operations, on nondiscriminatory terms and conditions; and
        (2) not subsidize its alarm monitoring services either directly
      or indirectly from telephone exchange service operations.
    (c) Expedited consideration of complaints
      The Commission shall establish procedures for the receipt and
    review of complaints concerning violations of subsection (b) of
    this section or the regulations thereunder that result in material
    financial harm to a provider of alarm monitoring service. Such
    procedures shall ensure that the Commission will make a final
    determination with respect to any such complaint within 120 days
    after receipt of the complaint. If the complaint contains an
    appropriate showing that the alleged violation occurred, as
    determined by the Commission in accordance with such regulations,
    the Commission shall, within 60 days after receipt of the
    complaint, order the incumbent local exchange carrier (as defined
    in section 251(h) of this title) and its affiliates to cease
    engaging in such violation pending such final determination.
    (d) Use of data
      A local exchange carrier may not record or use in any fashion the
    occurrence or contents of calls received by providers of alarm
    monitoring services for the purposes of marketing such services on
    behalf of such local exchange carrier, or any other entity. Any
    regulations necessary to enforce this subsection shall be issued
    initially within 6 months after February 8, 1996.
    (e) "Alarm monitoring service" defined

    device located at a residence, place of business, or other fixed

      such premises regarding a possible threat at such premises to
      life, safety, or property, from burglary, fire, vandalism, bodily
      injury, or other emergency, and
        (2) to transmit a signal regarding such threat by means of
      transmission facilities of a local exchange carrier or one of its
      affiliates to a remote monitoring center to alert a person at
      such center of the need to inform the customer or another person
      or police, fire, rescue, security, or public safety personnel of
      such threat,

    but does not include a service that uses a medical monitoring
    device attached to an individual for the automatic surveillance of
    an ongoing medical condition.

        relay service calls for hearing disabled individuals shall not
        be subject to such compensation;
          (B) discontinue the intrastate and interstate carrier access
        charge payphone service elements and payments in effect on
        February 8, 1996, and all intrastate and interstate payphone
        subsidies from basic exchange and exchange access revenues, in

        safeguards equal to those adopted in the Computer Inquiry-III
        (CC Docket No. 90-623) proceeding;
          (D) provide for Bell operating company payphone service
        providers to have the same right that independent payphone
        providers have to negotiate with the location provider on the
        location provider's selecting and contracting with, and,
        subject to the terms of any agreement with the location
        provider, to select and contract with, the carriers that carry
        interLATA calls from their payphones, unless the Commission
        determines in the rulemaking pursuant to this section that it
        is not in the public interest; and
          (E) provide for all payphone service providers to have the
        right to negotiate with the location provider on the location
        provider's selecting and contracting with, and, subject to the
        terms of any agreement with the location provider, to select
        and contract with, the carriers that carry intraLATA calls from
        their payphones.
      (2) Public interest telephones
        In the rulemaking conducted pursuant to paragraph (1), the
      Commission shall determine whether public interest payphones,
      which are provided in the interest of public health, safety, and
      welfare, in locations where there would otherwise not be a
      payphone, should be maintained, and if so, ensure that such
      public interest payphones are supported fairly and equitably.
      (3) Existing contracts
        Nothing in this section shall affect any existing contracts
      between location providers and payphone service providers or
      interLATA or intraLATA carriers that are in force and effect as
      of February 8, 1996.
    (c) State preemption
      To the extent that any State requirements are inconsistent with
    the Commission's regulations, the Commission's regulations on such
    matters shall preempt such State requirements.

      As used in this section, the term "payphone service" means the

    section 301 of this title in any radio service for the operation at
    issue shall not be subject to action by a State or local government
    under this subsection. A State or local government statute or
    ordinance enacted for purposes of this subsection shall identify
    the exemption available under this paragraph.
      (3) The Commission shall, to the extent practicable, provide
    technical guidance to State and local governments regarding the
    detection and determination of violations of the regulations
    specified in paragraph (1).
      (4)(A) In addition to any other remedy authorized by law, a
    person affected by the decision of a State or local government
    agency enforcing a statute or ordinance under paragraph (1) may
    submit to the Commission an appeal of the decision on the grounds
    that the State or local government, as the case may be, enacted a
    statute or ordinance outside the authority provided in this
    subsection.
      (B) A person shall submit an appeal on a decision of a State or
    local government agency to the Commission under this paragraph, if
    at all, not later than 30 days after the date on which the decision
    by the State or local government agency becomes final, but prior to

                 PARENTAL CHOICE IN TELEVISION PROGRAMMING             
      Section 551(a) of Pub. L. 104-104 provided that: "The Congress
    makes the following findings:
        "(1) Television influences children's perception of the values
      and behavior that are common and acceptable in society.
        "(2) Television station operators, cable television system
      operators, and video programmers should follow practices in
      connection with video programming that take into consideration
      that television broadcast and cable programming has established a
      uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of American children.
        "(3) The average American child is exposed to 25 hours of
      television each week and some children are exposed to as much as
      11 hours of television a day.
        "(4) Studies have shown that children exposed to violent video
      programming at a young age have a higher tendency for violent and
      aggressive behavior later in life than children not so exposed,
      and that children exposed to violent video programming are prone
      to assume that acts of violence are acceptable behavior.
        "(5) Children in the United States are, on average, exposed to
      an estimated 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of violence on
      television by the time the child completes elementary school.
        "(6) Studies indicate that children are affected by the
      pervasiveness and casual treatment of sexual material on
      television, eroding the ability of parents to develop responsible
      attitudes and behavior in their children.
        "(7) Parents express grave concern over violent and sexual
      video programming and strongly support technology that would give
      them greater control to block video programming in the home that
      they consider harmful to their children.
        "(8) There is a compelling governmental interest in empowering
      parents to limit the negative influences of video programming
      that is harmful to children.
        "(9) Providing parents with timely information about the nature
      of upcoming video programming and with the technological tools
      that allow them easily to block violent, sexual, or other
      programming that they believe harmful to their children is a
      nonintrusive and narrowly tailored means of achieving that
      compelling governmental interest."

                      ADVISORY COMMITTEE REQUIREMENTS

      operators, appropriate public interest groups, and other
      interested individuals from the private sector and is fairly
      balanced in terms of political affiliation, the points of view
      represented, and the functions to be performed by the committee;
        "(B) provide to the committee such staff and resources as may
      be necessary to permit it to perform its functions efficiently
      and promptly; and
        "(C) require the committee to submit a final report of its
      recommendations within one year after the date of the appointment
      of the initial members."

    relevant related industries (in consultation with appropriate
    public interest groups and interested individuals from the private
    sector) to - 
        "(1) establish a technology fund to encourage television and
      electronics equipment manufacturers to facilitate the development
      of technology which would empower parents to block programming
      they deem inappropriate for their children and to encourage the
      availability thereof to low income parents;
        "(2) report to the viewing public on the status of the
      development of affordable, easy to use blocking technology; and
        "(3) establish and promote effective procedures, standards,
      systems, advisories, or other mechanisms for ensuring that users
      have easy and complete access to the information necessary to
      effectively utilize blocking technology and to encourage the
      availability thereof to low income parents."

                           TO TELEVISION MEDIUM
      Section 2 of Pub. L. 101-431 provided that: "The Congress finds
    that - 
        "(1) to the fullest extent made possible by technology, deaf
      and hearing-impaired people should have equal access to the
      television medium;
        "(2) closed-captioned television transmissions have made it
      possible for thousands of deaf and hearing-impaired people to
      gain access to the television medium, thus significantly
      improving the quality of their lives;
        "(3) closed-captioned television will provide access to
      information, entertainment, and a greater understanding of our
      Nation and the world to over 24,000,000 people in the United
      States who are deaf or hearing-impaired;
        "(4) closed-captioned television will provide benefits for the
      nearly 38 percent of older Americans who have some loss of
      hearing;
        "(5) closed-captioned television can assist both hearing and
      hearing-impaired children with reading and other learning skills,
      and improve literacy skills among adults;
        "(6) closed-captioned television can assist those among our
      Nation's large immigrant population who are learning English as a
      second language with language comprehension;
        "(7) currently, a consumer must buy a TeleCaption decoder and
      connect the decoder to a television set in order to display the
      closed-captioned television transmissions;
        "(8) technology is now available to enable that closed-caption
      decoding capability to be built into new television sets during
      manufacture at a nominal cost by 1991; and
        "(9) the availability of decoder-equipped television sets will
      significantly increase the audience that can be served by closed-
      captioned television, and such increased market will be an
      incentive to the television medium to provide more captioned
      programming."

        DIRECTION ON USE OF FUNDS REGARDING SPECTRUM ALLOCATION AND

    that:
      "(a) Funds authorized to be appropriated under section 2 of this

    Federal Communications Commission to establish a plan which
    adequately ensures that the needs of State and local public safety
    authorities would be taken into account in making allocations of
    the electromagnetic spectrum. In establishing such a plan the
    Commission shall (1) review the current and future needs of such
    public safety authorities in light of suitable and commercially
    available equipment and (2) consider the need for a nationwide
    contiguous frequency allocation for public safety purposes.
      "(b) Pending adoption of a plan, the Commission, while making
    assignments and allocations, shall duly recognize the needs of
    State and local public safety authorities."

      assist children to learn important information, skills, values,
      and behavior, while entertaining them and exciting their
      curiosity to learn about the world around them;
        "(2) as part of their obligation to serve the public interest,

      from overcommercialization on television;
        "(5) television station operators and licensees should follow
      practices in connection with children's television programming
      and advertising that take into consideration the characteristics

                         MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT                     
    To the Congress of the United States:
      We live in a time when the technology of telecommunications is
    undergoing rapid change which will dramatically affect the whole of
    our society. It has long been recognized that the executive branch
    of the Federal government should be better equipped to deal with
    the issues which arise from telecommunications growth. As the
    largest single user of the nation's telecommunications facilities,
    the Federal government must also manage its internal communications
    operations in the most effective manner possible.
      Accordingly, I am today transmitting to the Congress
    Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1970, prepared in accordance with
    chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code.
      That plan would establish a new Office of Telecommunications
    Policy in the Executive Office of the President. The new unit would
    be headed by a Director and a Deputy Director who would be
    appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the
    Senate. The existing office held by the Director of
    Telecommunications Management in the Office of Emergency
    Preparedness would be abolished.
      In addition to the functions which are transferred to it by the
    reorganization plan, the new Office would perform certain other
    duties which I intend to assign to it by Executive order as soon as
    the reorganization plan takes effect. That order would delegate to
    the new Office essentially those functions which are now assigned
    to the Director of Telecommunications Management. The Office of
    Telecommunications Policy would be assisted in its research and
    analysis responsibilities by the agencies and departments of the
    Executive Branch including another new office, located in the
    Department of Commerce.
      The new Office of Telecommunications Policy would play three
    essential roles:
      1. It would serve as the President's principal adviser on
    telecommunications policy, helping to formulate government policies
    concerning a wide range of domestic and international
    telecommunications issues and helping to develop plans and programs
    which take full advantage of the nation's technological
    capabilities. The speed of economic and technological advance in
    our time means that new questions concerning communications are
    constantly arising, questions on which the government must be well
    informed and well advised. The new Office will enable the President
    and all government officials to share more fully in the experience,
    the insights, and the forecasts of government and non-government
    experts.
      2. The Office of Telecommunications Policy would help formulate
    policies and coordinate operations for the Federal government's own
    vast communications systems. It would, for example, set guidelines
    for the various departments and agencies concerning their
    communications equipment and services. It would regularly review
    the ability of government communications systems to meet the
    security needs of the nation and to perform effectively in time of
    emergency. The Office would direct the assignment of those portions
    of the radio spectrum which are reserved for government use, carry
    out responsibilities conferred on the President by the
    Communications Satellite Act, advise State and local governments,
    and provide policy direction for the National Communications
    System.
      3. Finally, the new Office would enable the executive branch to
    speak with a clearer vote and to act as a more effective partner in
    discussions of communications policy with both the Congress and the
    Federal Communications Commission. This action would take away none
    of the prerogatives or functions assigned to the Federal
    Communications Commission by the Congress. It is my hope, however,
    that the new Office and the Federal Communications Commission would
    cooperate in achieving certain reforms in telecommunications
    policy, especially in their procedures for allocating portions of
    the radio spectrum for government and civilian use. Our current
    procedures must be more flexible if they are to deal adequately
    with problems such as the worsening spectrum shortage.
      Each reorganization included in the plan which accompanies this
    message is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set
    forth in section 901(a) of title 5 of the United States Code. In
    particular, the plan is responsive to section 901(a)(1), "to
    promote the better execution of the laws, the more effective
    management of the executive branch and of its agencies and
    functions, and the expeditious administration of the public
    business;" and section 901(a)(3), "to increase the efficiency of
    the operations of the government to the fullest extent
    practicable."
      The reorganization provided for in this plan make necessary the
    appointment and compensation of new officers, as specified in
    sections 3(a) and 3(b) of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed
    for these officers are comparable to those fixed for other officers
    in the executive branch who have similar responsibilities.
      This plan should result in the more efficient operation of the
    government. It is not practical, however, to itemize or aggregate
    the exact expenditure reductions which will result from this
    action.
      The public interest requires that government policies concerning
    telecommunications be formulated with as much sophistication and
    vision as possible. This reorganization plan - and the executive
    order which would follow it - are necessary instruments if the
    government is to respond adequately to the challenges and
    opportunities presented by the rapid pace of change in
    communications. I urge that the Congress allow this plan to become
    effective so that these necessary reforms can be accomplished.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Grant
      The Commission, if public convenience, interest, or necessity
    will be served thereby, subject to the limitations of this chapter,
    shall grant to any applicant therefor a station license provided
    for by this chapter.
    (b) Allocation of facilities
      In considering applications for licenses, and modifications and
    renewals thereof, when and insofar as there is demand for the same,
    the Commission shall make such distribution of licenses,
    frequencies, hours of operation, and of power among the several
    States and communities as to provide a fair, efficient, and
    equitable distribution of radio service to each of the same.
    (c) Terms of licenses
      (1) Initial and renewal licenses
        Each license granted for the operation of a broadcasting
      station shall be for a term of not to exceed 8 years. Upon
      application therefor, a renewal of such license may be granted
      from time to time for a term of not to exceed 8 years from the
      date of expiration of the preceding license, if the Commission
      finds that public interest, convenience, and necessity would be
      served thereby. Consistent with the foregoing provisions of this
      subsection, the Commission may by rule prescribe the period or
      periods for which licenses shall be granted and renewed for
      particular classes of stations, but the Commission may not adopt
      or follow any rule which would preclude it, in any case involving
      a station of a particular class, from granting or renewing a
      license for a shorter period than that prescribed for stations of
      such class if, in its judgment, the public interest, convenience,
      or necessity would be served by such action.
      (2) Materials in application
        In order to expedite action on applications for renewal of
      broadcasting station licenses and in order to avoid needless
      expense to applicants for such renewals, the Commission shall not
      require any such applicant to file any information which
      previously has been furnished to the Commission or which is not
      directly material to the considerations that affect the granting
      or denial of such application, but the Commission may require any
      new or additional facts it deems necessary to make its findings.
      (3) Continuation pending decision
        Pending any administrative or judicial hearing and final
      decision on such an application and the disposition of any
      petition for rehearing pursuant to section 405 or section 402 of
      this title, the Commission shall continue such license in effect.
    (d) Renewals
      No renewal of an existing station license in the broadcast or the
    common carrier services shall be granted more than thirty days
    prior to the expiration of the original license.
    (e) Operation of certain radio stations without individual licenses
      (1) Notwithstanding any license requirement established in this
    chapter, if the Commission determines that such authorization
    serves the public interest, convenience, and necessity, the
    Commission may by rule authorize the operation of radio stations
    without individual licenses in the following radio services: (A)
    the citizens band radio service; (B) the radio control service; (C)
    the aviation radio service for aircraft stations operated on
    domestic flights when such aircraft are not otherwise required to
    carry a radio station; and (D) the maritime radio service for ship
    stations navigated on domestic voyages when such ships are not
    otherwise required to carry a radio station.
      (2) Any radio station operator who is authorized by the
    Commission to operate without an individual license shall comply
    with all other provisions of this chapter and with rules prescribed
    by the Commission under this chapter.
      (3) For purposes of this subsection, the terms "citizens band
    radio service", "radio control service", "aircraft station" and
    "ship station" shall have the meanings given them by the Commission
    by rule.
    (f) Areas in Alaska without access to over the air broadcasts
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, (1) any holder of a
    broadcast license may broadcast to an area of Alaska that otherwise
    does not have access to over the air broadcasts via translator,
    microwave, or other alternative signal delivery even if another
    holder of a broadcast license begins broadcasting to such area, (2)
    any holder of a broadcast license who has broadcast to an area of
    Alaska that did not have access to over the air broadcasts via
    translator, microwave, or other alternative signal delivery may
    continue providing such service even if another holder of a
    broadcast license begins broadcasting to such area, and shall not
    be fined or subject to any other penalty, forfeiture, or revocation
    related to providing such service including any fine, penalty,
    forfeiture, or revocation for continuing to operate notwithstanding
    orders to the contrary.

    effect beyond the period of the emergency or war requiring it:
    Provided further, That the Commission may issue by cable,
    telegraph, or radio a permit for the operation of a station on a
    vessel of the United States at sea, effective in lieu of a license
    until said vessel shall return to a port of the continental United
    States.
    (b) Conditions
      All applications for station licenses, or modifications or
    renewals thereof, shall set forth such facts as the Commission by
    regulation may prescribe as to the citizenship, character, and
    financial, technical, and other qualifications of the applicant to
    operate the station; the ownership and location of the proposed
    station and of the stations, if any, with which it is proposed to
    communicate; the frequencies and the power desired to be used; the
    hours of the day or other periods of time during which it is
    proposed to operate the station; the purposes for which the station
    is to be used; and such other information as it may require. The
    Commission, at any time after the filing of such original
    application and during the term of any such license, may require
    from an applicant or licensee further written statements of fact to
    enable it to determine whether such original application should be
    granted or denied or such license revoked. Such application and/or
    such statement of fact shall be signed by the applicant and/or
    licensee in any manner or form, including by electronic means, as
    the Commission may prescribe by regulation.
    (c) Commercial communication
      The Commission in granting any license for a station intended or
    used for commercial communication between the United States or any
    Territory or possession, continental or insular, subject to the
    jurisdiction of the United States, and any foreign country, may
    impose any terms, conditions, or restrictions authorized to be
    imposed with respect to submarine-cable licenses by section 35 of
    this title.
    (d) Summary of complaints
      Each applicant for the renewal of a commercial or noncommercial
    television license shall attach as an exhibit to the application a
    summary of written comments and suggestions received from the
    public and maintained by the licensee (in accordance with
    Commission regulations) that comment on the applicant's
    programming, if any, and that are characterized by the commentor as
    constituting violent programming.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Considerations in granting application
      Subject to the provisions of this section, the Commission shall
    determine, in the case of each application filed with it to which
    section 308 of this title applies, whether the public interest,
    convenience, and necessity will be served by the granting of such
    application, and, if the Commission, upon examination of such
    application and upon consideration of such other matters as the
    Commission may officially notice, shall find that public interest,
    convenience, and necessity would be served by the granting thereof,
    it shall grant such application.
    (b) Time of granting application
      Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, no such
    application - 
        (1) for an instrument of authorization in the case of a station
      in the broadcasting or common carrier services, or
        (2) for an instrument of authorization in the case of a station
      in any of the following categories:
          (A) industrial radio positioning stations for which
        frequencies are assigned on an exclusive basis,
          (B) aeronautical en route stations,
          (C) aeronautical advisory stations,
          (D) airdrome control stations,
          (E) aeronautical fixed stations, and
          (F) such other stations or classes of stations, not in the
        broadcasting or common carrier services, as the Commission
        shall by rule prescribe,

    shall be granted by the Commission earlier than thirty days
    following issuance of public notice by the Commission of the
    acceptance for filing of such application or of any substantial
    amendment thereof.
    (c) Applications not affected by subsection (b)
      Subsection (b) of this section shall not apply - 
        (1) to any minor amendment of an application to which such
      subsection is applicable, or
        (2) to any application for - 
          (A) a minor change in the facilities of an authorized
        station,
          (B) consent to an involuntary assignment or transfer under
        section 310(b) of this title or to an assignment or transfer
        thereunder which does not involve a substantial change in
        ownership or control,
          (C) a license under section 319(c) of this title or, pending
        application for or grant of such license, any special or
        temporary authorization to permit interim operation to
        facilitate completion of authorized construction or to provide
        substantially the same service as would be authorized by such
        license,
          (D) extension of time to complete construction of authorized
        facilities,
          (E) an authorization of facilities for remote pickups, studio
        links and similar facilities for use in the operation of a
        broadcast station,
          (F) authorizations pursuant to section 325(c) of this title
        where the programs to be transmitted are special events not of
        a continuing nature,
          (G) a special temporary authorization for nonbroadcast
        operation not to exceed thirty days where no application for
        regular operation is contemplated to be filed or not to exceed
        sixty days pending the filing of an application for such
        regular operation, or
          (H) an authorization under any of the proviso clauses of
        section 308(a) of this title.
    (d) Petition to deny application; time; contents; reply; findings
      (1) Any party in interest may file with the Commission a petition
    to deny any application (whether as originally filed or as amended)
    to which subsection (b) of this section applies at any time prior
    to the day of Commission grant thereof without hearing or the day
    of formal designation thereof for hearing; except that with respect
    to any classification of applications, the Commission from time to
    time by rule may specify a shorter period (no less than thirty days
    following the issuance of public notice by the Commission of the
    acceptance for filing of such application or of any substantial
    amendment thereof), which shorter period shall be reasonably
    related to the time when the applications would normally be reached
    for processing. The petitioner shall serve a copy of such petition
    on the applicant. The petition shall contain specific allegations
    of fact sufficient to show that the petitioner is a party in
    interest and that a grant of the application would be prima facie
    inconsistent with subsection (a) of this section (or subsection (k)
    of this section in the case of renewal of any broadcast station
    license). Such allegations of fact shall, except for those of which
    official notice may be taken, be supported by affidavit of a person
    or persons with personal knowledge thereof. The applicant shall be
    given the opportunity to file a reply in which allegations of fact
    or denials thereof shall similarly be supported by affidavit.
      (2) If the Commission finds on the basis of the application, the
    pleadings filed, or other matters which it may officially notice
    that there are no substantial and material questions of fact and
    that a grant of the application would be consistent with subsection
    (a) of this section (or subsection (k) of this section in the case
    of renewal of any broadcast station license), it shall make the
    grant, deny the petition, and issue a concise statement of the
    reasons for denying the petition, which statement shall dispose of
    all substantial issues raised by the petition. If a substantial and
    material question of fact is presented or if the Commission for any
    reason is unable to find that grant of the application would be
    consistent with subsection (a) of this section (or subsection (k)
    of this section in the case of renewal of any broadcast station
    license), it shall proceed as provided in subsection (e) of this
    section.
    (e) Hearings; intervention; evidence; burden of proof
      If, in the case of any application to which subsection (a) of
    this section applies, a substantial and material question of fact
    is presented or the Commission for any reason is unable to make the
    finding specified in such subsection, it shall formally designate
    the application for hearing on the ground or reasons then obtaining
    and shall forthwith notify the applicant and all other known
    parties in interest of such action and the grounds and reasons
    therefor, specifying with particularity the matters and things in
    issue but not including issues or requirements phrased generally.
    When the Commission has so designated an application for hearing
    the parties in interest, if any, who are not notified by the
    Commission of such action may acquire the status of a party to the
    proceeding thereon by filing a petition for intervention showing
    the basis for their interest not more than thirty days after
    publication of the hearing issues or any substantial amendment
    thereto in the Federal Register. Any hearing subsequently held upon
    such application shall be a full hearing in which the applicant and
    all other parties in interest shall be permitted to participate.
    The burden of proceeding with the introduction of evidence and the
    burden of proof shall be upon the applicant, except that with
    respect to any issue presented by a petition to deny or a petition
    to enlarge the issues, such burdens shall be as determined by the
    Commission.
    (f) Temporary authorization of temporary operations under
      subsection (b)
      When an application subject to subsection (b) of this section has
    been filed, the Commission, notwithstanding the requirements of
    such subsection, may, if the grant of such application is otherwise
    authorized by law and if it finds that there are extraordinary
    circumstances requiring temporary operations in the public interest
    and that delay in the institution of such temporary operations
    would seriously prejudice the public interest, grant a temporary
    authorization, accompanied by a statement of its reasons therefor,
    to permit such temporary operations for a period not exceeding 180
    days, and upon making like findings may extend such temporary
    authorization for additional periods not to exceed 180 days. When
    any such grant of a temporary authorization is made, the Commission
    shall give expeditious treatment to any timely filed petition to
    deny such application and to any petition for rehearing of such
    grant filed under section 405 of this title.
    (g) Classification of applications
      The Commission is authorized to adopt reasonable classifications
    of applications and amendments in order to effectuate the purposes
    of this section.
    (h) Form and conditions of station licenses
      Such station licenses as the Commission may grant shall be in
    such general form as it may prescribe, but each license shall
    contain, in addition to other provisions, a statement of the
    following conditions to which such license shall be subject: (1)
    The station license shall not vest in the licensee any right to
    operate the station nor any right in the use of the frequencies
    designated in the license beyond the term thereof nor in any other
    manner than authorized therein; (2) neither the license nor the
    right granted thereunder shall be assigned or otherwise transferred
    in violation of this chapter; (3) every license issued under this
    chapter shall be subject in terms to the right of use or control
    conferred by section 606 of this title.
    (i) Random selection
      (1) General authority. - Except as provided in paragraph (5), if
    there is more than one application for any initial license or
    construction permit, then the Commission shall have the authority
    to grant such license or permit to a qualified applicant through
    the use of a system of random selection.
      (2) No license or construction permit shall be granted to an
    applicant selected pursuant to paragraph (1) unless the Commission
    determines the qualifications of such applicant pursuant to
    subsection (a) of this section and section 308(b) of this title.
    When substantial and material questions of fact exist concerning
    such qualifications, the Commission shall conduct a hearing in
    order to make such determinations. For the purpose of making such
    determinations, the Commission may, by rule, and notwithstanding
    any other provision of law - 
        (A) adopt procedures for the submission of all or part of the
      evidence in written form;
        (B) delegate the function of presiding at the taking of written
      evidence to Commission employees other than administrative law
      judges; and
        (C) omit the determination required by subsection (a) of this
      section with respect to any application other than the one
      selected pursuant to paragraph (1).

      (3)(A) The Commission shall establish rules and procedures to
    ensure that, in the administration of any system of random
    selection under this subsection used for granting licenses or
    construction permits for any media of mass communications,
    significant preferences will be granted to applicants or groups of
    applicants, the grant to which of the license or permit would
    increase the diversification of ownership of the media of mass
    communications. To further diversify the ownership of the media of
    mass communications, an additional significant preference shall be
    granted to any applicant controlled by a member or members of a
    minority group.
      (B) The Commission shall have authority to require each qualified
    applicant seeking a significant preference under subparagraph (A)
    to submit to the Commission such information as may be necessary to
    enable the Commission to make a determination regarding whether
    such applicant shall be granted such preference. Such information
    shall be submitted in such form, at such times, and in accordance
    with such procedures, as the Commission may require.
      (C) For purposes of this paragraph:
        (i) The term "media of mass communications" includes
      television, radio, cable television, multipoint distribution
      service, direct broadcast satellite service, and other services,
      the licensed facilities of which may be substantially devoted
      toward providing programming or other information services within
      the editorial control of the licensee.
        (ii) The term "minority group" includes Blacks, Hispanics,
      American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asians, and Pacific Islanders.

      (4)(A) The Commission shall, after notice and opportunity for
    hearing, prescribe rules establishing a system of random selection
    for use by the Commission under this subsection in any instance in
    which the Commission, in its discretion, determines that such use
    is appropriate for the granting of any license or permit in
    accordance with paragraph (1).
      (B) The Commission shall have authority to amend such rules from
    time to time to the extent necessary to carry out the provisions of
    this subsection. Any such amendment shall be made after notice and
    opportunity for hearing.
      (C) Not later than 180 days after August 10, 1993, the Commission
    shall prescribe such transfer disclosures and antitrafficking
    restrictions and payment schedules as are necessary to prevent the
    unjust enrichment of recipients of licenses or permits as a result
    of the methods employed to issue licenses under this subsection.
      (5) Termination of authority. - (A) Except as provided in
    subparagraph (B), the Commission shall not issue any license or
    permit using a system of random selection under this subsection
    after July 1, 1997.
      (B) Subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not apply with
    respect to licenses or permits for stations described in section
    397(6) of this title.
    (j) Use of competitive bidding
      (1) General authority
        If, consistent with the obligations described in paragraph
      (6)(E), mutually exclusive applications are accepted for any
      initial license or construction permit, then, except as provided
      in paragraph (2), the Commission shall grant the license or
      permit to a qualified applicant through a system of competitive
      bidding that meets the requirements of this subsection.
      (2) Exemptions
        The competitive bidding authority granted by this subsection
      shall not apply to licenses or construction permits issued by the
      Commission - 
          (A) for public safety radio services, including private
        internal radio services used by State and local governments and
        non-government entities and including emergency road services
        provided by not-for-profit organizations, that - 
            (i) are used to protect the safety of life, health, or
          property; and
            (ii) are not made commercially available to the public;

          (B) for initial licenses or construction permits for digital
        television service given to existing terrestrial broadcast
        licensees to replace their analog television service licenses;
        or
          (C) for stations described in section 397(6) of this title.
      (3) Design of systems of competitive bidding
        For each class of licenses or permits that the Commission
      grants through the use of a competitive bidding system, the
      Commission shall, by regulation, establish a competitive bidding
      methodology. The Commission shall seek to design and test
      multiple alternative methodologies under appropriate
      circumstances. The Commission shall, directly or by contract,
      provide for the design and conduct (for purposes of testing) of
      competitive bidding using a contingent combinatorial bidding
      system that permits prospective bidders to bid on combinations or
      groups of licenses in a single bid and to enter multiple
      alternative bids within a single bidding round. In identifying
      classes of licenses and permits to be issued by competitive
      bidding, in specifying eligibility and other characteristics of
      such licenses and permits, and in designing the methodologies for
      use under this subsection, the Commission shall include
      safeguards to protect the public interest in the use of the
      spectrum and shall seek to promote the purposes specified in
      section 151 of this title and the following objectives:
          (A) the development and rapid deployment of new technologies,
        products, and services for the benefit of the public, including
        those residing in rural areas, without administrative or
        judicial delays;
          (B) promoting economic opportunity and competition and
        ensuring that new and innovative technologies are readily
        accessible to the American people by avoiding excessive
        concentration of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a
        wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural
        telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of
        minority groups and women;
          (C) recovery for the public of a portion of the value of the
        public spectrum resource made available for commercial use and
        avoidance of unjust enrichment through the methods employed to
        award uses of that resource;
          (D) efficient and intensive use of the electromagnetic
        spectrum;
          (E) ensure that, in the scheduling of any competitive bidding
        under this subsection, an adequate period is allowed - 
            (i) before issuance of bidding rules, to permit notice and
          comment on proposed auction procedures; and
            (ii) after issuance of bidding rules, to ensure that
          interested parties have a sufficient time to develop business
          plans, assess market conditions, and evaluate the
          availability of equipment for the relevant services; and

          (F) for any auction of eligible frequencies described in
        section 113(g)(2) of the National Telecommunications and
        Information Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C.
        923(g)(2)), the recovery of 110 percent of estimated relocation
        costs as provided to the Commission pursuant to section
        113(g)(4) of such Act.
      (4) Contents of regulations
        In prescribing regulations pursuant to paragraph (3), the
      Commission shall - 
          (A) consider alternative payment schedules and methods of
        calculation, including lump sums or guaranteed installment
        payments, with or without royalty payments, or other schedules
        or methods that promote the objectives described in paragraph
        (3)(B), and combinations of such schedules and methods;
          (B) include performance requirements, such as appropriate
        deadlines and penalties for performance failures, to ensure
        prompt delivery of service to rural areas, to prevent
        stockpiling or warehousing of spectrum by licensees or
        permittees, and to promote investment in and rapid deployment
        of new technologies and services;
          (C) consistent with the public interest, convenience, and
        necessity, the purposes of this chapter, and the
        characteristics of the proposed service, prescribe area
        designations and bandwidth assignments that promote (i) an
        equitable distribution of licenses and services among
        geographic areas, (ii) economic opportunity for a wide variety
        of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone
        companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups
        and women, and (iii) investment in and rapid deployment of new
        technologies and services;
          (D) ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies,
        and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women
        are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of
        spectrum-based services, and, for such purposes, consider the
        use of tax certificates, bidding preferences, and other
        procedures;
          (E) require such transfer disclosures and antitrafficking
        restrictions and payment schedules as may be necessary to
        prevent unjust enrichment as a result of the methods employed
        to issue licenses and permits; and
          (F) prescribe methods by which a reasonable reserve price
        will be required, or a minimum bid will be established, to
        obtain any license or permit being assigned pursuant to the
        competitive bidding, unless the Commission determines that such
        a reserve price or minimum bid is not in the public interest.
      (5) Bidder and licensee qualification
        No person shall be permitted to participate in a system of
      competitive bidding pursuant to this subsection unless such
      bidder submits such information and assurances as the Commission
      may require to demonstrate that such bidder's application is
      acceptable for filing. No license shall be granted to an
      applicant selected pursuant to this subsection unless the
      Commission determines that the applicant is qualified pursuant to
      subsection (a) of this section and sections 308(b) and 310 of
      this title. Consistent with the objectives described in paragraph
      (3), the Commission shall, by regulation, prescribe expedited
      procedures consistent with the procedures authorized by
      subsection (i)(2) of this section for the resolution of any
      substantial and material issues of fact concerning
      qualifications.
      (6) Rules of construction
        Nothing in this subsection, or in the use of competitive
      bidding, shall - 
          (A) alter spectrum allocation criteria and procedures
        established by the other provisions of this chapter;
          (B) limit or otherwise affect the requirements of subsection
        (h) of this section, section 301, 304, 307, 310, or 606 of this
        title, or any other provision of this chapter (other than
        subsections (d)(2) and (e) of this section);
          (C) diminish the authority of the Commission under the other
        provisions of this chapter to regulate or reclaim spectrum
        licenses;
          (D) be construed to convey any rights, including any
        expectation of renewal of a license, that differ from the
        rights that apply to other licenses within the same service
        that were not issued pursuant to this subsection;
          (E) be construed to relieve the Commission of the obligation
        in the public interest to continue to use engineering
        solutions, negotiation, threshold qualifications, service
        regulations, and other means in order to avoid mutual
        exclusivity in application and licensing proceedings;
          (F) be construed to prohibit the Commission from issuing
        nationwide, regional, or local licenses or permits;
          (G) be construed to prevent the Commission from awarding
        licenses to those persons who make significant contributions to
        the development of a new telecommunications service or
        technology; or
          (H) be construed to relieve any applicant for a license or
        permit of the obligation to pay charges imposed pursuant to
        section 158 of this title.
      (7) Consideration of revenues in public interest determinations
        (A) Consideration prohibited
          In making a decision pursuant to section 303(c) of this title
        to assign a band of frequencies to a use for which licenses or
        permits will be issued pursuant to this subsection, and in
        prescribing regulations pursuant to paragraph (4)(C) of this
        subsection, the Commission may not base a finding of public
        interest, convenience, and necessity on the expectation of
        Federal revenues from the use of a system of competitive
        bidding under this subsection.
        (B) Consideration limited
          In prescribing regulations pursuant to paragraph (4)(A) of
        this subsection, the Commission may not base a finding of
        public interest, convenience, and necessity solely or
        predominantly on the expectation of Federal revenues from the
        use of a system of competitive bidding under this subsection.
        (C) Consideration of demand for spectrum not affected
          Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the
        Commission from continuing to consider consumer demand for
        spectrum-based services.
      (8) Treatment of revenues
        (A) General rule
          Except as provided in subparagraphs (B), (D), and (E), all

        accordance with chapter 33 of title 31.
        (B) Retention of revenues
          Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the salaries and expenses
        account of the Commission shall retain as an offsetting
        collection such sums as may be necessary from such proceeds for
        the costs of developing and implementing the program required
        by this subsection. Such offsetting collections shall be
        available for obligation subject to the terms and conditions of
        the receiving appropriations account, and shall be deposited in
        such accounts on a quarterly basis. Such offsetting collections
        are authorized to remain available until expended. No sums may
        be retained under this subparagraph during any fiscal year
        beginning after September 30, 1998, if the annual report of the
        Commission under section 154(k) of this title for the second
        preceding fiscal year fails to include in the itemized
        statement required by paragraph (3) of such section a statement
        of each expenditure made for purposes of conducting competitive
        bidding under this subsection during such second preceding
        fiscal year.
        (C) Deposit and use of auction escrow accounts
          Any deposits the Commission may require for the qualification
        of any person to bid in a system of competitive bidding

        bearing account at a financial institution designated for
        purposes of this subsection by the Commission (after
        consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury). Within 45
        days following the conclusion of the competitive bidding - 
            (i) the deposits of successful bidders shall be paid to the
          Treasury, except as otherwise provided in subparagraph
          (E)(ii);
            (ii) the deposits of unsuccessful bidders shall be returned
          to such bidders; and
            (iii) the interest accrued to the account shall be
          transferred to the Telecommunications Development Fund
          established pursuant to section 614 of this title.
        (D) Disposition of cash proceeds
          Cash proceeds attributable to the auction of any eligible
        frequencies described in section 113(g)(2) of the National
        Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization
        Act (47 U.S.C. 923(g)(2)) shall be deposited in the Spectrum
        Relocation Fund established under section 118 of such Act [47
        U.S.C. 928], and shall be available in accordance with that
        section.
        (E) Transfer of receipts

          fund to be known as the Digital Television Transition and
          Public Safety Fund.
          (ii) Proceeds for funds
            Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the proceeds (including
          deposits and upfront payments from successful bidders) from
          the use of a competitive bidding system under this subsection
          with respect to recovered analog spectrum shall be deposited
          in the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund.
          (iii) Transfer of amount to Treasury

        this subsection on and after 2 years after August 10, 1993,
        shall cease to be effective if - 
            (i) the Secretary of Commerce has failed to submit the
          report required by section 113(a) of the National
          Telecommunications and Information Administration
          Organization Act [47 U.S.C. 923(a)];

          Congress, not later than 18 months after August 10, 1993, a
          study of current and future spectrum needs of State and local
          government public safety agencies through the year 2010, and
          a specific plan to ensure that adequate frequencies are made
          available to public safety licensees; or
            (v) the Commission has failed under section 332(c)(3) of
          this title to grant or deny within the time required by such
          section any petition that a State has filed within 90 days

        until such failure has been corrected.
      (11) Termination
        The authority of the Commission to grant a license or permit
      under this subsection shall expire September 30, 2011.
      (12) Evaluation
        Not later than September 30, 1997, the Commission shall conduct
      a public inquiry and submit to the Congress a report - 
          (A) containing a statement of the revenues obtained, and a

            (i) competitive bidding significantly improved the
          efficiency and effectiveness of the process for granting
          radio spectrum licenses;
            (ii) competitive bidding facilitated the introduction of
          new spectrum-based technologies and the entry of new
          companies into the telecommunications market;

          (E) recommending any statutory changes that are needed to
        improve the competitive bidding process.
      (13) Recovery of value of public spectrum in connection with
        pioneer preferences
        (A) In general
          Notwithstanding paragraph (6)(G), the Commission shall not
        award licenses pursuant to a preferential treatment accorded by
        the Commission to persons who make significant contributions to
        the development of a new telecommunications service or
        technology, except in accordance with the requirements of this
        paragraph.
        (B) Recovery of value
          The Commission shall recover for the public a portion of the
        value of the public spectrum resource made available to such
        person by requiring such person, as a condition for receipt of
        the license, to agree to pay a sum determined by - 
            (i) identifying the winning bids for the licenses that the
          Commission determines are most reasonably comparable in terms
          of bandwidth, scope of service area, usage restrictions, and
          other technical characteristics to the license awarded to
          such person, and excluding licenses that the Commission
          determines are subject to bidding anomalies due to the award
          of preferential treatment;
            (ii) dividing each such winning bid by the population of
          its service area (hereinafter referred to as the per capita
          bid amount);
            (iii) computing the average of the per capita bid amounts
          for the licenses identified under clause (i);
            (iv) reducing such average amount by 15 percent; and
            (v) multiplying the amount determined under clause (iv) by
          the population of the service area of the license obtained by
          such person.
        (C) Installments permitted
          The Commission shall require such person to pay the sum
        required by subparagraph (B) in a lump sum or in guaranteed
        installment payments, with or without royalty payments, over a
        period of not more than 5 years.
        (D) Rulemaking on pioneer preferences
          Except with respect to pending applications described in
        clause (iv) of this subparagraph, the Commission shall
        prescribe regulations specifying the procedures and criteria by
        which the Commission will evaluate applications for
        preferential treatment in its licensing processes (by
        precluding the filing of mutually exclusive applications) for
        persons who make significant contributions to the development
        of a new service or to the development of new technologies that
        substantially enhance an existing service. Such regulations
        shall - 
            (i) specify the procedures and criteria by which the
          significance of such contributions will be determined, after
          an opportunity for review and verification by experts in the
          radio sciences drawn from among persons who are not employees
          of the Commission or by any applicant for such preferential
          treatment;
            (ii) include such other procedures as may be necessary to
          prevent unjust enrichment by ensuring that the value of any
          such contribution justifies any reduction in the amounts paid
          for comparable licenses under this subsection;
            (iii) be prescribed not later than 6 months after December
          8, 1994;
            (iv) not apply to applications that have been accepted for
          filing on or before September 1, 1994; and
            (v) cease to be effective on the date of the expiration of
          the Commission's authority under subparagraph (F).
        (E) Implementation with respect to pending applications
          In applying this paragraph to any broadband licenses in the
        personal communications service awarded pursuant to the
        preferential treatment accorded by the Federal Communications
        Commission in the Third Report and Order in General Docket 90-
        314 (FCC 93-550, released February 3, 1994) - 
            (i) the Commission shall not reconsider the award of
          preferences in such Third Report and Order, and the
          Commission shall not delay the grant of licenses based on
          such awards more than 15 days following December 8, 1994, and
          the award of such preferences and licenses shall not be
          subject to administrative or judicial review;
            (ii) the Commission shall not alter the bandwidth or
          service areas designated for such licenses in such Third
          Report and Order;
            (iii) except as provided in clause (v), the Commission
          shall use, as the most reasonably comparable licenses for
          purposes of subparagraph (B)(i), the broadband licenses in
          the personal communications service for blocks A and B for
          the 20 largest markets (ranked by population) in which no
          applicant has obtained preferential treatment;
            (iv) for purposes of subparagraph (C), the Commission shall
          permit guaranteed installment payments over a period of 5
          years, subject to - 
              (I) the payment only of interest on unpaid balances
            during the first 2 years, commencing not later than 30 days
            after the award of the license (including any preferential
            treatment used in making such award) is final and no longer
            subject to administrative or judicial review, except that
            no such payment shall be required prior to the date of
            completion of the auction of the comparable licenses
            described in clause (iii); and
              (II) payment of the unpaid balance and interest thereon
            after the end of such 2 years in accordance with the
            regulations prescribed by the Commission; and

            (v) the Commission shall recover with respect to broadband
          licenses in the personal communications service an amount
          under this paragraph that is equal to not less than
          $400,000,000, and if such amount is less than $400,000,000,
          the Commission shall recover an amount equal to $400,000,000
          by allocating such amount among the holders of such licenses
          based on the population of the license areas held by each
          licensee.

        The Commission shall not include in any amounts required to be
        collected under clause (v) the interest on unpaid balances
        required to be collected under clause (iv).
        (F) Expiration
          The authority of the Commission to provide preferential
        treatment in licensing procedures (by precluding the filing of
        mutually exclusive applications) to persons who make
        significant contributions to the development of a new service
        or to the development of new technologies that substantially
        enhance an existing service shall expire on August 5, 1997.
        (G) Effective date
          This paragraph shall be effective on December 8, 1994, and
        apply to any licenses issued on or after August 1, 1994, by the
        Federal Communications Commission pursuant to any licensing
        procedure that provides preferential treatment (by precluding
        the filing of mutually exclusive applications) to persons who
        make significant contributions to the development of a new
        service or to the development of new technologies that
        substantially enhance an existing service.
      (14) Auction of recaptured broadcast television spectrum
        (A) Limitations on terms of terrestrial television broadcast
          licenses

        analog television service may not be renewed to authorize such
        service for a period that extends beyond February 17, 2009.
        (B) Spectrum reversion and resale
          (i) The Commission shall - 
            (I) ensure that, as licenses for analog television service
          expire pursuant to subparagraph (A), each licensee shall
          cease using electromagnetic spectrum assigned to such service
          according to the Commission's direction; and
            (II) reclaim and organize the electromagnetic spectrum in a
          manner consistent with the objectives described in paragraph
          (3) of this subsection.

        pursuant to clause (i) shall be assigned in accordance with
        this subsection.
        (C) Certain limitations on qualified bidders prohibited
          In prescribing any regulations relating to the qualification
        of bidders for spectrum reclaimed pursuant to subparagraph
        (B)(i), the Commission, for any license that may be used for
        any digital television service where the grade A contour of the
        station is projected to encompass the entirety of a city with a
        population in excess of 400,000 (as determined using the 1990
        decennial census), shall not - 
            (i) preclude any party from being a qualified bidder for
          such spectrum on the basis of - 
              (I) the Commission's duopoly rule (47 C.F.R. 73.3555(b));
            or
              (II) the Commission's newspaper cross-ownership rule (47
            C.F.R. 73.3555(d)); or

            (ii) apply either such rule to preclude such a party that
          is a winning bidder in a competitive bidding for such
          spectrum from using such spectrum for digital television
          service.
      (15) Commission to determine timing of auctions

          inclusive (between frequencies 698 and 806 megahertz,
          inclusive) reclaimed from analog television service

        made by such bidders for such licenses.
      (16) Special auction provisions for eligible frequencies
        (A) Special regulations
          The Commission shall revise the regulations prescribed under
        paragraph (4)(F) of this subsection to prescribe methods by
        which the total cash proceeds from any auction of eligible
        frequencies described in section 113(g)(2) of the National
        Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization
        Act (47 U.S.C. 923(g)(2)) shall at least equal 110 percent of
        the total estimated relocation costs provided to the Commission
        pursuant to section 113(g)(4) of such Act.
        (B) Conclusion of auctions contingent on minimum proceeds
          The Commission shall not conclude any auction of eligible
        frequencies described in section 113(g)(2) of such Act [47
        U.S.C. 923(g)(2)] if the total cash proceeds attributable to
        such spectrum are less than 110 percent of the total estimated
        relocation costs provided to the Commission pursuant to section
        113(g)(4) of such Act. If the Commission is unable to conclude
        an auction for the foregoing reason, the Commission shall
        cancel the auction, return within 45 days after the auction
        cancellation date any deposits from participating bidders held
        in escrow, and absolve such bidders from any obligation to the
        United States to bid in any subsequent reauction of such
        spectrum.
        (C) Authority to issue prior to deauthorization
          In any auction conducted under the regulations required by
        subparagraph (A), the Commission may grant a license assigned
        for the use of eligible frequencies prior to the termination of
        an eligible Federal entity's authorization. However, the
        Commission shall condition such license by requiring that the
        licensee cannot cause harmful interference to such Federal
        entity until such entity's authorization has been terminated by
        the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.
    (k) Broadcast station renewal procedures
      (1) Standards for renewal
        If the licensee of a broadcast station submits an application
      to the Commission for renewal of such license, the Commission
      shall grant the application if it finds, with respect to that
      station, during the preceding term of its license - 
          (A) the station has served the public interest, convenience,
        and necessity;
          (B) there have been no serious violations by the licensee of
        this chapter or the rules and regulations of the Commission;
        and
          (C) there have been no other violations by the licensee of
        this chapter or the rules and regulations of the Commission
        which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse.
      (2) Consequence of failure to meet standard
        If any licensee of a broadcast station fails to meet the
      requirements of this subsection, the Commission may deny the
      application for renewal in accordance with paragraph (3), or
      grant such application on terms and conditions as are
      appropriate, including renewal for a term less than the maximum
      otherwise permitted.
      (3) Standards for denial
        If the Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for
      a hearing as provided in subsection (e) of this section, that a
      licensee has failed to meet the requirements specified in
      paragraph (1) and that no mitigating factors justify the
      imposition of lesser sanctions, the Commission shall - 
          (A) issue an order denying the renewal application filed by
        such licensee under section 308 of this title; and
          (B) only thereafter accept and consider such applications for
        a construction permit as may be filed under section 308 of this
        title specifying the channel or broadcasting facilities of the
        former licensee.
      (4) Competitor consideration prohibited
        In making the determinations specified in paragraph (1) or (2),
      the Commission shall not consider whether the public interest,
      convenience, and necessity might be served by the grant of a
      license to a person other than the renewal applicant.
    (l) Applicability of competitive bidding to pending comparative
      licensing cases
      With respect to competing applications for initial licenses or
    construction permits for commercial radio or television stations
    that were filed with the Commission before July 1, 1997, the
    Commission shall - 
        (1) have the authority to conduct a competitive bidding
      proceeding pursuant to subsection (j) of this section to assign
      such license or permit;
        (2) treat the persons filing such applications as the only
      persons eligible to be qualified bidders for purposes of such
      proceeding; and
        (3) waive any provisions of its regulations necessary to permit
      such persons to enter an agreement to procure the removal of a
      conflict between their applications during the 180-day period
      beginning on August 5, 1997.

    license or permit would increase the diversification of ownership
    of the media of mass communications. To further diversify the
    ownership of the media of mass communications, an additional
    significant preference shall be granted to any applicant controlled
    by a member or members of a minority group" for ", groups or

    days after publication of the hearing issues or any substantial
    amendment thereto in the Federal Register" for "at any time not
    less than ten days prior to the date of hearing".
      1960 - Pub. L. 86-752 amended section generally to revise pre-
    grant procedure, and, among other changes, a public notice was
    substituted for a mandatory notice to applicants and interested
    parties before hearings upon applications; the Commission was
    required to hold applications for 30 days before acting upon them
    without hearings; interested parties were permitted to file
    petitions to deny applications before the Commission acted upon
    them without hearings, in lieu of 30 days after applications were

    permitted to dispense with formal hearings when there are "no
    substantial or material questions of fact," subject to a

    its action.
      1956 - Subsec. (c). Act Jan. 20, 1956, struck out hearings with
    respect to facts which, even if true, would not be grounds for

    discretion to keep in effect the protested authorization but
    required the Commission to affirmatively find and set forth that
    the public interest requires grant to remain in effect; and
    authorized Commission to redraft issues urged by protestant in
    accordance with the facts alleged in the protest.

      equipment, supplies, and systems), rather than the warehousing or
      storage of equipment and supplies currently available at the time
      the reserve is established.
        "(2) Requirements and characteristics. - Funds provided to meet
      uses described in paragraph (1) shall be used in support of

      be virtual and may include items donated on an in-kind
      contribution basis.
        "(4) Allocation of funds. - In evaluating permitted uses under
      subparagraph (a)(1)(B), the Assistant Secretary shall take into
      account barriers to immediate deployment, including time and
      distance, that may slow the rapid deployment of equipment,
      supplies, and systems (and communications service related to such
      equipment, supplies, and systems) in the event of an emergency in
      any State.
      "(d) Voluntary Consensus Standards. - In carrying out this
    section, the Assistant Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary
    of Homeland Security, shall identify and, if necessary, encourage

                                 FINDINGS                             
      Pub. L. 107-195, Sec. 2, June 19, 2002, 116 Stat. 715, provided
    that: "Congress finds the following:
        "(1) Circumstances in the telecommunications market have
      changed dramatically since the auctioning of spectrum in the 700
      megahertz band was originally mandated by Congress in 1997,
      raising serious questions as to whether the original deadlines,
      or the subsequent revision of the deadlines, are consistent with
      sound telecommunications policy and spectrum management
      principles.
        "(2) No comprehensive plan yet exists for allocating additional
      spectrum for third-generation wireless and other advanced
      communications services. The Federal Communications Commission
      should have the flexibility to auction frequencies in the 700
      megahertz band for such purposes.
        "(3) The study being conducted by the National
      Telecommunications and Information Administration in consultation
      with the Department of Defense to determine whether the
      Department of Defense can share or relinquish additional spectrum
      for third generation wireless and other advanced communications
      services will not be completed until after the June 19th auction
      date for the upper 700 megahertz band, and long after the
      applications must be filed to participate in the auction, thereby
      creating further uncertainty as to whether the frequencies in the
      700 megahertz band will be put to their highest and best use for
      the benefit of consumers.
        "(4) The Federal Communications Commission is also in the
      process of determining how to resolve the interference problems
      that exist in the 800 megahertz band, especially for public
      safety. One option being considered for the 800 megahertz band
      would involve the 700 megahertz band. The Commission should not
      hold the 700 megahertz auction before the 800 megahertz
      interference issues are resolved or a tenable plan has been
      conceived.
        "(5) The 700 megahertz band is currently occupied by television
      broadcasters, and will be so until the transfer to digital
      television is completed. This situation creates a tremendous
      amount of uncertainty concerning when the spectrum will be
      available and reduces the value placed on the spectrum by
      potential bidders. The encumbrance of the 700 megahertz band
      reduces both the amount of money that the auction would be likely
      to produce and the probability that the spectrum would be
      purchased by the entities that valued the spectrum the most and
      would put the spectrum to its most productive use.
        "(6) The Commission's rules governing voluntary mechanisms for
      vacating the 700 megahertz band by broadcast stations - 
          "(A) produced no certainty that the band would be available
        for advanced mobile communications services, public safety
        operations, or other wireless services any earlier than the
        existing statutory framework provides; and
          "(B) should advance the transition of digital television and
        must not result in the unjust enrichment of any incumbent
        licensee."

                     COMPLIANCE WITH AUCTION AUTHORITY                 
      Pub. L. 107-195, Sec. 4, June 19, 2002, 116 Stat. 717, provided

    rescheduled auctions 31 and 44 prior to the expiration of the
    auction authority under section 309(j)(11) of the Communications
    Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)(11))."

    set out under section 609 of this title] shall be construed to
    relieve television broadcast station licensees of the obligation to

    (c) Authorization for aliens licensed by foreign governments;
      multilateral or bilateral agreement to which United States and
      foreign country are parties as prerequisite
      In addition to amateur station licenses which the Commission may
    issue to aliens pursuant to this chapter, the Commission may issue
    authorizations, under such conditions and terms as it may
    prescribe, to permit an alien licensed by his government as an
    amateur radio operator to operate his amateur radio station
    licensed by his government in the United States, its possessions,
    and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico provided there is in effect a
    multilateral or bilateral agreement, to which the United States and
    the alien's government are parties, for such operation on a
    reciprocal basis by United States amateur radio operators. Other
    provisions of this chapter and of subchapter II of chapter 5, and
    chapter 7, of title 5 shall not be applicable to any request or
    application for or modification, suspension, or cancellation of any
    such authorization.
    (d) Assignment and transfer of construction permit or station
      license
      No construction permit or station license, or any rights
    thereunder, shall be transferred, assigned, or disposed of in any
    manner, voluntarily or involuntarily, directly or indirectly, or by
    transfer of control of any corporation holding such permit or
    license, to any person except upon application to the Commission
    and upon finding by the Commission that the public interest,
    convenience, and necessity will be served thereby. Any such
    application shall be disposed of as if the proposed transferee or
    assignee were making application under section 308 of this title
    for the permit or license in question; but in acting thereon the
    Commission may not consider whether the public interest,
    convenience, and necessity might be served by the transfer,
    assignment, or disposal of the permit or license to a person other
    than the proposed transferee or assignee.
    (e) Administration of regional concentration rules for broadcast
      stations
      (1) In the case of any broadcast station, and any ownership
    interest therein, which is excluded from the regional concentration
    rules by reason of the savings provision for existing facilities
    provided by the First Report and Order adopted March 9, 1977
    (docket No. 20548; 42 Fed. Reg. 16145), the exclusion shall not
    terminate solely by reason of changes made in the technical
    facilities of the station to improve its service.
      (2) For purposes of this subsection, the term "regional
    concentration rules" means the provisions of sections 73.35,
    73.240, and 73.636 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations (as in
    effect June 1, 1983), which prohibit any party from directly or
    indirectly owning, operating, or controlling three broadcast
    stations in one or several services where any two of such stations
    are within 100 miles of the third (measured city-to-city), and
    where there is a primary service contour overlap of any of the
    stations.

      pursuant to section 308 of this title;
        (2) because of conditions coming to the attention of the
      Commission which would warrant it in refusing to grant a license

        (3) for willful or repeated failure to operate substantially as
      set forth in the license;
        (4) for willful or repeated violation of, or willful or

    (c) Order to show cause
      Before revoking a license or permit pursuant to subsection (a) of
    this section, or issuing a cease and desist order pursuant to
    subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall serve upon the
    licensee, permittee, or person involved an order to show cause why
    an order of revocation or a cease and desist order should not be
    issued. Any such order to show cause shall contain a statement of
    the matters with respect to which the Commission is inquiring and
    shall call upon said licensee, permittee, or person to appear
    before the Commission at a time and place stated in the order, but
    in no event less than thirty days after the receipt of such order,
    and give evidence upon the matter specified therein; except that
    where safety of life or property is involved, the Commission may
    provide in the order for a shorter period. If after hearing, or a
    waiver thereof, the Commission determines that an order of
    revocation or a cease and desist order should issue, it shall issue
    such order, which shall include a statement of the findings of the
    Commission and the grounds and reasons therefor and specify the
    effective date of the order, and shall cause the same to be served

      or regulation of the Commission authorized by this chapter or by
      a treaty ratified by the United States.

    any consecutive 12-month period, then the station license granted
    for the operation of that broadcast station expires at the end of
    that period, notwithstanding any provision, term, or condition of
    the license to the contrary, except that the Commission may extend
    or reinstate such station license if the holder of the station
    license prevails in an administrative or judicial appeal, the
    applicable law changes, or for any other reason to promote equity
    and fairness. Any broadcast license revoked or terminated in Alaska
    in a proceeding related to broadcasting via translator, microwave,
    or other alternative signal delivery is reinstated.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Revocation of licenses
      All laws of the United States relating to unlawful restraints and
    monopolies and to combinations, contracts, or agreements in
    restraint of trade are declared to be applicable to the manufacture
    and sale of and to trade in radio apparatus and devices entering
    into or affecting interstate or foreign commerce and to interstate
    or foreign radio communications. Whenever in any suit, action, or
    proceeding, civil or criminal, brought under the provisions of any
    of said laws or in any proceedings brought to enforce or to review
    findings and orders of the Federal Trade Commission or other
    governmental agency in respect of any matters as to which said
    Commission or other governmental agency is by law authorized to
    act, any licensee shall be found guilty of the violation of the
    provisions of such laws or any of them, the court, in addition to
    the penalties imposed by said laws, may adjudge, order, and/or
    decree that the license of such licensee shall, as of the date the
    decree or judgment becomes finally effective or as of such other
    date as the said decree shall fix, be revoked and that all rights
    under such license shall thereupon cease: Provided, however, That
    such licensee shall have the same right of appeal or review as is
    provided by law in respect of other decrees and judgments of said
    court.
    (b) Refusal of licenses and permits
      The Commission is hereby directed to refuse a station license
    and/or the permit hereinafter required for the construction of a
    station to any person (or to any person directly or indirectly
    controlled by such person) whose license has been revoked by a
    court under this section.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Equal opportunities requirement; censorship prohibition;
      allowance of station use; news appearances exception; public

    candidates for that office in the use of such broadcasting station:
    Provided, That such licensee shall have no power of censorship over
    the material broadcast under the provisions of this section. No

        station that the candidate (and any authorized committee of the
        candidate) shall not make any direct reference to another
        candidate for the same office, in any broadcast using the

        broadcast there appears simultaneously, for a period no less
        than 4 seconds - 
            (i) a clearly identifiable photographic or similar image of
          the candidate; and

    (a) Disclosure of person furnishing
      (1) All matter broadcast by any radio station for which any
    money, service or other valuable consideration is directly or
    indirectly paid, or promised to or charged or accepted by, the
    station so broadcasting, from any person, shall, at the time the
    same is so broadcast, be announced as paid for or furnished, as the
    case may be, by such person: Provided, That "service or other
    valuable consideration" shall not include any service or property
    furnished without charge or at a nominal charge for use on, or in
    connection with, a broadcast unless it is so furnished in
    consideration for an identification in a broadcast of any person,
    product, service, trademark, or brand name beyond an identification
    which is reasonably related to the use of such service or property
    on the broadcast.
      (2) Nothing in this section shall preclude the Commission from
    requiring that an appropriate announcement shall be made at the
    time of the broadcast in the case of any political program or any
    program involving the discussion of any controversial issue for
    which any films, records, transcriptions, talent, scripts, or other
    material or service of any kind have been furnished, without charge
    or at a nominal charge, directly or indirectly, as an inducement to
    the broadcast of such program.
    (b) Disclosure to station of payments
      In any case where a report has been made to a radio station, as
    required by section 508 of this title, of circumstances which would
    have required an announcement under this section had the
    consideration been received by such radio station, an appropriate
    announcement shall be made by such radio station.
    (c) Acquiring information from station employees
      The licensee of each radio station shall exercise reasonable
    diligence to obtain from its employees, and from other persons with
    whom it deals directly in connection with any program or program
    matter for broadcast, information to enable such licensee to make
    the announcement required by this section.
    (d) Waiver of announcement
      The Commission may waive the requirement of an announcement as
    provided in this section in any case or class of cases with respect
    to which it determines that the public interest, convenience, or
    necessity does not require the broadcasting of such announcement.
    (e) Rules and regulations
      The Commission shall prescribe appropriate rules and regulations
    to carry out the provisions of this section.

    Sec. 319. Construction permits

-STATUTE-
    (a) Requirements
      No license shall be issued under the authority of this chapter
    for the operation of any station unless a permit for its
    construction has been granted by the Commission. The application
    for a construction permit shall set forth such facts as the
    Commission by regulation may prescribe as to the citizenship,
    character, and the financial, technical, and other ability of the
    applicant to construct and operate the station, the ownership and
    location of the proposed station and of the station or stations
    with which it is proposed to communicate, the frequencies desired
    to be used, the hours of the day or other periods of time during
    which it is proposed to operate the station, the purpose for which
    the station is to be used, the type of transmitting apparatus to be
    used, the power to be used, the date upon which the station is
    expected to be completed and in operation, and such other
    information as the Commission may require. Such application shall
    be signed by the applicant in any manner or form, including by
    electronic means, as the Commission may prescribe by regulation.
    (b) Time limitation; forfeiture
      Such permit for construction shall show specifically the earliest
    and latest dates between which the actual operation of such station
    is expected to begin, and shall provide that said permit will be
    automatically forfeited if the station is not ready for operation
    within the time specified or within such further time as the
    Commission may allow, unless prevented by causes not under the
    control of the grantee.
    (c) Licenses for operation
      Upon the completion of any station for the construction or
    continued construction of which a permit has been granted, and upon
    it being made to appear to the Commission that all the terms,
    conditions, and obligations set forth in the application and permit
    have been fully met, and that no cause or circumstance arising or
    first coming to the knowledge of the Commission since the granting
    of the permit would, in the judgment of the Commission, make the
    operation of such station against the public interest, the
    Commission shall issue a license to the lawful holder of said
    permit for the operation of said station. Said license shall
    conform generally to the terms of said permit. The provisions of
    section 309(a)-(g) of this title shall not apply with respect to
    any station license the issuance of which is provided for and
    governed by the provisions of this subsection.
    (d) Government, amateur, or mobile station; waiver
      A permit for construction shall not be required for Government
    stations, amateur stations, or mobile stations. A permit for
    construction shall not be required for public coast stations,
    privately owned fixed microwave stations, or stations licensed to
    common carriers, unless the Commission determines that the public
    interest, convenience, and necessity would be served by requiring
    such permits for any such stations. With respect to any
    broadcasting station, the Commission shall not have any authority
    to waive the requirement of a permit for construction, except that
    the Commission may by regulation determine that a permit shall not
    be required for minor changes in the facilities of authorized
    broadcast stations. With respect to any other station or class of
    stations, the Commission shall not waive the requirement for a
    construction permit unless the Commission determines that the
    public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served by such
    a waiver.

    are liable to interfere with the transmission or reception of
    distress signals of ships. Such stations are required to keep a
    licensed radio operator listening in on the frequencies designated
    for signals of distress and radio communications relating thereto
    during the entire period the transmitter of such station is in
    operation.

      (a) The transmitting set in a radio station on shipboard may be
    adjusted in such a manner as to produce a maximum of radiation,
    irrespective of the amount of interference which may thus be
    caused, when such station is sending radio communications or
    signals of distress and radio communications relating thereto.
      (b) All radio stations, including Government stations and
    stations on board foreign vessels when within the territorial
    waters of the United States, shall give absolute priority to radio
    communications or signals relating to ships in distress; shall
    cease all sending on frequencies which will interfere with hearing
    a radio communication or signal of distress, and, except when
    engaged in answering or aiding the ship in distress, shall refrain
    from sending any radio communications or signals until there is
    assurance that no interference will be caused with the radio
    communications or signals relating thereto, and shall assist the
    vessel in distress, so far as possible, by complying with its
    instructions.

    Sec. 325. False, fraudulent, or unauthorized transmissions

-STATUTE-
    (a) False distress signals; rebroadcasting programs
      No person within the jurisdiction of the United States shall
    knowingly utter or transmit, or cause to be uttered or transmitted,
    any false or fraudulent signal of distress, or communication
    relating thereto, nor shall any broadcasting station rebroadcast
    the program or any part thereof of another broadcasting station
    without the express authority of the originating station.
    (b) Consent to retransmission of broadcasting station signals
      (1) No cable system or other multichannel video programming
    distributor shall retransmit the signal of a broadcasting station,
    or any part thereof, except - 
        (A) with the express authority of the originating station;
        (B) under section 534 of this title, in the case of a station
      electing, in accordance with this subsection, to assert the right
      to carriage under such section; or
        (C) under section 338 of this title, in the case of a station
      electing, in accordance with this subsection, to assert the right
      to carriage under such section.

      (2) This subsection shall not apply - 
        (A) to retransmission of the signal of a noncommercial
      television broadcast station;
        (B) to retransmission of the signal of a television broadcast
      station outside the station's local market by a satellite carrier
      directly to its subscribers, if - 
          (i) such station was a superstation on May 1, 1991;
          (ii) as of July 1, 1998, such station was retransmitted by a
        satellite carrier under the statutory license of section 119 of
        title 17; and
          (iii) the satellite carrier complies with any network
        nonduplication, syndicated exclusivity, and sports blackout
        rules adopted by the Commission under section 339(b) of this
        title;

        (C) until December 31, 2009, to retransmission of the signals
      of network stations directly to a home satellite antenna, if the
      subscriber receiving the signal - 
          (i) is located in an area outside the local market of such
        stations; and
          (ii) resides in an unserved household;

        (D) to retransmission by a cable operator or other multichannel
      video provider, other than a satellite carrier, of the signal of
      a television broadcast station outside the station's local market
      if such signal was obtained from a satellite carrier and - 
          (i) the originating station was a superstation on May 1,
        1991; and
          (ii) as of July 1, 1998, such station was retransmitted by a
        satellite carrier under the statutory license of section 119 of
        title 17; or

        (E) during the 6-month period beginning on November 29, 1999,
      to the retransmission of the signal of a television broadcast
      station within the station's local market by a satellite carrier
      directly to its subscribers under the statutory license of
      section 122 of title 17.

    For purposes of this paragraph, the terms "satellite carrier" and
    "superstation" have the meanings given those terms, respectively,
    in section 119(d) of title 17, as in effect on October 5, 1992, the
    term "unserved household" has the meaning given that term under
    section 119(d) of such title, and the term "local market" has the
    meaning given that term in section 122(j) of such title.
      (3)(A) Within 45 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall
    commence a rulemaking proceeding to establish regulations to govern
    the exercise by television broadcast stations of the right to grant
    retransmission consent under this subsection and of the right to
    signal carriage under section 534 of this title, and such other
    regulations as are necessary to administer the limitations
    contained in paragraph (2). The Commission shall consider in such
    proceeding the impact that the grant of retransmission consent by
    television stations may have on the rates for the basic service
    tier and shall ensure that the regulations prescribed under this
    subsection do not conflict with the Commission's obligation under
    section 543(b)(1) of this title to ensure that the rates for the
    basic service tier are reasonable. Such rulemaking proceeding shall
    be completed within 180 days after October 5, 1992.
      (B) The regulations required by subparagraph (A) shall require
    that television stations, within one year after October 5, 1992,
    and every three years thereafter, make an election between the
    right to grant retransmission consent under this subsection and the
    right to signal carriage under section 534 of this title. If there
    is more than one cable system which services the same geographic
    area, a station's election shall apply to all such cable systems.
      (C) The Commission shall commence a rulemaking proceeding to
    revise the regulations governing the exercise by television
    broadcast stations of the right to grant retransmission consent
    under this subsection, and such other regulations as are necessary
    to administer the limitations contained in paragraph (2). Such
    regulations shall - 
        (i) establish election time periods that correspond with those
      regulations adopted under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph;
        (ii) until January 1, 2010, prohibit a television broadcast
      station that provides retransmission consent from engaging in
      exclusive contracts for carriage or failing to negotiate in good
      faith, and it shall not be a failure to negotiate in good faith
      if the television broadcast station enters into retransmission
      consent agreements containing different terms and conditions,
      including price terms, with different multichannel video
      programming distributors if such different terms and conditions
      are based on competitive marketplace considerations; and
        (iii) until January 1, 2010, prohibit a multichannel video
      programming distributor from failing to negotiate in good faith
      for retransmission consent under this section, and it shall not
      be a failure to negotiate in good faith if the distributor enters
      into retransmission consent agreements containing different terms
      and conditions, including price terms, with different broadcast
      stations if such different terms and conditions are based on
      competitive marketplace considerations.

      (4) If an originating television station elects under paragraph
    (3)(B) to exercise its right to grant retransmission consent under
    this subsection with respect to a cable system, the provisions of
    section 534 of this title shall not apply to the carriage of the
    signal of such station by such cable system. If an originating
    television station elects under paragraph (3)(C) to exercise its
    right to grant retransmission consent under this subsection with
    respect to a satellite carrier, section 338 of this title shall not
    apply to the carriage of the signal of such station by such
    satellite carrier.
      (5) The exercise by a television broadcast station of the right
    to grant retransmission consent under this subsection shall not
    interfere with or supersede the rights under section 338, 534, or
    535 of this title of any station electing to assert the right to
    signal carriage under that section.
      (6) Nothing in this section shall be construed as modifying the
    compulsory copyright license established in section 111 of title 17
    or as affecting existing or future video programming licensing
    agreements between broadcasting stations and video programmers.
      (7) For purposes of this subsection, the term - 
        (A) "network station" has the meaning given such term under
      section 119(d) of title 17; and
        (B) "television broadcast station" means an over-the-air
      commercial or noncommercial television broadcast station licensed
      by the Commission under subpart E of part 73 of title 47, Code of
      Federal Regulations, except that such term does not include a low-
      power or translator television station.
    (c) Broadcast to foreign countries for rebroadcast to United
      States; permit
      No person shall be permitted to locate, use, or maintain a radio
    broadcast studio or other place or apparatus from which or whereby
    sound waves are converted into electrical energy, or mechanical or
    physical reproduction of sound waves produced, and caused to be
    transmitted or delivered to a radio station in a foreign country
    for the purpose of being broadcast from any radio station there
    having a power output of sufficient intensity and/or being so
    located geographically that its emissions may be received
    consistently in the United States, without first obtaining a permit
    from the Commission upon proper application therefor.
    (d) Application for permit
      Such application shall contain such information as the Commission
    may by regulation prescribe, and the granting or refusal thereof
    shall be subject to the requirements of section 309 of this title
    with respect to applications for station licenses or renewal or
    modification thereof, and the license or permission so granted
    shall be revocable for false statements in the application so
    required or when the Commission, after hearings, shall find its
    continuation no longer in the public interest.
    (e) Enforcement proceedings against satellite carriers concerning
      retransmissions of television broadcast stations in the
      respective local markets of such carriers
      (1) Complaints by television broadcast stations
        If after the expiration of the 6-month period described under
      subsection (b)(2)(E) of this section a television broadcast
      station believes that a satellite carrier has retransmitted its
      signal to any person in the local market of such station in
      violation of subsection (b)(1) of this section, the station may
      file with the Commission a complaint providing - 
          (A) the name, address, and call letters of the station;
          (B) the name and address of the satellite carrier;
          (C) the dates on which the alleged retransmission occurred;
          (D) the street address of at least one person in the local
        market of the station to whom the alleged retransmission was
        made;
          (E) a statement that the retransmission was not expressly
        authorized by the television broadcast station; and
          (F) the name and address of counsel for the station.
      (2) Service of complaints on satellite carriers
        For purposes of any proceeding under this subsection, any
      satellite carrier that retransmits the signal of any broadcast
      station shall be deemed to designate the Secretary of the
      Commission as its agent for service of process. A television
      broadcast station may serve a satellite carrier with a complaint
      concerning an alleged violation of subsection (b)(1) of this
      section through retransmission of a station within the local
      market of such station by filing the original and two copies of
      the complaint with the Secretary of the Commission and serving a
      copy of the complaint on the satellite carrier by means of two
      commonly used overnight delivery services, each addressed to the
      chief executive officer of the satellite carrier at its principal
      place of business, and each marked "URGENT LITIGATION MATTER" on
      the outer packaging. Service shall be deemed complete one
      business day after a copy of the complaint is provided to the
      delivery services for overnight delivery. On receipt of a
      complaint filed by a television broadcast station under this
      subsection, the Secretary of the Commission shall send the
      original complaint by United States mail, postage prepaid,
      receipt requested, addressed to the chief executive officer of
      the satellite carrier at its principal place of business.
      (3) Answers by satellite carriers
        Within five business days after the date of service, the
      satellite carrier shall file an answer with the Commission and
      shall serve the answer by a commonly used overnight delivery
      service and by United States mail, on the counsel designated in
      the complaint at the address listed for such counsel in the
      complaint.
      (4) Defenses
        (A) Exclusive defenses
          The defenses under this paragraph are the exclusive defenses
        available to a satellite carrier against which a complaint
        under this subsection is filed.
        (B) Defenses
          The defenses referred to under subparagraph (A) are the
        defenses that - 
            (i) the satellite carrier did not retransmit the television
          broadcast station to any person in the local market of the
          station during the time period specified in the complaint;
            (ii) the television broadcast station had, in a writing
          signed by an officer of the television broadcast station,
          expressly authorized the retransmission of the station by the
          satellite carrier to each person in the local market of the
          television broadcast station to which the satellite carrier
          made such retransmissions for the entire time period during
          which it is alleged that a violation of subsection (b)(1) of
          this section has occurred;
            (iii) the retransmission was made after January 1, 2002,
          and the television broadcast station had elected to assert
          the right to carriage under section 338 of this title as
          against the satellite carrier for the relevant period; or
            (iv) the station being retransmitted is a noncommercial
          television broadcast station.
      (5) Counting of violations
        The retransmission without consent of a particular television
      broadcast station on a particular day to one or more persons in
      the local market of the station shall be considered a separate
      violation of subsection (b)(1) of this section.
      (6) Burden of proof
        With respect to each alleged violation, the burden of proof
      shall be on a television broadcast station to establish that the
      satellite carrier retransmitted the station to at least one
      person in the local market of the station on the day in question.
      The burden of proof shall be on the satellite carrier with
      respect to all defenses other than the defense under paragraph
      (4)(B)(i).
      (7) Procedures
        (A) Regulations
          Within 60 days after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall
        issue procedural regulations implementing this subsection which
        shall supersede procedures under section 312 of this title.
        (B) Determinations
          (i) In general
            Within 45 days after the filing of a complaint, the
          Commission shall issue a final determination in any
          proceeding brought under this subsection. The Commission's
          final determination shall specify the number of violations
          committed by the satellite carrier. The Commission shall hear
          witnesses only if it clearly appears, based on written
          filings by the parties, that there is a genuine dispute about
          material facts. Except as provided in the preceding sentence,
          the Commission may issue a final ruling based on written
          filings by the parties.
          (ii) Discovery
            The Commission may direct the parties to exchange pertinent
          documents, and if necessary to take prehearing depositions,
          on such schedule as the Commission may approve, but only if
          the Commission first determines that such discovery is
          necessary to resolve a genuine dispute about material facts,
          consistent with the obligation to make a final determination
          within 45 days.
      (8) Relief
        If the Commission determines that a satellite carrier has
      retransmitted the television broadcast station to at least one
      person in the local market of such station and has failed to meet
      its burden of proving one of the defenses under paragraph (4)
      with respect to such retransmission, the Commission shall be
      required to - 
          (A) make a finding that the satellite carrier violated
        subsection (b)(1) of this section with respect to that station;
        and
          (B) issue an order, within 45 days after the filing of the
        complaint, containing - 
            (i) a cease-and-desist order directing the satellite
          carrier immediately to stop making any further
          retransmissions of the television broadcast station to any
          person within the local market of such station until such
          time as the Commission determines that the satellite carrier
          is in compliance with subsection (b)(1) of this section with
          respect to such station;
            (ii) if the satellite carrier is found to have violated
          subsection (b)(1) of this section with respect to more than
          two television broadcast stations, a cease-and-desist order
          directing the satellite carrier to stop making any further
          retransmission of any television broadcast station to any
          person within the local market of such station, until such
          time as the Commission, after giving notice to the station,
          that the satellite carrier is in compliance with subsection
          (b)(1) of this section with respect to such stations; and
            (iii) an award to the complainant of that complainant's
          costs and reasonable attorney's fees.
      (9) Court proceedings on enforcement of Commission order
        (A) In general
          On entry by the Commission of a final order granting relief
        under this subsection - 
            (i) a television broadcast station may apply within 30 days
          after such entry to the United States District Court for the
          Eastern District of Virginia for a final judgment enforcing
          all relief granted by the Commission; and
            (ii) the satellite carrier may apply within 30 days after
          such entry to the United States District Court for the
          Eastern District of Virginia for a judgment reversing the
          Commission's order.
        (B) Appeal
          The procedure for an appeal under this paragraph by the
        satellite carrier shall supersede any other appeal rights under
        Federal or State law. A United States district court shall be
        deemed to have personal jurisdiction over the satellite carrier
        if the carrier, or a company under common control with the
        satellite carrier, has delivered television programming by
        satellite to more than 30 customers in that district during the
        preceding 4-year period. If the United States District Court
        for the Eastern District of Virginia does not have personal
        jurisdiction over the satellite carrier, an enforcement action
        or appeal shall be brought in the United States District Court
        for the District of Columbia, which may find personal
        jurisdiction based on the satellite carrier's ownership of
        licenses issued by the Commission. An application by a
        television broadcast station for an order enforcing any cease-
        and-desist relief granted by the Commission shall be resolved
        on a highly expedited schedule. No discovery may be conducted
        by the parties in any such proceeding. The district court shall
        enforce the Commission order unless the Commission record
        reflects manifest error and an abuse of discretion by the
        Commission.
      (10) Civil action for statutory damages
        Within 6 months after issuance of an order by the Commission
      under this subsection, a television broadcast station may file a
      civil action in any United States district court that has
      personal jurisdiction over the satellite carrier for an award of
      statutory damages for any violation that the Commission has
      determined to have been committed by a satellite carrier under
      this subsection. Such action shall not be subject to transfer
      under section 1404(a) of title 28. On finding that the satellite
      carrier has committed one or more violations of subsection (b) of
      this section, the District Court shall be required to award the
      television broadcast station statutory damages of $25,000 per
      violation, in accordance with paragraph (5), and the costs and
      attorney's fees incurred by the station. Such statutory damages
      shall be awarded only if the television broadcast station has
      filed a binding stipulation with the court that such station will
      donate the full amount in excess of $1,000 of any statutory
      damage award to the United States Treasury for public purposes.
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a station shall incur
      no tax liability of any kind with respect to any amounts so
      donated. Discovery may be conducted by the parties in any
      proceeding under this paragraph only if and to the extent
      necessary to resolve a genuinely disputed issue of fact
      concerning one of the defenses under paragraph (4). In any such
      action, the defenses under paragraph (4) shall be exclusive, and
      the burden of proof shall be on the satellite carrier with
      respect to all defenses other than the defense under paragraph
      (4)(B)(i). A judgment under this paragraph may be enforced in any
      manner permissible under Federal or State law.
      (11) Appeals
        (A) In general
          The nonprevailing party before a United States district court
        may appeal a decision under this subsection to the United
        States Court of Appeals with jurisdiction over that district
        court. The Court of Appeals shall not issue any stay of the
        effectiveness of any decision granting relief against a
        satellite carrier unless the carrier presents clear and
        convincing evidence that it is highly likely to prevail on
        appeal and only after posting a bond for the full amount of any
        monetary award assessed against it and for such further amount
        as the Court of Appeals may believe appropriate.
        (B) Appeal
          If the Commission denies relief in response to a complaint
        filed by a television broadcast station under this subsection,
        the television broadcast station filing the complaint may file
        an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the
        District of Columbia Circuit.
      (12) Sunset
        No complaint or civil action may be filed under this subsection
      after December 31, 2001. This subsection shall continue to apply
      to any complaint or civil action filed on or before such date.

    Sec. 330. Prohibition against shipment of certain television
      receivers

-STATUTE-
      (a) No person shall ship in interstate commerce, or import from
    any foreign country into the United States, for sale or resale to
    the public, apparatus described in subsection (s) of section 303 of
    this title unless it complies with rules prescribed by the
    Commission pursuant to the authority granted by that subsection:
    Provided, That this section shall not apply to carriers
    transporting such apparatus without trading in it.
      (b) No person shall ship in interstate commerce, manufacture,
    assemble, or import from any foreign country into the United
    States, any apparatus described in section 303(u) of this title
    except in accordance with rules prescribed by the Commission
    pursuant to the authority granted by that section. Such rules shall
    provide performance and display standards for such built-in decoder
    circuitry. Such rules shall further require that all such apparatus
    be able to receive and display closed captioning which have been
    transmitted by way of line 21 of the vertical blanking interval and
    which conform to the signal and display specifications set forth in
    the Public Broadcasting System engineering report numbered E-7709-C
    dated May 1980, as amended by the Telecaption II Decoder Module
    Performance Specification published by the National Captioning
    Institute, November 1985. As new video technology is developed, the
    Commission shall take such action as the Commission determines
    appropriate to ensure that closed-captioning service continues to
    be available to consumers. This subsection shall not apply to
    carriers transporting such apparatus without trading it.
      (c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no person shall ship
    in interstate commerce or manufacture in the United States any
    apparatus described in section 303(x) of this title except in
    accordance with rules prescribed by the Commission pursuant to the
    authority granted by that section.
      (2) This subsection shall not apply to carriers transporting
    apparatus referred to in paragraph (1) without trading in it.
      (3) The rules prescribed by the Commission under this subsection
    shall provide for the oversight by the Commission of the adoption
    of standards by industry for blocking technology. Such rules shall
    require that all such apparatus be able to receive the rating
    signals which have been transmitted by way of line 21 of the
    vertical blanking interval and which conform to the signal and
    blocking specifications established by industry under the
    supervision of the Commission.
      (4) As new video technology is developed, the Commission shall
    take such action as the Commission determines appropriate to ensure
    that blocking service continues to be available to consumers. If
    the Commission determines that an alternative blocking technology
    exists that - 
        (A) enables parents to block programming based on identifying
      programs without ratings,
        (B) is available to consumers at a cost which is comparable to
      the cost of technology that allows parents to block programming
      based on common ratings, and
        (C) will allow parents to block a broad range of programs on a
      multichannel system as effectively and as easily as technology
      that allows parents to block programming based on common ratings,

    the Commission shall amend the rules prescribed pursuant to section
    303(x) of this title to require that the apparatus described in
    such section be equipped with either the blocking technology
    described in such section or the alternative blocking technology
    described in this paragraph.
      (d) For the purposes of this section, and sections 303(s),
    303(u), and 303(x) of this title - 
        (1) The term "interstate commerce" means (A) commerce between
      any State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto
      Rico, or any possession of the United States and any place
      outside thereof which is within the United States, (B) commerce
      between points in the same State, the District of Columbia, the
      Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or possession of the United States
      but through any place outside thereof, or (C) commerce wholly
      within the District of Columbia or any possession of the United
      States.
        (2) The term "United States" means the several States, the
      District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the
      possessions of the United States, but does not include the Canal
      Zone.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 331. Very high frequency stations and AM radio stations

-STATUTE-
    (a) Very high frequency stations
      It shall be the policy of the Federal Communications Commission
    to allocate channels for very high frequency commercial television
    broadcasting in a manner which ensures that not less than one such
    channel shall be allocated to each State, if technically feasible.
    In any case in which licensee of a very high frequency commercial
    television broadcast station notifies the Commission to the effect
    that such licensee will agree to the reallocation of its channel to
    a community within a State in which there is allocated no very high
    frequency commercial television broadcast channel at the time (!1)
    such notification, the Commission shall, notwithstanding any other
    provision of law, order such reallocation and issue a license to
    such licensee for that purpose pursuant to such notification for a
    term of not to exceed 5 years as provided in section 307(d) (!2) of
    this title.


    (b) AM radio stations
      It shall be the policy of the Commission, in any case in which
    the licensee of an existing AM daytime-only station located in a
    community with a population of more than 100,000 persons that lacks
    a local full-time aural station licensed to that community and that
    is located within a Class I station primary service area notifies
    the Commission that such licensee seeks to provide full-time
    service, to ensure that such a licensee is able to place a
    principal community contour signal over its entire community of
    license 24 hours a day, if technically feasible. The Commission
    shall report to the appropriate committees of Congress within 30
    days after December 20, 1991, on how it intends to meet this policy
    goal.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 332. Mobile services

-STATUTE-
    (a) Factors which Commission must consider
      In taking actions to manage the spectrum to be made available for
    use by the private mobile services, the Commission shall consider,
    consistent with section 151 of this title, whether such actions
    will - 
        (1) promote the safety of life and property;
        (2) improve the efficiency of spectrum use and reduce the
      regulatory burden upon spectrum users, based upon sound
      engineering principles, user operational requirements, and
      marketplace demands;
        (3) encourage competition and provide services to the largest
      feasible number of users; or
        (4) increase interservice sharing opportunities between private
      mobile services and other services.
    (b) Advisory coordinating committees
      (1) The Commission, in coordinating the assignment of frequencies
    to stations in the private mobile services and in the fixed
    services (as defined by the Commission by rule), shall have
    authority to utilize assistance furnished by advisory coordinating
    committees consisting of individuals who are not officers or
    employees of the Federal Government.
      (2) The authority of the Commission established in this
    subsection shall not be subject to or affected by the provisions of
    part III of title 5 or section 1342 of title 31.
      (3) Any person who provides assistance to the Commission under
    this subsection shall not be considered, by reason of having
    provided such assistance, a Federal employee.
      (4) Any advisory coordinating committee which furnishes
    assistance to the Commission under this subsection shall not be
    subject to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.
    (c) Regulatory treatment of mobile services
      (1) Common carrier treatment of commercial mobile services
        (A) A person engaged in the provision of a service that is a
      commercial mobile service shall, insofar as such person is so
      engaged, be treated as a common carrier for purposes of this
      chapter, except for such provisions of subchapter II of this
      chapter as the Commission may specify by regulation as
      inapplicable to that service or person. In prescribing or
      amending any such regulation, the Commission may not specify any
      provision of section 201, 202, or 208 of this title, and may
      specify any other provision only if the Commission determines
      that - 
          (i) enforcement of such provision is not necessary in order
        to ensure that the charges, practices, classifications, or
        regulations for or in connection with that service are just and
        reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory;
          (ii) enforcement of such provision is not necessary for the
        protection of consumers; and
          (iii) specifying such provision is consistent with the public
        interest.

        (B) Upon reasonable request of any person providing commercial
      mobile service, the Commission shall order a common carrier to
      establish physical connections with such service pursuant to the
      provisions of section 201 of this title. Except to the extent
      that the Commission is required to respond to such a request,
      this subparagraph shall not be construed as a limitation or
      expansion of the Commission's authority to order interconnection
      pursuant to this chapter.
        (C) The Commission shall review competitive market conditions
      with respect to commercial mobile services and shall include in
      its annual report an analysis of those conditions. Such analysis
      shall include an identification of the number of competitors in
      various commercial mobile services, an analysis of whether or not
      there is effective competition, an analysis of whether any of
      such competitors have a dominant share of the market for such
      services, and a statement of whether additional providers or
      classes of providers in those services would be likely to enhance
      competition. As a part of making a determination with respect to
      the public interest under subparagraph (A)(iii), the Commission
      shall consider whether the proposed regulation (or amendment
      thereof) will promote competitive market conditions, including
      the extent to which such regulation (or amendment) will enhance
      competition among providers of commercial mobile services. If the
      Commission determines that such regulation (or amendment) will
      promote competition among providers of commercial mobile
      services, such determination may be the basis for a Commission
      finding that such regulation (or amendment) is in the public
      interest.
        (D) The Commission shall, not later than 180 days after August
      10, 1993, complete a rulemaking required to implement this
      paragraph with respect to the licensing of personal
      communications services, including making any determinations
      required by subparagraph (C).
      (2) Non-common carrier treatment of private mobile services
        A person engaged in the provision of a service that is a
      private mobile service shall not, insofar as such person is so
      engaged, be treated as a common carrier for any purpose under
      this chapter. A common carrier (other than a person that was
      treated as a provider of a private land mobile service prior to
      August 10, 1993) shall not provide any dispatch service on any
      frequency allocated for common carrier service, except to the
      extent such dispatch service is provided on stations licensed in
      the domestic public land mobile radio service before January 1,
      1982. The Commission may by regulation terminate, in whole or in
      part, the prohibition contained in the preceding sentence if the
      Commission determines that such termination will serve the public
      interest.
      (3) State preemption
        (A) Notwithstanding sections 152(b) and 221(b) of this title,
      no State or local government shall have any authority to regulate
      the entry of or the rates charged by any commercial mobile
      service or any private mobile service, except that this paragraph
      shall not prohibit a State from regulating the other terms and
      conditions of commercial mobile services. Nothing in this
      subparagraph shall exempt providers of commercial mobile services
      (where such services are a substitute for land line telephone
      exchange service for a substantial portion of the communications
      within such State) from requirements imposed by a State
      commission on all providers of telecommunications services
      necessary to ensure the universal availability of
      telecommunications service at affordable rates. Notwithstanding
      the first sentence of this subparagraph, a State may petition the
      Commission for authority to regulate the rates for any commercial
      mobile service and the Commission shall grant such petition if
      such State demonstrates that - 
          (i) market conditions with respect to such services fail to
        protect subscribers adequately from unjust and unreasonable
        rates or rates that are unjustly or unreasonably
        discriminatory; or
          (ii) such market conditions exist and such service is a
        replacement for land line telephone exchange service for a
        substantial portion of the telephone land line exchange service
        within such State.

      The Commission shall provide reasonable opportunity for public
      comment in response to such petition, and shall, within 9 months
      after the date of its submission, grant or deny such petition. If
      the Commission grants such petition, the Commission shall
      authorize the State to exercise under State law such authority
      over rates, for such periods of time, as the Commission deems
      necessary to ensure that such rates are just and reasonable and
      not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory.
        (B) If a State has in effect on June 1, 1993, any regulation
      concerning the rates for any commercial mobile service offered in
      such State on such date, such State may, no later than 1 year
      after August 10, 1993, petition the Commission requesting that
      the State be authorized to continue exercising authority over
      such rates. If a State files such a petition, the State's
      existing regulation shall, notwithstanding subparagraph (A),
      remain in effect until the Commission completes all action
      (including any reconsideration) on such petition. The Commission
      shall review such petition in accordance with the procedures
      established in such subparagraph, shall complete all action
      (including any reconsideration) within 12 months after such
      petition is filed, and shall grant such petition if the State
      satisfies the showing required under subparagraph (A)(i) or
      (A)(ii). If the Commission grants such petition, the Commission
      shall authorize the State to exercise under State law such
      authority over rates, for such period of time, as the Commission
      deems necessary to ensure that such rates are just and reasonable
      and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. After a
      reasonable period of time, as determined by the Commission, has
      elapsed from the issuance of an order under subparagraph (A) or
      this subparagraph, any interested party may petition the
      Commission for an order that the exercise of authority by a State
      pursuant to such subparagraph is no longer necessary to ensure
      that the rates for commercial mobile services are just and
      reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. The
      Commission shall provide reasonable opportunity for public
      comment in response to such petition, and shall, within 9 months
      after the date of its submission, grant or deny such petition in
      whole or in part.
      (4) Regulatory treatment of communications satellite corporation
        Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to alter or
      affect the regulatory treatment required by title IV of the
      Communications Satellite Act of 1962 [47 U.S.C. 741 et seq.] of
      the corporation authorized by title III of such Act [47 U.S.C.
      731 et seq.].
      (5) Space segment capacity
        Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Commission from
      continuing to determine whether the provision of space segment
      capacity by satellite systems to providers of commercial mobile
      services shall be treated as common carriage.
      (6) Foreign ownership
        The Commission, upon a petition for waiver filed within 6
      months after August 10, 1993, may waive the application of
      section 310(b) of this title to any foreign ownership that
      lawfully existed before May 24, 1993, of any provider of a
      private land mobile service that will be treated as a common
      carrier as a result of the enactment of the Omnibus Budget
      Reconciliation Act of 1993, but only upon the following
      conditions:
          (A) The extent of foreign ownership interest shall not be
        increased above the extent which existed on May 24, 1993.
          (B) Such waiver shall not permit the subsequent transfer of
        ownership to any other person in violation of section 310(b) of
        this title.
      (7) Preservation of local zoning authority
        (A) General authority
          Except as provided in this paragraph, nothing in this chapter
        shall limit or affect the authority of a State or local
        government or instrumentality thereof over decisions regarding
        the placement, construction, and modification of personal
        wireless service facilities.
        (B) Limitations
          (i) The regulation of the placement, construction, and
        modification of personal wireless service facilities by any
        State or local government or instrumentality thereof - 
            (I) shall not unreasonably discriminate among providers of
          functionally equivalent services; and
            (II) shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting
          the provision of personal wireless services.

          (ii) A State or local government or instrumentality thereof
        shall act on any request for authorization to place, construct,
        or modify personal wireless service facilities within a
        reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed with
        such government or instrumentality, taking into account the
        nature and scope of such request.
          (iii) Any decision by a State or local government or
        instrumentality thereof to deny a request to place, construct,
        or modify personal wireless service facilities shall be in
        writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a
        written record.
          (iv) No State or local government or instrumentality thereof
        may regulate the placement, construction, and modification of
        personal wireless service facilities on the basis of the
        environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the
        extent that such facilities comply with the Commission's
        regulations concerning such emissions.
          (v) Any person adversely affected by any final action or
        failure to act by a State or local government or any
        instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with this
        subparagraph may, within 30 days after such action or failure
        to act, commence an action in any court of competent
        jurisdiction. The court shall hear and decide such action on an
        expedited basis. Any person adversely affected by an act or
        failure to act by a State or local government or any
        instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with clause (iv)
        may petition the Commission for relief.
        (C) Definitions
          For purposes of this paragraph - 
            (i) the term "personal wireless services" means commercial
          mobile services, unlicensed wireless services, and common
          carrier wireless exchange access services;
            (ii) the term "personal wireless service facilities" means
          facilities for the provision of personal wireless services;
          and
            (iii) the term "unlicensed wireless service" means the
          offering of telecommunications services using duly authorized
          devices which do not require individual licenses, but does
          not mean the provision of direct-to-home satellite services
          (as defined in section 303(v) of this title).
      (8) Mobile services access
        A person engaged in the provision of commercial mobile
      services, insofar as such person is so engaged, shall not be
      required to provide equal access to common carriers for the
      provision of telephone toll services. If the Commission
      determines that subscribers to such services are denied access to
      the provider of telephone toll services of the subscribers'
      choice, and that such denial is contrary to the public interest,
      convenience, and necessity, then the Commission shall prescribe
      regulations to afford subscribers unblocked access to the
      provider of telephone toll services of the subscribers' choice
      through the use of a carrier identification code assigned to such
      provider or other mechanism. The requirements for unblocking
      shall not apply to mobile satellite services unless the
      Commission finds it to be in the public interest to apply such
      requirements to such services.

    amendments made by this section [amending this section and sections
    152, 153, and 309 of this title] are effective on the date of

        "(B) any private land mobile service provided by any person
      before such date of enactment, and any paging service utilizing

    under their control for the placement of new telecommunications
    services that are dependent, in whole or in part, upon the
    utilization of Federal spectrum rights for the transmission or
    reception of such services. These procedures may establish a
    presumption that requests for the use of property, rights-of-way,
    and easements by duly authorized providers should be granted absent
    unavoidable direct conflict with the department or agency's
    mission, or the current or planned use of the property, rights-of-
    way, and easements in question. Reasonable fees may be charged to
    providers of such telecommunications services for use of property,
    rights-of-way, and easements. The Commission shall provide
    technical support to States to encourage them to make property,
    rights-of-way, and easements under their jurisdiction available for
    such purposes."

           TRANSITIONAL RULEMAKING FOR MOBILE SERVICE PROVIDERS       
      Section 6002(d)(3) of Pub. L. 103-66 provided that: "Within 1
    year after the date of enactment of this Act [Aug. 10, 1993], the

      sections 152 and 153 of this title];
        "(B) in the regulations that will, after such date of
      enactment, apply to a service that was a private land mobile

      modifications or terminations as may be necessary and practical
      to assure that licensees in such service are subjected to
      technical requirements that are comparable to the technical
      requirements that apply to licensees that are providers of
      substantially similar common carrier services;
        "(C) shall issue such other regulations as are necessary to
      implement the amendments made by subsection (b)(2); and
        "(D) shall include, in such regulations, modifications, and

    Sec. 335. Direct broadcast satellite service obligations

-STATUTE-
    (a) Proceeding required to review DBS responsibilities
      The Commission shall, within 180 days after October 5, 1992,
    initiate a rulemaking proceeding to impose, on providers of direct
    broadcast satellite service, public interest or other requirements
    for providing video programming. Any regulations prescribed
    pursuant to such rulemaking shall, at a minimum, apply the access
    to broadcast time requirement of section 312(a)(7) of this title
    and the use of facilities requirements of section 315 of this title
    to providers of direct broadcast satellite service providing video
    programming. Such proceeding also shall examine the opportunities
    that the establishment of direct broadcast satellite service
    provides for the principle of localism under this chapter, and the
    methods by which such principle may be served through technological
    and other developments in, or regulation of, such service.
    (b) Carriage obligations for noncommercial, educational, and
      informational programming
      (1) Channel capacity required
        The Commission shall require, as a condition of any provision,
      initial authorization, or authorization renewal for a provider of
      direct broadcast satellite service providing video programming,
      that the provider of such service reserve a portion of its
      channel capacity, equal to not less than 4 percent nor more than
      7 percent, exclusively for noncommercial programming of an
      educational or informational nature.
      (2) Use of unused channel capacity
        A provider of such service may utilize for any purpose any
      unused channel capacity required to be reserved under this
      subsection pending the actual use of such channel capacity for
      noncommercial programming of an educational or informational
      nature.
      (3) Prices, terms, and conditions; editorial control
        A provider of direct broadcast satellite service shall meet the
      requirements of this subsection by making channel capacity
      available to national educational programming suppliers, upon
      reasonable prices, terms, and conditions, as determined by the
      Commission under paragraph (4). The provider of direct broadcast
      satellite service shall not exercise any editorial control over
      any video programming provided pursuant to this subsection.
      (4) Limitations
        In determining reasonable prices under paragraph (3) - 
          (A) the Commission shall take into account the nonprofit
        character of the programming provider and any Federal funds
        used to support such programming;
          (B) the Commission shall not permit such prices to exceed,
        for any channel made available under this subsection, 50
        percent of the total direct costs of making such channel
        available; and
          (C) in the calculation of total direct costs, the Commission
        shall exclude - 
            (i) marketing costs, general administrative costs, and
          similar overhead costs of the provider of direct broadcast
          satellite service; and
            (ii) the revenue that such provider might have obtained by
          making such channel available to a commercial provider of
          video programming.
      (5) Definitions
        For purposes of this subsection - 
          (A) The term "provider of direct broadcast satellite service"
        means - 
            (i) a licensee for a Ku-band satellite system under part
          100 of title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations; or
            (ii) any distributor who controls a minimum number of
          channels (as specified by Commission regulation) using a Ku-
          band fixed service satellite system for the provision of
          video programming directly to the home and licensed under
          part 25 of title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

          (B) The term "national educational programming supplier"
        includes any qualified noncommercial educational television
        station, other public telecommunications entities, and public
        or private educational institutions.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 336. Broadcast spectrum flexibility

-STATUTE-
    (a) Commission action
      If the Commission determines to issue additional licenses for
    advanced television services, the Commission - 
        (1) should limit the initial eligibility for such licenses to
      persons that, as of the date of such issuance, are licensed to
      operate a television broadcast station or hold a permit to
      construct such a station (or both); and
        (2) shall adopt regulations that allow the holders of such
      licenses to offer such ancillary or supplementary services on
      designated frequencies as may be consistent with the public
      interest, convenience, and necessity.
    (b) Contents of regulations
      In prescribing the regulations required by subsection (a) of this
    section, the Commission shall - 
        (1) only permit such licensee or permittee to offer ancillary
      or supplementary services if the use of a designated frequency
      for such services is consistent with the technology or method
      designated by the Commission for the provision of advanced
      television services;
        (2) limit the broadcasting of ancillary or supplementary
      services on designated frequencies so as to avoid derogation of
      any advanced television services, including high definition
      television broadcasts, that the Commission may require using such
      frequencies;
        (3) apply to any other ancillary or supplementary service such
      of the Commission's regulations as are applicable to the offering
      of analogous services by any other person, except that no
      ancillary or supplementary service shall have any rights to
      carriage under section 534 or 535 of this title or be deemed a
      multichannel video programming distributor for purposes of
      section 548 of this title;
        (4) adopt such technical and other requirements as may be
      necessary or appropriate to assure the quality of the signal used
      to provide advanced television services, and may adopt
      regulations that stipulate the minimum number of hours per day
      that such signal must be transmitted; and
        (5) prescribe such other regulations as may be necessary for
      the protection of the public interest, convenience, and
      necessity.
    (c) Recovery of license
      If the Commission grants a license for advanced television
    services to a person that, as of the date of such issuance, is
    licensed to operate a television broadcast station or holds a
    permit to construct such a station (or both), the Commission shall,
    as a condition of such license, require that either the additional
    license or the original license held by the licensee be surrendered
    to the Commission for reallocation or reassignment (or both)
    pursuant to Commission regulation.
    (d) Public interest requirement
      Nothing in this section shall be construed as relieving a
    television broadcasting station from its obligation to serve the
    public interest, convenience, and necessity. In the Commission's
    review of any application for renewal of a broadcast license for a
    television station that provides ancillary or supplementary
    services, the television licensee shall establish that all of its
    program services on the existing or advanced television spectrum
    are in the public interest. Any violation of the Commission rules
    applicable to ancillary or supplementary services shall reflect
    upon the licensee's qualifications for renewal of its license.
    (e) Fees
      (1) Services to which fees apply
        If the regulations prescribed pursuant to subsection (a) of
      this section permit a licensee to offer ancillary or
      supplementary services on a designated frequency - 
          (A) for which the payment of a subscription fee is required
        in order to receive such services, or
          (B) for which the licensee directly or indirectly receives
        compensation from a third party in return for transmitting
        material furnished by such third party (other than commercial
        advertisements used to support broadcasting for which a
        subscription fee is not required),

      the Commission shall establish a program to assess and collect
      from the licensee for such designated frequency an annual fee or
      other schedule or method of payment that promotes the objectives
      described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2).
      (2) Collection of fees
        The program required by paragraph (1) shall - 
          (A) be designed (i) to recover for the public a portion of
        the value of the public spectrum resource made available for
        such commercial use, and (ii) to avoid unjust enrichment
        through the method employed to permit such uses of that
        resource;
          (B) recover for the public an amount that, to the extent
        feasible, equals but does not exceed (over the term of the
        license) the amount that would have been recovered had such
        services been licensed pursuant to the provisions of section
        309(j) of this title and the Commission's regulations
        thereunder; and
          (C) be adjusted by the Commission from time to time in order
        to continue to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.
      (3) Treatment of revenues
        (A) General rule
          Except as provided in subparagraph (B), all proceeds obtained
        pursuant to the regulations required by this subsection shall
        be deposited in the Treasury in accordance with chapter 33 of
        title 31.
        (B) Retention of revenues
          Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the salaries and expenses
        account of the Commission shall retain as an offsetting
        collection such sums as may be necessary from such proceeds for
        the costs of developing and implementing the program required
        by this section and regulating and supervising advanced
        television services. Such offsetting collections shall be
        available for obligation subject to the terms and conditions of
        the receiving appropriations account, and shall be deposited in
        such accounts on a quarterly basis.
      (4) Report
        Within 5 years after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall
      report to the Congress on the implementation of the program
      required by this subsection, and shall annually thereafter advise
      the Congress on the amounts collected pursuant to such program.
    (f) Preservation of low-power community television broadcasting
      (1) Creation of class A licenses
        (A) Rulemaking required
          Within 120 days after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall
        prescribe regulations to establish a class A television license
        to be available to licensees of qualifying low-power television
        stations. Such regulations shall provide that - 
            (i) the license shall be subject to the same license terms
          and renewal standards as the licenses for full-power
          television stations except as provided in this subsection;
          and
            (ii) each such class A licensee shall be accorded primary
          status as a television broadcaster as long as the station
          continues to meet the requirements for a qualifying low-power
          station in paragraph (2).
        (B) Notice to and certification by licensees
          Within 30 days after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall
        send a notice to the licensees of all low-power television
        licenses that describes the requirements for class A
        designation. Within 60 days after November 29, 1999, licensees
        intending to seek class A designation shall submit to the
        Commission a certification of eligibility based on the
        qualification requirements of this subsection. Absent a
        material deficiency, the Commission shall grant certification
        of eligibility to apply for class A status.
        (C) Application for and award of licenses
          Consistent with the requirements set forth in paragraph
        (2)(A) of this subsection, a licensee may submit an application
        for class A designation under this paragraph within 30 days
        after final regulations are adopted under subparagraph (A) of
        this paragraph. Except as provided in paragraphs (6) and (7),
        the Commission shall, within 30 days after receipt of an
        application of a licensee of a qualifying low-power television
        station that is acceptable for filing, award such a class A
        television station license to such licensee.
        (D) Resolution of technical problems
          The Commission shall act to preserve the service areas of low-
        power television licensees pending the final resolution of a
        class A application. If, after granting certification of
        eligibility for a class A license, technical problems arise
        requiring an engineering solution to a full-power station's
        allotted parameters or channel assignment in the digital
        television Table of Allotments, the Commission shall make such
        modifications as necessary - 
            (i) to ensure replication of the full-power digital
          television applicant's service area, as provided for in
          sections 73.622 and 73.623 of the Commission's regulations
          (47 CFR 73.622, 73.623); and
            (ii) to permit maximization of a full-power digital
          television applicant's service area consistent with such
          sections 73.622 and 73.623,

        if such applicant has filed an application for maximization or
        a notice of its intent to seek such maximization by December
        31, 1999, and filed a bona fide application for maximization by
        May 1, 2000. Any such applicant shall comply with all
        applicable Commission rules regarding the construction of
        digital television facilities.
        (E) Change applications
          If a station that is awarded a construction permit to
        maximize or significantly enhance its digital television
        service area, later files a change application to reduce its
        digital television service area, the protected contour of that
        station shall be reduced in accordance with such change
        modification.
      (2) Qualifying low-power television stations
        For purposes of this subsection, a station is a qualifying low-
      power television station if - 
          (A)(i) during the 90 days preceding November 29, 1999 - 
            (I) such station broadcast a minimum of 18 hours per day;
            (II) such station broadcast an average of at least 3 hours
          per week of programming that was produced within the market
          area served by such station, or the market area served by a
          group of commonly controlled low-power stations that carry
          common local programming produced within the market area
          served by such group; and
            (III) such station was in compliance with the Commission's
          requirements applicable to low-power television stations; and

          (ii) from and after the date of its application for a class A
        license, the station is in compliance with the Commission's
        operating rules for full-power television stations; or
          (B) the Commission determines that the public interest,
        convenience, and necessity would be served by treating the
        station as a qualifying low-power television station for
        purposes of this section, or for other reasons determined by
        the Commission.
      (3) Common ownership
        No low-power television station authorized as of November 29,
      1999, shall be disqualified for a class A license based on common
      ownership with any other medium of mass communication.
      (4) Issuance of licenses for advanced television services to
        television translator stations and qualifying low-power
        television stations
        The Commission is not required to issue any additional license
      for advanced television services to the licensee of a class A
      television station under this subsection, or to any licensee of
      any television translator station, but shall accept a license
      application for such services proposing facilities that will not
      cause interference to the service area of any other broadcast
      facility applied for, protected, permitted, or authorized on the
      date of filing of the advanced television application. Such new
      license or the original license of the applicant shall be
      forfeited after the end of the digital television service
      transition period, as determined by the Commission. A licensee of
      a low-power television station or television translator station
      may, at the option of licensee, elect to convert to the provision
      of advanced television services on its analog channel, but shall
      not be required to convert to digital operation until the end of
      such transition period.
      (5) No preemption of section 337
        Nothing in this subsection preempts or otherwise affects
      section 337 of this title.
      (6) Interim qualification
        (A) Stations operating within certain bandwidth
          The Commission may not grant a class A license to a low-power
        television station for operation between 698 and 806 megahertz,
        but the Commission shall provide to low-power television
        stations assigned to and temporarily operating in that
        bandwidth the opportunity to meet the qualification
        requirements for a class A license. If such a qualified
        applicant for a class A license is assigned a channel within
        the core spectrum (as such term is defined in MM Docket No. 87-
        286, February 17, 1998), the Commission shall issue a class A
        license simultaneously with the assignment of such channel.
        (B) Certain channels off-limits
          The Commission may not grant under this subsection a class A
        license to a low-power television station operating on a
        channel within the core spectrum that includes any of the 175
        additional channels referenced in paragraph 45 of its February
        23, 1998, Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration of
        the Sixth Report and Order (MM Docket No. 87-268). Within 18
        months after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall identify
        by channel, location, and applicable technical parameters those
        175 channels.
      (7) No interference requirement
        The Commission may not grant a class A license, nor approve a
      modification of a class A license, unless the applicant or
      licensee shows that the class A station for which the license or
      modification is sought will not cause - 
          (A) interference within - 
            (i) the predicted Grade B contour (as of the date of the
          enactment of the Community Broadcasters Protection Act of
          1999 [November 29, 1999], or November 1, 1999, whichever is
          later, or as proposed in a change application filed on or
          before such date) of any television station transmitting in
          analog format; or
            (ii)(I) the digital television service areas provided in

          and (f)); (III) the digital television service areas of
          stations subsequently granted by the Commission prior to the
          filing of a class A application; and (IV) stations seeking to
          maximize power under the Commission's rules, if such station
          has complied with the notification requirements in paragraph
          (1)(D);

          (B) interference within the protected contour of any low-
        power television station or low-power television translator
        station that - 
            (i) was licensed prior to the date on which the application
          for a class A license, or for the modification of such a
          license, was filed;
            (ii) was authorized by construction permit prior to such
          date; or
            (iii) had a pending application that was submitted prior to
          such date; or

          (C) interference within the protected contour of 80 miles
        from the geographic center of the areas listed in section
        22.625(b)(1) or 90.303 of the Commission's regulations (47 CFR
        22.625(b)(1) and 90.303) for frequencies in - 
            (i) the 470-512 megahertz band identified in section 22.621
          or 90.303 of such regulations; or
            (ii) the 482-488 megahertz band in New York.
      (8) Priority for displaced low-power stations
        Low-power stations that are displaced by an application filed
      under this section shall have priority over other low-power
      stations in the assignment of available channels.
    (g) Evaluation
      Within 10 years after the date the Commission first issues
    additional licenses for advanced television services, the
    Commission shall conduct an evaluation of the advanced television
    services program. Such evaluation shall include - 
        (1) an assessment of the willingness of consumers to purchase
      the television receivers necessary to receive broadcasts of
      advanced television services;
        (2) an assessment of alternative uses, including public safety
      use, of the frequencies used for such broadcasts; and
        (3) the extent to which the Commission has been or will be able
      to reduce the amount of spectrum assigned to licensees.
    (h) Provision of digital data service by low-power television
      stations
      (1) Within 60 days after receiving a request (made in such form
    and manner and containing such information as the Commission may
    require) under this subsection from a low-power television station
    to which this subsection applies, the Commission shall authorize
    the licensee or permittee of that station to provide digital data
    service subject to the requirements of this subsection as a pilot
    project to demonstrate the feasibility of using low-power
    television stations to provide high-speed wireless digital data
    service, including Internet access to unserved areas.

      causes any interference that cannot otherwise be remedied; or
        (ii) the provision of 1-way digital data service by that
      station causes any interference.

      (B) The Commission shall grant any such station, upon application
    (made in such form and manner and containing such information as
    the Commission may require) by the licensee or permittee of that
    station, authority to move the station to another location, to
    modify its facilities to operate on a different channel, or to use
    booster or auxiliary transmitting locations, if the grant of
    authority will not cause interference to the allowable or protected
    service areas of full service digital television stations, National
    Television Standards Committee assignments, or television
    translator stations, and provided, however, no such authority shall
    be granted unless it is consistent with existing Commission
    regulations relating to the movement, modification, and use of non-
    class A low power television transmission facilities in order - 
        (i) to operate within television channels 2 through 51,
      inclusive; or
        (ii) to demonstrate the utility of low-power television
      stations to provide high-speed 2-way wireless digital data

      (D) The Commission shall resolve any complaints of interference
    with television reception caused by any station providing digital
    data service authorized under this subsection within 60 days after
    the complaint is received by the Commission.
      (6) The Commission shall assess and collect from any low-power
    television station authorized to provide digital data service under
    this subsection an annual fee or other schedule or method of
    payment comparable to any fee imposed under the authority of this
    chapter on providers of similar services. Amounts received by the
    Commission under this paragraph may be retained by the Commission
    as an offsetting collection to the extent necessary to cover the
    costs of developing and implementing the pilot program authorized
    by this subsection, and regulating and supervising the provision of
    digital data service by low-power television stations under this
    subsection. Amounts received by the Commission under this paragraph
    in excess of any amount retained under the preceding sentence shall
    be deposited in the Treasury in accordance with chapter 33 of title

    Nov. 29, 1999, 113 Stat. 1536, 1501A-594, provided that: "Congress
    finds the following:
        "(1) Since the creation of low-power television licenses by the
      Federal Communications Commission, a small number of license
      holders have operated their stations in a manner beneficial to
      the public good providing broadcasting to their communities that
      would not otherwise be available.
        "(2) These low-power broadcasters have operated their stations
      in a manner consistent with the programming objectives and hours
      of operation of full-power broadcasters providing worthwhile
      services to their respective communities while under severe
      license limitations compared to their full-power counterparts.
        "(3) License limitations, particularly the temporary nature of
      the license, have blocked many low-power broadcasters from having
      access to capital, and have severely hampered their ability to
      continue to provide quality broadcasting, programming, or
      improvements.
        "(4) The passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 [Pub. L.
      104-104, see Short Title of 1996 Amendment note set out under
      section 609 of this title] has added to the uncertainty of the
      future status of these stations by the lack of specific
      provisions regarding the permanency of their licenses, or their
      treatment during the transition to high definition, digital
      television.
        "(5) It is in the public interest to promote diversity in
      television programming such as that currently provided by low-
      power television stations to foreign-language communities."

      licenses and commercial licenses

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      Not later than January 1, 1998, the Commission shall allocate the
    electromagnetic spectrum between 746 megahertz and 806 megahertz,
    inclusive, as follows:
        (1) 24 megahertz of that spectrum for public safety services
      according to the terms and conditions established by the
      Commission, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and
      the Attorney General; and
        (2) 36 megahertz of that spectrum for commercial use to be
      assigned by competitive bidding pursuant to section 309(j) of
      this title.
    (b) Assignment
      The Commission shall commence assignment of licenses for public
    safety services created pursuant to subsection (a) of this section
    no later than September 30, 1998.
    (c) Licensing of unused frequencies for public safety services
      (1) Use of unused channels for public safety services
        Upon application by an entity seeking to provide public safety
      services, the Commission shall waive any requirement of this
      chapter or its regulations implementing this chapter (other than
      its regulations regarding harmful interference) to the extent
      necessary to permit the use of unassigned frequencies for the
      provision of public safety services by such entity. An
      application shall be granted under this subsection if the
      Commission finds that - 
          (A) no other spectrum allocated to public safety services is
        immediately available to satisfy the requested public safety
        service use;
          (B) the requested use is technically feasible without causing
        harmful interference to other spectrum users entitled to
        protection from such interference under the Commission's
        regulations;
          (C) the use of the unassigned frequency for the provision of
        public safety services is consistent with other allocations for
        the provision of such services in the geographic area for which
        the application is made;
          (D) the unassigned frequency was allocated for its present
        use not less than 2 years prior to the date on which the
        application is granted; and
          (E) granting such application is consistent with the public
        interest.
      (2) Applicability
        Paragraph (1) shall apply to any application to provide public
      safety services that is pending or filed on or after August 5,
      1997.
    (d) Conditions on licenses
      In establishing service rules with respect to licenses granted
    pursuant to this section, the Commission - 
        (1) shall establish interference limits at the boundaries of
      the spectrum block and service area;
        (2) shall establish any additional technical restrictions
      necessary to protect full-service analog television service and
      digital television service during a transition to digital
      television service;
        (3) may permit public safety services licensees and commercial
      licensees - 
          (A) to aggregate multiple licenses to create larger spectrum
        blocks and service areas; and
          (B) to disaggregate or partition licenses to create smaller
        spectrum blocks or service areas; and

        (4) shall establish rules insuring that public safety services
      licensees using spectrum reallocated pursuant to subsection
      (a)(1) of this section shall not be subject to harmful
      interference from television broadcast licensees.
    (e) Removal and relocation of incumbent broadcast licensees
      (1) Channels 52 to 69
        Any full-power television station licensee that holds a
      television broadcast license to operate between 698 and 806
      megahertz may not operate at that frequency after February 17,
      2009.
      (2) Incumbent qualifying low-power stations
        After making any allocation or assignment under this section,
      the Commission shall seek to assure, consistent with the
      Commission's plan for allotments for digital television service,
      that each qualifying low-power television station is assigned a
      frequency below 698 megahertz to permit the continued operation
      of such station.
    (f) Definitions
      For purposes of this section:
      (1) Public safety services

      section 501(f).
      (3) (!1) Low power station carriage optional

        No low power television station whose signals are provided
      under section 119(a)(14) of title 17 shall be entitled to insist
      on carriage under this section, regardless of whether the
      satellite carrier provides secondary transmissions of the primary
      transmissions of other stations in the same local market pursuant
      to section 122 of such title, nor shall any such carriage be
      considered in connection with the requirements of subsection (c)
      of this section.
      (3) (!1) Effective date
        No satellite carrier shall be required to carry local
      television broadcast stations under paragraph (1) until January
      1, 2002.
      (4) Carriage of signals of local stations in certain markets
        A satellite carrier that offers multichannel video programming
      distribution service in the United States to more than 5,000,000
      subscribers shall (A) within 1 year after December 8, 2004,
      retransmit the signals originating as analog signals of each
      television broadcast station located in any local market within a
      State that is not part of the contiguous United States, and (B)
      within 30 months after December 8, 2004, retransmit the signals
      originating as digital signals of each such station. The
      retransmissions of such stations shall be made available to
      substantially all of the satellite carrier's subscribers in each
      station's local market, and the retransmissions of the stations
      in at least one market in the State shall be made available to
      substantially all of the satellite carrier's subscribers in areas
      of the State that are not within a designated market area. The
      cost to subscribers of such retransmissions shall not exceed the
      cost of retransmissions of local television stations in other
      States. Within 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Commission
      shall promulgate regulations concerning elections by television
      stations in such State between mandatory carriage pursuant to
      this section and retransmission consent pursuant to section
      325(b) of this title, which shall take into account the schedule
      on which local television stations are made available to viewers
      in such State.
    (b) Good signal required
      (1) Costs
        A television broadcast station asserting its right to carriage
      under subsection (a) of this section shall be required to bear
      the costs associated with delivering a good quality signal to the
      designated local receive facility of the satellite carrier or to
      another facility that is acceptable to at least one-half the
      stations asserting the right to carriage in the local market.
      (2) Regulations
        The regulations issued under subsection (g) of this section
      shall set forth the obligations necessary to carry out this
      subsection.
    (c) Duplication not required
      (1) Commercial stations
        Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1) of this section, a satellite
      carrier shall not be required to carry upon request the signal of
      any local commercial television broadcast station that
      substantially duplicates the signal of another local commercial
      television broadcast station which is secondarily transmitted by
      the satellite carrier within the same local market, or to carry
      upon request the signals of more than one local commercial
      television broadcast station in a single local market that is
      affiliated with a particular television network unless such
      stations are licensed to communities in different States.
      (2) Noncommercial stations
        The Commission shall prescribe regulations limiting the
      carriage requirements under subsection (a) of this section of
      satellite carriers with respect to the carriage of multiple local
      noncommercial television broadcast stations. To the extent
      possible, such regulations shall provide the same degree of
      carriage by satellite carriers of such multiple stations as is
      provided by cable systems under section 535 of this title.
    (d) Channel positioning
      No satellite carrier shall be required to provide the signal of a
    local television broadcast station to subscribers in that station's
    local market on any particular channel number or to provide the
    signals in any particular order, except that the satellite carrier
    shall retransmit the signal of the local television broadcast
    stations to subscribers in the stations' local market on contiguous
    channels and provide access to such station's signals at a
    nondiscriminatory price and in a nondiscriminatory manner on any
    navigational device, on-screen program guide, or menu.
    (e) Compensation for carriage
      A satellite carrier shall not accept or request monetary payment
    or other valuable consideration in exchange either for carriage of
    local television broadcast stations in fulfillment of the
    requirements of this section or for channel positioning rights
    provided to such stations under this section, except that any such
    station may be required to bear the costs associated with
    delivering a good quality signal to the local receive facility of
    the satellite carrier.
    (f) Remedies
      (1) Complaints by broadcast stations
        Whenever a local television broadcast station believes that a
      satellite carrier has failed to meet its obligations under
      subsections (b) through (e) of this section, such station shall
      notify the carrier, in writing, of the alleged failure and
      identify its reasons for believing that the satellite carrier
      failed to comply with such obligations. The satellite carrier
      shall, within 30 days after such written notification, respond in
      writing to such notification and comply with such obligations or
      state its reasons for believing that it is in compliance with
      such obligations. A local television broadcast station that
      disputes a response by a satellite carrier that it is in
      compliance with such obligations may obtain review of such denial
      or response by filing a complaint with the Commission. Such
      complaint shall allege the manner in which such satellite carrier
      has failed to meet its obligations and the basis for such
      allegations.
      (2) Opportunity to respond
        The Commission shall afford the satellite carrier against which
      a complaint is filed under paragraph (1) an opportunity to
      present data and arguments to establish that there has been no
      failure to meet its obligations under this section.
      (3) Remedial actions; dismissal
        Within 120 days after the date a complaint is filed under
      paragraph (1), the Commission shall determine whether the
      satellite carrier has met its obligations under subsections (b)
      through (e) of this section. If the Commission determines that
      the satellite carrier has failed to meet such obligations, the
      Commission shall order the satellite carrier to take appropriate
      remedial action. If the Commission determines that the satellite
      carrier has fully met the requirements of such subsections, the
      Commission shall dismiss the complaint.
    (g) Carriage of local stations on a single dish
      (1) Single dish
        Each satellite carrier that retransmits the analog signals of
      local television broadcast stations in a local market shall
      retransmit such analog signals in such market by means of a
      single reception antenna and associated equipment.
      (2) Exception
        If the carrier retransmits signals in the digital television
      service, the carrier shall retransmit such digital signals in
      such market by means of a single reception antenna and associated
      equipment, but such antenna and associated equipment may be
      separate from the single reception antenna and associated
      equipment used for analog television service signals.
      (3) Effective date
        The requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection
      shall apply on and after 18 months after December 8, 2004.
      (4) Notice of disruptions
        A carrier that is providing signals of a local television
      broadcast station in a local market under this section on
      December 8, 2004, shall, not later than 15 months after December
      8, 2004, provide to the licensees for such stations and the
      carrier's subscribers in such local market a notice that displays
      prominently and conspicuously a clear statement of - 
          (A) any reallocation of signals between different reception
        antennas and associated equipment that the carrier intends to
        make in order to comply with the requirements of this
        subsection;
          (B) the need, if any, for subscribers to obtain an additional
        reception antenna and associated equipment to receive such
        signals; and
          (C) any cessation of carriage or other material change in the
        carriage of signals as a consequence of the requirements of
        this paragraph.
    (h) Additional notices to subscribers, networks, and stations
      concerning signal carriage
      (1) Notices to and elections by subscribers concerning
        grandfathered signals
        Any carrier that provides a distant signal of a network station

            (i) offering to substitute the local network signal for the
          duplicating distant network signal; and
            (ii) informing the subscriber that, if the subscriber fails
          to respond in 60 days, the subscriber will lose the distant
          network signal but will be permitted to subscribe to the
          local network signal; and

          (B) if the subscriber - 
            (i) elects to substitute such local network signal within
          such 60 days, switch such subscriber to such local network
          signal within 10 days after the end of such 60-day period; or
            (ii) fails to respond within such 60 days, terminate the
          distant network signal within 10 days after the end of such
          60-day period.
      (2) Notice to station licensees of commencement of local-into-
        local service
        (A) Notice required
          Within 180 days after December 8, 2004, the Commission shall

        (B) Contents of commencement notice
          The notice required by such regulations shall inform each
        television broadcast station licensee within any local market
        in which a satellite carrier proposes to commence carriage of
        signals of stations from that market, not later than 60 days
        prior to the commencement of such carriage - 
            (i) of the carrier's intention to launch local-into-local
          service under this section in a local market, the identity of
          that local market, and the location of the carrier's proposed
          local receive facility for that local market;
            (ii) of the right of such licensee to elect carriage under
          this section or grant retransmission consent under section
          325(b) of this title;
            (iii) that such licensee has 30 days from the date of the
          receipt of such notice to make such election; and
            (iv) that failure to make such election will result in the
          loss of the right to demand carriage under this section for
          the remainder of the 3-year cycle of carriage under section
          325 of this title.

      carriers

-STATUTE-
    (a) Provisions relating to carriage of distant signals
      (1) Carriage permitted
        (A) In general
          Subject to section 119 of title 17, any satellite carrier
        shall be permitted to provide the signals of no more than two
        network stations in a single day for each television network to
        any household not located within the local markets of those
        network stations.
        (B) Additional service
          In addition to signals provided under subparagraph (A), any
        satellite carrier may also provide service under the statutory
        license of section 122 of title 17, to the local market within
        which such household is located. The service provided under
        section 122 of such title may be in addition to the two signals
        provided under section 119 of such title.

      Such two network stations may be comprised of both the analog
      signal and digital signal of not more than two network stations.
      (2) Replacement of distant signals with local signals
        Notwithstanding any other provision of paragraph (1), the
      following rules shall apply after December 8, 2004:
        (A) Rules for grandfathered subscribers to analog signals
          (i) For those receiving distant analog signals
            In the case of a subscriber of a satellite carrier who is
          eligible to receive the analog signal of a network station
          solely by reason of section 119(e) of title 17 (in this
          subparagraph referred to as a "distant analog signal"), and
          who, as of October 1, 2004, is receiving the distant analog
          signal of that network station, the following shall apply:
              (I) In a case in which the satellite carrier makes
            available to the subscriber the analog signal of a local
            network station affiliated with the same television network
            pursuant to section 338 of this title, the carrier may only
            provide the secondary transmissions of the distant analog
            signal of a station affiliated with the same network to
            that subscriber - 
                (aa) if, within 60 days after receiving the notice of
              the satellite carrier under section 338(h)(1) of this
              title, the subscriber elects to retain the distant analog
              signal; but
                (bb) only until such time as the subscriber elects to
              receive such local analog signal.

              (II) Notwithstanding subclause (I), the carrier may not
            retransmit the distant analog signal to any subscriber who
            is eligible to receive the analog signal of a network
            station solely by reason of section 119(e) of title 17,
            unless such carrier, within 60 days after December 8, 2004,
            submits to that television network the list and statement
            required by subparagraph (F)(i).
          (ii) For those not receiving distant analog signals
            In the case of any subscriber of a satellite carrier who is
          eligible to receive the distant analog signal of a network
          station solely by reason of section 119(e) of title 17 and
          who did not receive a distant analog signal of a station
          affiliated with the same network on October 1, 2004, the
          carrier may not provide the secondary transmissions of the
          distant analog signal of a station affiliated with the same
          network to that subscriber.
        (B) Rules for other subscribers to analog signals
          In the case of a subscriber of a satellite carrier who is
        eligible to receive the analog signal of a network station
        under this section (in this subparagraph referred to as a
        "distant analog signal"), other than subscribers to whom
        subparagraph (A) applies, the following shall apply:
            (i) In a case in which the satellite carrier makes
          available to that subscriber, on January 1, 2005, the analog
          signal of a local network station affiliated with the same
          television network pursuant to section 338 of this title, the
          carrier may only provide the secondary transmissions of the
          distant analog signal of a station affiliate with the same
          network to that subscriber if the subscriber's satellite
          carrier, not later than March 1, 2005, submits to that
          television network the list and statement required by
          subparagraph (F)(i).
            (ii) In a case in which the satellite carrier does not make
          available to that subscriber, on January 1, 2005, the analog
          signal of a local network station pursuant to section 338 of
          this title, the carrier may only provide the secondary
          transmissions of the distant analog signal of a station
          affiliated with the same network to that subscriber if - 
              (I) that subscriber seeks to subscribe to such distant
            analog signal before the date on which such carrier
            commences to carry pursuant to section 338 of this title
            the analog signals of stations from the local market of
            such local network station; and
              (II) the satellite carrier, within 60 days after such
            date, submits to each television network the list and
            statement required by subparagraph (F)(ii).
        (C) Future applicability
          A satellite carrier may not provide a distant analog signal
        (within the meaning of subparagraph (A) or (B)) to a person who
        - 
            (i) is not a subscriber lawfully receiving such secondary
          transmission as of December 8, 2004; and
            (ii) at the time such person seeks to subscribe to receive
          such secondary transmission, resides in a local market where
          the satellite carrier makes available to that person the
          analog signal of a local network station affiliated with the
          same television network pursuant to section 338 of this
          title, and the retransmission of such signal by such carrier
          can reach such subscriber.
        (D) Special rules for distant digital signals
          (i) Eligibility
            In the case of a subscriber of a satellite carrier who,
          with respect to a local network station - 
              (I) is a subscriber whose household is located outside
            the coverage area of the analog signal of such station as
            predicted by the model specified in subsection (c)(3) of
            this section for the signal intensity required under
            section 73.683(a) of title 47 of the Code of Federal
            Regulations, or a successor regulation;
              (II) is in an unserved household as determined under
            section 119(d)(1)(A) of title 17; or
              (III) is, after the date on which the conditions required
            by clause (vii) are met with respect to such station,
            determined under clause (vi) of this subparagraph to be
            unable to receive a digital signal of such local network
            station that exceeds the signal intensity standard
            specified in such clause;
          such subscriber is eligible to receive the digital signal of
          a distant network station affiliated with the same network
          under this section (in this subparagraph referred to as a
          "distant digital signal") subject to the provisions of this
          subparagraph.
          (ii) Pre-enactment distant digital signal subscribers
            Any eligible subscriber under this subparagraph who is a
          lawful subscriber to such a distant digital signal as of the
          date of enactment of the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and
          Reauthorization Act of 2004 [December 8, 2004] may continue
          to receive such distant digital signal, whether or not such
          subscriber elects to subscribe to local digital signals.
          (iii) Local-to-local analog markets
            In a case in which the satellite carrier makes available to
          an eligible subscriber under this subparagraph the analog
          signal of a local network station pursuant to section 338 of
          this title, the carrier may only provide the distant digital
          signal of a station affiliated with the same network to that
          subscriber if - 
              (I) in the case of any local market in the 48 contiguous
            States of the United States, the distant digital signal is
            the secondary transmission of a station whose prime time
            network programming is generally broadcast simultaneously
            with, or later than, the prime time network programming of
            the affiliate of the same network in the local market;
              (II) in any local market, the retransmission of the
            distant digital signal of the distant station occupies at
            least the equivalent bandwidth (as such term is defined by
            the Commission under section 340(h)(4) of this title) as
            the digital signal broadcast by such station; and
              (III) the subscriber subscribes to the analog signal of
            such local network station within 60 days after such signal
            is made available by the satellite carrier, and adds to or
            replaces such analog signal with the digital signal from
            such local network station within 60 days after such signal
            is made available by the satellite carrier, except that
            such distant digital signal may continue to be provided to
            a subscriber who cannot be reached by the satellite
            transmission of the local digital signal.
          (iv) Local-to-local digital markets
            After the date on which a satellite carrier makes available
          the digital signal of a local network station, the carrier
          may not offer the distant digital signal of a network station
          affiliated with the same television network to any new
          subscriber to such distant digital signal after such date,
          except that such distant digital signal may be provided to a
          new subscriber who cannot be reached by the satellite
          transmission of the local digital signal.
          (v) Non-local-to-local markets
            After December 8, 2004, if the satellite carrier does not
          make available the digital signal of a local network station
          in a local market, the satellite carrier may offer a new
          subscriber after such date who is eligible under this
          subparagraph a distant digital signal from a station
          affiliated with the same network and, in the case of any
          local market in the 48 contiguous States of the United
          States, whose prime time network programming is generally
          broadcast simultaneously with, or later than, the prime time
          network programming of the affiliate of the same network in
          the local market, except that - 
              (I) such carrier may continue to provide such distant
            digital signal to such a subscriber after the date on which
            the carrier makes available the digital signal of a local
            network station affiliated with such network only if such
            subscriber subscribes to the digital signal from such local
            network station; and
              (II) the limitation contained in subclause (I) of this
            clause shall not apply to a subscriber that cannot be
            reached by the satellite transmission of the local digital
            signal.
          (vi) Signal testing for digital signals
            (I) A subscriber shall be eligible for a distant digital
          signal under clause (i)(III) if such subscriber is
          determined, based on a test conducted in accordance with
          section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations,
          or any successor regulation, not to be able to receive a
          signal that exceeds the signal intensity standard in section
          73.622(e)(1) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, as in
          effect on December 8, 2004.
            (II) Such test shall be conducted, upon written request for
          a digital signal strength test by the subscriber to the
          satellite carrier, within 30 days after the date the
          subscriber submits such request for the test. Such test shall
          be conducted by a qualified and independent person selected
          by the satellite carrier and the network station or stations,
          or who has been previously approved by the satellite carrier
          and by each affected network station but not previously
          disapproved. A tester may not be so disapproved for a test
          after the tester has commenced such test.
            (III) Unless the satellite carrier and the network station
          or stations otherwise agree, the costs of conducting the test
          shall be borne as follows:
              (aa) If the subscriber is not eligible for a distant
            digital signal under clause (i)(I) of this subparagraph (by
            reason of being outside of the coverage area of the analog
            signal), the satellite carrier may request the station
            licensee for a waiver.
              (bb) If the licensee agrees to a waiver, or fails to
            respond to a waiver request within 30 days, the subscriber
            may receive such distant digital signal.
              (cc) If the licensee refuses to grant a waiver, the
            subscriber may request the satellite carrier to conduct the
            test.
              (dd) If the satellite carrier requests the test and - 
                (AA) the station's signal is determined to exceed such
              signal intensity standard, the costs of the test shall be
              borne by the satellite carrier; and
                (BB) the station's signal is determined to not exceed
              such signal intensity standard, the costs of the test
              shall be borne by the licensee.

              (ee) If the satellite carrier does not request the test,
            or fails to respond within 30 days, the subscriber may
            request the test be conducted under the supervision of the
            carrier, and the costs of the test shall be borne by the
            subscriber in accordance with regulations prescribed by the
            Commission. Such regulations shall also require the carrier
            to notify the subscriber of the typical costs of such test.
          (vii) Trigger events for use of testing
            A subscriber shall not be eligible for a distant digital
          signal under clause (i)(III) pursuant to a test conducted
          under clause (vii) until - 
              (I) in the case of a subscriber whose household is
            located within the area predicted to be served (by the
            predictive model for analog signals under subsection (b)(3)
            of this section) by the signal of a local network station
            and who is seeking a distant digital signal of a station
            affiliated with the same network as that local network
            station - 
                (aa) April 30, 2006, if such local network station is
              within the top 100 television markets and - 
                  (AA) has received a tentative digital television
                service channel designation that is the same as such
                station's current digital television service channel;
                or
                  (BB) has been found by the Commission to have lost
                interference protection; or

                (bb) July 15, 2007, for any other local network
              stations, other than translator stations licensed to
              broadcast on December 8, 2004; or

              (II) in the case of a translator station, 1 year after
            the date on which the Commission completes all actions
            necessary for the allocation and assignment of digital
            television licenses to television translator stations.
          (viii) Testing waivers
            Upon request by a local network station, the Commission may
          grant a waiver with respect to such station to the beginning
          of testing under clause (vii), and prohibit subscribers from
          receiving digital signal strength testing with respect to
          such station. Such a request shall be filed not less than 5
          months prior to the implementation deadline specified in such
          clause, and the Commission shall act on such request by such
          implementation deadline. Such a waiver shall expire at the
          end of not more than 6 months, except that a waiver may be
          renewed upon a proper showing. The Commission may only grant
          such a request upon submission of clear and convincing
          evidence that the station's digital signal coverage is
          limited due to the unremediable presence of one or more of
          the following:
              (I) the need for international coordination or approvals;
              (II) clear zoning or environmental legal impediments;
              (III) force majeure;
              (IV) the station experiences a substantial decrease in
            its digital signal coverage area due to necessity of using
            side-mounted antenna;
              (V) substantial technical problems that result in a
            station experiencing a substantial decrease in its coverage
            area solely due to actions to avoid interference with
            emergency response providers; or
              (VI) no satellite carrier is providing the retransmission
            of the analog signals of local network stations under
            section 338 of this title in the local market.

          Under no circumstances may such a waiver be based upon
          financial exigency.
          (ix) Special waiver provision for translators
            Upon request by a television translator station, the
          Commission may grant, for not more than 3 years, a waiver
          with respect to such station to the beginning of testing
          under clause (vii), and prohibit subscribers from receiving
          digital signal strength testing with respect to such station,
          if the Commission determines that the translator station is
          not broadcasting a digital signal due to one or more of the
          following:
              (I) frequent occurrence of inclement weather; or
              (II) mountainous terrain at the transmitter tower
            location.
          (x) Savings provision
            Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to affect a
          satellite carrier's obligations under section 338 of this
          title.
          (xi) Definition
            For purposes of clause (viii), the term "emergency response
          providers" means Federal, State, or local governmental and
          nongovernmental emergency public safety, law enforcement,
          fire, emergency response, emergency medical (including
          hospital emergency facilities), and related personnel,
          organizations, agencies, or authorities.
        (E) Authority to grant station-specific waivers
          This paragraph shall not prohibit a retransmission of a
        distant analog signal or distant digital signal (within the
        meaning of subparagraph (A), (B), or (D)) of any distant
        network station to any subscriber to whom the signal of a local
        network station affiliated with the same network is available,
        if and to the extent that such local network station has
        affirmatively granted a waiver from the requirements of this
        paragraph to such satellite carrier with respect to
        retransmission of such distant network station to such
        subscriber.
        (F) Notices to networks of distant signal subscribers
          (i) Within 60 days after December 8, 2004, each satellite
        carrier that provides a distant signal of a network station to
        a subscriber pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B)(i) of this
        paragraph shall submit to each network - 
            (I) a list, aggregated by designated market area,
          identifying each subscriber provided such a signal by - 
              (aa) name;
              (bb) address (street or rural route number, city, State,
            and zip code); and
              (cc) the distant network signal or signals received; and

            (II) a statement that, to the best of the carrier's
          knowledge and belief after having made diligent and good
          faith inquiries, the subscriber is qualified under the
          existing law to receive the distant network signal or signals
          pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B)(i) of this paragraph.

          (ii) Within 60 days after the date a satellite carrier
        commences to carry pursuant to section 338 of this title the
        signals of stations from a local market, such a satellite
        carrier that provides a distant signal of a network station to
        a subscriber pursuant to subparagraph (B)(ii) of this paragraph
        shall submit to each network - 
            (I) a list identifying each subscriber in that local market
          provided such a signal by - 
              (aa) name;
              (bb) address (street or rural route number, city, State,
            and zip code); and
              (cc) the distant network signal or signals received; and

            (II) a statement that, to the best of the carrier's
          knowledge and belief after having made diligent and good
          faith inquiries, the subscriber is qualified under the
          existing law to receive the distant network signal or signals
          pursuant to subparagraph (B)(ii) of this paragraph.
        (G) Other provisions not affected
          This paragraph shall not affect the eligibility of a
        subscriber to receive secondary transmissions under section 340
        of this title or as an unserved household included under
        section 119(a)(12) of title 17.
        (H) Available defined
          For purposes of this paragraph, a satellite carrier makes
        available a local signal to a subscriber or person if the
        satellite carrier offers that local signal to other subscribers
        who reside in the same zip code as that subscriber or person.
      (3) Penalty for violation
        Any satellite carrier that knowingly and willfully provides the
      signals of television stations to subscribers in violation of
      this subsection shall be liable for a forfeiture penalty under
      section 503 of this title in the amount of $50,000 for each
      violation or each day of a continuing violation, except that
      paragraph (2)(D) of this subsection, relating to the provision of
      distant digital signals, shall be enforceable under the
      provisions of section 340(f) of this title.
    (b) Extension of network nonduplication, syndicated exclusivity,
      and sports blackout to satellite retransmission
      (1) Extension of protections
        Within 45 days after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall
      commence a single rulemaking proceeding to establish regulations
      that - 
          (A) apply network nonduplication protection (47 CFR 76.92)
        syndicated exclusivity protection (47 CFR 76.151), and sports
        blackout protection (47 CFR 76.67) to the retransmission of the
        signals of nationally distributed superstations by satellite
        carriers to subscribers; and
          (B) to the extent technically feasible and not economically
        prohibitive, apply sports blackout protection (47 CFR 76.67) to
        the retransmission of the signals of network stations by
        satellite carriers to subscribers.
      (2) Deadline for action
        The Commission shall complete all actions necessary to
      prescribe regulations required by this section so that the
      regulations shall become effective within 1 year after November
      29, 1999.
    (c) Eligibility for retransmission
      (1) Study of digital strength testing procedures
        (A) Study required
          Not later than 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Federal
        Communications Commission shall complete an inquiry regarding
        whether, for purposes of identifying if a household is unserved
        by an adequate digital signal under section 119(d)(10) of title
        17, the digital signal strength standard in section
        73.622(e)(1) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or the
        testing procedures in section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of
        Federal Regulations, such statutes or regulations should be
        revised to take into account the types of antennas that are
        available to consumers.
        (B) Study considerations
          In conducting the study under this paragraph, the Commission
        shall consider whether - 
            (i) to account for the fact that an antenna can be mounted
          on a roof or placed in a home and can be fixed or capable of
          rotating;
            (ii) section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of Federal
          Regulations, should be amended to create different procedures
          for determining if the requisite digital signal strength is
          present than for determining if the requisite analog signal
          strength is present;
            (iii) a standard should be used other than the presence of
          a signal of a certain strength to ensure that a household can
          receive a high-quality picture using antennas of reasonable
          cost and ease of installation;
            (iv) to develop a predictive methodology for determining
          whether a household is unserved by an adequate digital signal
          under section 119(d)(10) of title 17;
            (v) there is a wide variation in the ability of reasonably
          priced consumer digital television sets to receive over-the-
          air signals, such that at a given signal strength some may
          be able to display high-quality pictures while others cannot,
          whether such variation is related to the price of the
          television set, and whether such variation should be factored
          into setting a standard for determining whether a household
          is unserved by an adequate digital signal; and
            (vi) to account for factors such as building loss, external
          interference sources, or undesired signals from both digital
          television and analog television stations using either the
          same or adjacent channels in nearby markets, foliage, and man-
          made clutter.
        (C) Report
          Not later than 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Federal
        Communications Commission shall submit to the Committee on
        Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the
        Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the
        Senate a report containing - 
            (i) the results of the study under this paragraph; and
            (ii) recommendations, if any, as to what changes should be
          made to Federal statutes or regulations.
      (2) Waivers
        A subscriber who is denied the retransmission of a signal of a
      network station under section 119 of title 17 may request a
      waiver from such denial by submitting a request, through such
      subscriber's satellite carrier, to the network station asserting
      that the retransmission is prohibited. The network station shall
      accept or reject a subscriber's request for a waiver within 30
      days after receipt of the request. The subscriber shall be
      permitted to receive such retransmission under section
      119(d)(10)(B) of title 17, if such station agrees to the waiver
      request and files with the satellite carrier a written waiver
      with respect to that subscriber allowing the subscriber to
      receive such retransmission. If a television network station
      fails to accept or reject a subscriber's request for a waiver
      within the 30-day period after receipt of the request, that
      station shall be deemed to agree to the waiver request and have
      filed such written waiver.
      (3) Establishment of improved predictive model required
        Within 180 days after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall
      take all actions necessary, including any reconsideration, to
      develop and prescribe by rule a point-to-point predictive model
      for reliably and presumptively determining the ability of
      individual locations to receive signals in accordance with the
      signal intensity standard in effect under section 119(d)(10)(A)
      of title 17. In prescribing such model, the Commission shall rely
      on the Individual Location Longley-Rice model set forth by the
      Federal Communications Commission in Docket No. 98-201 and ensure
      that such model takes into account terrain, building structures,
      and other land cover variations. The Commission shall establish
      procedures for the continued refinement in the application of the
      model by the use of additional data as it becomes available.
      (4) Objective verification
        (A) In general
          If a subscriber's request for a waiver under paragraph (2) is
        rejected and the subscriber submits to the subscriber's
        satellite carrier a request for a test verifying the
        subscriber's inability to receive a signal that meets the
        signal intensity standard in effect under section 119(d)(10)(A)
        of title 17, the satellite carrier and the network station or
        stations asserting that the retransmission is prohibited with
        respect to that subscriber shall select a qualified and
        independent person to conduct a test in accordance with section
        73.686(d) of its regulations (47 CFR 73.686(d)), or any
        successor regulation. Such test shall be conducted within 30
        days after the date the subscriber submits a request for the
        test. If the written findings and conclusions of a test
        conducted in accordance with such section (or any successor
        regulation) demonstrate that the subscriber does not receive a
        signal that meets or exceeds the signal intensity standard in
        effect under section 119(d)(10)(A) of title 17, the subscriber
        shall not be denied the retransmission of a signal of a network
        station under section 119 of title 17.
        (B) Designation of tester and allocation of costs
          If the satellite carrier and the network station or stations
        asserting that the retransmission is prohibited are unable to
        agree on such a person to conduct the test, the person shall be
        designated by an independent and neutral entity designated by
        the Commission by rule. Unless the satellite carrier and the
        network station or stations otherwise agree, the costs of
        conducting the test under this paragraph shall be borne by the
        satellite carrier, if the station's signal meets or exceeds the
        signal intensity standard in effect under section 119(d)(10)(A)
        of title 17, or by the network station, if its signal fails to
        meet or exceed such standard.
        (C) Avoidance of undue burden
          Commission regulations prescribed under this paragraph shall
        seek to avoid any undue burden on any party.
        (D) Reduction of verification burdens
          Within 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Commission shall by
        rule exempt from the verification requirements of subparagraph
        (A) any request for a test made by a subscriber to a satellite
        carrier to whom the retransmission of the signals of local
        broadcast stations is available under section 338 of this title
        from such carrier.
        (E) Exception
          A satellite carrier may refuse to engage in the testing
        process. If the carrier does so refuse, a subscriber in a local
        market in which the satellite carrier does not offer the
        signals of local broadcast stations under section 338 of this
        title may, at his or her own expense, authorize a signal
        intensity test to be performed pursuant to the procedures
        specified by the Commission in section 73.686(d) of title 47,
        Code of Federal Regulations, by a tester who is approved by the
        satellite carrier and by each affected network station, or who
        has been previously approved by the satellite carrier and by
        each affected network station but not previously disapproved. A
        tester may not be so disapproved for a test after the tester
        has commenced such test. The tester shall give 5 business days
        advance written notice to the satellite carrier and to the
        affected network station or stations. A signal intensity test
        conducted in accordance with this subparagraph shall be
        determinative of the signal strength received at that household
        for purposes of determining whether the household is capable of
        receiving a Grade B intensity signal.
      (5) Definition
        Notwithstanding subsection (d)(4) of this section, for purposes
      of paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subsection, the term "satellite
      carrier" includes a distributor (as defined in section 119(d)(1)
      of title 17), but only if the satellite distributor's
      relationship with the subscriber includes billing, collection,
      service activation, and service deactivation.

    (a) Significantly viewed stations
      In addition to the broadcast signals that subscribers may receive
    under section (!1) 338 and 339 of this title, a satellite carrier
    is also authorized to retransmit to a subscriber located in a
    community the signal of any station located outside the local
    market in which such subscriber is located, to the extent such
    signal - 

        (1) has, before December 8, 2004, been determined by the
      Federal Communications Commission to be a signal a cable operator
      may carry as significantly viewed in such community, except to
      the extent that such signal is prevented from being carried by a
      cable system in such community under the Commission's network
      nonduplication and syndicated exclusivity rules; or
        (2) is, after December 8, 2004, determined by the Commission to
      be significantly viewed in such community in accordance with the
      same standards and procedures concerning shares of viewing hours
      and audience surveys as are applicable under the rules,
      regulations, and authorizations of the Commission to determining
      with respect to a cable system whether signals are significantly
      viewed in a community.
    (b) Limitations
      (1) Analog service limited to subscribers taking local-into-local
        service
        With respect to a signal that originates as an analog signal of
      a network station, this section shall apply only to
      retransmissions to subscribers of a satellite carrier who receive
      retransmissions of a signal that originates as an analog signal
      of a local network station from that satellite carrier pursuant
      to section 338 of this title.
      (2) Digital service limitations
        With respect to a signal that originates as a digital signal of
      a network station, this section shall apply only if - 
          (A) the subscriber receives from the satellite carrier
        pursuant to section 338 of this title the retransmission of the
        digital signal of a network station in the subscriber's local
        market that is affiliated with the same television network; and
          (B) either - 
            (i) the retransmission of the local network station
          occupies at least the equivalent bandwidth as the digital
          signal retransmitted pursuant to this section; or
            (ii) the retransmission of the local network station is
          comprised of the entire bandwidth of the digital signal
          broadcast by such local network station.
      (3) Limitation not applicable where no network affiliates
        The limitations in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not prohibit a
      retransmission under this section to a subscriber located in a
      local market in which there are no network stations affiliated
      with the same television network as the station whose signal is
      being retransmitted pursuant to this section.
      (4) Authority to grant station-specific waivers
        Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not prohibit a retransmission of a
      network station to a subscriber if and to the extent that the
      network station in the local market in which the subscriber is
      located, and that is affiliated with the same television network,
      has privately negotiated and affirmatively granted a waiver from
      the requirements of paragraph (!2) (1) and (2) to such satellite
      carrier with respect to retransmission of the significantly
      viewed station to such subscriber.

    (c) Publication and modifications of lists; regulations
      (1) In general
        The Commission shall - 
          (A) within 60 days after December 8, 2004 - 
            (i) publish a list of the stations that are eligible for
          retransmission under subsection (a)(1) of this section and
          the communities in which such stations are eligible for such
          retransmission; and
            (ii) commence a rulemaking proceeding to implement this
          section by publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking;

          (B) adopt rules pursuant to such rulemaking within 1 year
        after December 8, 2004.
      (2) Public availability of list
        The Commission shall make readily available to the public in
      electronic form, on the Internet website of the Commission or
      other comparable facility, a list of the stations that are
      eligible for retransmission under subsection (a) of this section
      and the communities in which such stations are eligible for such
      retransmission. The Commission shall update such list within 10
      business days after the date on which the Commission issues an
      order making any modification of such stations and communities.
      (3) Modifications
        In addition to cable operators and television broadcast station
      licensees, the Commission shall permit a satellite carrier to
      petition for decisions and orders - 
          (A) by which stations may be added to those that are eligible
        for retransmission under subsection (a) of this section, and by
        which communities may be added in which such stations are
        eligible for such retransmission; and
          (B) by which network nonduplication or syndicated exclusivity
        regulations are applied to the retransmission in accordance
        with subsection (e) of this section.
    (d) Effect on other obligations and rights
      (1) No effect on carriage obligations
        Carriage of a signal under this section is not mandatory, and
      any right of a station licensee to have the signal of such
      station carried under section 338 of this title is not affected
      by the eligibility of such station to be carried under this
      section.
      (2) Retransmission consent rights not affected
        The eligibility of the signal of a station to be carried under
      this section does not affect any right of the licensee of such
      station to grant (or withhold) retransmission consent under
      section 325(b)(1) of this title.
    (e) Network nonduplication and syndicated exclusivity
      (1) Not applicable except as provided by commission regulations
        Signals eligible to be carried under this section are not
      subject to the Commission's regulations concerning network
      nonduplication or syndicated exclusivity unless, pursuant to
      regulations adopted by the Commission, the Commission determines
      to permit network nonduplication or syndicated exclusivity to
      apply within the appropriate zone of protection.
      (2) Limitation
        Nothing in this subsection or Commission regulations shall
      permit the application of network nonduplication or syndicated
      exclusivity regulations to the retransmission of distant signals
      of network stations that are carried by a satellite carrier
      pursuant to a statutory license under section 119(a)(2)(A) or (B)
      of title 17, with respect to persons who reside in unserved
      households, under (!3) 119(a)(4)(A), or under section 119(a)(12),
      of such title.

    (f) Enforcement
      (1) Orders and damages
        Upon complaint, the Commission shall issue a cease and desist
      order to any satellite carrier found to have violated this
      section in carrying any television broadcast station. Such order
      may, if a complaining station requests damages - 
          (A) provide for the award of damages to a complaining station
        that establishes that the violation was committed in bad faith,
        in an amount up to $50 per subscriber, per station, per day of
        the violation; and
          (B) provide for the award of damages to a prevailing
        satellite carrier if the Commission determines that the
        complaint was frivolous, in an amount up to $50 per subscriber
        alleged to be in violation, per station alleged, per day of the
        alleged violation.
      (2) Commission decision
        The Commission shall issue a final determination resolving a
      complaint brought under this subsection not later than 180 days
      after the submission of a complaint under this subsection. The
      Commission may hear witnesses if it clearly appears, based on
      written filings by the parties, that there is a genuine dispute
      about material facts. Except as provided in the preceding
      sentence, the Commission may issue a final ruling based on
      written filings by the parties.
      (3) Remedies in addition
        The remedies under this subsection are in addition to any
      remedies available under title 17.
      (4) No effect on copyright proceedings
        Any determination, action, or failure to act of the Commission
      under this subsection shall have no effect on any proceeding
      under title 17 and shall not be introduced in evidence in any
      proceeding under that title. In no instance shall a Commission
      enforcement proceeding under this subsection be required as a
      predicate to the pursuit of a remedy available under title 17.
    (g) Notices concerning significantly viewed stations
      Each satellite carrier that proposes to commence the
    retransmission of a station pursuant to this section in any local
    market shall - 
        (1) not less than 60 days before commencing such
      retransmission, provide a written notice to any television
      broadcast station in such local market of such proposal; and
        (2) designate on such carrier's website all significantly
      viewed signals carried pursuant to section 340 of this title and
      the communities in which the signals are carried.
    (h) Additional corresponding changes in regulations
      (1) Community-by-community elections
        The Commission shall, no later than October 30, 2005, revise
      section 76.66 of its regulations (47 CFR 76.66), concerning
      satellite broadcast signal carriage, to permit (at the next cycle
      of elections under section 325 of this title) a television
      broadcast station that is located in a local market into which a
      satellite carrier retransmits a television broadcast station
      pursuant to section 338 of this title, to elect, with respect to
      such satellite carrier, between retransmission consent pursuant
      to such section 325 of this title and mandatory carriage pursuant
      to section 338 of this title separately for each county within
      such station's local market, if - 
          (A) the satellite carrier has notified the station, pursuant
        to paragraph (3), that it intends to carry another affiliate of
        the same network pursuant to this section during the relevant
        election period in the station's local market; or
          (B) on the date notification under paragraph (3) was due, the
        satellite carrier was retransmitting into the station's local
        market pursuant to this section an affiliate of the same
        television network.
      (2) Unified negotiations
        In revising its regulations as required by paragraph (1), the
      Commission shall provide that any such station shall conduct a
      unified negotiation for the entire portion of its local market
      for which retransmission consent is elected.
      (3) Additional provisions
        The Commission shall, no later than October 30, 2005, revise
      its regulations to provide the following:
        (A) Notifications by satellite carrier
          A satellite carrier's retransmission of television broadcast
        stations pursuant to this section shall be subject to the
        following limitations:
            (i) In any local market in which the satellite carrier
          provides service pursuant to section 338 of this title on
          December 8, 2004, the carrier may notify a television
          broadcast station in that market, at least 60 days prior to
          any date on which the station must thereafter make an
          election under section 76.66 of the Commission's regulations
          (47 CFR 76.66), of - 
              (I) each affiliate of the same television network that
            the carrier reserves the right to retransmit into that
            station's local market pursuant to this section during the
            next election cycle under such section of such regulations;
            and
              (II) for each such affiliate, the communities into which
            the satellite carrier reserves the right to make such
            retransmissions.

            (ii) In any local market in which the satellite carrier
          commences service pursuant to section 338 of this title after
          December 8, 2004, the carrier may notify a station in that
          market, at least 60 days prior to the introduction of such
          service in that market, and thereafter at least 60 days prior
          to any date on which the station must thereafter make an
          election under section 76.66 of the Commission's regulations
          (47 CFR 76.66), of each affiliate of the same television
          network that the carrier reserves the right to retransmit
          into that station's local market during the next election
          cycle under such section of such regulations.
            (iii) Beginning with the 2005 election cycle, a satellite
          carrier may only retransmit pursuant to this section during
          the pertinent election period a signal - 
              (I) as to which it has provided the notifications set
            forth in clauses (i) and (ii); or
              (II) that it was retransmitting into the local market
            under this section as of the date such notifications were
            due.
        (B) Harmonization of elections and retransmission consent
          agreements
          If a satellite carrier notifies a television broadcast
        station that it reserves the right to retransmit an affiliate
        of the same television network during the next election cycle
        pursuant to this section, the station may choose between
        retransmission consent and mandatory carriage for any portion
        of the 3-year election cycle that is not covered by an existing
        retransmission consent agreement.

      radiotelegraph station.
        (g) The reserve installation shall include a source of
      electrical energy independent of the propelling power of the ship
      and of any other electrical system and shall be capable of being
      put into operation rapidly and of working for at least six
      continuous hours. The reserve source of energy and its
      switchboard shall be as high as practicable in the ship and
      readily accessible to the radio officer.
        (h) There shall be provided between the bridge of the ship and
      the radiotelegraph operating room, and between the bridge and the
      location of the radio direction finding apparatus, when such
      apparatus is not located on the bridge, an efficient two-way
      system for calling and voice communication which shall be
      independent of any other communication system in the ship.
        (i) The radio direction finding apparatus shall be efficient
      and capable of receiving signals with the minimum of receiver
      noise and of taking bearings from which the true bearing and
      direction may be determined. It shall be capable of receiving
      signals on the radiotelegraph frequencies assigned by the radio
      regulations annexed to the International Telecommunication
      Convention in force for the purposes of distress, direction
      finding, and maritime radio beacons, and, in installations made
      after May 26, 1965, such other frequencies as the Commission may

      will be under the control of the applicant;
        (3) necessary funds to construct, operate, and maintain such
      public telecommunications facilities will be available when
      needed;
        (4) such public telecommunications facilities will be used
      primarily for the provision of public telecommunications
      services, and that the use of such public telecommunications
      facilities for purposes other than the provision of public
      telecommunications services will not interfere with the provision
      of such public telecommunications services as required in this
      part;
        (5) the applicant has participated in comprehensive planning
      for such public telecommunications facilities in the area which
      the applicant proposes to serve, and such planning has included
      an evaluation of alternate technologies and coordination with
      State educational television and radio agencies, as appropriate;
      and
        (6) the applicant will make the most efficient use of the
      grant.
    (b) Amount of grant
      Upon approving any application under this section with respect to
    any project for the construction of public telecommunications
    facilities, the Secretary shall make a grant to the applicant in an
    amount determined by the Secretary, except that such amount shall
    not exceed 75 percent of the amount determined by the Secretary to
    be the reasonable and necessary cost of such project.
    (c) Information and assurances
      The Secretary may provide such funds as the Secretary deems
    necessary for the planning of any project for which construction
    funds may be obtained under this section. An applicant for a
    planning grant shall provide such information with respect to such
    project as the Secretary may require and shall provide assurances
    satisfactory to the Secretary that the applicant meets the eligible
    requirements of subsection (a) of this section to receive
    construction assistance.
    (d) Studies
      Any studies conducted by or for any grant recipient under this
    section shall be provided to the Secretary, if such studies are
    conducted through the use of funds received under this section.
    (e) Rules and regulations
      The Secretary shall establish such rules and regulations as may
    be necessary to carry out this subpart, including rules and
    regulations relating to the order of priority in approving
    applications for construction projects and relating to determining
    the amount of each grant for such projects.
    (f) Minorities and women
      In establishing criteria for grants pursuant to section 393 of
    this title and in establishing procedures relating to the order of
    priority established in subsection (e) of this section in approving
    applications for grants, the Secretary shall give special
    consideration to applications which would increase minority and
    women's ownership of, operation of, and participation in public
    telecommunications entities. The Secretary shall take affirmative
    steps to inform minorities and women of the availability of funds
    under this subpart, and the localities where new public
    telecommunications facilities are needed, and to provide such other
    assistance and information as may be appropriate.
    (g) Recovering funds
      If, within 10 years after completion of any project for
    construction of public telecommunications facilities with respect
    to which a grant has been made under this section - 
        (1) the applicant or other owner of such facilities ceases to
      be an agency, institution, foundation, corporation, association,
      or other entity described in subsection (a)(1) of this section;
      or
        (2) such facilities cease to be used primarily for the
      provision of public telecommunications services (or the use of
      such public telecommunications facilities for purposes other than
      the provision of public telecommunications services interferes
      with the provision of such public telecommunications services as
      required in this part);

    the United States shall be entitled to recover from the applicant
    or other owner of such facilities the amount bearing the same ratio
    to the value of such facilities at the time the applicant ceases to
    be such an entity or at the time of such determination (as
    determined by agreement of the parties or by action brought in the
    United States district court for the district in which such
    facilities are situated), as the amount of the Federal
    participation bore to the cost of construction of such facilities.
    (h) Recordkeeping requirements
      Each recipient of assistance under this subpart shall keep such
    records as may be reasonably necessary to enable the Secretary to
    carry out the functions of the Secretary under this subpart,
    including a complete and itemized inventory of all public
    telecommunications facilities under the control of such recipient,
    and records which fully disclose the amount and the disposition by
    such recipient of the proceeds of such assistance, the total cost
    of the project in connection with which such assistance is given or
    used, the amount and nature of that portion of the cost of the
    project supplied by other sources, and such other records as will
    facilitate an effective audit.
    (i) Accessibility of records
      The Secretary and the Comptroller General of the United States,
    or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access
    for the purpose of audit and examination to any books, documents,
    papers, and records of any recipient of assistance under this
    subpart that are pertinent to assistance received under this
    subpart.

    Sec. 394. Establishment of National Endowment

-STATUTE-
    (a) Purpose
      It is the purpose of this section to enhance the education of
    children through the creation and production of television
    programming specifically directed toward the development of
    fundamental intellectual skills.
    (b) Establishment; contracts and grants
      (1) There is established, under the direction of the Secretary, a
    National Endowment for Children's Educational Television. In
    administering the National Endowment, the Secretary is authorized
    to - 
        (A) contract with the Corporation for the production of
      educational television programming for children; and
        (B) make grants directly to persons proposing to create and
      produce educational television programming for children.

    The Secretary shall consult with the Advisory Council on Children's
    Educational Television in the making of the grants or the awarding
    of contracts for the purpose of making the grants.
      (2) Contracts and grants under this section shall be made on the
    condition that the programming shall - 
        (A) during the first two years after its production, be made
      available only to public television licensees and permittees and
      noncommercial television licensees and permittees; and
        (B) thereafter be made available to any commercial television
      licensee or permittee or cable television system operator, at a
      charge established by the Secretary that will assure the maximum
      practicable distribution of such programming, so long as such
      licensee, permittee, or operator does not interrupt the
      programming with commercial advertisements.

    The Secretary may, consistent with the purpose and provisions of
    this section, permit the programming to be distributed to persons
    using other media, establish conditions relating to such
    distribution, and apply those conditions to any contract or grant
    made under this section. The Secretary may waive the requirements
    of subparagraph (A) if the Secretary finds that neither public
    television licensees and permittees nor noncommercial television
    licensees and permittees will have an opportunity to air such
    programming in the first two years after its production.
    (c) Criteria for contracts and grants; applications for contracts
      and grants
      (1) The Secretary, with the advice of the Advisory Council on
    Children's Educational Television, shall establish criteria for

    be consistent with the purpose and provisions of this section and
    shall be made available to interested parties upon request. Such
    criteria shall include - 
        (A) criteria to maximize the amount of programming that is
      produced with the funds made available by the Endowment;
        (B) criteria to minimize the costs of - 
          (i) selection of grantees,
          (ii) administering the contracts and grants, and
          (iii) the administrative costs of the programming production;
        and

        (C) criteria to otherwise maximize the proportion of funds made
      available by the Endowment that are expended for the cost of
      programming production.

      (2) Applications for grants under this section shall be submitted
    to the Secretary in such form and containing such information as
    the Secretary shall require by regulation.
    (d) Amount of grants
      Upon approving any application for a grant under subsection
    (b)(1)(B) of this section, the Secretary shall make a grant to the
    applicant in an amount determined by the Secretary, except that
    such amounts shall not exceed 75 percent of the amount determined
    by the Secretary to be the reasonable and necessary cost of the
    project for which the grant is made.
    (e) Advisory Council on Children's Educational Television
      (1) The Secretary shall establish an Advisory Council on
    Children's Educational Television. The Secretary shall appoint ten

    psychology, child development, or television programming, or
    related disciplines. Officers and employees of the United States
    shall not be appointed as members.
      (3) While away from their homes or regular places of business in
    the performance of duties for the Council, the members of the
    Council shall serve without compensation but shall be allowed
    travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, in
    accordance with section 5703 of title 5.
      (4) The Council shall meet at the call of the Chairman and shall
    advise the Secretary concerning the making of contracts and grants
    under this section.
    (f) Recordkeeping relating to grants; audits
      (1) Each recipient of a grant under this section shall keep such
    records as may be reasonably necessary to enable the Secretary to
    carry out the Secretary's functions under this section, including
    records which fully disclose the amount and the disposition by such
    recipient of the proceeds of such grant, the total cost of the
    project, the amount and nature of that portion of the cost of the
    project supplied by other sources, and such other records as will
    facilitate an effective audit.
      (2) The Secretary and the Comptroller General of the United
    States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have

        "(2) these fundamental skills are essential for the future
      governmental and industrial leadership of the United States;
        "(3) the United States must act now to greatly improve the
      education of its children;
        "(4) television is watched by children about three hours each
      day on average and can be effective in teaching children;
        "(5) educational television programming for children is aired
      too infrequently either because public broadcast licensees and
      permittees lack funds or because commercial broadcast licensees
      and permittees or cable television system operators do not have
      the economic incentive; and
        "(6) the Federal Government can assist in the creation of
      children's educational television by establishing a National
      Endowment for Children's Educational Television to supplement the
      children's educational programming funded by other governmental
      entities."

      development of public radio and television broadcasting,
      including the use of such media for instructional, educational,
      and cultural purposes;
        (2) it is in the public interest to encourage the growth and
      development of nonbroadcast telecommunications technologies for
      the delivery of public telecommunications services;
        (3) expansion and development of public telecommunications and
      of diversity of its programming depend on freedom, imagination,
      and initiative on both local and national levels;
        (4) the encouragement and support of public telecommunications,
      while matters of importance for private and local development,
      are also of appropriate and important concern to the Federal
      Government;
        (5) it furthers the general welfare to encourage public
      telecommunications services which will be responsive to the
      interests of people both in particular localities and throughout
      the United States, which will constitute an expression of
      diversity and excellence, and which will constitute a source of
      alternative telecommunications services for all the citizens of
      the Nation;
        (6) it is in the public interest to encourage the development
      of programming that involves creative risks and that addresses
      the needs of unserved and underserved audiences, particularly
      children and minorities;
        (7) it is necessary and appropriate for the Federal Government
      to complement, assist, and support a national policy that will
      most effectively make public telecommunications services
      available to all citizens of the United States;
        (8) public television and radio stations and public
      telecommunications services constitute valuable local community
      resources for utilizing electronic media to address national
      concerns and solve local problems through community programs and
      outreach programs;
        (9) it is in the public interest for the Federal Government to
      ensure that all citizens of the United States have access to
      public telecommunications services through all appropriate
      available telecommunications distribution technologies; and
        (10) a private corporation should be created to facilitate the
      development of public telecommunications and to afford maximum
      protection from extraneous interference and control.

    Corporation.
      (iii)(I) For fiscal year 1990 and succeeding fiscal years, the
    Corporation shall, in carrying out its obligations under clause (i)

    Corporation for the expenditure of funds for the production of
    public television programs by independent producers and independent
    production entities.
      (III) The Corporation shall work with organizations or
    associations of independent producers or independent production

      (IV) The Corporation shall ensure that the funds provided to such
    independent production service shall be used exclusively in pursuit
    of the Corporation's obligation to expand the diversity and
    innovativeness of programming available to public broadcasting.
      (V) The Corporation shall report annually to Congress regarding
    the activities and expenditures of the independent production
    service, including carriage and viewing information for programs
    produced or acquired with funds provided pursuant to subclause (I).
    At the end of fiscal years 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995, the
    Corporation shall submit a report to Congress evaluating the
    performance of the independent production service in light of its
    mission to expand the diversity and innovativeness of programming
    available to public broadcasting.
      (VI) The Corporation shall not contract to provide funds to any
    such independent production service, unless that service agrees to
    comply with public inspection requirements established by the
    Corporation within 3 months after August 26, 1992. Under such
    requirements the service shall maintain at its offices a public
    file, updated regularly, containing information relating to the
    service's award of funds for the production of programming. The
    information shall be available for public inspection and copying
    for at least 3 years and shall be of the same kind as the
    information required to be maintained by the Corporation under
    subsection (l)(4)(B) of this section.
      (4) Funds may not be distributed pursuant to this subsection to
    the Public Broadcasting Service or National Public Radio (or any
    successor organization), or to the licensee or permittee of any
    public broadcast station, unless the governing body of any such
    organization, any committee of such governing body, or any advisory
    body of any such organization, holds open meetings preceded by
    reasonable notice to the public. All persons shall be permitted to
    attend any meeting of the board, or of any such committee or body,
    and no person shall be required, as a condition to attendance at
    any such meeting, to register such person's name or to provide any
    other information. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be
    construed to prevent any such board, committee, or body from
    holding closed sessions to consider matters relating to individual
    employees, proprietary information, litigation and other matters
    requiring the confidential advice of counsel, commercial or
    financial information obtained from a person on a privileged or
    confidential basis, or the purchase of property or services
    whenever the premature exposure of such purchase would compromise
    the business interests of any such organization. If any such
    meeting is closed pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, the
    organization involved shall thereafter (within a reasonable period
    of time) make available to the public a written statement
    containing an explanation of the reasons for closing the meeting.
      (5) Funds may not be distributed pursuant to this subsection to
    any public telecommunications entity that does not maintain for
    public examination copies of the annual financial and audit
    reports, or other information regarding finances, submitted to the
    Corporation pursuant to subsection (l)(3)(B) of this section.
      (6)(A) The Corporation shall conduct a study and prepare a plan,
    in consultation with public television licensees (or designated
    representatives of those licensees) and the Public Broadcasting
    Service, on how funds available to the Corporation under paragraph
    (3)(A)(ii)(II) can be best allocated to meet the objectives of this
    chapter with regard to national public television programming. The
    plan, which shall be based on the conclusions resulting from the
    study, shall be submitted by the Corporation to the Congress not
    later than January 31, 1990. Unless directed otherwise by an Act of
    Congress, the Corporation shall implement the plan during the first
    fiscal year beginning after the fiscal year in which the plan is
    submitted to Congress.
      (B) The Corporation shall make a basic grant from the portion
    reserved for television stations under paragraph (3)(A)(ii)(I) to
    each licensee and permittee of a public television station that is
    on the air. The Corporation shall assist radio stations to maintain
    and improve their service where public radio is the only broadcast
    service available. The balance of the portion reserved for
    television stations and the total portion reserved for radio
    stations under paragraph (3)(A)(iii)(I) shall be distributed to
    licensees and permittees of such stations in accordance with
    eligibility criteria (which the Corporation shall review
    periodically in consultation with public radio and television
    licensees or permittees, or their designated representatives) that
    promote the public interest in public broadcasting, and on the
    basis of a formula designed to - 
        (i) provide for the financial needs and requirements of
      stations in relation to the communities and audiences such
      stations undertake to serve;
        (ii) maintain existing, and stimulate new, sources of non-
      Federal financial support for stations by providing incentives
      for increases in such support; and
        (iii) assure that each eligible licensee and permittee of a
      public radio station receives a basic grant.

      (7) The funds distributed pursuant to paragraph (3)(A)(ii)(I) and
    (iii)(I) may be used at the discretion of the recipient for
    purposes related primarily to the production or acquisition of
    programming.
      (8)(A) Funds may not be distributed pursuant to this subpart to
    any public broadcast station (other than any station which is owned
    and operated by a State, a political or special purpose subdivision
    of a State, or a public agency) unless such station establishes a
    community advisory board. Any such station shall undertake good
    faith efforts to assure that (i) its advisory board meets at
    regular intervals; (ii) the members of its advisory board regularly
    attend the meetings of the advisory board; and (iii) the
    composition of its advisory board are (!2) reasonably
    representative of the diverse needs and interests of the
    communities served by such station.

      (B) The board shall be permitted to review the programming goals
    established by the station, the service provided by the station,
    and the significant policy decisions rendered by the station. The
    board may also be delegated any other responsibilities, as
    determined by the governing body of the station. The board shall
    advise the governing body of the station with respect to whether
    the programming and other policies of such station are meeting the
    specialized educational and cultural needs of the communities
    served by the station, and may make such recommendations as it
    considers appropriate to meet such needs.
      (C) The role of the board shall be solely advisory in nature,
    except to the extent other responsibilities are delegated to the
    board by the governing body of the station. In no case shall the
    board have any authority to exercise any control over the daily
    management or operation of the station.
      (D) In the case of any public broadcast station (other than any
    station which is owned and operated by a State, a political or
    special purpose subdivision of a State, or a public agency) in
    existence on November 2, 1978, such station shall comply with the
    requirements of this paragraph with respect to the establishment of
    a community advisory board not later than 180 days after November
    2, 1978.
      (E) The provision of subparagraph (A) prohibiting the
    distribution of funds to any public broadcast station (other than
    any station which is owned and operated by a State, a political or
    special purpose subdivision of a State, or a public agency) unless
    such station establishes a community advisory board shall be the
    exclusive remedy for the enforcement of the provisions of this
    paragraph.
      (9) Funds may not be distributed pursuant to this subsection to
    the Public Broadcasting Service or National Public Radio (or any
    successor organization) unless assurances are provided to the
    Corporation that no officer or employee of the Public Broadcasting
    Service or National Public Radio (or any successor organization),
    as the case may be, will be compensated in excess of reasonable
    compensation as determined pursuant to Section (!3) 4958 of title
    26 for services that the officer or employee renders to
    organization,(!4) and unless further assurances are provided to the
    Corporation that no officer or employee of such an entity will be
    loaned money by that entity on an interest-free basis.


      (10)(A) There is hereby established in the Treasury a fund which
    shall be known as the Public Broadcasting Satellite Interconnection
    Fund (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the "Satellite
    Interconnection Fund"), to be administered by the Secretary of the
    Treasury.
      (B) There is authorized to be appropriated to the Satellite
    Interconnection Fund, for fiscal year 1991, the amount of
    $200,000,000. If such amount is not appropriated in full for fiscal
    year 1991, the portion of such amount not yet appropriated is
    authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years 1992 and 1993. Funds
    appropriated to the Satellite Interconnection Fund shall remain
    available until expended.
      (C) The Secretary of the Treasury shall make available and
    disburse to the Corporation, at the beginning of fiscal year 1991
    and of each succeeding fiscal year thereafter, such funds as have

      national entity they designate for satellite interconnection
      purposes and to those public telecommunications entities
      participating in the public radio satellite interconnection
      system or the national entity they designate for satellite
      interconnection purposes, exclusively for the capital costs of
      the replacement, refurbishment, or upgrading of their national
      satellite interconnection systems and associated maintenance of
      such systems; and
        (ii) shall not be used for the administrative costs of the

      personnel and members of the Board, or for expenses of
      consultants and advisers to the Corporation.

      (11)(A) Funds may not be distributed pursuant to this subsection
    for any fiscal year to the licensee or permittee of any public
    broadcast station if such licensee or permittee - 
        (i) fails to certify to the Corporation that such licensee or
      permittee complies with the Commission's regulations concerning
      equal employment opportunity as published under section 73.2080
      of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor
      regulations thereto; or

    job openings were not filled in accordance with such regulations,
    the report shall contain a statement providing reasons therefor.
    The statistical report shall be available to the public at the
    central office and at every location where more than five full-time
    employees are regularly assigned to work.
      (12) Funds may not be distributed under this subsection to any
    public broadcasting entity that directly or indirectly -

    independent certified public accountants or independent licensed
    public accountants certified or licensed by a regulatory authority
    of a State or other political subdivision of the United States,

    receiving funds under this subpart, taking into account
    organizational differences among various categories of such
    entities. Such principles shall be designed to account fully for
    all funds received and expended for public telecommunications

      (C) Any recipient of assistance by grant or contract under this
    section, other than a fixed price contract awarded pursuant to

    such other records as will facilitate an effective audit.
      (D) The Corporation or any of its duly authorized representatives
    shall have access to any books, documents, papers, and records of
    any recipient of assistance for the purpose of auditing and

      awardee or producer is a corporation or partnership, the
      principals of such corporation or partnership), the monetary
      amount of the award, and the title and description of the program
      (and of each program in a series of programs).

    distribution of public television or radio programs. Such list
    shall include the names of the programs (or program series),
    producers, and providers of funding.
    (m) Needs of minorities and other groups
      (1) Prior to July 1, 1989, and every three years thereafter, the
    Corporation shall compile an assessment of the needs of minority
    and diverse audiences, the plans of public broadcasting entities
    and public telecommunications entities to address such needs, the
    ways radio and television can be used to help these
    underrepresented groups, and projections concerning minority
    employment by public broadcasting entities and public
    telecommunications entities. Such assessment shall address the
    needs of racial and ethnic minorities, new immigrant populations,
    people for whom English is a second language, and adults who lack

      Nothing contained in this part shall be deemed (1) to amend any
    other provision of, or requirement under, this chapter; or (2)
    except to the extent authorized in subsection (b) of this section,
    to authorize any department, agency, officer, or employee of the
    United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control
    over public telecommunications, or over the Corporation or any of
    its grantees or contractors, or over the charter or bylaws of the
    Corporation, or over the curriculum, program of instruction, or
    personnel of any educational institution, school system, or public
    telecommunications entity.
    (b) Equal opportunity employment
      (1) Equal opportunity in employment shall be afforded to all
    persons by the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public
    Radio (or any successor organization) and by all public
    telecommunications entities receiving funds pursuant to subpart C
    (!1) (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as "recipients"),
    in accordance with the equal employment opportunity regulations of
    the Commission, and no person shall be subjected to discrimination
    in employment by any recipient on the grounds of race, color,
    religion, national origin, or sex.

      (2)(A) The Secretary is authorized and directed to enforce this
    subsection and to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be
    necessary to carry out the functions of the Secretary under this
    subsection.
      (B) The Secretary shall provide for close coordination with the
    Commission in the administration of the responsibilities of the
    Secretary under this subsection which are of interest to or affect
    the functions of the Commission so that, to the maximum extent
    possible consistent with the enforcement responsibilities of each,
    the reporting requirements of public telecommunications entities
    shall be uniformly based upon consistent definitions and categories
    of information.
      (3)(A) The Corporation shall incorporate into each grant
    agreement or contract with any recipient entered into on or after
    the effective date of the rules and regulations prescribed by the
    Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2)(A), a statement indicating
    that, as a material part of the terms and conditions of the grant
    agreement or contract, the recipient will comply with the
    provisions of paragraph (1) and the rules and regulations
    prescribed pursuant to paragraph (2)(A). Any person which desires
    to be a recipient (within the meaning of paragraph (1)) of funds
    under subpart C (!1) shall, before receiving any such funds,
    provide to the Corporation any information which the Corporation
    may require to satisfy itself that such person is affording equal

    requirements of this subsection, the Corporation shall notify the
    Secretary, and the Secretary shall review the matter and make a
    final determination regarding whether such person is affording
    equal opportunity in employment. In any case in which the Secretary
    conducts a review under the preceding sentence, the Corporation
    shall make funds available to the person involved pursuant to the
    grant application of such person (if the Corporation would have
    approved such application but for the finding of the Corporation
    under this paragraph) pending a final determination of the
    Secretary upon completion of such review. The Corporation shall
    monitor the equal employment opportunity practices of each
    recipient throughout the duration of the grant or contract.
      (C) The provisions of subparagraph (A) and subparagraph (B) shall
    take effect on the effective date of the rules and regulations
    prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2)(A).
      (4) Based upon its responsibilities under paragraph (3), the
    Corporation shall provide an annual report for the preceding fiscal
    year ending September 30 to the Secretary on or before the 15th day
    of February of each year. The report shall contain information in
    the form required by the Secretary. The Corporation shall submit a
    summary of such report to the President and the Congress as part of
    the report required in section 396(i) of this title. The
    Corporation shall provide other information in the form which the
    Secretary may require in order to carry out the functions of the
    Secretary under this subsection.
      (5) Whenever the Secretary makes a final determination, pursuant
    to the rules and regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe,
    that a recipient is not in compliance with paragraph (1), the
    Secretary shall, within 10 days after such determination, notify
    the recipient in writing of such determination and request the
    recipient to secure compliance. Unless the recipient within 120
    days after receipt of such written notice - 
        (A) demonstrates to the Secretary that the violation has been
      corrected; or
        (B) enters into a compliance agreement approved by the
      Secretary;

    the Secretary shall direct the Corporation to reduce or suspend any
    further payments of funds under this part to the recipient and the
    Corporation shall comply with such directive. Resumption of
    payments shall take place only when the Secretary certifies to the
    Corporation that the recipient has entered into a compliance
    agreement approved by the Secretary. A recipient whose funds have
    been reduced or suspended under this paragraph may apply at any
    time to the Secretary for such certification.
    (c) Control over content or distribution of programs
      Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize any
    department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to
    exercise any direction, supervision, or control over the content or
    distribution of public telecommunications programs and services, or

      The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction,

    United States, by its Attorney General, may apply to the
    appropriate district court of the United States for the enforcement
    of such order. If, after hearing, that court determines that the
    order was regularly made and duly served, and that the person is in

    order by a writ of injunction or other proper process, mandatory or
    otherwise, to restrain such person or the officers, agents, or
    representatives of such person, from further disobedience of such
    order, or to enjoin upon it or them obedience to the same.

    Sec. 402. Judicial review of Commission's orders and decisions

-STATUTE-
    (a) Procedure
      Any proceeding to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend any order
    of the Commission under this chapter (except those appealable under
    subsection (b) of this section) shall be brought as provided by and
    in the manner prescribed in chapter 158 of title 28.
    (b) Right to appeal
      Appeals may be taken from decisions and orders of the Commission
    to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
    in any of the following cases:
        (1) By any applicant for a construction permit or station
      license, whose application is denied by the Commission.
        (2) By any applicant for the renewal or modification of any
      such instrument of authorization whose application is denied by
      the Commission.
        (3) By any party to an application for authority to transfer,
      assign, or dispose of any such instrument of authorization, or
      any rights thereunder, whose application is denied by the
      Commission.
        (4) By any applicant for the permit required by section 325 of
      this title whose application has been denied by the Commission,
      or by any permittee under said section whose permit has been
      revoked by the Commission.
        (5) By the holder of any construction permit or station license
      which has been modified or revoked by the Commission.
        (6) By any other person who is aggrieved or whose interests are
      adversely affected by any order of the Commission granting or
      denying any application described in paragraphs (1), (2), (3),
      (4), and (9) of this subsection.
        (7) By any person upon whom an order to cease and desist has
      been served under section 312 of this title.

    (c) Filing notice of appeal; contents; jurisdiction; temporary
      orders
      Such appeal shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the
    court within thirty days from the date upon which public notice is
    given of the decision or order complained of. Such notice of appeal
    shall contain a concise statement of the nature of the proceedings
    as to which the appeal is taken; a concise statement of the reasons
    on which the appellant intends to rely, separately stated and
    numbered; and proof of service of a true copy of said notice and
    statement upon the Commission. Upon filing of such notice, the
    court shall have jurisdiction of the proceedings and of the
    questions determined therein and shall have power, by order,
    directed to the Commission or any other party to the appeal, to
    grant such temporary relief as it may deem just and proper. Orders
    granting temporary relief may be either affirmative or negative in
    their scope and application so as to permit either the maintenance
    of the status quo in the matter in which the appeal is taken or the
    restoration of a position or status terminated or adversely
    affected by the order appealed from and shall, unless otherwise
    ordered by the court, be effective pending hearing and
    determination of said appeal and compliance by the Commission with
    the final judgment of the court rendered in said appeal.
    (d) Notice to interested parties; filing of record
      Upon the filing of any such notice of appeal the appellant shall,
    not later than five days after the filing of such notice, notify
    each person shown by the records of the Commission to be interested
    in said appeal of the filing and pendency of the same. The
    Commission shall file with the court the record upon which the
    order complained of was entered, as provided in section 2112 of
    title 28.
    (e) Intervention
      Within thirty days after the filing of any such appeal any
    interested person may intervene and participate in the proceedings
    had upon said appeal by filing with the court a notice of intention
    to intervene and a verified statement showing the nature of the
    interest of such party, together with proof of service of true
    copies of said notice and statement, both upon appellant and upon
    the Commission. Any person who would be aggrieved or whose interest
    would be adversely affected by a reversal or modification of the
    order of the Commission complained of shall be considered an
    interested party.
    (f) Records and briefs
      The record and briefs upon which any such appeal shall be heard
    and determined by the court shall contain such information and
    material, and shall be prepared within such time and in such manner
    as the court may by rule prescribe.
    (g) Time of hearing; procedure
      The court shall hear and determine the appeal upon the record
    before it in the manner prescribed by section 706 of title 5.
    (h) Remand
      In the event that the court shall render a decision and enter an
    order reversing the order of the Commission, it shall remand the
    case to the Commission to carry out the judgment of the court and
    it shall be the duty of the Commission, in the absence of the
    proceedings to review such judgment, to forthwith give effect
    thereto, and unless otherwise ordered by the court, to do so upon
    the basis of the proceedings already had and the record upon which
    said appeal was heard and determined.
    (i) Judgment for costs
      The court may, in its discretion, enter judgment for costs in
    favor of or against an appellant, or other interested parties
    intervening in said appeal, but not against the Commission,
    depending upon the nature of the issues involved upon said appeal
    and the outcome thereof.
    (j) Finality of decision; review by Supreme Court
      The court's judgment shall be final, subject, however, to review
    by the Supreme Court of the United States upon writ of certiorari
    on petition therefor under section 1254 of title 28, by the
    appellant, by the Commission, or by any interested party
    intervening in the appeal, or by certification by the court
    pursuant to the provisions of that section.

    Sec. 405. Petition for reconsideration; procedure; disposition;
      time of filing; additional evidence; time for disposition of
      petition for reconsideration of order concluding hearing or
      investigation; appeal of order

-STATUTE-
      (a) After an order, decision, report, or action has been made or
    taken in any proceeding by the Commission, or by any designated
    authority within the Commission pursuant to a delegation under
    section 155(c)(1) of this title, any party thereto, or any other
    person aggrieved or whose interests are adversely affected thereby,
    may petition for reconsideration only to the authority making or
    taking the order, decision, report, or action; and it shall be
    lawful for such authority, whether it be the Commission or other
    authority designated under section 155(c)(1) of this title, in its
    discretion, to grant such a reconsideration if sufficient reason
    therefor be made to appear. A petition for reconsideration must be
    filed within thirty days from the date upon which public notice is
    given of the order, decision, report, or action complained of. No
    such application shall excuse any person from complying with or
    obeying any order, decision, report, or action of the Commission,
    or operate in any manner to stay or postpone the enforcement
    thereof, without the special order of the Commission. The filing of
    a petition for reconsideration shall not be a condition precedent
    to judicial review of any such order, decision, report, or action,
    except where the party seeking such review (1) was not a party to
    the proceedings resulting in such order, decision, report, or
    action, or (2) relies on questions of fact or law upon which the
    Commission, or designated authority within the Commission, has been
    afforded no opportunity to pass. The Commission, or designated
    authority within the Commission, shall enter an order, with a
    concise statement of the reasons therefor, denying a petition for
    reconsideration or granting such petition, in whole or in part, and
    ordering such further proceedings as may be appropriate: Provided,
    That in any case where such petition relates to an instrument of
    authorization granted without a hearing, the Commission, or
    designated authority within the Commission, shall take such action
    within ninety days of the filing of such petition. Reconsiderations
    shall be governed by such general rules as the Commission may
    establish, except that no evidence other than newly discovered
    evidence, evidence which has become available only since the
    original taking of evidence, or evidence which the Commission or
    designated authority within the Commission believes should have
    been taken in the original proceeding shall be taken on any
    reconsideration. The time within which a petition for review must
    be filed in a proceeding to which section 402(a) of this title
    applies, or within which an appeal must be taken under section
    402(b) of this title in any case, shall be computed from the date
    upon which the Commission gives public notice of the order,
    decision, report, or action complained of.
      (b)(1) Within 90 days after receiving a petition for
    reconsideration of an order concluding a hearing under section
    204(a) of this title or concluding an investigation under section
    208(b) of this title, the Commission shall issue an order granting
    or denying such petition.
      (2) Any order issued under paragraph (1) shall be a final order
    and may be appealed under section 402(a) of this title.

    any order, decision, report, or action made or taken after such
    rehearing reversing, changing, or modifying the original order

      1961 - Pub. L. 87-192 provided for petition for rehearing to the
    authority making or taking the order, decision, report, or action,
    substituted references to report and action for requirement,
    wherever else appearing, and inserted references to proceeding by
    any designated authority within the Commission, wherever appearing.
      1960 - Pub. L. 86-752 substituted "any party" for "and party" in
    first sentence, and inserted sentence dealing with disposition of
    petitions for rehearing.

      jurisdiction

-STATUTE-
      The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction
    upon the relation of any person alleging any violation, by a
    carrier subject to this chapter, of any of the provisions of this
    chapter which prevent the relator from receiving service in
    interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio, or in
    interstate or foreign transmission of energy by radio, from said
    carrier at the same charges, or upon terms or conditions as
    favorable as those given by said carrier for like communication or
    transmission under similar conditions to any other person, to issue
    a writ or writs of mandamus against said carrier commanding such
    carrier to furnish facilities for such communication or
    transmission to the party applying for the writ: Provided, That if
    any question of fact as to the proper compensation to the carrier
    for the service to be enforced by the writ is raised by the
    pleadings, the writ of peremptory mandamus may issue,
    notwithstanding such question of fact is undetermined, upon such
    terms as to security, payment of money into the court, or
    otherwise, as the court may think proper pending the determination
    of the question of fact: Provided further, That the remedy given by
    writ of mandamus shall be cumulative and shall not be held to
    exclude or interfere with other remedies provided by this chapter.

      If a carrier does not comply with an order for the payment of
    money within the time limit in such order, the complainant, or any
    person for whose benefit such order was made, may file in the
    district court of the United States for the district in which he
    resides or in which is located the principal operating office of
    the carrier, or through which the line of the carrier runs, or in
    any State court of general jurisdiction having jurisdiction of the
    parties, a petition setting forth briefly the causes for which he
    claims damages, and the order of the Commission in the premises.
    Such suit in the district court of the United States shall proceed
    in all respects like other civil suits for damages, except that on
    the trial of such suits the findings and order of the Commission
    shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated, except
    that the petitioner shall not be liable for costs in the district
    court nor for costs at any subsequent stage of the proceedings
    unless they accrue upon his appeal. If the petitioner shall finally
    prevail, he shall be allowed a reasonable attorney's fee, to be
    taxed and collected as a part of the costs of the suit.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Filing of initial decisions; exceptions
      In every case of adjudication (as defined in section 551 of title
    5) which has been designated by the Commission for hearing, the
    person or persons conducting the hearing shall prepare and file an
    initial, tentative, or recommended decision, except where such
    person or persons become unavailable to the Commission or where the
    Commission finds upon the record that due and timely execution of
    its functions imperatively and unavoidably require that the record
    be certified to the Commission for initial or final decision.
    (b) Exceptions to initial decisions; memoranda; determination of
      Commission or authority within Commission; prohibition against
      consideration of own decision
      In every case of adjudication (as defined in section 551 of title
    5) which has been designated by the Commission for hearing, any
    party to the proceeding shall be permitted to file exceptions and
    memoranda in support thereof to the initial, tentative, or
    recommended decision, which shall be passed upon by the Commission
    or by the authority within the Commission, if any, to whom the
    function of passing upon the exceptions is delegated under section
    155(d)(1) (!1) of this title: Provided, however, That such
    authority shall not be the same authority which made the decision
    to which the exception is taken.

    (c) Notice and opportunity for participation by parties;
      applicability of administrative procedure provisions
      (1) In any case of adjudication (as defined in section 551 of
    title 5) which has been designated by the Commission for a hearing,
    no person who has participated in the presentation or preparation
    for presentation of such case at the hearing or upon review shall
    (except to the extent required for the disposition of ex parte
    matters as authorized by law) directly or indirectly make any
    additional presentation respecting such case to the hearing officer
    or officers or to the Commission, or to any authority within the
    Commission to whom, in such case, review functions have been
    delegated by the Commission under section 155(d)(1) (!1) of this
    title, unless upon notice and opportunity for all parties to
    participate.
      (2) The provision in section 554(d) of title 5 which states that
    such subsection shall not apply in determining applications for
    initial licenses, shall not be applicable hereafter in the case of
    applications for initial licenses before the Federal Communications
    Commission.
    (d) Applicability of administrative procedure provisions
      To the extent that the foregoing provisions of this section and
    section 155(d) (!1) of this title are in conflict with the
    provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5, and chapter 7, of title
    5, such provisions of this section and section 155(d) (!1) of this
    title shall be held to supersede and modify the provisions of
    subchapter II of chapter 5, and chapter 7, of title 5.
    (e) Subpenas; witnesses; production of documents; fees and mileage
      For the purposes of this chapter the Commission shall have the
    power to require by subpena the attendance and testimony of
    witnesses and the production of all books, papers, schedules of
    charges, contracts, agreements, and documents relating to any
    matter under investigation. Witnesses summoned before the
    Commission shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid
    witnesses in the courts of the United States.
    (f) Designated place of hearing; aid in enforcement of orders
      Such attendance of witnesses, and the production of such
    documentary evidence, may be required from any place in the United
    States, at any designated place of hearing. And in case of
    disobedience to a subpena the Commission, or any party to a
    proceeding before the Commission, may invoke the aid of any court
    of the United States in requiring the attendance and testimony of
    witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents under
    the provisions of this section.
    (g) Contempts
      Any of the district courts of the United States within the
    jurisdiction of which such inquiry is carried on may, in case of
    contumacy or refusal to obey a subpena issued to any common carrier
    or licensee or other person, issue an order requiring such common
    carrier, licensee, or other person to appear before the Commission
    (and produce books and papers if so ordered) and give evidence
    touching the matter in question; and any failure to obey such order
    of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof.
    (h) Depositions
      The testimony of any witness may be taken, at the instance of a
    party, in any proceeding or investigation pending before the
    Commission, by deposition, at any time after a cause or proceeding
    is at issue on petition and answer. The Commission may also order
    testimony to be taken by deposition in any proceeding or
    investigation pending before it, at any stage of such proceeding or
    investigation. Such depositions may be taken before any judge of
    any court of the United States, or any United States magistrate
    judge, or any clerk of a district court, or any chancellor,
    justice, or judge of a supreme or superior court, mayor, or chief
    magistrate of a city, judge of a county court, or court of common
    pleas of any of the United States, or any notary public, not being
    of counsel or attorney to either of the parties, nor interested in
    the event of the proceeding or investigation. Reasonable notice
    must first be given in writing by the party or his attorney
    proposing to take such deposition to the opposite party or his
    attorney of record, as either may be nearest, which notice shall
    state the name of the witness and the time and place of the taking
    of his deposition. Any person may be compelled to appear and
    depose, and to produce documentary evidence, in the same manner as
    witnesses may be compelled to appear and testify and produce
    documentary evidence before the Commission, as hereinbefore
    provided.
    (i) Oaths; testimony in writing
      Every person deposing as herein provided shall be cautioned and
    sworn (or affirm, if he so request) to testify the whole truth, and
    shall be carefully examined. His testimony shall be reduced to
    writing by the magistrate taking the deposition, or under his
    direction, and shall, after it has been reduced to writing, be
    subscribed by the deponent.
    (j) Foreign depositions
      If a witness whose testimony may be desired to be taken by
    deposition be in a foreign country, the deposition may be taken
    before an officer or person designated by the Commission, or agreed
    upon by the parties by stipulation in writing to be filed with the
    Commission. All depositions must be promptly filed with the
    Commission.
    (k) Deposition fees
      Witnesses whose depositions are taken as authorized in this
    chapter, and the magistrate or other officer taking the same, shall
    severally be entitled to the same fees as are paid for like
    services in the courts of the United States.
    (l) Repealed. Pub. L. 91-452, title II, Sec. 242, Oct. 15, 1970, 84
      Stat. 930
    (m) Penalties
      Any person who shall neglect or refuse to attend and testify, or
    to answer any lawful inquiry, or to produce books, papers,
    schedules of charges, contracts, agreements, and documents, if in
    his power to do so, in obedience to the subpena or lawful
    requirement of the Commission, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and
    upon conviction thereof by a court of competent jurisdiction shall
    be punished by a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $5,000,
    or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or by both such fine
    and imprisonment.

    of members, as determined by the Commission, from each of the
    States in which the wire or radio communication affected by or

    of acting upon such matter any such board shall have all the
    jurisdiction and powers conferred by law upon an examiner provided
    for in section 3105 of title 5, designated by the Commission, and
    shall be subject to the same duties and obligations. The action of
    a joint board shall have such force and effect and its proceedings

    regulations prescribe. The joint board member or members for each
    State shall be nominated by the State commission of the State or by
    the Governor if there is no State commission, and appointed by the
    Federal Communications Commission. The Commission shall have
    discretion to reject any nominee. Joint board members shall receive

    the Commission is authorized under such rules and regulations as it
    shall prescribe to hold joint hearings with any State commission in
    connection with any matter with respect to which the Commission is
    authorized to act. The Commission is authorized in the

    in section 409 of this title, may refer any other matter, relating
    to common carrier communications of joint Federal-State concern, to

    jurisdiction, powers, duties, and obligations as a joint board
    established under subsection (a) of this section, and shall prepare
    a recommended decision for prompt review and action by the
    Commission. In addition, the State members of the Joint Board shall

    the recommended decision of the Joint Board or any further
    decisional action that may be required in the proceeding. The Joint
    Board shall be composed of three Commissioners of the Commission
    and of four State commissioners nominated by the national
    organization of the State commissions and approved by the
    Commission. The Chairman of the Commission, or another Commissioner
    designated by the Commission, shall serve as Chairman of the Joint

-STATUTE-
    (a) Rebates and offsets
      Any person who shall deliver messages for interstate or foreign
    transmission to any carrier, or for whom as sender or receiver, any
    such carrier shall transmit any interstate or foreign wire or radio
    communication, who shall knowingly by employee, agent, officer, or
    otherwise, directly or indirectly, by or through any means or
    device whatsoever, receive or accept from such common carrier any
    sum of money or any other valuable consideration as a rebate or
    offset against the regular charges for transmission of such
    messages as fixed by the schedules of charges provided for in this
    chapter, shall in addition to any other penalty provided by this
    chapter forfeit to the United States a sum of money three times the
    amount of money so received or accepted and three times the value
    of any other consideration so received or accepted, to be
    ascertained by the trial court; and in the trial of said action all
    such rebates or other considerations so received or accepted for a
    period of six years prior to the commencement of the action, may be
    included therein, and the amount recovered shall be three times the
    total amount of money, or three times the total value of such
    consideration, so received or accepted, or both, as the case may
    be.
    (b) Activities constituting violations authorizing imposition of
      forfeiture penalty; amount of penalty; procedures applicable;
      persons subject to penalty; liability exemption period
      (1) Any person who is determined by the Commission, in accordance
    with paragraph (3) or (4) of this subsection, to have - 
        (A) willfully or repeatedly failed to comply substantially with
      the terms and conditions of any license, permit, certificate, or
      other instrument or authorization issued by the Commission;
        (B) willfully or repeatedly failed to comply with any of the
      provisions of this chapter or of any rule, regulation, or order
      issued by the Commission under this chapter or under any treaty,
      convention, or other agreement to which the United States is a
      party and which is binding upon the United States;
        (C) violated any provision of section 317(c) or 509(a) of this
      title; or
        (D) violated any provision of section 1304, 1343, 1464, or 2252
      of title 18;

    shall be liable to the United States for a forfeiture penalty. A
    forfeiture penalty under this subsection shall be in addition to
    any other penalty provided for by this chapter; except that this
    subsection shall not apply to any conduct which is subject to
    forfeiture under subchapter II of this chapter, part II or III of
    subchapter III of this chapter, or section 507 of this title.
      (2)(A) If the violator is (i) a broadcast station licensee or
    permittee, (ii) a cable television operator, or (iii) an applicant
    for any broadcast or cable television operator license, permit,
    certificate, or other instrument or authorization issued by the
    Commission, the amount of any forfeiture penalty determined under
    this section shall not exceed $25,000 for each violation or each
    day of a continuing violation, except that the amount assessed for
    any continuing violation shall not exceed a total of $250,000 for
    any single act or failure to act described in paragraph (1) of this
    subsection.
      (B) If the violator is a common carrier subject to the provisions
    of this chapter or an applicant for any common carrier license,
    permit, certificate, or other instrument of authorization issued by
    the Commission, the amount of any forfeiture penalty determined
    under this subsection shall not exceed $100,000 for each violation
    or each day of a continuing violation, except that the amount
    assessed for any continuing violation shall not exceed a total of
    $1,000,000 for any single act or failure to act described in
    paragraph (1) of this subsection.
      (C) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if the violator is - 
        (i)(I) a broadcast station licensee or permittee; or
        (II) an applicant for any broadcast license, permit,
      certificate, or other instrument or authorization issued by the
      Commission; and
        (ii) determined by the Commission under paragraph (1) to have
      broadcast obscene, indecent, or profane language,(!1) the amount
      of any forfeiture penalty determined under this subsection shall
      not exceed $325,000 for each violation or each day of a
      continuing violation, except that the amount assessed for any
      continuing violation shall not exceed a total of $3,000,000 for
      any single act or failure to act.


      (D) In any case not covered in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C), the
    amount of any forfeiture penalty determined under this subsection
    shall not exceed $10,000 for each violation or each day of a
    continuing violation, except that the amount assessed for any
    continuing violation shall not exceed a total of $75,000 for any
    single act or failure to act described in paragraph (1) of this
    subsection.
      (E) The amount of such forfeiture penalty shall be assessed by
    the Commission, or its designee, by written notice. In determining
    the amount of such a forfeiture penalty, the Commission or its
    designee shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent,
    and gravity of the violation and, with respect to the violator, the
    degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, ability to
    pay, and such other matters as justice may require.
      (3)(A) At the discretion of the Commission, a forfeiture penalty
    may be determined against a person under this subsection after
    notice and an opportunity for a hearing before the Commission or an
    administrative law judge thereof in accordance with section 554 of
    title 5. Any person against whom a forfeiture penalty is determined
    under this paragraph may obtain review thereof pursuant to section
    402(a) of this title.
      (B) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a forfeiture
    penalty determined under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, after
    it has become a final and unappealable order or after the
    appropriate court has entered final judgment in favor of the
    Commission, the Commission shall refer the matter to the Attorney
    General of the United States, who shall recover the amount assessed
    in any appropriate district court of the United States. In such
    action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order
    imposing the forfeiture penalty shall not be subject to review.
      (4) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, no
    forfeiture penalty shall be imposed under this subsection against
    any person unless and until - 
        (A) the Commission issues a notice of apparent liability, in
      writing, with respect to such person;
        (B) such notice has been received by such person, or until the
      Commission has sent such notice to the last known address of such
      person, by registered or certified mail; and
        (C) such person is granted an opportunity to show, in writing,
      within such reasonable period of time as the Commission
      prescribes by rule or regulation, why no such forfeiture penalty
      should be imposed.

    Such a notice shall (i) identify each specific provision, term, and
    condition of any Act, rule, regulation, order, treaty, convention,
    or other agreement, license, permit, certificate, instrument, or
    authorization which such person apparently violated or with which
    such person apparently failed to comply; (ii) set forth the nature
    of the act or omission charged against such person and the facts
    upon which such charge is based; and (iii) state the date on which
    such conduct occurred. Any forfeiture penalty determined under this
    paragraph shall be recoverable pursuant to section 504(a) of this
    title.
      (5) No forfeiture liability shall be determined under this
    subsection against any person, if such person does not hold a
    license, permit, certificate, or other authorization issued by the
    Commission, and if such person is not an applicant for a license,
    permit, certificate, or other authorization issued by the
    Commission, unless, prior to the notice required by paragraph (3)
    of this subsection or the notice of apparent liability required by
    paragraph (4) of this subsection, such person (A) is sent a
    citation of the violation charged; (B) is given a reasonable
    opportunity for a personal interview with an official of the
    Commission, at the field office of the Commission which is nearest
    to such person's place of residence; and (C) subsequently engages
    in conduct of the type described in such citation. The provisions
    of this paragraph shall not apply, however, if the person involved
    is engaging in activities for which a license, permit, certificate,
    or other authorization is required, or is a cable television system
    operator, if the person involved is transmitting on frequencies
    assigned for use in a service in which individual station operation
    is authorized by rule pursuant to section 307(e) of this title, or
    in the case of violations of section 303(q) of this title, if the
    person involved is a nonlicensee tower owner who has previously
    received notice of the obligations imposed by section 303(q) of
    this title from the Commission or the permittee or licensee who
    uses that tower. Whenever the requirements of this paragraph are
    satisfied with respect to a particular person, such person shall
    not be entitled to receive any additional citation of the violation
    charged, with respect to any conduct of the type described in the
    citation sent under this paragraph.
      (6) No forfeiture penalty shall be determined or imposed against
    any person under this subsection if - 
        (A) such person holds a broadcast station license issued under
      subchapter III of this chapter and if the violation charged
      occurred - 
          (i) more than 1 year prior to the date of issuance of the
        required notice or notice of apparent liability; or
          (ii) prior to the date of commencement of the current term of
        such license,

      whichever is earlier; or
        (B) such person does not hold a broadcast station license
      issued under subchapter III of this chapter and if the violation
      charged occurred more than 1 year prior to the date of issuance
      of the required notice or notice of apparent liability.

    For purposes of this paragraph, "date of commencement of the
    current term of such license" means the date of commencement of the
    last term of license for which the licensee has been granted a
    license by the Commission. A separate license term shall not be
    deemed to have commenced as a result of continuing a license in
    effect under section 307(c) of this title pending decision on an
    application for renewal of the license.

    determined under section 503(b)(3) of this title, in a civil suit
    in the name of the United States brought in the district where the
    person or carrier has its principal operating office or in any
    district through which the line or system of the carrier runs:
    Provided, That any suit for the recovery of a forfeiture imposed
    pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be a trial de
    novo: Provided further, That in the case of forfeiture by a ship,
    said forfeiture may also be recoverable by way of libel in any
    district in which such ship shall arrive or depart. Such
    forfeitures shall be in addition to any other general or specific
    penalties provided in this chapter. It shall be the duty of the
    various United States attorneys, under the direction of the
    Attorney General of the United States, to prosecute for the
    recovery of forfeitures under this chapter. The costs and expenses
    of such prosecutions shall be paid from the appropriation for the
    expenses of the courts of the United States.
    (b) Remission and mitigation
      The forfeitures imposed by subchapter II of this chapter, parts
    II and III of subchapter III of this chapter, and sections 503(b)
    and 507 of this title shall be subject to remission or mitigation
    by the Commission under such regulations and methods of
    ascertaining the facts as may seem to it advisable, and, if suit
    has been instituted, the Attorney General, upon request of the
    Commission, shall direct the discontinuance of any prosecution to
    recover such forfeitures: Provided, however, That no forfeiture
    shall be remitted or mitigated after determination by a court of
    competent jurisdiction.
    (c) Use of notice of apparent liability
      In any case where the Commission issues a notice of apparent
    liability looking toward the imposition of a forfeiture under this
    chapter, that fact shall not be used, in any other proceeding
    before the Commission, to the prejudice of the person to whom such
    notice was issued, unless (i) the forfeiture has been paid, or (ii)
    a court of competent jurisdiction has ordered payment of such
    forfeiture, and such order has become final.

    Sec. 521. Purposes

-STATUTE-
      The purposes of this subchapter are to - 
        (1) establish a national policy concerning cable
      communications;
        (2) establish franchise procedures and standards which
      encourage the growth and development of cable systems and which
      assure that cable systems are responsive to the needs and
      interests of the local community;
        (3) establish guidelines for the exercise of Federal, State,
      and local authority with respect to the regulation of cable
      systems;
        (4) assure that cable communications provide and are encouraged
      to provide the widest possible diversity of information sources
      and services to the public;
        (5) establish an orderly process for franchise renewal which
      protects cable operators against unfair denials of renewal where
      the operator's past performance and proposal for future
      performance meet the standards established by this subchapter;
      and
        (6) promote competition in cable communications and minimize
      unnecessary regulation that would impose an undue economic burden
      on cable systems.

           CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND POLICY FOR PUB. L. 102-385       
      Pub. L. 102-385, Sec. 2(a), (b), Oct. 5, 1992, 106 Stat. 1460,
    1463, provided that:
      "(a) Findings. - The Congress finds and declares the following:
        "(1) Pursuant to the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984
      [Pub. L. 98-549, enacting this subchapter and section 611 of this
      title, amending sections 152, 224, 309, and 605 of this title,
      section 2511 of Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure, and
      section 1805 of Title 50, War and National Defense, and enacting
      provisions set out as notes under this section and sections 543,
      605, and 609 of this title], rates for cable television services
      have been deregulated in approximately 97 percent of all
      franchises since December 29, 1986. Since rate deregulation,
      monthly rates for the lowest priced basic cable service have
      increased by 40 percent or more for 28 percent of cable
      television subscribers. Although the average number of basic
      channels has increased from about 24 to 30, average monthly rates
      have increased by 29 percent during the same period. The average
      monthly cable rate has increased almost 3 times as much as the
      Consumer Price Index since rate deregulation.
        "(2) For a variety of reasons, including local franchising
      requirements and the extraordinary expense of constructing more
      than one cable television system to serve a particular geographic
      area, most cable television subscribers have no opportunity to
      select between competing cable systems. Without the presence of
      another multichannel video programming distributor, a cable
      system faces no local competition. The result is undue market
      power for the cable operator as compared to that of consumers and
      video programmers.
        "(3) There has been a substantial increase in the penetration
      of cable television systems over the past decade. Nearly
      56,000,000 households, over 60 percent of the households with
      televisions, subscribe to cable television, and this percentage
      is almost certain to increase. As a result of this growth, the
      cable television industry has become a dominant nationwide video
      medium.
        "(4) The cable industry has become highly concentrated. The
      potential effects of such concentration are barriers to entry for
      new programmers and a reduction in the number of media voices
      available to consumers.
        "(5) The cable industry has become vertically integrated; cable
      operators and cable programmers often have common ownership. As a
      result, cable operators have the incentive and ability to favor
      their affiliated programmers. This could make it more difficult
      for noncable-affiliated programmers to secure carriage on cable
      systems. Vertically integrated program suppliers also have the
      incentive and ability to favor their affiliated cable operators
      over nonaffiliated cable operators and programming distributors
      using other technologies.
        "(6) There is a substantial governmental and First Amendment
      interest in promoting a diversity of views provided through
      multiple technology media.
        "(7) There is a substantial governmental and First Amendment
      interest in ensuring that cable subscribers have access to local
      noncommercial educational stations which Congress has authorized,
      as expressed in section 396(a)(5) of the Communications Act of
      1934 [47 U.S.C. 396(a)(5)]. The distribution of unique
      noncommercial, educational programming services advances that
      interest.
        "(8) The Federal Government has a substantial interest in
      making all nonduplicative local public television services
      available on cable systems because - 
          "(A) public television provides educational and informational
        programming to the Nation's citizens, thereby advancing the
        Government's compelling interest in educating its citizens;
          "(B) public television is a local community institution,
        supported through local tax dollars and voluntary citizen
        contributions in excess of $10,800,000,000 since 1972, that
        provides public service programming that is responsive to the
        needs and interests of the local community;
          "(C) the Federal Government, in recognition of public
        television's integral role in serving the educational and
        informational needs of local communities, has invested more
        than $3,000,000,000 in public broadcasting since 1969; and
          "(D) absent carriage requirements there is a substantial
        likelihood that citizens, who have supported local public
        television services, will be deprived of those services.
        "(9) The Federal Government has a substantial interest in
      having cable systems carry the signals of local commercial
      television stations because the carriage of such signals is
      necessary to serve the goals contained in section 307(b) of the
      Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 307(b)] of providing a
      fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of broadcast
      services.
        "(10) A primary objective and benefit of our Nation's system of
      regulation of television broadcasting is the local origination of
      programming. There is a substantial governmental interest in
      ensuring its continuation.
        "(11) Broadcast television stations continue to be an important
      source of local news and public affairs programming and other
      local broadcast services critical to an informed electorate.
        "(12) Broadcast television programming is supported by revenues
      generated from advertising broadcast over stations. Such
      programming is otherwise free to those who own television sets
      and do not require cable transmission to receive broadcast
      signals. There is a substantial governmental interest in
      promoting the continued availability of such free television
      programming, especially for viewers who are unable to afford
      other means of receiving programming.
        "(13) As a result of the growth of cable television, there has
      been a marked shift in market share from broadcast television to
      cable television services.
        "(14) Cable television systems and broadcast television
      stations increasingly compete for television advertising
      revenues. As the proportion of households subscribing to cable
      television increases, proportionately more advertising revenues
      will be reallocated from broadcast to cable television systems.
        "(15) A cable television system which carries the signal of a
      local television broadcaster is assisting the broadcaster to
      increase its viewership, and thereby attract additional
      advertising revenues that otherwise might be earned by the cable
      system operator. As a result, there is an economic incentive for
      cable systems to terminate the retransmission of the broadcast
      signal, refuse to carry new signals, or reposition a broadcast
      signal to a disadvantageous channel position. There is a
      substantial likelihood that absent the reimposition of such a
      requirement, additional local broadcast signals will be deleted,
      repositioned, or not carried.
        "(16) As a result of the economic incentive that cable systems
      have to delete, reposition, or not carry local broadcast signals,
      coupled with the absence of a requirement that such systems carry
      local broadcast signals, the economic viability of free local
      broadcast television and its ability to originate quality local
      programming will be seriously jeopardized.
        "(17) Consumers who subscribe to cable television often do so
      to obtain local broadcast signals which they otherwise would not
      be able to receive, or to obtain improved signals. Most
      subscribers to cable television systems do not or cannot maintain
      antennas to receive broadcast television services, do not have
      input selector switches to convert from a cable to antenna
      reception system, or cannot otherwise receive broadcast
      television services. The regulatory system created by the Cable
      Communications Policy Act of 1984 was premised upon the continued
      existence of mandatory carriage obligations for cable systems,
      ensuring that local stations would be protected from
      anticompetitive conduct by cable systems.
        "(18) Cable television systems often are the single most
      efficient distribution system for television programming. A
      Government mandate for a substantial societal investment in
      alternative distribution systems for cable subscribers, such as
      the 'A/B' input selector antenna system, is not an enduring or
      feasible method of distribution and is not in the public
      interest.
        "(19) At the same time, broadcast programming that is carried
      remains the most popular programming on cable systems, and a
      substantial portion of the benefits for which consumers pay cable
      systems is derived from carriage of the signals of network
      affiliates, independent television stations, and public
      television stations. Also cable programming placed on channels
      adjacent to popular off-the-air signals obtains a larger audience
      than on other channel positions. Cable systems, therefore, obtain
      great benefits from local broadcast signals which, until now,
      they have been able to obtain without the consent of the
      broadcaster or any copyright liability. This has resulted in an
      effective subsidy of the development of cable systems by local
      broadcasters. While at one time, when cable systems did not
      attempt to compete with local broadcasters for programming,
      audience, and advertising, this subsidy may have been
      appropriate, it is so no longer and results in a competitive
      imbalance between the 2 industries.
        "(20) The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, in its
      amendments to the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 151 et
      seq.], limited the regulatory authority of franchising
      authorities over cable operators. Franchising authorities are
      finding it difficult under the current regulatory scheme to deny
      renewals to cable systems that are not adequately serving cable
      subscribers.
        "(21) Cable systems should be encouraged to carry low-power
      television stations licensed to the communities served by those
      systems where the low-power station creates and broadcasts, as a
      substantial part of its programming day, local programming.
      "(b) Statement of Policy. - It is the policy of the Congress in
    this Act [enacting sections 334, 335, 534 to 537, 544a, 548, and
    555a of this title, amending sections 325, 332, 522, 532, 533, 541
    to 544, 546, 551 to 555, and 558 of this title, and enacting
    provisions set out as notes under this section and sections 325,
    531, 543, and 554 of this title] to - 
        "(1) promote the availability to the public of a diversity of
      views and information through cable television and other video
      distribution media;
        "(2) rely on the marketplace, to the maximum extent feasible,
      to achieve that availability;
        "(3) ensure that cable operators continue to expand, where
      economically justified, their capacity and the programs offered
      over their cable systems;
        "(4) where cable television systems are not subject to
      effective competition, ensure that consumer interests are
      protected in receipt of cable service; and
        "(5) ensure that cable television operators do not have undue
      market power vis-a-vis video programmers and consumers."

      Pub. L. 102-385, Sec. 26, Oct. 5, 1992, 106 Stat. 1502, directed
    Federal Communications Commission to investigate and analyze, on a
    sport-by-sport basis, trends in migration of local, regional, and
    national sports programming from carriage by broadcast stations to

    section.
    (d) Promulgation of rules and procedures
      In the case of any franchise under which channel capacity is
    designated under subsection (b) of this section, the franchising
    authority shall prescribe - 
        (1) rules and procedures under which the cable operator is
      permitted to use such channel capacity for the provision of other
      services if such channel capacity is not being used for the
      purposes designated, and
        (2) rules and procedures under which such permitted use shall
      cease.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 532. Cable channels for commercial use

-STATUTE-
    (a) Purpose
      The purpose of this section is to promote competition in the
    delivery of diverse sources of video programming and to assure that
    the widest possible diversity of information sources are made
    available to the public from cable systems in a manner consistent
    with growth and development of cable systems.
    (b) Designation of channel capacity for commercial use
      (1) A cable operator shall designate channel capacity for
    commercial use by persons unaffiliated with the operator in
    accordance with the following requirements:
        (A) An operator of any cable system with 36 or more (but not
      more than 54) activated channels shall designate 10 percent of
      such channels which are not otherwise required for use (or the
      use of which is not prohibited) by Federal law or regulation.
        (B) An operator of any cable system with 55 or more (but not
      more than 100) activated channels shall designate 15 percent of
      such channels which are not otherwise required for use (or the
      use of which is not prohibited) by Federal law or regulation.
        (C) An operator of any cable system with more than 100
      activated channels shall designate 15 percent of all such
      channels.
        (D) An operator of any cable system with fewer than 36
      activated channels shall not be required to designate channel
      capacity for commercial use by persons unaffiliated with the
      operator, unless the cable system is required to provide such
      channel capacity under the terms of a franchise in effect on
      October 30, 1984.
        (E) An operator of any cable system in operation on October 30,
      1984, shall not be required to remove any service actually being
      provided on July 1, 1984, in order to comply with this section,
      but shall make channel capacity available for commercial use as
      such capacity becomes available until such time as the cable
      operator is in full compliance with this section.

      (2) Any Federal agency, State, or franchising authority may not
    require any cable system to designate channel capacity for
    commercial use by unaffiliated persons in excess of the capacity
    specified in paragraph (1), except as otherwise provided in this
    section.
      (3) A cable operator may not be required, as part of a request
    for proposals or as part of a proposal for renewal, subject to
    section 546 of this title, to designate channel capacity for any
    use (other than commercial use by unaffiliated persons under this
    section) except as provided in sections 531 and 557 of this title,
    but a cable operator may offer in a franchise, or proposal for
    renewal thereof, to provide, consistent with applicable law, such
    capacity for other than commercial use by such persons.
      (4) A cable operator may use any unused channel capacity
    designated pursuant to this section until the use of such channel
    capacity is obtained, pursuant to a written agreement, by a person
    unaffiliated with the operator.
      (5) For the purposes of this section, the term "commercial use"
    means the provision of video programming, whether or not for
    profit.
      (6) Any channel capacity which has been designated for public,
    educational, or governmental use may not be considered as
    designated under this section for commercial use for purpose of
    this section.
    (c) Use of channel capacity by unaffiliated persons; editorial
      control; restriction on service; rules on rates, terms, and
      conditions
      (1) If a person unaffiliated with the cable operator seeks to use
    channel capacity designated pursuant to subsection (b) of this
    section for commercial use, the cable operator shall establish,
    consistent with the purpose of this section and with rules
    prescribed by the Commission under paragraph (4), the price, terms,
    and conditions of such use which are at least sufficient to assure
    that such use will not adversely affect the operation, financial
    condition, or market development of the cable system.
      (2) A cable operator shall not exercise any editorial control
    over any video programming provided pursuant to this section, or in
    any other way consider the content of such programming, except that
    a cable operator may refuse to transmit any leased access program
    or portion of a leased access program which contains obscenity,
    indecency, or nudity and may consider such content to the minimum
    extent necessary to establish a reasonable price for the commercial
    use of designated channel capacity by an unaffiliated person.
      (3) Any cable system channel designated in accordance with this
    section shall not be used to provide a cable service that is being
    provided over such system on October 30, 1984, if the provision of
    such programming is intended to avoid the purpose of this section.
      (4)(A) The Commission shall have the authority to - 
        (i) determine the maximum reasonable rates that a cable
      operator may establish pursuant to paragraph (1) for commercial
      use of designated channel capacity, including the rate charged
      for the billing of rates to subscribers and for the collection of
      revenue from subscribers by the cable operator for such use;
        (ii) establish reasonable terms and conditions for such use,
      including those for billing and collection; and
        (iii) establish procedures for the expedited resolution of
      disputes concerning rates or carriage under this section.

      (B) Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall
    establish rules for determining maximum reasonable rates under
    subparagraph (A)(i), for establishing terms and conditions under
    subparagraph (A)(ii), and for providing procedures under
    subparagraph (A)(iii).
    (d) Right of action in district court; relief; factors not to be
      considered by court
      Any person aggrieved by the failure or refusal of a cable
    operator to make channel capacity available for use pursuant to
    this section may bring an action in the district court of the
    United States for the judicial district in which the cable system
    is located to compel that such capacity be made available. If the
    court finds that the channel capacity sought by such person has not
    been made available in accordance with this section, or finds that
    the price, terms, or conditions established by the cable operator
    are unreasonable, the court may order such system to make available
    to such person the channel capacity sought, and further determine
    the appropriate price, terms, or conditions for such use consistent
    with subsection (c) of this section, and may award actual damages
    if it deems such relief appropriate. In any such action, the court
    shall not consider any price, term, or condition established
    between an operator and an affiliate for comparable services.
    (e) Petition to Commission; relief
      (1) Any person aggrieved by the failure or refusal of a cable
    operator to make channel capacity available pursuant to this
    section may petition the Commission for relief under this
    subsection upon a showing of prior adjudicated violations of this
    section. Records of previous adjudications resulting in a court
    determination that the operator has violated this section shall be
    considered as sufficient for the showing necessary under this
    subsection. If the Commission finds that the channel capacity
    sought by such person has not been made available in accordance
    with this section, or that the price, terms, or conditions
    established by such system are unreasonable under subsection (c) of
    this section, the Commission shall, by rule or order, require such
    operator to make available such channel capacity under price,
    terms, and conditions consistent with subsection (c) of this
    section.
      (2) In any case in which the Commission finds that the prior
    adjudicated violations of this section constitute a pattern or
    practice of violations by an operator, the Commission may also
    establish any further rule or order necessary to assure that the
    operator provides the diversity of information sources required by
    this section.
      (3) In any case in which the Commission finds that the prior
    adjudicated violations of this section constitute a pattern or
    practice of violations by any person who is an operator of more
    than one cable system, the Commission may also establish any
    further rule or order necessary to assure that such person provides
    the diversity of information sources required by this section.
    (f) Presumption of reasonableness and good faith
      In any action brought under this section in any Federal district
    court or before the Commission, there shall be a presumption that
    the price, terms, and conditions for use of channel capacity
    designated pursuant to subsection (b) of this section are
    reasonable and in good faith unless shown by clear and convincing
    evidence to the contrary.
    (g) Promulgation of rules
      Notwithstanding sections 541(c) and 543(a) of this title, at such
    time as cable systems with 36 or more activated channels are
    available to 70 percent of households within the United States and
    are subscribed to by 70 percent of the households to which such
    systems are available, the Commission may promulgate any additional
    rules necessary to provide diversity of information sources. Any
    rules promulgated by the Commission pursuant to this subsection
    shall not preempt authority expressly granted to franchising
    authorities under this subchapter.
    (h) Cable service unprotected by Constitution
      Any cable service offered pursuant to this section shall not be
    provided, or shall be provided subject to conditions, if such cable
    service in the judgment of the franchising authority or the cable
    operator is obscene, or is in conflict with community standards in
    that it is lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent or is otherwise
    unprotected by the Constitution of the United States. This
    subsection shall permit a cable operator to enforce prospectively a
    written and published policy of prohibiting programming that the
    cable operator reasonably believes describes or depicts sexual or
    excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as
    measured by contemporary community standards.
    (i) Programming from qualified minority or educational programming
      sources
      (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of
    this section, a cable operator required by this section to
    designate channel capacity for commercial use may use any such
    channel capacity for the provision of programming from a qualified
    minority programming source or from any qualified educational
    programming source, whether or not such source is affiliated with
    the cable operator. The channel capacity used to provide
    programming from a qualified minority programming source or from
    any qualified educational programming source pursuant to this
    subsection may not exceed 33 percent of the channel capacity
    designated pursuant to this section. No programming provided over a
    cable system on July 1, 1990, may qualify as minority programming
    or educational programming on that cable system under this
    subsection.
      (2) For purposes of this subsection, the term "qualified minority
    programming source" means a programming source which devotes
    substantially all of its programming to coverage of minority
    viewpoints, or to programming directed at members of minority
    groups, and which is over 50 percent minority-owned, as the term
    "minority" is defined in section 309(i)(3)(C)(ii) of this title.
      (3) For purposes of this subsection, the term "qualified
    educational programming source" means a programming source which
    devotes substantially all of its programming to educational or
    instructional programming that promotes public understanding of
    mathematics, the sciences, the humanities, and the arts and has a
    documented annual expenditure on programming exceeding $15,000,000.
    The annual expenditure on programming means all annual costs
    incurred by the programming source to produce or acquire programs
    which are scheduled to be televised, and specifically excludes
    marketing, promotion, satellite transmission and operational costs,
    and general administrative costs.
      (4) Nothing in this subsection shall substitute for the
    requirements to carry qualified noncommercial educational
    television stations as specified under section 535 of this title.
    (j) Single channel access to indecent programming
      (1) Within 120 days following October 5, 1992, the Commission
    shall promulgate regulations designed to limit the access of
    children to indecent programming, as defined by Commission
    regulations, and which cable operators have not voluntarily
    prohibited under subsection (h) of this section by - 
        (A) requiring cable operators to place on a single channel all
      indecent programs, as identified by program providers, intended
      for carriage on channels designated for commercial use under this
      section;
        (B) requiring cable operators to block such single channel
      unless the subscriber requests access to such channel in writing;
      and
        (C) requiring programmers to inform cable operators if the
      program would be indecent as defined by Commission regulations.

      (2) Cable operators shall comply with the regulations promulgated
    pursuant to paragraph (1).

    SUBCHAPTER V-A - CABLE COMMUNICATIONS
    Part II - Use of Cable Channels and Cable Ownership Restrictions

-HEAD-
    Sec. 533. Ownership restrictions

-STATUTE-
    (a) Cable operator holding license for multichannel distribution or
      offering satellite service
      It shall be unlawful for a cable operator to hold a license for
    multichannel multipoint distribution service, or to offer satellite
    master antenna television service separate and apart from any
    franchised cable service, in any portion of the franchise area
    served by that cable operator's cable system. The Commission - 
        (1) shall waive the requirements of this paragraph for all
      existing multichannel multipoint distribution services and
      satellite master antenna television services which are owned by a
      cable operator on October 5, 1992;
        (2) may waive the requirements of this paragraph to the extent
      the Commission determines is necessary to ensure that all
      significant portions of a franchise area are able to obtain video
      programming; and
        (3) shall not apply the requirements of this subsection to any
      cable operator in any franchise area in which a cable operator is
      subject to effective competition as determined under section
      543(l) of this title.
    (b) Repealed. Pub. L. 104-104, title III, Sec. 302(b)(1), Feb. 8,
      1996, 110 Stat. 124
    (c) Promulgation of rules
      The Commission may prescribe rules with respect to the ownership
    or control of cable systems by persons who own or control other
    media of mass communications which serve the same community served
    by a cable system.
    (d) Regulation of ownership by States or franchising authorities
      Any State or franchising authority may not prohibit the ownership
    or control of a cable system by any person because of such person's
    ownership or control of any other media of mass communications or
    other media interests. Nothing in this section shall be construed
    to prevent any State or franchising authority from prohibiting the
    ownership or control of a cable system in a jurisdiction by any
    person (1) because of such person's ownership or control of any
    other cable system in such jurisdiction; or (2) in circumstances in
    which the State or franchising authority determines that the
    acquisition of such a cable system may eliminate or reduce
    competition in the delivery of cable service in such jurisdiction.
    (e) Holding of ownership interests or exercise of editorial control
      by States or franchising authorities
      (1) Subject to paragraph (2), a State or franchising authority
    may hold any ownership interest in any cable system.
      (2) Any State or franchising authority shall not exercise any
    editorial control regarding the content of any cable service on a
    cable system in which such governmental entity holds ownership
    interest (other than programming on any channel designated for
    educational or governmental use), unless such control is exercised
    through an entity separate from the franchising authority.
    (f) Enhancement of effective competition
      (1) In order to enhance effective competition, the Commission
    shall, within one year after October 5, 1992, conduct a proceeding -
     
        (A) to prescribe rules and regulations establishing reasonable
      limits on the number of cable subscribers a person is authorized
      to reach through cable systems owned by such person, or in which
      such person has an attributable interest;
        (B) to prescribe rules and regulations establishing reasonable
      limits on the number of channels on a cable system that can be
      occupied by a video programmer in which a cable operator has an
      attributable interest; and
        (C) to consider the necessity and appropriateness of imposing
      limitations on the degree to which multichannel video programming
      distributors may engage in the creation or production of video
      programming.

      (2) In prescribing rules and regulations under paragraph (1), the
    Commission shall, among other public interest objectives - 
        (A) ensure that no cable operator or group of cable operators
      can unfairly impede, either because of the size of any individual
      operator or because of joint actions by a group of operators of
      sufficient size, the flow of video programming from the video
      programmer to the consumer;
        (B) ensure that cable operators affiliated with video
      programmers do not favor such programmers in determining carriage
      on their cable systems or do not unreasonably restrict the flow
      of the video programming of such programmers to other video
      distributors;
        (C) take particular account of the market structure, ownership
      patterns, and other relationships of the cable television
      industry, including the nature and market power of the local
      franchise, the joint ownership of cable systems and video
      programmers, and the various types of non-equity controlling
      interests;
        (D) account for any efficiencies and other benefits that might
      be gained through increased ownership or control;
        (E) make such rules and regulations reflect the dynamic nature
      of the communications marketplace;
        (F) not impose limitations which would bar cable operators from
      serving previously unserved rural areas; and
        (G) not impose limitations which would impair the development
      of diverse and high quality video programming.
    (g) Combination of interests under prior law
      This section shall not apply to prohibit any combination of any
    interests held by any person on July 1, 1984, to the extent of the
    interests so held as of such date, if the holding of such interests
    was not inconsistent with any applicable Federal or State law or
    regulations in effect on that date.
    (h) "Media of mass communications" defined
      For purposes of this section, the term "media of mass
    communications" shall have the meaning given such term under
    section 309(i)(3)(C)(i) of this title.

    Part II - Use of Cable Channels and Cable Ownership Restrictions

-HEAD-
    Sec. 534. Carriage of local commercial television signals

-STATUTE-
    (a) Carriage obligations
      Each cable operator shall carry, on the cable system of that
    operator, the signals of local commercial television stations and
    qualified low power stations as provided by this section. Carriage
    of additional broadcast television signals on such system shall be
    at the discretion of such operator, subject to section 325(b) of
    this title.
    (b) Signals required
      (1) In general
        (A) A cable operator of a cable system with 12 or fewer usable
      activated channels shall carry the signals of at least three
      local commercial television stations, except that if such a
      system has 300 or fewer subscribers, it shall not be subject to
      any requirements under this section so long as such system does
      not delete from carriage by that system any signal of a broadcast
      television station.
        (B) A cable operator of a cable system with more than 12 usable
      activated channels shall carry the signals of local commercial
      television stations, up to one-third of the aggregate number of
      usable activated channels of such system.
      (2) Selection of signals
        Whenever the number of local commercial television stations
      exceeds the maximum number of signals a cable system is required
      to carry under paragraph (1), the cable operator shall have
      discretion in selecting which such stations shall be carried on
      its cable system, except that - 
          (A) under no circumstances shall a cable operator carry a
        qualified low power station in lieu of a local commercial
        television station; and
          (B) if the cable operator elects to carry an affiliate of a
        broadcast network (as such term is defined by the Commission by
        regulation), such cable operator shall carry the affiliate of
        such broadcast network whose city of license reference point,
        as defined in section 76.53 of title 47, Code of Federal
        Regulations (in effect on January 1, 1991), or any successor
        regulation thereto, is closest to the principal headend of the
        cable system.
      (3) Content to be carried
        (A) A cable operator shall carry in its entirety, on the cable
      system of that operator, the primary video, accompanying audio,
      and line 21 closed caption transmission of each of the local
      commercial television stations carried on the cable system and,
      to the extent technically feasible, program-related material
      carried in the vertical blanking interval or on subcarriers.
      Retransmission of other material in the vertical blanking
      internal or other nonprogram-related material (including teletext
      and other subscription and advertiser-supported information
      services) shall be at the discretion of the cable operator. Where
      appropriate and feasible, operators may delete signal
      enhancements, such as ghost-canceling, from the broadcast signal
      and employ such enhancements at the system headend or headends.
        (B) The cable operator shall carry the entirety of the program
      schedule of any television station carried on the cable system
      unless carriage of specific programming is prohibited, and other
      programming authorized to be substituted, under section 76.67 or
      subpart F of part 76 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations (as
      in effect on January 1, 1991), or any successor regulations
      thereto.
      (4) Signal quality
        (A) Nondegradation; technical specifications
          The signals of local commercial television stations that a
        cable operator carries shall be carried without material
        degradation. The Commission shall adopt carriage standards to
        ensure that, to the extent technically feasible, the quality of
        signal processing and carriage provided by a cable system for
        the carriage of local commercial television stations will be no
        less than that provided by the system for carriage of any other
        type of signal.
        (B) Advanced television
          At such time as the Commission prescribes modifications of
        the standards for television broadcast signals, the Commission
        shall initiate a proceeding to establish any changes in the
        signal carriage requirements of cable television systems
        necessary to ensure cable carriage of such broadcast signals of
        local commercial television stations which have been changed to
        conform with such modified standards.
      (5) Duplication not required
        Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a cable operator shall not be
      required to carry the signal of any local commercial television
      station that substantially duplicates the signal of another local
      commercial television station which is carried on its cable
      system, or to carry the signals of more than one local commercial
      television station affiliated with a particular broadcast network
      (as such term is defined by regulation). If a cable operator
      elects to carry on its cable system a signal which substantially
      duplicates the signal of another local commercial television
      station carried on the cable system, or to carry on its system
      the signals of more than one local commercial television station
      affiliated with a particular broadcast network, all such signals
      shall be counted toward the number of signals the operator is
      required to carry under paragraph (1).
      (6) Channel positioning
        Each signal carried in fulfillment of the carriage obligations
      of a cable operator under this section shall be carried on the
      cable system channel number on which the local commercial
      television station is broadcast over the air, or on the channel
      on which it was carried on July 19, 1985, or on the channel on
      which it was carried on January 1, 1992, at the election of the
      station, or on such other channel number as is mutually agreed
      upon by the station and the cable operator. Any dispute regarding
      the positioning of a local commercial television station shall be
      resolved by the Commission.
      (7) Signal availability
        Signals carried in fulfillment of the requirements of this
      section shall be provided to every subscriber of a cable system.
      Such signals shall be viewable via cable on all television
      receivers of a subscriber which are connected to a cable system
      by a cable operator or for which a cable operator provides a
      connection. If a cable operator authorizes subscribers to install
      additional receiver connections, but does not provide the
      subscriber with such connections, or with the equipment and
      materials for such connections, the operator shall notify such
      subscribers of all broadcast stations carried on the cable system
      which cannot be viewed via cable without a converter box and
      shall offer to sell or lease such a converter box to such
      subscribers at rates in accordance with section 543(b)(3) of this
      title.
      (8) Identification of signals carried
        A cable operator shall identify, upon request by any person,
      the signals carried on its system in fulfillment of the
      requirements of this section.
      (9) Notification
        A cable operator shall provide written notice to a local
      commercial television station at least 30 days prior to either
      deleting from carriage or repositioning that station. No deletion
      or repositioning of a local commercial television station shall
      occur during a period in which major television ratings services
      measure the size of audiences of local television stations. The
      notification provisions of this paragraph shall not be used to
      undermine or evade the channel positioning or carriage
      requirements imposed upon cable operators under this section.
      (10) Compensation for carriage
        A cable operator shall not accept or request monetary payment
      or other valuable consideration in exchange either for carriage
      of local commercial television stations in fulfillment of the
      requirements of this section or for the channel positioning
      rights provided to such stations under this section, except that -
       
          (A) any such station may be required to bear the costs
        associated with delivering a good quality signal or a baseband
        video signal to the principal headend of the cable system;
          (B) a cable operator may accept payments from stations which
        would be considered distant signals under section 111 of title
        17 as indemnification for any increased copyright liability
        resulting from carriage of such signal; and
          (C) a cable operator may continue to accept monetary payment
        or other valuable consideration in exchange for carriage or
        channel positioning of the signal of any local commercial
        television station carried in fulfillment of the requirements
        of this section, through, but not beyond, the date of
        expiration of an agreement thereon between a cable operator and
        a local commercial television station entered into prior to
        June 26, 1990.
    (c) Low power station carriage obligation
      (1) Requirement
        If there are not sufficient signals of full power local
      commercial television stations to fill the channels set aside
      under subsection (b) of this section - 
          (A) a cable operator of a cable system with a capacity of 35
        or fewer usable activated channels shall be required to carry
        one qualified low power station; and
          (B) a cable operator of a cable system with a capacity of
        more than 35 usable activated channels shall be required to
        carry two qualified low power stations.
      (2) Use of public, educational, or governmental channels
        A cable operator required to carry more than one signal of a
      qualified low power station under this subsection may do so,
      subject to approval by the franchising authority pursuant to
      section 531 of this title, by placing such additional station on
      public, educational, or governmental channels not in use for
      their designated purposes.
    (d) Remedies
      (1) Complaints by broadcast stations
        Whenever a local commercial television station believes that a
      cable operator has failed to meet its obligations under this
      section, such station shall notify the operator, in writing, of
      the alleged failure and identify its reasons for believing that
      the cable operator is obligated to carry the signal of such
      station or has otherwise failed to comply with the channel
      positioning or repositioning or other requirements of this
      section. The cable operator shall, within 30 days of such written
      notification, respond in writing to such notification and either
      commence to carry the signal of such station in accordance with
      the terms requested or state its reasons for believing that it is
      not obligated to carry such signal or is in compliance with the
      channel positioning and repositioning and other requirements of
      this section. A local commercial television station that is
      denied carriage or channel positioning or repositioning in
      accordance with this section by a cable operator may obtain
      review of such denial by filing a complaint with the Commission.
      Such complaint shall allege the manner in which such cable
      operator has failed to meet its obligations and the basis for
      such allegations.
      (2) Opportunity to respond
        The Commission shall afford such cable operator an opportunity
      to present data and arguments to establish that there has been no
      failure to meet its obligations under this section.
      (3) Remedial actions; dismissal
        Within 120 days after the date a complaint is filed, the
      Commission shall determine whether the cable operator has met its
      obligations under this section. If the Commission determines that
      the cable operator has failed to meet such obligations, the
      Commission shall order the cable operator to reposition the
      complaining station or, in the case of an obligation to carry a
      station, to commence carriage of the station and to continue such
      carriage for at least 12 months. If the Commission determines
      that the cable operator has fully met the requirements of this
      section, it shall dismiss the complaint.
    (e) Input selector switch rules abolished
      No cable operator shall be required - 
        (1) to provide or make available any input selector switch as
      defined in section 76.5(mm) of title 47, Code of Federal
      Regulations, or any comparable device; or
        (2) to provide information to subscribers about input selector
      switches or comparable devices.
    (f) Regulations by Commission
      Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall,
    following a rulemaking proceeding, issue regulations implementing
    the requirements imposed by this section. Such implementing
    regulations shall include necessary revisions to update section
    76.51 of title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
    (g) Sales presentations and program length commercials
      (1) Carriage pending proceeding
        Pending the outcome of the proceeding under paragraph (2),
      nothing in this chapter shall require a cable operator to carry
      on any tier, or prohibit a cable operator from carrying on any
      tier, the signal of any commercial television station or video
      programming service that is predominantly utilized for the
      transmission of sales presentations or program length
      commercials.
      (2) Proceeding concerning certain stations
        Within 270 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission,
      notwithstanding prior proceedings to determine whether broadcast
      television stations that are predominantly utilized for the
      transmission of sales presentations or program length commercials
      are serving the public interest, convenience, and necessity,
      shall complete a proceeding in accordance with this paragraph to
      determine whether broadcast television stations that are
      predominantly utilized for the transmission of sales
      presentations or program length commercials are serving the
      public interest, convenience, and necessity. In conducting such
      proceeding, the Commission shall provide appropriate notice and
      opportunity for public comment. The Commission shall consider the
      viewing of such stations, the level of competing demands for the
      spectrum allocated to such stations, and the role of such
      stations in providing competition to nonbroadcast services
      offering similar programming. In the event that the Commission
      concludes that one or more of such stations are serving the
      public interest, convenience, and necessity, the Commission shall
      qualify such stations as local commercial television stations for
      purposes of subsection (a) of this section. In the event that the
      Commission concludes that one or more of such stations are not
      serving the public interest, convenience, and necessity, the
      Commission shall allow the licensees of such stations a
      reasonable period within which to provide different programming,
      and shall not deny such stations a renewal expectancy solely
      because their programming consisted predominantly of sales
      presentations or program length commercials.
    (h) Definitions
      (1) Local commercial television station
        (A) In general
          For purposes of this section, the term "local commercial
        television station" means any full power television broadcast
        station, other than a qualified noncommercial educational
        television station within the meaning of section 535(l)(1) of
        this title, licensed and operating on a channel regularly
        assigned to its community by the Commission that, with respect
        to a particular cable system, is within the same television
        market as the cable system.
        (B) Exclusions
          The term "local commercial television station" shall not
        include - 
            (i) low power television stations, television translator
          stations, and passive repeaters which operate pursuant to
          part 74 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or any
          successor regulations thereto;
            (ii) a television broadcast station that would be
          considered a distant signal under section 111 of title 17, if
          such station does not agree to indemnify the cable operator
          for any increased copyright liability resulting from carriage
          on the cable system; or
            (iii) a television broadcast station that does not deliver
          to the principal headend of a cable system either a signal
          level of -45dBm for UHF signals or -49dBm for VHF
          signals at the input terminals of the signal processing
          equipment, if such station does not agree to be responsible
          for the costs of delivering to the cable system a signal of
          good quality or a baseband video signal.
        (C) Market determinations
          (i) For purposes of this section, a broadcasting station's
        market shall be determined by the Commission by regulation or
        order using, where available, commercial publications which
        delineate television markets based on viewing patterns, except
        that, following a written request, the Commission may, with
        respect to a particular television broadcast station, include
        additional communities within its television market or exclude
        communities from such station's television market to better
        effectuate the purposes of this section. In considering such
        requests, the Commission may determine that particular
        communities are part of more than one television market.
          (ii) In considering requests filed pursuant to clause (i),
        the Commission shall afford particular attention to the value
        of localism by taking into account such factors as - 
            (I) whether the station, or other stations located in the
          same area, have been historically carried on the cable system
          or systems within such community;
            (II) whether the television station provides coverage or
          other local service to such community;
            (III) whether any other television station that is eligible
          to be carried by a cable system in such community in
          fulfillment of the requirements of this section provides news
          coverage of issues of concern to such community or provides
          carriage or coverage of sporting and other events of interest
          to the community; and
            (IV) evidence of viewing patterns in cable and noncable
          households within the areas served by the cable system or
          systems in such community.

          (iii) A cable operator shall not delete from carriage the
        signal of a commercial television station during the pendency
        of any proceeding pursuant to this subparagraph.
          (iv) Within 120 days after the date on which a request is
        filed under this subparagraph (or 120 days after February 8,
        1996, if later), the Commission shall grant or deny the
        request.
      (2) Qualified low power station
        The term "qualified low power station" means any television
      broadcast station conforming to the rules established for Low
      Power Television Stations contained in part 74 of title 47, Code
      of Federal Regulations, only if - 
          (A) such station broadcasts for at least the minimum number
        of hours of operation required by the Commission for television
        broadcast stations under part 73 of title 47, Code of Federal
        Regulations;
          (B) such station meets all obligations and requirements
        applicable to television broadcast stations under part 73 of
        title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, with respect to the
        broadcast of nonentertainment programming; programming and
        rates involving political candidates, election issues,
        controversial issues of public importance, editorials, and
        personal attacks; programming for children; and equal
        employment opportunity; and the Commission determines that the
        provision of such programming by such station would address
        local news and informational needs which are not being
        adequately served by full power television broadcast stations
        because of the geographic distance of such full power stations
        from the low power station's community of license;
          (C) such station complies with interference regulations
        consistent with its secondary status pursuant to part 74 of
        title 47, Code of Federal Regulations;
          (D) such station is located no more than 35 miles from the
        cable system's headend, and delivers to the principal headend
        of the cable system an over-the-air signal of good quality, as
        determined by the Commission;
          (E) the community of license of such station and the
        franchise area of the cable system are both located outside of
        the largest 160 Metropolitan Statistical Areas, ranked by
        population, as determined by the Office of Management and
        Budget on June 30, 1990, and the population of such community
        of license on such date did not exceed 35,000; and
          (F) there is no full power television broadcast station
        licensed to any community within the county or other political
        subdivision (of a State) served by the cable system.

      Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to change the
      secondary status of any low power station as provided in part 74
      of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on October
      5, 1992.

      In addition to the carriage requirements set forth in section 534
    of this title, each cable operator of a cable system shall carry
    the signals of qualified noncommercial educational television
    stations in accordance with the provisions of this section.
    (b) Requirements to carry qualified stations
      (1) General requirement to carry each qualified station
        Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3) and subsection (e) of this
      section, each cable operator shall carry, on the cable system of
      that cable operator, any qualified local noncommercial
      educational television station requesting carriage.
      (2) Systems with 12 or fewer channels
        (A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a cable operator of a cable
      system with 12 or fewer usable activated channels shall be
      required to carry the signal of one qualified local noncommercial
      educational television station; except that a cable operator of
      such a system shall comply with subsection (c) of this section
      and may, in its discretion, carry the signals of other qualified
      noncommercial educational television stations.
        (B) In the case of a cable system described in subparagraph (A)
      which operates beyond the presence of any qualified local
      noncommercial educational television station - 
          (i) the cable operator shall import and carry on that system
        the signal of one qualified noncommercial educational
        television station;
          (ii) the selection for carriage of such a signal shall be at
        the election of the cable operator; and
          (iii) in order to satisfy the requirements for carriage
        specified in this subsection, the cable operator of the system
        shall not be required to remove any other programming service
        actually provided to subscribers on March 29, 1990; except that
        such cable operator shall use the first channel available to
        satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph.
      (3) Systems with 13 to 36 channels
        (A) Subject to subsection (c) of this section, a cable operator
      of a cable system with 13 to 36 usable activated channels - 
          (i) shall carry the signal of at least one qualified local
        noncommercial educational television station but shall not be
        required to carry the signals of more than three such stations,
        and
          (ii) may, in its discretion, carry additional such stations.

        (B) In the case of a cable system described in this paragraph
      which operates beyond the presence of any qualified local
      noncommercial educational television station, the cable operator
      shall import and carry on that system the signal of at least one
      qualified noncommercial educational television station to comply
      with subparagraph (A)(i).
        (C) The cable operator of a cable system described in this
      paragraph which carries the signal of a qualified local
      noncommercial educational station affiliated with a State public
      television network shall not be required to carry the signal of
      any additional qualified local noncommercial educational
      television stations affiliated with the same network if the
      programming of such additional stations is substantially
      duplicated by the programming of the qualified local
      noncommercial educational television station receiving carriage.
        (D) A cable operator of a system described in this paragraph
      which increases the usable activated channel capacity of the
      system to more than 36 channels on or after March 29, 1990,
      shall, in accordance with the other provisions of this section,
      carry the signal of each qualified local noncommercial
      educational television station requesting carriage, subject to
      subsection (e) of this section.
    (c) Continued carriage of existing stations
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, all cable
    operators shall continue to provide carriage to all qualified local
    noncommercial educational television stations whose signals were
    carried on their systems as of March 29, 1990. The requirements of
    this subsection may be waived with respect to a particular cable
    operator and a particular such station, upon the written consent of
    the cable operator and the station.
    (d) Placement of additional signals
      A cable operator required to add the signals of qualified local
    noncommercial educational television stations to a cable system
    under this section may do so, subject to approval by the
    franchising authority pursuant to section 531 of this title, by
    placing such additional stations on public, educational, or
    governmental channels not in use for their designated purposes.
    (e) Systems with more than 36 channels
      A cable operator of a cable system with a capacity of more than
    36 usable activated channels which is required to carry the signals
    of three qualified local noncommercial educational television
    stations shall not be required to carry the signals of additional
    such stations the programming of which substantially duplicates the
    programming broadcast by another qualified local noncommercial
    educational television station requesting carriage. Substantial
    duplication shall be defined by the Commission in a manner that
    promotes access to distinctive noncommercial educational television
    services.
    (f) Waiver of nonduplication rights
      A qualified local noncommercial educational television station
    whose signal is carried by a cable operator shall not assert any
    network nonduplication rights it may have pursuant to section 76.92
    of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, to require the deletion
    of programs aired on other qualified local noncommercial
    educational television stations whose signals are carried by that
    cable operator.
    (g) Conditions of carriage
      (1) Content to be carried
        A cable operator shall retransmit in its entirety the primary
      video, accompanying audio, and line 21 closed caption
      transmission of each qualified local noncommercial educational
      television station whose signal is carried on the cable system,
      and, to the extent technically feasible, program-related material
      carried in the vertical blanking interval, or on subcarriers,
      that may be necessary for receipt of programming by handicapped
      persons or for educational or language purposes. Retransmission
      of other material in the vertical blanking interval or on
      subcarriers shall be within the discretion of the cable operator.
      (2) Bandwidth and technical quality
        A cable operator shall provide each qualified local
      noncommercial educational television station whose signal is
      carried in accordance with this section with bandwidth and
      technical capacity equivalent to that provided to commercial
      television broadcast stations carried on the cable system and
      shall carry the signal of each qualified local noncommercial
      educational television station without material degradation.
      (3) Changes in carriage
        The signal of a qualified local noncommercial educational
      television station shall not be repositioned by a cable operator
      unless the cable operator, at least 30 days in advance of such
      repositioning, has provided written notice to the station and all
      subscribers of the cable system. For purposes of this paragraph,
      repositioning includes (A) assignment of a qualified local
      noncommercial educational television station to a cable system
      channel number different from the cable system channel number to
      which the station was assigned as of March 29, 1990, and (B)
      deletion of the station from the cable system. The notification
      provisions of this paragraph shall not be used to undermine or
      evade the channel positioning or carriage requirements imposed
      upon cable operators under this section.
      (4) Good quality signal required
        Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, a cable
      operator shall not be required to carry the signal of any
      qualified local noncommercial educational television station
      which does not deliver to the cable system's principal headend a
      signal of good quality or a baseband video signal, as may be
      defined by the Commission.
      (5) Channel positioning
        Each signal carried in fulfillment of the carriage obligations
      of a cable operator under this section shall be carried on the
      cable system channel number on which the qualified local
      noncommercial educational television station is broadcast over
      the air, or on the channel on which it was carried on July 19,
      1985, at the election of the station, or on such other channel
      number as is mutually agreed upon by the station and the cable
      operator. Any dispute regarding the positioning of a qualified
      local noncommercial educational television station shall be
      resolved by the Commission.
    (h) Availability of signals
      Signals carried in fulfillment of the carriage obligations of a
    cable operator under this section shall be available to every
    subscriber as part of the cable system's lowest priced service tier
    that includes the retransmission of local commercial television
    broadcast signals.
    (i) Payment for carriage prohibited
      (1) In general
        A cable operator shall not accept monetary payment or other
      valuable consideration in exchange for carriage of the signal of
      any qualified local noncommercial educational television station
      carried in fulfillment of the requirements of this section,
      except that such a station may be required to bear the cost
      associated with delivering a good quality signal or a baseband
      video signal to the principal headend of the cable system.
      (2) Distant signal exception
        Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a cable
      operator shall not be required to add the signal of a qualified
      local noncommercial educational television station not already
      carried under the provision of subsection (c) of this section,
      where such signal would be considered a distant signal for
      copyright purposes unless such station indemnifies the cable
      operator for any increased copyright costs resulting from
      carriage of such signal.
    (j) Remedies
      (1) Complaint
        Whenever a qualified local noncommercial educational television
      station believes that a cable operator of a cable system has
      failed to comply with the signal carriage requirements of this
      section, the station may file a complaint with the Commission.
      Such complaint shall allege the manner in which such cable
      operator has failed to comply with such requirements and state
      the basis for such allegations.
      (2) Opportunity to respond
        The Commission shall afford such cable operator an opportunity
      to present data, views, and arguments to establish that the cable
      operator has complied with the signal carriage requirements of
      this section.
      (3) Remedial actions; dismissal
        Within 120 days after the date a complaint is filed under this
      subsection, the Commission shall determine whether the cable
      operator has complied with the requirements of this section. If
      the Commission determines that the cable operator has failed to
      comply with such requirements, the Commission shall state with
      particularity the basis for such findings and order the cable
      operator to take such remedial action as is necessary to meet
      such requirements. If the Commission determines that the cable
      operator has fully complied with such requirements, the
      Commission shall dismiss the complaint.
    (k) Identification of signals
      A cable operator shall identify, upon request by any person,
    those signals carried in fulfillment of the requirements of this
    section.

      carriage on one or more of such operator's systems;
        (2) include provisions designed to prohibit a cable operator or
      other multichannel video programming distributor from coercing a
      video programming vendor to provide, and from retaliating against
      such a vendor for failing to provide, exclusive rights against
      other multichannel video programming distributors as a condition
      of carriage on a system;
        (3) contain provisions designed to prevent a multichannel video
      programming distributor from engaging in conduct the effect of
      which is to unreasonably restrain the ability of an unaffiliated
      video programming vendor to compete fairly by discriminating in
      video programming distribution on the basis of affiliation or
      nonaffiliation of vendors in the selection, terms, or conditions
      for carriage of video programming provided by such vendors;
        (4) provide for expedited review of any complaints made by a
      video programming vendor pursuant to this section;
        (5) provide for appropriate penalties and remedies for
      violations of this subsection, including carriage; and
        (6) provide penalties to be assessed against any person filing
      a frivolous complaint pursuant to this section.
    (b) "Video programming vendor" defined

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authority to award franchises; public rights-of-way and
      easements; equal access to service; time for provision of
      service; assurances
      (1) A franchising authority may award, in accordance with the
    provisions of this subchapter, 1 or more franchises within its
    jurisdiction; except that a franchising authority may not grant an
    exclusive franchise and may not unreasonably refuse to award an
    additional competitive franchise. Any applicant whose application
    for a second franchise has been denied by a final decision of the
    franchising authority may appeal such final decision pursuant to
    the provisions of section 555 of this title for failure to comply
    with this subsection.
      (2) Any franchise shall be construed to authorize the
    construction of a cable system over public rights-of-way, and
    through easements, which is within the area to be served by the
    cable system and which have been dedicated for compatible uses,
    except that in using such easements the cable operator shall ensure
    - 
        (A) that the safety, functioning, and appearance of the
      property and the convenience and safety of other persons not be
      adversely affected by the installation or construction of
      facilities necessary for a cable system;
        (B) that the cost of the installation, construction, operation,
      or removal of such facilities be borne by the cable operator or
      subscriber, or a combination of both; and
        (C) that the owner of the property be justly compensated by the
      cable operator for any damages caused by the installation,
      construction, operation, or removal of such facilities by the
      cable operator.

      (3) In awarding a franchise or franchises, a franchising
    authority shall assure that access to cable service is not denied
    to any group of potential residential cable subscribers because of
    the income of the residents of the local area in which such group
    resides.
      (4) In awarding a franchise, the franchising authority - 
        (A) shall allow the applicant's cable system a reasonable
      period of time to become capable of providing cable service to
      all households in the franchise area;
        (B) may require adequate assurance that the cable operator will
      provide adequate public, educational, and governmental access
      channel capacity, facilities, or financial support; and
        (C) may require adequate assurance that the cable operator has
      the financial, technical, or legal qualifications to provide
      cable service.
    (b) No cable service without franchise; exception under prior law
      (1) Except to the extent provided in paragraph (2) and subsection
    (f) of this section, a cable operator may not provide cable service
    without a franchise.
      (2) Paragraph (1) shall not require any person lawfully providing
    cable service without a franchise on July 1, 1984, to obtain a
    franchise unless the franchising authority so requires.
      (3)(A) If a cable operator or affiliate thereof is engaged in the
    provision of telecommunications services - 
        (i) such cable operator or affiliate shall not be required to
      obtain a franchise under this subchapter for the provision of
      telecommunications services; and
        (ii) the provisions of this subchapter shall not apply to such
      cable operator or affiliate for the provision of
      telecommunications services.

      (B) A franchising authority may not impose any requirement under
    this subchapter that has the purpose or effect of prohibiting,
    limiting, restricting, or conditioning the provision of a
    telecommunications service by a cable operator or an affiliate
    thereof.
      (C) A franchising authority may not order a cable operator or
    affiliate thereof - 
        (i) to discontinue the provision of a telecommunications
      service, or
        (ii) to discontinue the operation of a cable system, to the
      extent such cable system is used for the provision of a
      telecommunications service, by reason of the failure of such
      cable operator or affiliate thereof to obtain a franchise or
      franchise renewal under this subchapter with respect to the
      provision of such telecommunications service.

      (D) Except as otherwise permitted by sections 531 and 532 of this
    title, a franchising authority may not require a cable operator to
    provide any telecommunications service or facilities, other than
    institutional networks, as a condition of the initial grant of a
    franchise, a franchise renewal, or a transfer of a franchise.
    (c) Status of cable system as common carrier or utility
      Any cable system shall not be subject to regulation as a common
    carrier or utility by reason of providing any cable service.
    (d) Informational tariffs; regulation by States; "State" defined
      (1) A State or the Commission may require the filing of
    informational tariffs for any intrastate communications service
    provided by a cable system, other than cable service, that would be
    subject to regulation by the Commission or any State if offered by
    a common carrier subject, in whole or in part, to subchapter II of
    this chapter. Such informational tariffs shall specify the rates,
    terms, and conditions for the provision of such service, including
    whether it is made available to all subscribers generally, and
    shall take effect on the date specified therein.
      (2) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to affect the
    authority of any State to regulate any cable operator to the extent
    that such operator provides any communication service other than
    cable service, whether offered on a common carrier or private
    contract basis.
      (3) For purposes of this subsection, the term "State" has the
    meaning given it in section 153 of this title.
    (e) State regulation of facilities serving subscribers in multiple
      dwelling units
      Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to affect the
    authority of any State to license or otherwise regulate any
    facility or combination of facilities which serves only subscribers
    in one or more multiple unit dwellings under common ownership,
    control, or management and which does not use any public right-of-
    way.
    (f) Local or municipal authority as multichannel video programming
      distributor
      No provision of this chapter shall be construed to - 
        (1) prohibit a local or municipal authority that is also, or is
      affiliated with, a franchising authority from operating as a
      multichannel video programming distributor in the franchise area,
      notwithstanding the granting of one or more franchises by such
      franchising authority; or
        (2) require such local or municipal authority to secure a
      franchise to operate as a multichannel video programming
      distributor.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Payment under terms of franchise
      Subject to the limitation of subsection (b) of this section, any
    cable operator may be required under the terms of any franchise to
    pay a franchise fee.
    (b) Amount of fees per annum
      For any twelve-month period, the franchise fees paid by a cable
    operator with respect to any cable system shall not exceed 5
    percent of such cable operator's gross revenues derived in such
    period from the operation of the cable system to provide cable
    services. For purposes of this section, the 12-month period shall
    be the 12-month period applicable under the franchise for
    accounting purposes. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a
    franchising authority and a cable operator from agreeing that
    franchise fees which lawfully could be collected for any such 12-
    month period shall be paid on a prepaid or deferred basis; except
    that the sum of the fees paid during the term of the franchise may
    not exceed the amount, including the time value of money, which
    would have lawfully been collected if such fees had been paid per
    annum.
    (c) Itemization of subscriber bills
      Each cable operator may identify, consistent with the regulations
    prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section 543 of this title,
    as a separate line item on each regular bill of each subscriber,
    each of the following:
        (1) The amount of the total bill assessed as a franchise fee
      and the identity of the franchising authority to which the fee is
      paid.
        (2) The amount of the total bill assessed to satisfy any
      requirements imposed on the cable operator by the franchise
      agreement to support public, educational, or governmental
      channels or the use of such channels.
        (3) The amount of any other fee, tax, assessment, or charge of
      any kind imposed by any governmental authority on the transaction
      between the operator and the subscriber.
    (d) Court actions; reflection of costs in rate structures
      In any court action under subsection (c) of this section, the
    franchising authority shall demonstrate that the rate structure
    reflects all costs of the franchise fees.
    (e) Decreases passed through to subscribers
      Any cable operator shall pass through to subscribers the amount
    of any decrease in a franchise fee.
    (f) Itemization of franchise fee in bill
      A cable operator may designate that portion of a subscriber's
    bill attributable to the franchise fee as a separate item on the
    bill.
    (g) "Franchise fee" defined
      For the purposes of this section - 
        (1) the term "franchise fee" includes any tax, fee, or
      assessment of any kind imposed by a franchising authority or
      other governmental entity on a cable operator or cable
      subscriber, or both, solely because of their status as such;
        (2) the term "franchise fee" does not include - 
          (A) any tax, fee, or assessment of general applicability
        (including any such tax, fee, or assessment imposed on both
        utilities and cable operators or their services but not
        including a tax, fee, or assessment which is unduly
        discriminatory against cable operators or cable subscribers);
          (B) in the case of any franchise in effect on October 30,
        1984, payments which are required by the franchise to be made
        by the cable operator during the term of such franchise for, or
        in support of the use of, public, educational, or governmental
        access facilities;
          (C) in the case of any franchise granted after October 30,
        1984, capital costs which are required by the franchise to be
        incurred by the cable operator for public, educational, or
        governmental access facilities;
          (D) requirements or charges incidental to the awarding or
        enforcing of the franchise, including payments for bonds,
        security funds, letters of credit, insurance, indemnification,
        penalties, or liquidated damages; or
          (E) any fee imposed under title 17.
    (h) Uncompensated services; taxes, fees and other assessments;
      limitation on fees
      (1) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit any
    authority of a franchising authority to impose a tax, fee, or other
    assessment of any kind on any person (other than a cable operator)
    with respect to cable service or other communications service
    provided by such person over a cable system for which charges are
    assessed to subscribers but not received by the cable operator.
      (2) For any 12-month period, the fees paid by such person with
    respect to any such cable service or other communications service
    shall not exceed 5 percent of such person's gross revenues derived
    in such period from the provision of such service over the cable
    system.
    (i) Regulatory authority of Federal agencies

    fees paid by a cable operator, or regulate the use of funds derived

    Part III - Franchising and Regulation

-HEAD-
    Sec. 543. Regulation of rates

-STATUTE-
    (a) Competition preference; local and Federal regulation
      (1) In general
        No Federal agency or State may regulate the rates for the
      provision of cable service except to the extent provided under
      this section and section 532 of this title. Any franchising
      authority may regulate the rates for the provision of cable
      service, or any other communications service provided over a
      cable system to cable subscribers, but only to the extent
      provided under this section. No Federal agency, State, or
      franchising authority may regulate the rates for cable service of
      a cable system that is owned or operated by a local government or
      franchising authority within whose jurisdiction that cable system
      is located and that is the only cable system located within such
      jurisdiction.
      (2) Preference for competition
        If the Commission finds that a cable system is subject to
      effective competition, the rates for the provision of cable
      service by such system shall not be subject to regulation by the
      Commission or by a State or franchising authority under this
      section. If the Commission finds that a cable system is not
      subject to effective competition - 
          (A) the rates for the provision of basic cable service shall
        be subject to regulation by a franchising authority, or by the
        Commission if the Commission exercises jurisdiction pursuant to
        paragraph (6), in accordance with the regulations prescribed by
        the Commission under subsection (b) of this section; and
          (B) the rates for cable programming services shall be subject
        to regulation by the Commission under subsection (c) of this
        section.
      (3) Qualification of franchising authority
        A franchising authority that seeks to exercise the regulatory
      jurisdiction permitted under paragraph (2)(A) shall file with the
      Commission a written certification that - 
          (A) the franchising authority will adopt and administer
        regulations with respect to the rates subject to regulation
        under this section that are consistent with the regulations
        prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b) of this
        section;
          (B) the franchising authority has the legal authority to
        adopt, and the personnel to administer, such regulations; and
          (C) procedural laws and regulations applicable to rate
        regulation proceedings by such authority provide a reasonable
        opportunity for consideration of the views of interested
        parties.
      (4) Approval by Commission
        A certification filed by a franchising authority under
      paragraph (3) shall be effective 30 days after the date on which
      it is filed unless the Commission finds, after notice to the
      authority and a reasonable opportunity for the authority to
      comment, that - 
          (A) the franchising authority has adopted or is administering
        regulations with respect to the rates subject to regulation
        under this section that are not consistent with the regulations
        prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b) of this
        section;
          (B) the franchising authority does not have the legal
        authority to adopt, or the personnel to administer, such
        regulations; or
          (C) procedural laws and regulations applicable to rate
        regulation proceedings by such authority do not provide a
        reasonable opportunity for consideration of the views of
        interested parties.

      If the Commission disapproves a franchising authority's
      certification, the Commission shall notify the franchising
      authority of any revisions or modifications necessary to obtain
      approval.
      (5) Revocation of jurisdiction
        Upon petition by a cable operator or other interested party,
      the Commission shall review the regulation of cable system rates
      by a franchising authority under this subsection. A copy of the
      petition shall be provided to the franchising authority by the
      person filing the petition. If the Commission finds that the
      franchising authority has acted inconsistently with the
      requirements of this subsection, the Commission shall grant
      appropriate relief. If the Commission, after the franchising
      authority has had a reasonable opportunity to comment, determines
      that the State and local laws and regulations are not in
      conformance with the regulations prescribed by the Commission
      under subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall revoke
      the jurisdiction of such authority.
      (6) Exercise of jurisdiction by Commission
        If the Commission disapproves a franchising authority's
      certification under paragraph (4), or revokes such authority's
      jurisdiction under paragraph (5), the Commission shall exercise
      the franchising authority's regulatory jurisdiction under
      paragraph (2)(A) until the franchising authority has qualified to
      exercise that jurisdiction by filing a new certification that
      meets the requirements of paragraph (3). Such new certification
      shall be effective upon approval by the Commission. The
      Commission shall act to approve or disapprove any such new
      certification within 90 days after the date it is filed.
      (7) Aggregation of equipment costs
        (A) In general
          The Commission shall allow cable operators, pursuant to any
        rules promulgated under subsection (b)(3) of this section, to
        aggregate, on a franchise, system, regional, or company level,
        their equipment costs into broad categories, such as converter
        boxes, regardless of the varying levels of functionality of the
        equipment within each such broad category. Such aggregation
        shall not be permitted with respect to equipment used by
        subscribers who receive only a rate regulated basic service
        tier.
        (B) Revision to Commission rules; forms
          Within 120 days of February 8, 1996, the Commission shall
        issue revisions to the appropriate rules and forms necessary to
        implement subparagraph (A).
    (b) Establishment of basic service tier rate regulations
      (1) Commission obligation to subscribers
        The Commission shall, by regulation, ensure that the rates for
      the basic service tier are reasonable. Such regulations shall be
      designed to achieve the goal of protecting subscribers of any
      cable system that is not subject to effective competition from
      rates for the basic service tier that exceed the rates that would
      be charged for the basic service tier if such cable system were
      subject to effective competition.
      (2) Commission regulations
        Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall
      prescribe, and periodically thereafter revise, regulations to
      carry out its obligations under paragraph (1). In prescribing
      such regulations, the Commission - 
          (A) shall seek to reduce the administrative burdens on
        subscribers, cable operators, franchising authorities, and the
        Commission;
          (B) may adopt formulas or other mechanisms and procedures in
        complying with the requirements of subparagraph (A); and
          (C) shall take into account the following factors:
            (i) the rates for cable systems, if any, that are subject
          to effective competition;
            (ii) the direct costs (if any) of obtaining, transmitting,
          and otherwise providing signals carried on the basic service
          tier, including signals and services carried on the basic
          service tier pursuant to paragraph (7)(B), and changes in
          such costs;
            (iii) only such portion of the joint and common costs (if
          any) of obtaining, transmitting, and otherwise providing such
          signals as is determined, in accordance with regulations
          prescribed by the Commission, to be reasonably and properly
          allocable to the basic service tier, and changes in such
          costs;
            (iv) the revenues (if any) received by a cable operator
          from advertising from programming that is carried as part of
          the basic service tier or from other consideration obtained
          in connection with the basic service tier;
            (v) the reasonably and properly allocable portion of any
          amount assessed as a franchise fee, tax, or charge of any
          kind imposed by any State or local authority on the
          transactions between cable operators and cable subscribers or
          any other fee, tax, or assessment of general applicability
          imposed by a governmental entity applied against cable
          operators or cable subscribers;
            (vi) any amount required, in accordance with paragraph (4),
          to satisfy franchise requirements to support public,
          educational, or governmental channels or the use of such
          channels or any other services required under the franchise;
          and
            (vii) a reasonable profit, as defined by the Commission
          consistent with the Commission's obligations to subscribers
          under paragraph (1).
      (3) Equipment
        The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this
      subsection shall include standards to establish, on the basis of
      actual cost, the price or rate for - 
          (A) installation and lease of the equipment used by
        subscribers to receive the basic service tier, including a
        converter box and a remote control unit and, if requested by
        the subscriber, such addressable converter box or other
        equipment as is required to access programming described in
        paragraph (8); and
          (B) installation and monthly use of connections for
        additional television receivers.
      (4) Costs of franchise requirements
        The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this
      subsection shall include standards to identify costs attributable
      to satisfying franchise requirements to support public,
      educational, and governmental channels or the use of such
      channels or any other services required under the franchise.
      (5) Implementation and enforcement
        The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this
      subsection shall include additional standards, guidelines, and
      procedures concerning the implementation and enforcement of such
      regulations, which shall include - 
          (A) procedures by which cable operators may implement and
        franchising authorities may enforce the regulations prescribed
        by the Commission under this subsection;
          (B) procedures for the expeditious resolution of disputes
        between cable operators and franchising authorities concerning
        the administration of such regulations;
          (C) standards and procedures to prevent unreasonable charges
        for changes in the subscriber's selection of services or
        equipment subject to regulation under this section, which
        standards shall require that charges for changing the service
        tier selected shall be based on the cost of such change and
        shall not exceed nominal amounts when the system's
        configuration permits changes in service tier selection to be
        effected solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by
        other similarly simple method; and
          (D) standards and procedures to assure that subscribers
        receive notice of the availability of the basic service tier
        required under this section.
      (6) Notice
        The procedures prescribed by the Commission pursuant to
      paragraph (5)(A) shall require a cable operator to provide 30
      days' advance notice to a franchising authority of any increase
      proposed in the price to be charged for the basic service tier.
      (7) Components of basic tier subject to rate regulation
        (A) Minimum contents
          Each cable operator of a cable system shall provide its
        subscribers a separately available basic service tier to which
        subscription is required for access to any other tier of
        service. Such basic service tier shall, at a minimum, consist
        of the following:
            (i) All signals carried in fulfillment of the requirements
          of sections 534 and 535 of this title.
            (ii) Any public, educational, and governmental access
          programming required by the franchise of the cable system to
          be provided to subscribers.
            (iii) Any signal of any television broadcast station that
          is provided by the cable operator to any subscriber, except a
          signal which is secondarily transmitted by a satellite
          carrier beyond the local service area of such station.
        (B) Permitted additions to basic tier
          A cable operator may add additional video programming signals
        or services to the basic service tier. Any such additional
        signals or services provided on the basic service tier shall be
        provided to subscribers at rates determined under the
        regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection.
      (8) Buy-through of other tiers prohibited
        (A) Prohibition
          A cable operator may not require the subscription to any tier
        other than the basic service tier required by paragraph (7) as
        a condition of access to video programming offered on a per
        channel or per program basis. A cable operator may not
        discriminate between subscribers to the basic service tier and
        other subscribers with regard to the rates charged for video
        programming offered on a per channel or per program basis.
        (B) Exception; limitation
          The prohibition in subparagraph (A) shall not apply to a
        cable system that, by reason of the lack of addressable
        converter boxes or other technological limitations, does not
        permit the operator to offer programming on a per channel or
        per program basis in the same manner required by subparagraph
        (A). This subparagraph shall not be available to any cable
        operator after - 
            (i) the technology utilized by the cable system is modified
          or improved in a way that eliminates such technological
          limitation; or
            (ii) 10 years after October 5, 1992, subject to
          subparagraph (C).
        (C) Waiver
          If, in any proceeding initiated at the request of any cable
        operator, the Commission determines that compliance with the
        requirements of subparagraph (A) would require the cable
        operator to increase its rates, the Commission may, to the
        extent consistent with the public interest, grant such cable
        operator a waiver from such requirements for such specified
        period as the Commission determines reasonable and appropriate.
    (c) Regulation of unreasonable rates
      (1) Commission regulations
        Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall, by
      regulation, establish the following:
          (A) criteria prescribed in accordance with paragraph (2) for
        identifying, in individual cases, rates for cable programming
        services that are unreasonable;
          (B) fair and expeditious procedures for the receipt,
        consideration, and resolution of complaints from any
        franchising authority (in accordance with paragraph (3))
        alleging that a rate for cable programming services charged by
        a cable operator violates the criteria prescribed under
        subparagraph (A), which procedures shall include the minimum
        showing that shall be required for a complaint to obtain
        Commission consideration and resolution of whether the rate in
        question is unreasonable; and
          (C) the procedures to be used to reduce rates for cable
        programming services that are determined by the Commission to
        be unreasonable and to refund such portion of the rates or
        charges that were paid by subscribers after the filing of the
        first complaint filed with the franchising authority under
        paragraph (3) and that are determined to be unreasonable.
      (2) Factors to be considered
        In establishing the criteria for determining in individual
      cases whether rates for cable programming services are
      unreasonable under paragraph (1)(A), the Commission shall
      consider, among other factors - 
          (A) the rates for similarly situated cable systems offering
        comparable cable programming services, taking into account
        similarities in facilities, regulatory and governmental costs,
        the number of subscribers, and other relevant factors;
          (B) the rates for cable systems, if any, that are subject to
        effective competition;
          (C) the history of the rates for cable programming services
        of the system, including the relationship of such rates to
        changes in general consumer prices;
          (D) the rates, as a whole, for all the cable programming,
        cable equipment, and cable services provided by the system,
        other than programming provided on a per channel or per program
        basis;
          (E) capital and operating costs of the cable system,
        including the quality and costs of the customer service
        provided by the cable system; and
          (F) the revenues (if any) received by a cable operator from
        advertising from programming that is carried as part of the
        service for which a rate is being established, and changes in
        such revenues, or from other consideration obtained in
        connection with the cable programming services concerned.
      (3) Review of rate changes
        The Commission shall review any complaint submitted by a
      franchising authority after February 8, 1996, concerning an
      increase in rates for cable programming services and issue a
      final order within 90 days after it receives such a complaint,
      unless the parties agree to extend the period for such review. A
      franchising authority may not file a complaint under this
      paragraph unless, within 90 days after such increase becomes
      effective it receives subscriber complaints.
      (4) Sunset of upper tier rate regulation
        This subsection shall not apply to cable programming services
      provided after March 31, 1999.
    (d) Uniform rate structure required
      A cable operator shall have a rate structure, for the provision
    of cable service, that is uniform throughout the geographic area in
    which cable service is provided over its cable system. This
    subsection does not apply to (1) a cable operator with respect to
    the provision of cable service over its cable system in any
    geographic area in which the video programming services offered by
    the operator in that area are subject to effective competition, or
    (2) any video programming offered on a per channel or per program
    basis. Bulk discounts to multiple dwelling units shall not be
    subject to this subsection, except that a cable operator of a cable
    system that is not subject to effective competition may not charge
    predatory prices to a multiple dwelling unit. Upon a prima facie
    showing by a complainant that there are reasonable grounds to
    believe that the discounted price is predatory, the cable system
    shall have the burden of showing that its discounted price is not
    predatory.
    (e) Discrimination; services for the hearing impaired
      Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as prohibiting any
    Federal agency, State, or a franchising authority from - 
        (1) prohibiting discrimination among subscribers and potential
      subscribers to cable service, except that no Federal agency,
      State, or franchising authority may prohibit a cable operator
      from offering reasonable discounts to senior citizens or other
      economically disadvantaged group discounts; or
        (2) requiring and regulating the installation or rental of
      equipment which facilitates the reception of cable service by
      hearing impaired individuals.
    (f) Negative option billing prohibited
      A cable operator shall not charge a subscriber for any service or
    equipment that the subscriber has not affirmatively requested by
    name. For purposes of this subsection, a subscriber's failure to
    refuse a cable operator's proposal to provide such service or
    equipment shall not be deemed to be an affirmative request for such
    service or equipment.
    (g) Collection of information
      The Commission shall, by regulation, require cable operators to
    file with the Commission or a franchising authority, as
    appropriate, within one year after October 5, 1992, and annually
    thereafter, such financial information as may be needed for
    purposes of administering and enforcing this section.
    (h) Prevention of evasions
      Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall, by
    regulation, establish standards, guidelines, and procedures to
    prevent evasions, including evasions that result from retiering, of
    the requirements of this section and shall, thereafter,
    periodically review and revise such standards, guidelines, and
    procedures.
    (i) Small system burdens
      In developing and prescribing regulations pursuant to this
    section, the Commission shall design such regulations to reduce the
    administrative burdens and cost of compliance for cable systems
    that have 1,000 or fewer subscribers.
    (j) Rate regulation agreements
      During the term of an agreement made before July 1, 1990, by a
    franchising authority and a cable operator providing for the
    regulation of basic cable service rates, where there was not
    effective competition under Commission rules in effect on that
    date, nothing in this section (or the regulations thereunder) shall
    abridge the ability of such franchising authority to regulate rates
    in accordance with such an agreement.
    (k) Reports on average prices
      The Commission shall annually publish statistical reports on the
    average rates for basic cable service and other cable programming,
    and for converter boxes, remote control units, and other equipment,
    of - 
        (1) cable systems that the Commission has found are subject to
      effective competition under subsection (a)(2) of this section,
      compared with
        (2) cable systems that the Commission has found are not subject
      to such effective competition.
    (l) Definitions
      As used in this section - 
        (1) The term "effective competition" means that - 
          (A) fewer than 30 percent of the households in the franchise
        area subscribe to the cable service of a cable system;
          (B) the franchise area is - 
            (i) served by at least two unaffiliated multichannel video
          programming distributors each of which offers comparable
          video programming to at least 50 percent of the households in
          the franchise area; and
            (ii) the number of households subscribing to programming
          services offered by multichannel video programming
          distributors other than the largest multichannel video
          programming distributor exceeds 15 percent of the households
          in the franchise area;

          (C) a multichannel video programming distributor operated by
        the franchising authority for that franchise area offers video
        programming to at least 50 percent of the households in that
        franchise area; or
          (D) a local exchange carrier or its affiliate (or any
        multichannel video programming distributor using the facilities
        of such carrier or its affiliate) offers video programming
        services directly to subscribers by any means (other than
        direct-to-home satellite services) in the franchise area of an
        unaffiliated cable operator which is providing cable service in
        that franchise area, but only if the video programming services
        so offered in that area are comparable to the video programming
        services provided by the unaffiliated cable operator in that
        area.

        (2) The term "cable programming service" means any video
      programming provided over a cable system, regardless of service
      tier, including installation or rental of equipment used for the
      receipt of such video programming, other than (A) video
      programming carried on the basic service tier, and (B) video
      programming offered on a per channel or per program basis.
    (m) Special rules for small companies
      (1) In general
        Subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section do not apply to a
      small cable operator with respect to - 
          (A) cable programming services, or
          (B) a basic service tier that was the only service tier
        subject to regulation as of December 31, 1994,

      in any franchise area in which that operator services 50,000 or
      fewer subscribers.
      (2) "Small cable operator" defined
        For purposes of this subsection, the term "small cable
      operator" means a cable operator that, directly or through an
      affiliate, serves in the aggregate fewer than 1 percent of all
      subscribers in the United States and is not affiliated with any
      entity or entities whose gross annual revenues in the aggregate
      exceed $250,000,000.
    (n) Treatment of prior year losses
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or of section
    532 of this title, losses associated with a cable system (including
    losses associated with the grant or award of a franchise) that were
    incurred prior to September 4, 1992, with respect to a cable system
    that is owned and operated by the original franchisee of such
    system shall not be disallowed, in whole or in part, in the
    determination of whether the rates for any tier of service or any
    type of equipment that is subject to regulation under this section
    are lawful.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 544. Regulation of services, facilities, and equipment

-STATUTE-
    (a) Regulation by franchising authority
      Any franchising authority may not regulate the services,
    facilities, and equipment provided by a cable operator except to
    the extent consistent with this subchapter.
    (b) Requests for proposals; establishment and enforcement of
      requirements
      In the case of any franchise granted after the effective date of
    this subchapter, the franchising authority, to the extent related
    to the establishment or operation of a cable system - 
        (1) in its request for proposals for a franchise (including
      requests for renewal proposals, subject to section 546 of this
      title), may establish requirements for facilities and equipment,
      but may not, except as provided in subsection (h) of this

          (A) for facilities and equipment; and
          (B) for broad categories of video programming or other
        services.
    (c) Enforcement authority respecting franchises effective under
      prior law
      In the case of any franchise in effect on the effective date of
    this subchapter, the franchising authority may, subject to section
    545 of this title, enforce requirements contained within the
    franchise for the provision of services, facilities, and equipment,
    whether or not related to the establishment or operation of a cable
    system.
    (d) Cable service unprotected by Constitution; blockage of premium
      channel upon request
      (1) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as prohibiting
    a franchising authority and a cable operator from specifying, in a
    franchise or renewal thereof, that certain cable services shall not
    be provided or shall be provided subject to conditions, if such
    cable services are obscene or are otherwise unprotected by the
    Constitution of the United States.
      (2) In order to restrict the viewing of of of (!1) programming
    which is obscene or indecent, upon the request of a subscriber, a
    cable operator shall provide (by sale or lease) a device by which
    the subscriber can prohibit viewing of a particular cable service
    during periods selected by that subscriber.

      (3)(A) If a cable operator provides a premium channel without
    charge to cable subscribers who do not subscribe to such premium
    channel, the cable operator shall, not later than 30 days before
    such premium channel is provided without charge - 
        (i) notify all cable subscribers that the cable operator plans
      to provide a premium channel without charge;
        (ii) notify all cable subscribers when the cable operator plans
      to offer a premium channel without charge;
        (iii) notify all cable subscribers that they have a right to
      request that the channel carrying the premium channel be blocked;
      and
        (iv) block the channel carrying the premium channel upon the
      request of a subscriber.

      (B) For the purpose of this section, the term "premium channel"
    shall mean any pay service offered on a per channel or per program
    basis, which offers movies rated by the Motion Picture Association
    of America as X, NC-17, or R.
    (e) Technical standards
      Within one year after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall
    prescribe regulations which establish minimum technical standards
    relating to cable systems' technical operation and signal quality.
    The Commission shall update such standards periodically to reflect
    improvements in technology. No State or franchising authority may
    prohibit, condition, or restrict a cable system's use of any type
    of subscriber equipment or any transmission technology.
    (f) Limitation on regulatory powers of Federal agencies, States, or
      franchising authorities; exceptions
      (1) Any Federal agency, State, or franchising authority may not
    impose requirements regarding the provision or content of cable
    services, except as expressly provided in this subchapter.
      (2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to - 
        (A) any rule, regulation, or order issued under any Federal
      law, as such rule, regulation, or order (i) was in effect on
      September 21, 1983, or (ii) may be amended after such date if the
      rule, regulation, or order as amended is not inconsistent with
      the express provisions of this subchapter; and
        (B) any rule, regulation, or order under title 17.
    (g) Access to emergency information
      Notwithstanding any such rule, regulation, or order, each cable
    operator shall comply with such standards as the Commission shall
    prescribe to ensure that viewers of video programming on cable
    systems are afforded the same emergency information as is afforded
    by the emergency broadcasting system pursuant to Commission
    regulations in subpart G of part 73, title 47, Code of Federal
    Regulations.
    (h) Notice of changes in and comments on services
      A franchising authority may require a cable operator to do any
    one or more of the following:
        (1) Provide 30 days' advance written notice of any change in
      channel assignment or in the video programming service provided
      over any such channel.
        (2) Inform subscribers, via written notice, that comments on
      programming and channel position changes are being recorded by a
      designated office of the franchising authority.
    (i) Disposition of cable upon termination of service
      Within 120 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall

-HEAD-
    Sec. 544a. Consumer electronics equipment compatibility

-STATUTE-
    (a) Findings
      The Congress finds that - 
        (1) new and recent models of television receivers and video
      cassette recorders often contain premium features and functions
      that are disabled or inhibited because of cable scrambling,
      encoding, or encryption technologies and devices, including
      converter boxes and remote control devices required by cable
      operators to receive programming;
        (2) if these problems are allowed to persist, consumers will be
      less likely to purchase, and electronics equipment manufacturers
      will be less likely to develop, manufacture, or offer for sale,
      television receivers and video cassette recorders with new and
      innovative features and functions;
        (3) cable operators should use technologies that will prevent
      signal thefts while permitting consumers to benefit from such
      features and functions in such receivers and recorders; and
        (4) compatibility among televisions, video cassette recorders,
      and cable systems can be assured with narrow technical standards
      that mandate a minimum degree of common design and operation,
      leaving all features, functions, protocols, and other product and
      service options for selection through open competition in the
      market.
    (b) Compatible interfaces
      (1) Report; regulations
        Within 1 year after October 5, 1992, the Commission, in
      consultation with representatives of the cable industry and the
      consumer electronics industry, shall report to Congress on means
      of assuring compatibility between televisions and video cassette
      recorders and cable systems, consistent with the need to prevent
      theft of cable service, so that cable subscribers will be able to
      enjoy the full benefit of both the programming available on cable
      systems and the functions available on their televisions and
      video cassette recorders. Within 180 days after the date of
      submission of the report required by this subsection, the
      Commission shall issue such regulations as are necessary to
      assure such compatibility.
      (2) Scrambling and encryption
        In issuing the regulations referred to in paragraph (1), the
      Commission shall determine whether and, if so, under what
      circumstances to permit cable systems to scramble or encrypt
      signals or to restrict cable systems in the manner in which they
      encrypt or scramble signals, except that the Commission shall not
      limit the use of scrambling or encryption technology where the
      use of such technology does not interfere with the functions of
      subscribers' television receivers or video cassette recorders.
    (c) Rulemaking requirements
      (1) Factors to be considered
        In prescribing the regulations required by this section, the
      Commission shall consider - 
          (A) the need to maximize open competition in the market for
        all features, functions, protocols, and other product and
        service options of converter boxes and other cable converters
        unrelated to the descrambling or decryption of cable television
        signals;
          (B) the costs and benefits to consumers of imposing
        compatibility requirements on cable operators and television
        manufacturers in a manner that, while providing effective
        protection against theft or unauthorized reception of cable
        service, will minimize interference with or nullification of
        the special functions of subscribers' television receivers or
        video cassette recorders, including functions that permit the
        subscriber - 
            (i) to watch a program on one channel while simultaneously
          using a video cassette recorder to tape a program on another
          channel;
            (ii) to use a video cassette recorder to tape two
          consecutive programs that appear on different channels; and
            (iii) to use advanced television picture generation and
          display features; and

          (C) the need for cable operators to protect the integrity of
        the signals transmitted by the cable operator against theft or
        to protect such signals against unauthorized reception.
      (2) Regulations required
        The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this section
      shall include such regulations as are necessary - 
          (A) to specify the technical requirements with which a
        television receiver or video cassette recorder must comply in
        order to be sold as "cable compatible" or "cable ready";
          (B) to require cable operators offering channels whose
        reception requires a converter box - 
            (i) to notify subscribers that they may be unable to
          benefit from the special functions of their television
          receivers and video cassette recorders, including functions
          that permit subscribers - 
              (I) to watch a program on one channel while
            simultaneously using a video cassette recorder to tape a
            program on another channel;
              (II) to use a video cassette recorder to tape two
            consecutive programs that appear on different channels; and
              (III) to use advanced television picture generation and
            display features; and

            (ii) to the extent technically and economically feasible,
          to offer subscribers the option of having all other channels
          delivered directly to the subscribers' television receivers
          or video cassette recorders without passing through the
          converter box;

          (C) to promote the commercial availability, from cable
        operators and retail vendors that are not affiliated with cable
        systems, of converter boxes and of remote control devices
        compatible with converter boxes;
          (D) to ensure that any standards or regulations developed
        under the authority of this section to ensure compatibility
        between televisions, video cassette recorders, and cable
        systems do not affect features, functions, protocols, and other
        product and service options other than those specified in
        paragraph (1)(B), including telecommunications interface
        equipment, home automation communications, and computer network
        services;
          (E) to require a cable operator who offers subscribers the
        option of renting a remote control unit - 
            (i) to notify subscribers that they may purchase a
          commercially available remote control device from any source
          that sells such devices rather than renting it from the cable
          operator; and
            (ii) to specify the types of remote control units that are
          compatible with the converter box supplied by the cable
          operator; and

          (F) to prohibit a cable operator from taking any action that
        prevents or in any way disables the converter box supplied by
        the cable operator from operating compatibly with commercially
        available remote control units.
    (d) Review of regulations
      The Commission shall periodically review and, if necessary,

-HEAD-
    Sec. 545. Modification of franchise obligations

-STATUTE-
    (a) Grounds for modification by franchising authority; public
      proceeding; time of decision
      (1) During the period a franchise is in effect, the cable
    operator may obtain from the franchising authority modifications of
    the requirements in such franchise - 
        (A) in the case of any such requirement for facilities or
      equipment, including public, educational, or governmental access
      facilities or equipment, if the cable operator demonstrates that
      (i) it is commercially impracticable for the operator to comply
      with such requirement, and (ii) the proposal by the cable
      operator for modification of such requirement is appropriate
      because of commercial impracticability; or
        (B) in the case of any such requirement for services, if the
      cable operator demonstrates that the mix, quality, and level of
      services required by the franchise at the time it was granted
      will be maintained after such modification.

      (2) Any final decision by a franchising authority under this
    subsection shall be made in a public proceeding. Such decision
    shall be made within 120 days after receipt of such request by the
    franchising authority, unless such 120 day period is extended by
    mutual agreement of the cable operator and the franchising
    authority.
    (b) Judicial proceedings; grounds for modification by court
      (1) Any cable operator whose request for modification under
    subsection (a) of this section has been denied by a final decision
    of a franchising authority may obtain modification of such
    franchise requirements pursuant to the provisions of section 555 of
    this title.
      (2) In the case of any proposed modification of a requirement for
    facilities or equipment, the court shall grant such modification
    only if the cable operator demonstrates to the court that - 
        (A) it is commercially impracticable for the operator to comply
      with such requirement; and
        (B) the terms of the modification requested are appropriate
      because of commercial impracticability.

      (3) In the case of any proposed modification of a requirement for
    services, the court shall grant such modification only if the cable
    operator demonstrates to the court that the mix, quality, and level
    of services required by the franchise at the time it was granted
    will be maintained after such modification.
    (c) Rearrangement, replacement, or removal of service
      Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section, a cable
    operator may, upon 30 days' advance notice to the franchising
    authority, rearrange, replace, or remove a particular cable service
    required by the franchise if - 
        (1) such service is no longer available to the operator; or
        (2) such service is available to the operator only upon the
      payment of a royalty required under section 801(b)(2) of title
      17, which the cable operator can document - 
          (A) is substantially in excess of the amount of such payment
        required on the date of the operator's offer to provide such
        service, and
          (B) has not been specifically compensated for through a rate
        increase or other adjustment.
    (d) Rearrangement of particular services from one service tier to
      another or other offering of service
      Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section, a cable
    operator may take such actions to rearrange a particular service
    from one service tier to another, or otherwise offer the service,
    if the rates for all of the service tiers involved in such actions
    are not subject to regulation under section 543 of this title.
    (e) Requirements for services relating to public, educational, or
      governmental access
      A cable operator may not obtain modification under this section
    of any requirement for services relating to public, educational, or
    governmental access.
    (f) "Commercially impracticable" defined
      For purposes of this section, the term "commercially
    impracticable" means, with respect to any requirement applicable to
    a cable operator, that it is commercially impracticable for the
    operator to comply with such requirement as a result of a change in
    conditions which is beyond the control of the operator and the
    nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the
    requirement was based.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 546. Renewal

-STATUTE-
    (a) Commencement of proceedings; public notice and participation
      (1) A franchising authority may, on its own initiative during the
    6-month period which begins with the 36th month before the
    franchise expiration, commence a proceeding which affords the
    public in the franchise area appropriate notice and participation
    for the purpose of (A) identifying the future cable-related
    community needs and interests, and (B) reviewing the performance of
    the cable operator under the franchise during the then current
    franchise term. If the cable operator submits, during such 6-month
    period, a written renewal notice requesting the commencement of
    such a proceeding, the franchising authority shall commence such a
    proceeding not later than 6 months after the date such notice is
    submitted.
      (2) The cable operator may not invoke the renewal procedures set
    forth in subsections (b) through (g) of this section unless - 
        (A) such a proceeding is requested by the cable operator by
      timely submission of such notice; or
        (B) such a proceeding is commenced by the franchising authority
      on its own initiative.
    (b) Submission of renewal proposals; contents; time
      (1) Upon completion of a proceeding under subsection (a) of this
    section, a cable operator seeking renewal of a franchise may, on
    its own initiative or at the request of a franchising authority,
    submit a proposal for renewal.
      (2) Subject to section 544 of this title, any such proposal shall
    contain such material as the franchising authority may require,
    including proposals for an upgrade of the cable system.
      (3) The franchising authority may establish a date by which such
    proposal shall be submitted.
    (c) Notice of proposal; renewal; preliminary assessment of
      nonrenewal; administrative review; issues; notice and opportunity
      for hearing; transcript; written decision
      (1) Upon submittal by a cable operator of a proposal to the
    franchising authority for the renewal of a franchise pursuant to
    subsection (b) of this section, the franchising authority shall
    provide prompt public notice of such proposal and, during the 4-
    month period which begins on the date of the submission of the
    cable operator's proposal pursuant to subsection (b) of this
    section, renew the franchise or, issue a preliminary assessment
    that the franchise should not be renewed and, at the request of the
    operator or on its own initiative, commence an administrative
    proceeding, after providing prompt public notice of such
    proceeding, in accordance with paragraph (2) to consider whether - 
        (A) the cable operator has substantially complied with the
      material terms of the existing franchise and with applicable law;
        (B) the quality of the operator's service, including signal
      quality, response to consumer complaints, and billing practices,
      but without regard to the mix or quality of cable services or
      other services provided over the system, has been reasonable in
      light of community needs;
        (C) the operator has the financial, legal, and technical
      ability to provide the services, facilities, and equipment as set
      forth in the operator's proposal; and
        (D) the operator's proposal is reasonable to meet the future
      cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account
      the cost of meeting such needs and interests.

      (2) In any proceeding under paragraph (1), the cable operator
    shall be afforded adequate notice and the cable operator and the
    franchise authority, or its designee, shall be afforded fair
    opportunity for full participation, including the right to
    introduce evidence (including evidence related to issues raised in
    the proceeding under subsection (a) of this section), to require
    the production of evidence, and to question witnesses. A transcript
    shall be made of any such proceeding.
      (3) At the completion of a proceeding under this subsection, the
    franchising authority shall issue a written decision granting or
    denying the proposal for renewal based upon the record of such
    proceeding, and transmit a copy of such decision to the cable
    operator. Such decision shall state the reasons therefor.
    (d) Basis for denial
      Any denial of a proposal for renewal that has been submitted in
    compliance with subsection (b) of this section shall be based on
    one or more adverse findings made with respect to the factors
    described in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of subsection (c)(1) of
    this section, pursuant to the record of the proceeding under
    subsection (c) of this section. A franchising authority may not
    base a denial of renewal on a failure to substantially comply with
    the material terms of the franchise under subsection (c)(1)(A) of
    this section or on events considered under subsection (c)(1)(B) of
    this section in any case in which a violation of the franchise or
    the events considered under subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section
    occur after the effective date of this subchapter unless the
    franchising authority has provided the operator with notice and the
    opportunity to cure, or in any case in which it is documented that
    the franchising authority has waived its right to object, or the
    cable operator gives written notice of a failure or inability to
    cure and the franchising authority fails to object within a
    reasonable time after receipt of such notice.
    (e) Judicial review; grounds for relief
      (1) Any cable operator whose proposal for renewal has been denied
    by a final decision of a franchising authority made pursuant to
    this section, or has been adversely affected by a failure of the
    franchising authority to act in accordance with the procedural
    requirements of this section, may appeal such final decision or
    failure pursuant to the provisions of section 555 of this title.
      (2) The court shall grant appropriate relief if the court finds
    that - 
        (A) any action of the franchising authority, other than
      harmless error, is not in compliance with the procedural
      requirements of this section; or
        (B) in the event of a final decision of the franchising
      authority denying the renewal proposal, the operator has
      demonstrated that the adverse finding of the franchising
      authority with respect to each of the factors described in
      subparagraphs (A) through (D) of subsection (c)(1) of this
      section on which the denial is based is not supported by a
      preponderance of the evidence, based on the record of the
      proceeding conducted under subsection (c) of this section.
    (f) Finality of administrative decision
      Any decision of a franchising authority on a proposal for renewal
    shall not be considered final unless all administrative review by
    the State has occurred or the opportunity therefor has lapsed.
    (g) "Franchise expiration" defined
      For purposes of this section, the term "franchise expiration"
    means the date of the expiration of the term of the franchise, as
    provided under the franchise, as it was in effect on October 30,
    1984.
    (h) Alternative renewal procedures
      Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) through (g) of
    this section, a cable operator may submit a proposal for the
    renewal of a franchise pursuant to this subsection at any time, and
    a franchising authority may, after affording the public adequate
    notice and opportunity for comment, grant or deny such proposal at
    any time (including after proceedings pursuant to this section have
    commenced). The provisions of subsections (a) through (g) of this
    section shall not apply to a decision to grant or deny a proposal
    under this subsection. The denial of a renewal pursuant to this
    subsection shall not affect action on a renewal proposal that is
    submitted in accordance with subsections (a) through (g) of this
    section.
    (i) Effect of renewal procedures upon action to revoke franchise
      for cause
      Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) through (h) of
    this section, any lawful action to revoke a cable operator's
    franchise for cause shall not be negated by the subsequent
    initiation of renewal proceedings by the cable operator under this
    section.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 548. Development of competition and diversity in video
      programming distribution

-STATUTE-
    (a) Purpose
      The purpose of this section is to promote the public interest,
    convenience, and necessity by increasing competition and diversity
    in the multichannel video programming market, to increase the
    availability of satellite cable programming and satellite broadcast
    programming to persons in rural and other areas not currently able
    to receive such programming, and to spur the development of
    communications technologies.
    (b) Prohibition
      It shall be unlawful for a cable operator, a satellite cable
    programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable
    interest, or a satellite broadcast programming vendor to engage in
    unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or
    practices, the purpose or effect of which is to hinder
    significantly or to prevent any multichannel video programming
    distributor from providing satellite cable programming or satellite
    broadcast programming to subscribers or consumers.
    (c) Regulations required
      (1) Proceeding required
        Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall, in
      order to promote the public interest, convenience, and necessity
      by increasing competition and diversity in the multichannel video
      programming market and the continuing development of
      communications technologies, prescribe regulations to specify
      particular conduct that is prohibited by subsection (b) of this
      section.
      (2) Minimum contents of regulations
        The regulations to be promulgated under this section shall - 
          (A) establish effective safeguards to prevent a cable
        operator which has an attributable interest in a satellite
        cable programming vendor or a satellite broadcast programming
        vendor from unduly or improperly influencing the decision of
        such vendor to sell, or the prices, terms, and conditions of
        sale of, satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast
        programming to any unaffiliated multichannel video programming
        distributor;
          (B) prohibit discrimination by a satellite cable programming
        vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable interest
        or by a satellite broadcast programming vendor in the prices,
        terms, and conditions of sale or delivery of satellite cable
        programming or satellite broadcast programming among or between
        cable systems, cable operators, or other multichannel video
        programming distributors, or their agents or buying groups;
        except that such a satellite cable programming vendor in which
        a cable operator has an attributable interest or such a
        satellite broadcast programming vendor shall not be prohibited
        from - 
            (i) imposing reasonable requirements for creditworthiness,
          offering of service, and financial stability and standards
          regarding character and technical quality;
            (ii) establishing different prices, terms, and conditions
          to take into account actual and reasonable differences in the
          cost of creation, sale, delivery, or transmission of
          satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast
          programming;
            (iii) establishing different prices, terms, and conditions
          which take into account economies of scale, cost savings, or
          other direct and legitimate economic benefits reasonably
          attributable to the number of subscribers served by the
          distributor; or
            (iv) entering into an exclusive contract that is permitted
          under subparagraph (D);

          (C) prohibit practices, understandings, arrangements, and

        programming or satellite broadcast programming between a cable
        operator and a satellite cable programming vendor or satellite
        broadcast programming vendor, that prevent a multichannel video
        programming distributor from obtaining such programming from
        any satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable
        operator has an attributable interest or any satellite
        broadcast programming vendor in which a cable operator has an
        attributable interest for distribution to persons in areas not
        served by a cable operator as of October 5, 1992; and
          (D) with respect to distribution to persons in areas served
        by a cable operator, prohibit exclusive contracts for satellite
        cable programming or satellite broadcast programming between a
        cable operator and a satellite cable programming vendor in
        which a cable operator has an attributable interest or a
        satellite broadcast programming vendor in which a cable
        operator has an attributable interest, unless the Commission
        determines (in accordance with paragraph (4)) that such
        contract is in the public interest.
      (3) Limitations
        (A) Geographic limitations
          Nothing in this section shall require any person who is
        engaged in the national or regional distribution of video
        programming to make such programming available in any
        geographic area beyond which such programming has been
        authorized or licensed for distribution.
        (B) Applicability to satellite retransmissions
          Nothing in this section shall apply (i) to the signal of any

        is not satellite broadcast programming, or (ii) to any internal
        satellite communication of any broadcast network or cable
        network that is not satellite broadcast programming.
      (4) Public interest determinations on exclusive contracts
        In determining whether an exclusive contract is in the public
      interest for purposes of paragraph (2)(D), the Commission shall
      consider each of the following factors with respect to the effect
      of such contract on the distribution of video programming in

    Sec. 549. Competitive availability of navigation devices

-STATUTE-
    (a) Commercial consumer availability of equipment used to access
      services provided by multichannel video programming distributors
      The Commission shall, in consultation with appropriate industry
    standard-setting organizations, adopt regulations to assure the
    commercial availability, to consumers of multichannel video
    programming and other services offered over multichannel video
    programming systems, of converter boxes, interactive communications
    equipment, and other equipment used by consumers to access
    multichannel video programming and other services offered over
    multichannel video programming systems, from manufacturers,
    retailers, and other vendors not affiliated with any multichannel
    video programming distributor. Such regulations shall not prohibit
    any multichannel video programming distributor from also offering
    converter boxes, interactive communications equipment, and other
    equipment used by consumers to access multichannel video
    programming and other services offered over multichannel video
    programming systems, to consumers, if the system operator's charges
    to consumers for such devices and equipment are separately stated
    and not subsidized by charges for any such service.
    (b) Protection of system security
      The Commission shall not prescribe regulations under subsection
    (a) of this section which would jeopardize security of multichannel
    video programming and other services offered over multichannel
    video programming systems, or impede the legal rights of a provider
    of such services to prevent theft of service.
    (c) Waiver
      The Commission shall waive a regulation adopted under subsection
    (a) of this section for a limited time upon an appropriate showing
    by a provider of multichannel video programming and other services
    offered over multichannel video programming systems, or an
    equipment provider, that such waiver is necessary to assist the
    development or introduction of a new or improved multichannel video
    programming or other service offered over multichannel video
    programming systems, technology, or products. Upon an appropriate
    showing, the Commission shall grant any such waiver request within
    90 days of any application filed under this subsection, and such
    waiver shall be effective for all service providers and products in
    that category and for all providers of services and products.
    (d) Avoidance of redundant regulations
      (1) Commercial availability determinations
        Determinations made or regulations prescribed by the Commission
      with respect to commercial availability to consumers of converter
      boxes, interactive communications equipment, and other equipment
      used by consumers to access multichannel video programming and
      other services offered over multichannel video programming
      systems, before February 8, 1996, shall fulfill the requirements
      of this section.
      (2) Regulations
        Nothing in this section affects section 64.702(e) of the
      Commission's regulations (47 C.F.R. 64.702(e)) or other
      Commission regulations governing interconnection and competitive
      provision of customer premises equipment used in connection with
      basic common carrier communications services.
    (e) Sunset
      The regulations adopted under this section shall cease to apply
    when the Commission determines that - 
        (1) the market for the multichannel video programming
      distributors is fully competitive;
        (2) the market for converter boxes, and interactive
      communications equipment, used in conjunction with that service
      is fully competitive; and
        (3) elimination of the regulations would promote competition
      and the public interest.
    (f) Commission's authority
      Nothing in this section shall be construed as expanding or
    limiting any authority that the Commission may have under law in
    effect before February 8, 1996.

      court order
      Except as provided in subsection (c)(2)(D) of this section, a

        (1) such entity offers clear and convincing evidence that the
      subject of the information is reasonably suspected of engaging in
      criminal activity and that the information sought would be
      material evidence in the case; and
        (2) the subject of the information is afforded the opportunity

    Sec. 552. Consumer protection and customer service

-STATUTE-
    (a) Franchising authority enforcement
      A franchising authority may establish and enforce - 
        (1) customer service requirements of the cable operator; and
        (2) construction schedules and other construction-related
      requirements, including construction-related performance
      requirements, of the cable operator.
    (b) Commission standards
      The Commission shall, within 180 days of October 5, 1992,
    establish standards by which cable operators may fulfill their
    customer service requirements. Such standards shall include, at a
    minimum, requirements governing - 
        (1) cable system office hours and telephone availability;
        (2) installations, outages, and service calls; and
        (3) communications between the cable operator and the
      subscriber (including standards governing bills and refunds).
    (c) Subscriber notice
      A cable operator may provide notice of service and rate changes
    to subscribers using any reasonable written means at its sole
    discretion. Notwithstanding section 543(b)(6) of this title or any
    other provision of this chapter, a cable operator shall not be
    required to provide prior notice of any rate change that is the
    result of a regulatory fee, franchise fee, or any other fee, tax,
    assessment, or charge of any kind imposed by any Federal agency,
    State, or franchising authority on the transaction between the
    operator and the subscriber.
    (d) Consumer protection laws and customer service agreements
      (1) Consumer protection laws
        Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to prohibit any
      State or any franchising authority from enacting or enforcing any
      consumer protection law, to the extent not specifically preempted
      by this subchapter.
      (2) Customer service requirement agreements
        Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude a
      franchising authority and a cable operator from agreeing to
      customer service requirements that exceed the standards
      established by the Commission under subsection (b) of this
      section. Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to prevent
      the establishment or enforcement of any municipal law or
      regulation, or any State law, concerning customer service that
      imposes customer service requirements that exceed the standards
      set by the Commission under this section, or that addresses
      matters not addressed by the standards set by the Commission
      under this section.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Unauthorized interception or receipt or assistance in
      intercepting or receiving service; "assist in intercepting or
      receiving" defined
      (1) No person shall intercept or receive or assist in
    intercepting or receiving any communications service offered over a
    cable system, unless specifically authorized to do so by a cable
    operator or as may otherwise be specifically authorized by law.
      (2) For the purpose of this section, the term "assist in
    intercepting or receiving" shall include the manufacture or
    distribution of equipment intended by the manufacturer or
    distributor (as the case may be) for unauthorized reception of any
    communications service offered over a cable system in violation of
    subparagraph (1).
    (b) Penalties for willful violation
      (1) Any person who willfully violates subsection (a)(1) of this
    section shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not
    more than 6 months, or both.
      (2) Any person who violates subsection (a)(1) of this section
    willfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or private
    financial gain shall be fined not more than $50,000 or imprisoned
    for not more than 2 years, or both, for the first such offense and
    shall be fined not more than $100,000 or imprisoned for not more
    than 5 years, or both, for any subsequent offense.
      (3) For purposes of all penalties and remedies established for
    violations of subsection (a)(1) of this section, the prohibited
    activity established herein as it applies to each such device shall
    be deemed a separate violation.
    (c) Civil action in district court; injunctions; damages;
      attorney's fees and costs; regulation by States or franchising
      authorities
      (1) Any person aggrieved by any violation of subsection (a)(1) of
    this section may bring a civil action in a United States district
    court or in any other court of competent jurisdiction.
      (2) The court may - 
        (A) grant temporary and final injunctions on such terms as it
      may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain violations of
      subsection (a)(1) of this section;
        (B) award damages as described in paragraph (3); and
        (C) direct the recovery of full costs, including awarding
      reasonable attorneys' fees to an aggrieved party who prevails.

      (3)(A) Damages awarded by any court under this section shall be
    computed in accordance with either of the following clauses:
        (i) the party aggrieved may recover the actual damages suffered
      by him as a result of the violation and any profits of the
      violator that are attributable to the violation which are not
      taken into account in computing the actual damages; in
      determining the violator's profits, the party aggrieved shall be
      required to prove only the violator's gross revenue, and the
      violator shall be required to prove his deductible expenses and
      the elements of profit attributable to factors other than the
      violation; or
        (ii) the party aggrieved may recover an award of statutory
      damages for all violations involved in the action, in a sum of
      not less than $250 or more than $10,000 as the court considers
      just.

      (B) In any case in which the court finds that the violation was
    committed willfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or
    private financial gain, the court in its discretion may increase
    the award of damages, whether actual or statutory under
    subparagraph (A), by an amount of not more than $50,000.
      (C) In any case where the court finds that the violator was not
    aware and had no reason to believe that his acts constituted a
    violation of this section, the court in its discretion may reduce
    the award of damages to a sum of not less than $100.
      (D) Nothing in this subchapter shall prevent any State or
    franchising authority from enacting or enforcing laws, consistent
    with this section, regarding the unauthorized interception or
    reception of any cable service or other communications service.

    Sec. 554. Equal employment opportunity

-STATUTE-
    (a) Entities within scope of coverage
      This section shall apply to any corporation, partnership,
    association, joint-stock company, or trust engaged primarily in the
    management or operation of any cable system.
    (b) Discrimination prohibited
      Equal opportunity in employment shall be afforded by each entity
    specified in subsection (a) of this section, and no person shall be
    discriminated against in employment by such entity because of race,
    color, religion, national origin, age, or sex.
    (c) Equal opportunity programs; establishment; maintenance;
      execution; terms
      Any entity specified in subsection (a) of this section shall
    establish, maintain, and execute a positive continuing program of
    specific practices designed to ensure equal opportunity in every
    aspect of its employment policies and practices. Under the terms of
    its program, each such entity shall - 
        (1) define the responsibility of each level of management to
      ensure a positive application and vigorous enforcement of its
      policy of equal opportunity, and establish a procedure to review
      and control managerial and supervisory performance;
        (2) inform its employees and recognized employee organizations
      of the equal employment opportunity policy and program and enlist
      their cooperation;
        (3) communicate its equal employment opportunity policy and
      program and its employment needs to sources of qualified
      applicants without regard to race, color, religion, national
      origin, age, or sex, and solicit their recruitment assistance on
      a continuing basis;
        (4) conduct a continuing program to exclude every form of
      prejudice or discrimination based on race, color, religion,
      national origin, age, or sex, from its personnel policies and
      practices and working conditions; and
        (5) conduct a continuing review of job structure and employment
      practices and adopt positive recruitment, training, job design,
      and other measures needed to ensure genuine equality of
      opportunity to participate fully in all its organizational units,
      occupations, and levels of responsibility.
    (d) Revision of rules; required provisions; annual statistical
      report; notice and comment on amendments
      (1) Not later than 270 days after the date of enactment of the
    Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992,
    and after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission shall
    prescribe revisions in the rules under this section in order to
    implement the amendments made to this section by such Act. Such
    revisions shall be designed to promote equality of employment
    opportunities for females and minorities in each of the job
    categories itemized in paragraph (3).
      (2) Such rules shall specify the terms under which an entity
    specified in subsection (a) of this section shall, to the extent
    possible - 
        (A) disseminate its equal opportunity program to job
      applicants, employees, and those with whom it regularly does
      business;
        (B) use minority organizations, organizations for women, media,
      educational institutions, and other potential sources of minority
      and female applicants, to supply referrals whenever jobs are
      available in its operation;
        (C) evaluate its employment profile and job turnover against
      the availability of minorities and women in its franchise area;
        (D) undertake to offer promotions of minorities and women to
      positions of greater responsibility;
        (E) encourage minority and female entrepreneurs to conduct
      business with all parts of its operation; and
        (F) analyze the results of its efforts to recruit, hire,
      promote, and use the services of minorities and women and explain
      any difficulties encountered in implementing its equal employment
      opportunity program.

      (3)(A) Such rules also shall require an entity specified in
    subsection (a) of this section with more than 5 full-time employees
    to file with the Commission an annual statistical report
    identifying by race, sex, and job title the number of employees in
    each of the following full-time and part-time job categories:
        (i) Corporate officers.
        (ii) General Manager.
        (iii) Chief Technician.
        (iv) Comptroller.
        (v) General Sales Manager.
        (vi) Production Manager.
        (vii) Managers.
        (viii) Professionals.
        (ix) Technicians.
        (x) Sales Personnel.
        (xi) Office and Clerical Personnel.
        (xii) Skilled Craftspersons.
        (xiii) Semiskilled Operatives.
        (xiv) Unskilled Laborers.
        (xv) Service Workers.

      (B) The report required by subparagraph (A) shall be made on
    separate forms, provided by the Commission, for full-time and part-
    time employees. The Commission's rules shall sufficiently define
    the job categories listed in clauses (i) through (vi) of such
    subparagraph so as to ensure that only employees who are principal
    decisionmakers and who have supervisory authority are reported for
    such categories. The Commission shall adopt rules that define the
    job categories listed in clauses (vii) through (xv) in a manner
    that is consistent with the Commission policies in effect on June
    1, 1990. The Commission shall prescribe the method by which
    entities shall be required to compute and report the number of
    minorities and women in the job categories listed in clauses (i)
    through (x) and the number of minorities and women in the job
    categories listed in clauses (i) through (xv) in proportion to the
    total number of qualified minorities and women in the relevant
    labor market. The report shall include information on hiring,
    promotion, and recruitment practices necessary for the Commission
    to evaluate the efforts of entities to comply with the provisions
    of paragraph (2) of this subsection. The report shall be available
    for public inspection at the entity's central location and at every
    location where 5 or more full-time employees are regularly assigned
    to work. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as
    prohibiting the Commission from collecting or continuing to collect
    statistical or other employment information in a manner that it
    deems appropriate to carry out this section.
      (4) The Commission may amend such rules from time to time to the
    extent necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. Any
    such amendment shall be made after notice and opportunity for
    comment.
    (e) Annual certification of compliance; periodic investigation of
      employment practices
      (1) On an annual basis, the Commission shall certify each entity
    described in subsection (a) of this section as in compliance with
    this section if, on the basis of information in the possession of
    the Commission, including the report filed pursuant to subsection
    (d)(3) of this section, such entity was in compliance, during the
    annual period involved, with the requirements of subsections (b),
    (c), and (d) of this section.
      (2) The Commission shall, periodically but not less frequently
    than every five years, investigate the employment practices of each
    entity described in subsection (a) of this section, in the
    aggregate, as well as in individual job categories, and determine
    whether such entity is in compliance with the requirements of
    subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, including whether
    such entity's employment practices deny or abridge women and
    minorities equal employment opportunities. As part of such
    investigation, the Commission shall review whether the entity's
    reports filed pursuant to subsection (d)(3) of this section
    accurately reflect employee responsibilities in the reported job
    classifications.
    (f) Substantial failure to comply; penalties; notice to public and
      franchising authorities
      (1) If the Commission finds after notice and hearing that the
    entity involved has willfully or repeatedly without good cause
    failed to comply with the requirements of this section, such
    failure shall constitute a substantial failure to comply with this
    subchapter. The failure to obtain certification under subsection
    (e) of this section shall not itself constitute the basis for a
    determination of substantial failure to comply with this title. For
    purposes of this paragraph, the term "repeatedly", when used with
    respect to failures to comply, refers to 3 or more failures during
    any 7-year period.
      (2) Any person who is determined by the Commission, through an
    investigation pursuant to subsection (e) of this section or
    otherwise, to have failed to meet or failed to make best efforts to
    meet the requirements of this section, or rules under this section,
    shall be liable to the United States for a forfeiture penalty of
    $500 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall
    constitute a separate offense. Any entity defined in subsection (a)
    of this section shall not be liable for more than 180 days of
    forfeitures which accrued prior to notification by the Commission
    of a potential violation. Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the
    forfeiture imposed on any person as a result of any violation that

    person, may file a complaint with the Commission. A complaint by
    any such person shall be in writing, and shall be signed and sworn
    to by that person. The regulations under subsection (d)(1) of this
    section shall specify a program, under authorities otherwise
    available to the Commission, for the investigation of complaints
    and violations, and for the enforcement of this section.
    (h) "Cable operator" defined; owners of multiple unit dwellings
      (1) For purposes of this section, the term "cable operator"

    system, including a system described in section 522(7)(A) of this
    title and any multichannel video programming distributor.

      nonexclusive nature of remedies and enforcement provisions;
      covered franchises
      (1) Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of any

        (A) to establish or enforce any requirement which is consistent
      with the requirements of this section, including any requirement
      which affords equal employment opportunity protection for
      employees;
        (B) to establish or enforce any provision requiring or
      encouraging any cable operator to conduct business with
      enterprises which are owned or controlled by members of minority
      groups (as defined in section 309(i)(3)(C)(ii) of this title) or
      which have their principal operations located within the
      community served by the cable operator; or
        (C) to enforce any requirement of a franchise in effect on the
      effective date of this subchapter.

      (2) The remedies and enforcement provisions of this section are
    in addition to, and not in lieu of, those available under this or
    any other law.
      (3) The provisions of this section shall apply to any cable
    operator, whether operating pursuant to a franchise granted before,
    on, or after October 30, 1984.

    Sec. 571. Regulatory treatment of video programming services

-STATUTE-
    (a) Limitations on cable regulation
      (1) Radio-based systems
        To the extent that a common carrier (or any other person) is
      providing video programming to subscribers using radio
      communication, such carrier (or other person) shall be subject to
      the requirements of subchapter III of this chapter and section
      572 of this title, but shall not otherwise be subject to the
      requirements of this subchapter.
      (2) Common carriage of video traffic
        To the extent that a common carrier is providing transmission
      of video programming on a common carrier basis, such carrier
      shall be subject to the requirements of subchapter II of this
      chapter and section 572 of this title, but shall not otherwise be
      subject to the requirements of this subchapter. This paragraph
      shall not affect the treatment under section 522(7)(C) of this
      title of a facility of a common carrier as a cable system.
      (3) Cable systems and open video systems
        To the extent that a common carrier is providing video
      programming to its subscribers in any manner other than that
      described in paragraphs (1) and (2) - 
          (A) such carrier shall be subject to the requirements of this
        subchapter, unless such programming is provided by means of an
        open video system for which the Commission has approved a
        certification under section 573 of this title; or
          (B) if such programming is provided by means of an open video
        system for which the Commission has approved a certification
        under section 573 of this title, such carrier shall be subject
        to the requirements of this part, but shall be subject to parts
        I through IV of this subchapter only as provided in 573(c) of
        this title.
      (4) Election to operate as open video system
        A common carrier that is providing video programming in a
      manner described in paragraph (1) or (2), or a combination
      thereof, may elect to provide such programming by means of an
      open video system that complies with section 573 of this title.
      If the Commission approves such carrier's certification under
      section 573 of this title, such carrier shall be subject to the
      requirements of this part, but shall be subject to parts I
      through IV of this subchapter only as provided in 573(c) of this
      title.
    (b) Limitations on interconnection obligations
      A local exchange carrier that provides cable service through an
    open video system or a cable system shall not be required, pursuant
    to subchapter II of this chapter, to make capacity available on a
    nondiscriminatory basis to any other person for the provision of
    cable service directly to subscribers.
    (c) Additional regulatory relief
      A common carrier shall not be required to obtain a certificate
    under section 214 of this title with respect to the establishment
    or operation of a system for the delivery of video programming.

    Sec. 572. Prohibition on buy outs

-STATUTE-
    (a) Acquisitions by carriers
      No local exchange carrier or any affiliate of such carrier owned
    by, operated by, controlled by, or under common control with such
    carrier may purchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly
    more than a 10 percent financial interest, or any management
    interest, in any cable operator providing cable service within the
    local exchange carrier's telephone service area.
    (b) Acquisitions by cable operators
      No cable operator or affiliate of a cable operator that is owned
    by, operated by, controlled by, or under common ownership with such
    cable operator may purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or
    indirectly, more than a 10 percent financial interest, or any
    management interest, in any local exchange carrier providing
    telephone exchange service within such cable operator's franchise
    area.
    (c) Joint ventures
      A local exchange carrier and a cable operator whose telephone
    service area and cable franchise area, respectively, are in the
    same market may not enter into any joint venture or partnership to
    provide video programming directly to subscribers or to provide
    telecommunications services within such market.
    (d) Exceptions
      (1) Rural systems
        Notwithstanding subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section,
      a local exchange carrier (with respect to a cable system located
      in its telephone service area) and a cable operator (with respect
      to the facilities of a local exchange carrier used to provide
      telephone exchange service in its cable franchise area) may
      obtain a controlling interest in, management interest in, or
      enter into a joint venture or partnership with the operator of
      such system or facilities for the use of such system or
      facilities to the extent that - 
          (A) such system or facilities only serve incorporated or
        unincorporated - 
            (i) places or territories that have fewer than 35,000
          inhabitants; and
            (ii) are outside an urbanized area, as defined by the
          Bureau of the Census; and

          (B) in the case of a local exchange carrier, such system, in
        the aggregate with any other system in which such carrier has
        an interest, serves less than 10 percent of the households in
        the telephone service area of such carrier.
      (2) Joint use
        Notwithstanding subsection (c) of this section, a local
      exchange carrier may obtain, with the concurrence of the cable
      operator on the rates, terms, and conditions, the use of that
      part of the transmission facilities of a cable system extending
      from the last multi-user terminal to the premises of the end
      user, if such use is reasonably limited in scope and duration, as
      determined by the Commission.
      (3) Acquisitions in competitive markets
        Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (c) of this section, a
      local exchange carrier may obtain a controlling interest in, or
      form a joint venture or other partnership with, or provide
      financing to, a cable system (hereinafter in this paragraph
      referred to as "the subject cable system"), if - 
          (A) the subject cable system operates in a television market
        that is not in the top 25 markets, and such market has more
        than 1 cable system operator, and the subject cable system is
        not the cable system with the most subscribers in such
        television market;
          (B) the subject cable system and the cable system with the
        most subscribers in such television market held on May 1, 1995,
        cable television franchises from the largest municipality in
        the television market and the boundaries of such franchises
        were identical on such date;
          (C) the subject cable system is not owned by or under common
        ownership or control of any one of the 50 cable system
        operators with the most subscribers as such operators existed
        on May 1, 1995; and
          (D) the system with the most subscribers in the television
        market is owned by or under common ownership or control of any
        one of the 10 largest cable system operators as such operators
        existed on May 1, 1995.
      (4) Exempt cable systems
        Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to any cable
      system if - 
          (A) the cable system serves no more than 17,000 cable
        subscribers, of which no less than 8,000 live within an urban
        area, and no less than 6,000 live within a nonurbanized area as
        of June 1, 1995;
          (B) the cable system is not owned by, or under common
        ownership or control with, any of the 50 largest cable system
        operators in existence on June 1, 1995; and
          (C) the cable system operates in a television market that was
        not in the top 100 television markets as of June 1, 1995.
      (5) Small cable systems in nonurban areas
        Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (c) of this section, a
      local exchange carrier with less than $100,000,000 in annual
      operating revenues (or any affiliate of such carrier owned by,
      operated by, controlled by, or under common control with such
      carrier) may purchase or otherwise acquire more than a 10 percent
      financial interest in, or any management interest in, or enter
      into a joint venture or partnership with, any cable system within
      the local exchange carrier's telephone service area that serves
      no more than 20,000 cable subscribers, if no more than 12,000 of
      those subscribers live within an urbanized area, as defined by
      the Bureau of the Census.
      (6) Waivers
        The Commission may waive the restrictions of subsections (!1)
      (a), (b), or (c) of this section only if - 

          (A) the Commission determines that, because of the nature of
        the market served by the affected cable system or facilities
        used to provide telephone exchange service - 
            (i) the affected cable operator or local exchange carrier
          would be subjected to undue economic distress by the
          enforcement of such provisions;
            (ii) the system or facilities would not be economically
          viable if such provisions were enforced; or
            (iii) the anticompetitive effects of the proposed
          transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by
          the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the
          convenience and needs of the community to be served; and

          (B) the local franchising authority approves of such waiver.
    (e) "Telephone service area" defined
      For purposes of this section, the term "telephone service area"
    when used in connection with a common carrier subject in whole or
    in part to subchapter II of this chapter means the area within
    which such carrier provided telephone exchange service as of
    January 1, 1993, but if any common carrier after such date
    transfers its telephone exchange service facilities to another
    common carrier, the area to which such facilities provide telephone
    exchange service shall be treated as part of the telephone service
    area of the acquiring common carrier and not of the selling common
    carrier.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 573. Establishment of open video systems

-STATUTE-
    (a) Open video systems
      (1) Certificates of compliance
        A local exchange carrier may provide cable service to its cable
      service subscribers in its telephone service area through an open
      video system that complies with this section. To the extent
      permitted by such regulations as the Commission may prescribe
      consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity,
      an operator of a cable system or any other person may provide
      video programming through an open video system that complies with
      this section. An operator of an open video system shall qualify
      for reduced regulatory burdens under subsection (c) of this
      section if the operator of such system certifies to the
      Commission that such carrier complies with the Commission's
      regulations under subsection (b) of this section and the
      Commission approves such certification. The Commission shall
      publish notice of the receipt of any such certification and shall
      act to approve or disapprove any such certification within 10
      days after receipt of such certification.
      (2) Dispute resolution
        The Commission shall have the authority to resolve disputes
      under this section and the regulations prescribed thereunder. Any
      such dispute shall be resolved within 180 days after notice of
      such dispute is submitted to the Commission. At that time or
      subsequently in a separate damages proceeding, the Commission
      may, in the case of any violation of this section, require
      carriage, award damages to any person denied carriage, or any
      combination of such sanctions. Any aggrieved party may seek any
      other remedy available under this chapter.
    (b) Commission actions
      (1) Regulations required
        Within 6 months after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall
      complete all actions necessary (including any reconsideration) to
      prescribe regulations that - 
          (A) except as required pursuant to section 531, 534, or 535
        of this title, prohibit an operator of an open video system
        from discriminating among video programming providers with
        regard to carriage on its open video system, and ensure that
        the rates, terms, and conditions for such carriage are just and
        reasonable, and are not unjustly or unreasonably
        discriminatory;
          (B) if demand exceeds the channel capacity of the open video
        system, prohibit an operator of an open video system and its
        affiliates from selecting the video programming services for
        carriage on more than one-third of the activated channel
        capacity on such system, but nothing in this subparagraph shall
        be construed to limit the number of channels that the carrier
        and its affiliates may offer to provide directly to
        subscribers;
          (C) permit an operator of an open video system to carry on
        only one channel any video programming service that is offered
        by more than one video programming provider (including the
        local exchange carrier's video programming affiliate):
        Provided, That subscribers have ready and immediate access to
        any such video programming service;
          (D) extend to the distribution of video programming over open
        video systems the Commission's regulations concerning sports
        exclusivity (47 C.F.R. 76.67), network nonduplication (47
        C.F.R. 76.92 et seq.), and syndicated exclusivity (47 C.F.R.
        76.151 et seq.); and
          (E)(i) prohibit an operator of an open video system from
        unreasonably discriminating in favor of the operator or its
        affiliates with regard to material or information (including
        advertising) provided by the operator to subscribers for the
        purposes of selecting programming on the open video system, or
        in the way such material or information is presented to
        subscribers;
          (ii) require an operator of an open video system to ensure
        that video programming providers or copyright holders (or both)
        are able suitably and uniquely to identify their programming
        services to subscribers;
          (iii) if such identification is transmitted as part of the
        programming signal, require the carrier to transmit such
        identification without change or alteration; and
          (iv) prohibit an operator of an open video system from
        omitting television broadcast stations or other unaffiliated
        video programming services carried on such system from any
        navigational device, guide, or menu.
      (2) Consumer access
        Subject to the requirements of paragraph (1) and the
      regulations thereunder, nothing in this section prohibits a
      common carrier or its affiliate from negotiating mutually
      agreeable terms and conditions with over-the-air broadcast
      stations and other unaffiliated video programming providers to
      allow consumer access to their signals on any level or screen of
      any gateway, menu, or other program guide, whether provided by
      the carrier or its affiliate.
    (c) Reduced regulatory burdens for open video systems
      (1) In general
        Any provision that applies to a cable operator under - 
          (A) sections 533 (other than subsection (a) thereof), 536,
        543(f), 548, 551, and 554 of this title, shall apply,
          (B) sections 531, 534, and 535 of this title, and section 325
        of this title, shall apply in accordance with the regulations
        prescribed under paragraph (2), and
          (C) sections 532 and 537 of this title, and parts III and IV
        of this subchapter (other than sections 543(f), 548, 551, and
        554 of this title), shall not apply,

      to any operator of an open video system for which the Commission
      has approved a certification under this section.
      (2) Implementation
        (A) Commission action
          In the rulemaking proceeding to prescribe the regulations
        required by subsection (b)(1) of this section, the Commission
        shall, to the extent possible, impose obligations that are no
        greater or lesser than the obligations contained in the
        provisions described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection.
        The Commission shall complete all action (including any
        reconsideration) to prescribe such regulations no later than 6
        months after February 8, 1996.
        (B) Fees
          An operator of an open video system under this part may be
        subject to the payment of fees on the gross revenues of the
        operator for the provision of cable service imposed by a local
        franchising authority or other governmental entity, in lieu of
        the franchise fees permitted under section 542 of this title.
        The rate at which such fees are imposed shall not exceed the
        rate at which franchise fees are imposed on any cable operator
        transmitting video programming in the franchise area, as
        determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the
        Commission. An operator of an open video system may designate
        that portion of a subscriber's bill attributable to the fee
        under this subparagraph as a separate item on the bill.
      (3) Regulatory streamlining
        With respect to the establishment and operation of an open
      video system, the requirements of this section shall apply in
      lieu of, and not in addition to, the requirements of subchapter
      II of this chapter.
      (4) Treatment as cable operator
        Nothing in this chapter precludes a video programming provider
      making use of an open video system from being treated as an
      operator of a cable system for purposes of section 111 of title
      17.
    (d) "Telephone service area" defined
      For purposes of this section, the term "telephone service area"
    when used in connection with a common carrier subject in whole or
    in part to subchapter II of this chapter means the area within
    which such carrier is offering telephone exchange service.

      authorized equipment which is designed to eliminate the effects
      of such modification or alteration;
        (4) the term "private viewing" means the viewing for private
      use in an individual's dwelling unit by means of equipment, owned
      or operated by such individual, capable of receiving satellite

      (3)(A) Any person aggrieved by any violation of subsection (a) of
    this section or paragraph (4) of this subsection may bring a civil
    action in a United States district court or in any other court of
    competent jurisdiction.
      (B) The court - 
        (i) may grant temporary and final injunctions on such terms as
      it may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain violations of
      subsection (a) of this section;
        (ii) may award damages as described in subparagraph (C); and
        (iii) shall direct the recovery of full costs, including
      awarding reasonable attorneys' fees to an aggrieved party who

    with either of the following subclauses;
        (I) the party aggrieved may recover the actual damages suffered
      by him as a result of the violation and any profits of the
      violator that are attributable to the violation which are not
      taken into account in computing the actual damages; in
      determining the violator's profits, the party aggrieved shall be
      required to prove only the violator's gross revenue, and the
      violator shall be required to prove his deductible expenses and
      the elements of profit attributable to factors other than the
      violation; or
        (II) the party aggrieved may recover an award of statutory
      damages for each violation of subsection (a) of this section
      involved in the action in a sum of not less than $1,000 or more
      than $10,000, as the court considers just, and for each violation
      of paragraph (4) of this subsection involved in the action an
      aggrieved party may recover statutory damages in a sum not less
      than $10,000, or more than $100,000, as the court considers just.

      (ii) In any case in which the court finds that the violation was
    committed willfully and for purposes of direct or indirect
    commercial advantage or private financial gain, the court in its
    discretion may increase the award of damages, whether actual or
    statutory, by an amount of not more than $100,000 for each
    violation of subsection (a) of this section.
      (iii) In any case where the court finds that the violator was not
    aware and had no reason to believe that his acts constituted a
    violation of this section, the court in its discretion may reduce
    the award of damages to a sum of not less than $250.
      (4) Any person who manufactures, assembles, modifies, imports,
    exports, sells, or distributes any electronic, mechanical, or other
    device or equipment, knowing or having reason to know that the
    device or equipment is primarily of assistance in the unauthorized
    decryption of satellite cable programming, or direct-to-home
    satellite services, or is intended for any other activity
    prohibited by subsection (a) of this section, shall be fined not
    more than $500,000 for each violation, or imprisoned for not more
    than 5 years for each violation, or both. For purposes of all
    penalties and remedies established for violations of this
    paragraph, the prohibited activity established herein as it applies
    to each such device shall be deemed a separate violation.
      (5) The penalties under this subsection shall be in addition to
    those prescribed under any other provision of this subchapter.
      (6) Nothing in this subsection shall prevent any State, or
    political subdivision thereof, from enacting or enforcing any laws
    with respect to the importation, sale, manufacture, or distribution
    of equipment by any person with the intent of its use to assist in
    the interception or receipt of radio communications prohibited by
    subsection (a) of this section.
    (f) Rights, obligations, and liabilities under other laws
      unaffected
      Nothing in this section shall affect any right, obligation, or
    liability under title 17, any rule, regulation, or order
    thereunder, or any other applicable Federal, State, or local law.
    (g) Universal encryption standard
      The Commission shall initiate an inquiry concerning the need for
    a universal encryption standard that permits decryption of
    satellite cable programming intended for private viewing. In
    conducting such inquiry, the Commission shall take into account - 
        (1) consumer costs and benefits of any such standard, including
      consumer investment in equipment in operation;
        (2) incorporation of technological enhancements, including
      advanced television formats;
        (3) whether any such standard would effectively prevent present
      and future unauthorized decryption of satellite cable
      programming;
        (4) the costs and benefits of any such standard on other
      authorized users of encrypted satellite cable programming,
      including cable systems and satellite master antenna television
      systems;
        (5) the effect of any such standard on competition in the
      manufacture of decryption equipment; and
        (6) the impact of the time delay associated with the Commission
      procedures necessary for establishment of such standards.
    (h) Rulemaking for encryption standard
      If the Commission finds, based on the information gathered from
    the inquiry required by subsection (g) of this section, that a
    universal encryption standard is necessary and in the public
    interest, the Commission shall initiate a rulemaking to establish
    such a standard.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Priority communications
      During the continuance of a war in which the United States is
    engaged, the President is authorized, if he finds it necessary for
    the national defense and security, to direct that such
    communications as in his judgment may be essential to the national
    defense and security shall have preference or priority with any
    carrier subject to this chapter. He may give these directions at
    and for such times as he may determine, and may modify, change,
    suspend, or annul them and for any such purpose he is authorized to
    issue orders directly, or through such person or persons as he
    designates for the purpose, or through the Commission. Any carrier
    complying with any such order or direction for preference or
    priority herein authorized shall be exempt from any and all
    provisions in existing law imposing civil or criminal penalties,
    obligations, or liabilities upon carriers by reason of giving
    preference or priority in compliance with such order or direction.
    (b) Obstruction of interstate or foreign communications
      It shall be unlawful for any person during any war in which the
    United States is engaged to knowingly or willfully, by physical
    force or intimidation by threats of physical force, obstruct or
    retard or aid in obstructing or retarding interstate or foreign
    communication by radio or wire. The President is authorized,
    whenever in his judgment the public interest requires, to employ
    the armed forces of the United States to prevent any such
    obstruction or retardation of communication: Provided, That nothing
    in this section shall be construed to repeal, modify, or affect
    either section 17 of title 15 or section 52 of title 29.
    (c) Suspension or amendment of rules and regulations applicable to
      certain emission stations or devices
      Upon proclamation by the President that there exists war or a
    threat of war, or a state of public peril or disaster or other
    national emergency, or in order to preserve the neutrality of the
    United States, the President, if he deems it necessary in the
    interest of national security or defense, may suspend or amend, for
    such time as he may see fit, the rules and regulations applicable
    to any or all stations or devices capable of emitting
    electromagnetic radiations within the jurisdiction of the United
    States as prescribed by the Commission, and may cause the closing
    of any station for radio communication, or any device capable of
    emitting electromagnetic radiations between 10 kilocycles and
    100,000 megacycles, which is suitable for use as a navigational aid
    beyond five miles, and the removal therefrom of its apparatus and
    equipment, or he may authorize the use or control of any such
    station or device and/or its apparatus and equipment, by any
    department of the Government under such regulations as he may
    prescribe upon just compensation to the owners. The authority
    granted to the President, under this subsection, to cause the
    closing of any station or device and the removal therefrom of its
    apparatus and equipment, or to authorize the use or control of any
    station or device and/or its apparatus and equipment, may be
    exercised in the Canal Zone.
    (d) Suspension or amendment of rules and regulations applicable to
      wire communications; closing of facilities; Government use of
      facilities
      Upon proclamation by the President that there exists a state or
    threat of war involving the United States, the President, if he
    deems it necessary in the interest of the national security and
    defense, may, during a period ending not later than six months
    after the termination of such state or threat of war and not later
    than such earlier date as the Congress by concurrent resolution may
    designate, (1) suspend or amend the rules and regulations
    applicable to any or all facilities or stations for wire
    communication within the jurisdiction of the United States as
    prescribed by the Commission, (2) cause the closing of any facility
    or station for wire communication and the removal therefrom of its
    apparatus and equipment, or (3) authorize the use or control of any
    such facility or station and its apparatus and equipment by any
    department of the Government under such regulations as he may
    prescribe, upon just compensation to the owners.
    (e) Compensation
      The President shall ascertain the just compensation for such use
    or control and certify the amount ascertained to Congress for
    appropriation and payment to the person entitled thereto. If the
    amount so certified is unsatisfactory to the person entitled
    thereto, such person shall be paid only 75 per centum of the amount
    and shall be entitled to sue the United States to recover such
    further sum as added to such payment of 75 per centum will make
    such amount as will be just compensation for the use and control.

    powers, or regulations may affect the transmission of Government
    communications, or the issue of stocks and bonds by any
    communication system or systems.
    (g) Limitations upon Presidential power
      Nothing in subsection (c) or (d) of this section shall be

    this section shall be construed to authorize the President to take
    any action the force and effect of which shall continue beyond the
    date after which taking of such action would not have been
    authorized.
    (h) Penalties
      Any person who willfully does or causes or suffers to be done any
    act prohibited pursuant to the exercise of the President's
    authority under this section, or who willfully fails to do any act
    which he is required to do pursuant to the exercise of the
    President's authority under this section, or who willfully causes
    or suffers such failure, shall, upon conviction thereof, be
    punished for such offense by a fine of not more than $1,000 or by
    imprisonment for not more than one year, or both, and, if a firm,

    SUBCHAPTER VI - MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 610. Telephone service for disabled

-STATUTE-
    (a) Establishment of regulations
      The Commission shall establish such regulations as are necessary
    to ensure reasonable access to telephone service by persons with
    impaired hearing.
    (b) Hearing aid compatibility requirements
      (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), the Commission
    shall require that - 
        (A) all essential telephones, and
        (B) all telephones manufactured in the United States (other
      than for export) more than one year after August 16, 1988, or
      imported for use in the United States more than one year after
      August 16, 1988,

    provide internal means for effective use with hearing aids that are
    designed to be compatible with telephones which meet established
    technical standards for hearing aid compatibility.
      (2)(A) The initial regulations prescribed by the Commission under
    paragraph (1) of this subsection after August 16, 1988, shall
    exempt from the requirements established pursuant to paragraph
    (1)(B) of this subsection only - 
        (i) telephones used with public mobile services;
        (ii) telephones used with private radio services;
        (iii) cordless telephones; and
        (iv) secure telephones.

      (B) The exemption provided by such regulations for cordless
    telephones shall not apply with respect to cordless telephones
    manufactured or imported more than three years after August 16,
    1988.
      (C) The Commission shall periodically assess the appropriateness
    of continuing in effect the exemptions provided by such regulations
    for telephones used with public mobile services and telephones used
    with private radio services. The Commission shall revoke or
    otherwise limit any such exemption if the Commission determines
    that - 
        (i) such revocation or limitation is in the public interest;
        (ii) continuation of the exemption without such revocation or
      limitation would have an adverse effect on hearing-impaired
      individuals;
        (iii) compliance with the requirements of paragraph (1)(B) is
      technologically feasible for the telephones to which the
      exemption applies; and
        (iv) compliance with the requirements of paragraph (1)(B) would
      not increase costs to such an extent that the telephones to which
      the exemption applies could not be successfully marketed.

      (3) The Commission may, upon the application of any interested
    person, initiate a proceeding to waive the requirements of
    paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection with respect to new telephones,
    or telephones associated with a new technology or service. The
    Commission shall not grant such a waiver unless the Commission
    determines, on the basis of evidence in the record of such
    proceeding, that such telephones, or such technology or service,
    are in the public interest, and that (A) compliance with the
    requirements of paragraph (1)(B) is technologically infeasible, or
    (B) compliance with such requirements would increase the costs of
    the telephones, or of the technology or service, to such an extent
    that such telephones, technology, or service could not be
    successfully marketed. In any proceeding under this paragraph to
    grant a waiver from the requirements of paragraph (1)(B), the
    Commission shall consider the effect on hearing-impaired
    individuals of granting the waiver. The Commission shall
    periodically review and determine the continuing need for any
    waiver granted pursuant to this paragraph.
      (4) For purposes of this subsection - 
        (A) the term "essential telephones" means only coin-operated
      telephones, telephones provided for emergency use, and other
      telephones frequently needed for use by persons using such
      hearing aids;
        (B) the term "public mobile services" means air-to-ground
      radiotelephone services, cellular radio telecommunications
      services, offshore radio, rural radio service, public land mobile
      telephone service, and other common carrier radio communication
      services covered by part 22 of title 47 of the Code of Federal
      Regulations;
        (C) the term "private radio services" means private land mobile
      radio services and other communications services characterized by
      the Commission in its rules as private radio services; and
        (D) the term "secure telephones" means telephones that are
      approved by the United States Government for the transmission of
      classified or sensitive voice communications.
    (c) Technical standards
      The Commission shall establish or approve such technical
    standards as are required to enforce this section.
    (d) Labeling of packaging materials for equipment
      The Commission shall establish such requirements for the labeling
    of packaging materials for equipment as are needed to provide
    adequate information to consumers on the compatibility between
    telephones and hearing aids.
    (e) Costs and benefits; encouragement of use of currently available
      technology
      In any rulemaking to implement the provisions of this section,
    the Commission shall specifically consider the costs and benefits
    to all telephone users, including persons with and without hearing
    impairments. The Commission shall ensure that regulations adopted
    to implement this section encourage the use of currently available
    technology and do not discourage or impair the development of
    improved technology.
    (f) Periodic review of regulations; retrofitting
      The Commission shall periodically review the regulations
    established pursuant to this section. Except for coin-operated
    telephones and telephones provided for emergency use, the
    Commission may not require the retrofitting of equipment to achieve
    the purposes of this section.
    (g) Recovery of reasonable and prudent costs
      Any common carrier or connecting carrier may provide specialized
    terminal equipment needed by persons whose hearing, speech, vision,
    or mobility is impaired. The State commission may allow the carrier
    to recover in its tariffs for regulated service reasonable and
    prudent costs not charged directly to users of such equipment.
    (h) State enforcement
      The Commission shall delegate to each State commission the
    authority to enforce within such State compliance with the specific
    regulations that the Commission issues under subsections (a) and
    (b) of this section, conditioned upon the adoption and enforcement
    of such regulations by the State commission.

      impairments, require telephone reception by means of hearing aids
      with induction coils, or other inductive receptors;
        "(3) the lack of technical standards ensuring compatibility

    Sec. 613. Video programming accessibility

-STATUTE-
    (a) Commission inquiry
      Within 180 days after February 8, 1996, the Federal
    Communications Commission shall complete an inquiry to ascertain
    the level at which video programming is closed captioned. Such
    inquiry shall examine the extent to which existing or previously
    published programming is closed captioned, the size of the video
    programming provider or programming owner providing closed
    captioning, the size of the market served, the relative audience
    shares achieved, or any other related factors. The Commission shall
    submit to the Congress a report on the results of such inquiry.
    (b) Accountability criteria
      Within 18 months after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall
    prescribe such regulations as are necessary to implement this
    section. Such regulations shall ensure that - 
        (1) video programming first published or exhibited after the
      effective date of such regulations is fully accessible through
      the provision of closed captions, except as provided in
      subsection (d) of this section; and
        (2) video programming providers or owners maximize the
      accessibility of video programming first published or exhibited
      prior to the effective date of such regulations through the
      provision of closed captions, except as provided in subsection
      (d) of this section.
    (c) Deadlines for captioning
      Such regulations shall include an appropriate schedule of
    deadlines for the provision of closed captioning of video
    programming.
    (d) Exemptions
      Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section - 
        (1) the Commission may exempt by regulation programs, classes
      of programs, or services for which the Commission has determined
      that the provision of closed captioning would be economically
      burdensome to the provider or owner of such programming;
        (2) a provider of video programming or the owner of any program
      carried by the provider shall not be obligated to supply closed
      captions if such action would be inconsistent with contracts in
      effect on February 8, 1996, except that nothing in this section
      shall be construed to relieve a video programming provider of its
      obligations to provide services required by Federal law; and
        (3) a provider of video programming or program owner may
      petition the Commission for an exemption from the requirements of
      this section, and the Commission may grant such petition upon a
      showing that the requirements contained in this section would
      result in an undue burden.
    (e) Undue burden
      The term "undue burden" means significant difficulty or expense.
    In determining whether the closed captions necessary to comply with
    the requirements of this paragraph would result in an undue
    economic burden, the factors to be considered include - 
        (1) the nature and cost of the closed captions for the
      programming;
        (2) the impact on the operation of the provider or program
      owner;
        (3) the financial resources of the provider or program owner;
      and
        (4) the type of operations of the provider or program owner.
    (f) Video descriptions inquiry
      Within 6 months after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall
    commence an inquiry to examine the use of video descriptions on
    video programming in order to ensure the accessibility of video
    programming to persons with visual impairments, and report to
    Congress on its findings. The Commission's report shall assess
    appropriate methods and schedules for phasing video descriptions
    into the marketplace, technical and quality standards for video
    descriptions, a definition of programming for which video
    descriptions would apply, and other technical and legal issues that
    the Commission deems appropriate.
    (g) Video description
      For purposes of this section, "video description" means the
    insertion of audio narrated descriptions of a television program's
    key visual elements into natural pauses between the program's
    dialogue.
    (h) Private rights of actions prohibited
      Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize any
    private right of action to enforce any requirement of this section
    or any regulation thereunder. The Commission shall have exclusive
    jurisdiction with respect to any complaint under this section.

    that:
      "(a) Findings. - The Congress finds that - 
        "(1) the establishment and maintenance of an end-to-end
      communications infrastructure among members of the public,
      emergency safety, fire service and law enforcement officials,
      emergency dispatch providers, transportation officials, and
      hospital emergency and trauma care facilities will reduce
      response times for the delivery of emergency care, assist in
      delivering appropriate care, and thereby prevent fatalities,
      substantially reduce the severity and extent of injuries, reduce
      time lost from work, and save thousands of lives and billions of
      dollars in health care costs;
        "(2) the rapid, efficient deployment of emergency
      telecommunications service requires statewide coordination of the
      efforts of local public safety, fire service and law enforcement
      officials, emergency dispatch providers, and transportation
      officials; the establishment of sources of adequate funding for
      carrier and public safety, fire service and law enforcement
      agency technology development and deployment; the coordination
      and integration of emergency communications with traffic control
      and management systems and the designation of 9-1-1 as the number
      to call in emergencies throughout the Nation;
        "(3) emerging technologies can be a critical component of the
      end-to-end communications infrastructure connecting the public
      with emergency medical service providers and emergency dispatch
      providers, public safety, fire service and law enforcement
      officials, and hospital emergency and trauma care facilities, to
      reduce emergency response times and provide appropriate care;
        "(4) improved public safety remains an important public health
      objective of Federal, State, and local governments and
      substantially facilitates interstate and foreign commerce;
        "(5) emergency care systems, particularly in rural areas of the
      Nation, will improve with the enabling of prompt notification of
      emergency services when motor vehicle crashes occur; and
        "(6) the construction and operation of seamless, ubiquitous,
      and reliable wireless telecommunications systems promote public
      safety and provide immediate and critical communications links
      among members of the public; emergency medical service providers
      and emergency dispatch providers; public safety, fire service and
      law enforcement officials; transportation officials, and hospital
      emergency and trauma care facilities.
      "(b) Purpose. - The purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 1999
    Amendments note set out under section 609 of this title] is to
    encourage and facilitate the prompt deployment throughout the
    United States of a seamless, ubiquitous, and reliable end-to-end
    infrastructure for communications, including wireless
    communications, to meet the Nation's public safety and other
    communications needs."

-HEAD-
    Sec. 615a-1. Duty to provide 9-1-1 and enhanced 9-1-1 service

-STATUTE-
    (a) Duties
      It shall be the duty of each IP-enabled voice service provider to
    provide 9-1-1 service and enhanced 9-1-1 service to its subscribers
    in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Communications
    Commission, as in effect on the date of enactment of the New and
    Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008 and as such
    requirements may be modified by the Commission from time to time.
    (b) Parity for IP-enabled voice service providers
      An IP-enabled voice service provider that seeks capabilities to
    provide 9-1-1 and enhanced 9-1-1 service from an entity with
    ownership or control over such capabilities, to comply with its
    obligations under subsection (a), shall, for the exclusive purpose
    of complying with such obligations, have a right of access to such
    capabilities, including interconnection, to provide 9-1-1 and
    enhanced 9-1-1 service on the same rates, terms, and conditions
    that are provided to a provider of commercial mobile service (as
    such term is defined in section 332(d) of the Communications Act of
    1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(d))), subject to such regulations as the
    Commission prescribes under subsection (c).
    (c) Regulations
      The Commission - 
        (1) within 90 days after the date of enactment of the New and
      Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008, shall issue
      regulations implementing such Act, including regulations that - 
          (A) ensure that IP-enabled voice service providers have the
        ability to exercise their rights under subsection (b);
          (B) take into account any technical, network security, or
        information privacy requirements that are specific to IP-
        enabled voice services; and
          (C) provide, with respect to any capabilities that are not
        required to be made available to a commercial mobile service
        provider but that the Commission determines under subparagraph
        (B) of this paragraph or paragraph (3) are necessary for an IP-
        enabled voice service provider to comply with its obligations
        under subsection (a), that such capabilities shall be available
        at the same rates, terms, and conditions as would apply if such
        capabilities were made available to a commercial mobile service
        provider;

        (2) shall require IP-enabled voice service providers to which
      the regulations apply to register with the Commission and to
      establish a point of contact for public safety and government
      officials relative to 9-1-1 and enhanced 9-1-1 service and
      access; and
        (3) may modify such regulations from time to time, as
      necessitated by changes in the market or technology, to ensure
      the ability of an IP-enabled voice service provider to comply
      with its obligations under subsection (a) and to exercise its
      rights under subsection (b).
    (d) Delegation of enforcement to State commissions
      The Commission may delegate authority to enforce the regulations
    issued under subsection (c) to State commissions or other State or
    local agencies or programs with jurisdiction over emergency
    communications. Nothing in this section is intended to alter the
    authority of State commissions or other State or local agencies
    with jurisdiction over emergency communications, provided that the
    exercise of such authority is not inconsistent with Federal law or
    Commission requirements.
    (e) Implementation
      (1) Limitation
        Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the
      Commission to issue regulations that require or impose a specific
      technology or technological standard.
      (2) Enforcement
        The Commission shall enforce this section as if this section
      was a part of the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 151 et
      seq.]. For purposes of this section, any violations of this
      section, or any regulations promulgated under this section, shall
      be considered to be a violation of the Communications Act of 1934
      or a regulation promulgated under that Act, respectively.
    (f) State authority over fees
      (1) Authority
        Nothing in this Act, the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C.
      151 et seq.), the New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement
      Act of 2008, or any Commission regulation or order shall prevent
      the imposition and collection of a fee or charge applicable to
      commercial mobile services or IP-enabled voice services
      specifically designated by a State, political subdivision
      thereof, Indian tribe, or village or regional corporation serving
      a region established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims
      Settlement Act, as amended (85 Stat. 688) [43 U.S.C. 1601 et
      seq.] (!1) for the support or implementation of 9-1-1 or enhanced
      9-1-1 services, provided that the fee or charge is obligated or
      expended only in support of 9-1-1 and enhanced 9-1-1 services, or
      enhancements of such services, as specified in the provision of
      State or local law adopting the fee or charge. For each class of
      subscribers to IP-enabled voice services, the fee or charge may
      not exceed the amount of any such fee or charge applicable to the
      same class of subscribers to telecommunications services.

      (2) Fee accountability report
        To ensure efficiency, transparency, and accountability in the
      collection and expenditure of a fee or charge for the support or
      implementation of 9-1-1 or enhanced 9-1-1 services, the
      Commission shall submit a report within 1 year after the date of
      enactment of the New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement
      Act of 2008, and annually thereafter, to the Committee on
      Commerce, Science and Transportation of the Senate and the
      Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives
      detailing the status in each State of the collection and
      distribution of such fees or charges, and including findings on
      the amount of revenues obligated or expended by each State or
      political subdivision thereof for any purpose other than the
      purpose for which any such fees or charges are specified.
    (g) Availability of PSAP information
      The Commission may compile a list of public safety answering
    point contact information, contact information for providers of
    selective routers, testing procedures, classes and types of
    services supported by public safety answering points, and other
    information concerning 9-1-1 and enhanced 9-1-1 elements, for the
    purpose of assisting IP-enabled voice service providers in
    complying with this section, and may make any portion of such
    information available to telecommunications carriers, wireless
    carriers, IP-enabled voice service providers, other emergency
    service providers, or the vendors to or agents of any such carriers
    or providers, if such availability would improve public safety.
    (h) Development of standards
      The Commission shall work cooperatively with public safety
    organizations, industry participants, and the E-911 Implementation
    Coordination Office to develop best practices that promote
    consistency, where appropriate, including procedures for - 
        (1) defining geographic coverage areas for public safety
      answering points;
        (2) defining network diversity requirements for delivery of IP-
      enabled 9-1-1 and enhanced 9-1-1 calls;
        (3) call-handling in the event of call overflow or network
      outages;
        (4) public safety answering point certification and testing
      requirements;
        (5) validation procedures for inputting and updating location
      information in relevant databases; and
        (6) the format for delivering address information to public
      safety answering points.
    (i) Rule of construction
      Nothing in the New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act
    of 2008 shall be construed as altering, delaying, or otherwise
    limiting the ability of the Commission to enforce the Federal
    actions taken or rules adopted obligating an IP-enabled voice
    service provider to provide 9-1-1 or enhanced 9-1-1 service as of
    the date of enactment of the New and Emerging Technologies 911
    Improvement Act of 2008.

    provided that:
      "(a) Policy. - The Congress declares that it is the policy of the
    United States - 
        "(1) as a party to the International Telecommunications
      Satellite Organization (hereafter in this section referred to as
      'Intelsat'), to foster and support the global commercial
      communications satellite system owned and operated by Intelsat;
        "(2) to make available to consumers a variety of communications
      satellite services utilizing the space segment facilities of
      Intelsat and any additional such facilities which are found to be
      in the national interest and which - 
          "(A) are technically compatible with the use of the radio
        frequency spectrum and orbital space by the existing or planned
        Intelsat space segment, and
          "(B) avoid significant economic harm to the global system of
        Intelsat; and
        "(3) to authorize use and operation of any additional space
      segment facilities only if the obligations of the United States
      under article XIV(d) of the Intelsat Agreement have been met.
      "(b) Preconditions for Intelsat Consultation. - Before consulting
    with Intelsat for purposes of coordination of any separate
    international telecommunications satellite system under article
    XIV(d) of the Intelsat Agreement, the Secretary of State shall - 
        "(1) in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, ensure
      that any proposed separate international satellite
      telecommunications system comply with the Executive Branch
      conditions established pursuant to the Presidential Determination
      No. 85-2 [49 F.R. 46987]; and
        "(2) ensure that one or more foreign authorities have
      authorized the use of such system consistent with such
      conditions.
      "(c) Amendment of Intelsat Agreement. - (1) The Secretary of
    State shall consult with the United States signatory to Intelsat
    and the Secretary of Commerce regarding the appropriate scope and
    character of a modification to article V(d) of the Intelsat
    Agreement which would permit Intelsat to establish cost-based rates
    for individual traffic routes, as exceptional circumstances
    warrant, paying particular attention to the need for avoiding
    significant economic harm to the global system of Intelsat as well
    as United States national and foreign policy interests.
      "(2)(A) To ensure that rates established by Intelsat for such
    routes are cost-based, the Secretary of State, in consultation with
    the Secretary of Commerce and the Chairman of the Federal
    Communications Commission, shall instruct the United States
    signatory to Intelsat to ensure that sufficient documentation,
    including documentation regarding revenues and costs, is provided
    by Intelsat so as to verify that such rates are in fact cost-based.
      "(B) To the maximum extent possible, such documenation
    [documentation] will be made available to interested parties on a
    timely basis.
      "(3) Pursuant to the consultation under paragraph (1) and taking
    the steps prescribed in paragraph (2) to provide documentation, the
    United States shall support an appropriate modification to article
    V(d) of the Intelsat Agreement to accomplish the purpose described
    in paragraph (1).
      "(d) Congressional Consultation. - In the event that, after
    United States consultation with Intelsat for the purposes of
    coordination under article XIV(d) of the Intelsat Agreement for the
    establishment of a separate international telecommunications
    satellite system, the Assembly of Parties of Intelsat fails to
    recommend such a separate system, and the President determines to
    pursue the establishment of a separate system notwithstanding the
    Assembly's failure to approve such system, the Secretary of State,
    after consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall submit to
    the Congress a detailed report which shall set forth - 
        "(1) the foreign policy reasons for the President's
      determination, and
        "(2) a plan for minimizing any negative effects of the
      President's action on Intelsat and on United States foreign
      policy interests.
      "(e) Notification to Federal Communications Commission. - In the
    event the Secretary of State submits a report under subsection (d),
    the Secretary, 60 calendar days after the receipt by the Congress
    of such report, shall notify the Federal Communications Commission
    as to whether the United States obligations under article XIV(d) of
    the Intelsat Agreement have been met.
      "(f) Implementation. - In implementing the provisions of this
    section, the Secretary of State shall act in accordance with
    Executive order 12046 [set out under section 305 of this title].
      "(g) Definition. - For the purposes of this section, the term
    'separate international telecommunications satellite system' or
    'separate system' means a system of one or more telecommunications
    satellites separate from the Intelsat space segment which is
    established to provide international telecommunications services
    between points within the United States and points outside the
    United States, except that such term shall not include any
    satellite or system of satellites established - 
        "(1) primarily for domestic telecommunications purposes and
      which incidentally provides services on an ancillary basis to
      points outside the jurisdiction of the United States but within
      the western hemisphere, or
        "(2) solely for unique governmental purposes."

-HEAD-
    Sec. 761. Federal Communications Commission licensing

-STATUTE-
    (a) Licensing for separated entities
      (1) Competition test
        The Commission may not issue a license or construction permit
      to any separated entity, or renew or permit the assignment or use
      of any such license or permit, or authorize the use by any entity
      subject to United States jurisdiction of any space segment owned,
      leased, or operated by any separated entity, unless the
      Commission determines that such issuance, renewal, assignment, or
      use will not harm competition in the telecommunications market of
      the United States. If the Commission does not make such a
      determination, it shall deny or revoke authority to use space
      segment owned, leased, or operated by the separated entity to
      provide services to, from, or within the United States.
      (2) Criteria for competition test
        In making the determination required by paragraph (1), the
      Commission shall use the licensing criteria in sections 763 and
      763b (!1) of this title, and shall not make such a determination
      unless the Commission determines that the privatization of any
      separated entity is consistent with such criteria.

    (b) Licensing for INTELSAT, Inmarsat, and successor entities
      (1) Competition test
        (A) In general
          In considering the application of INTELSAT, Inmarsat, or
        their successor entities for a license or construction permit,
        or for the renewal or assignment or use of any such license or
        permit, or in considering the request of any entity subject to
        United States jurisdiction for authorization to use any space
        segment owned, leased, or operated by INTELSAT, Inmarsat, or
        their successor entities, to provide non-core services to,
        from, or within the United States, the Commission shall
        determine whether - 
            (i) after April 1, 2001, in the case of INTELSAT and its
          successor entities, INTELSAT and any successor entities have
          been privatized in a manner that will harm competition in the
          telecommunications markets of the United States; or
            (ii) after April 1, 2000, in the case of Inmarsat and its
          successor entities, Inmarsat and any successor entities have
          been privatized in a manner that will harm competition in the
          telecommunications markets of the United States.
        (B) Consequences of determination
          If the Commission determines that such competition will be
        harmed or that grant of such application or request for
        authority is not otherwise in the public interest, the
        Commission shall limit through conditions or deny such
        application or request, and limit or revoke previous
        authorizations to provide non-core services to, from, or within
        the United States. After due notice and opportunity for
        comment, the Commission shall apply the same limitations,
        restrictions, and conditions to all entities subject to United
        States jurisdiction using space segment owned, leased, or
        operated by INTELSAT, Inmarsat, or their successor entities.
        (C) National security, law enforcement, and public safety
          The Commission shall not impose any limitation, condition, or
        restriction under subparagraph (B) in a manner that will, or is
        reasonably likely to, result in limitation, denial, or
        revocation of authority for non-core services that are used by
        and required for a national security agency or law enforcement
        department or agency of the United States, or used by and
        required for, and otherwise in the public interest, any other
        Department or Agency of the United States to protect the health
        and safety of the public. Such services may be obtained by the
        United States directly from INTELSAT, Inmarsat, or a successor
        entity, or indirectly through COMSAT, or authorized carriers or
        distributors of the successor entity.
        (D) Rule of construction
          Nothing in this subsection is intended to preclude the
        Commission from acting upon applications of INTELSAT, Inmarsat,
        or their successor entities prior to the latest date set out in
        section 763(5)(A) of this title, including such actions as may
        be necessary for the United States to become the licensing
        jurisdiction for INTELSAT, but the Commission shall condition a
        grant of authority pursuant to this subsection upon compliance
        with sections 763 and 763a of this title.
      (2) Criteria for competition test
        In making the determination required by paragraph (1), the
      Commission shall use the licensing criteria in sections 763,
      763a, and 763c (!1) of this title, and shall determine that
      competition in the telecommunications markets of the United
      States will be harmed unless the Commission finds that the
      privatization referred to in paragraph (1) is consistent with
      such criteria.
      (3) Clarification: competitive safeguards
        In making its licensing decisions under this subsection, the
      Commission shall consider whether users of non-core services
      provided by INTELSAT or Inmarsat or successor or separated
      entities are able to obtain non-core services from providers
      offering services other than through INTELSAT or Inmarsat or
      successor or separated entities, at competitive rates, terms, or
      conditions. Such consideration shall also include whether such
      licensing decisions would require users to replace equipment at
      substantial costs prior to the termination of its design life. In
      making its licensing decisions, the Commission shall also
      consider whether competitive alternatives in individual markets
      do not exist because they have been foreclosed due to
      anticompetitive actions undertaken by or resulting from the
      INTELSAT or Inmarsat systems. Such licensing decisions shall be
      made in a manner which facilitates achieving the purposes and
      goals in this subchapter and shall be subject to notice and
      comment.
    (c) Additional considerations in determinations
      In making its determinations and licensing decisions under
    subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the Commission shall
    construe such subsections in a manner consistent with the United
    States obligations and commitments for satellite services under the
    Fourth Protocol to the General Agreement on Trade in Services.
    (d) Independent facilities competition
      Nothing in this section shall be construed as precluding COMSAT
    from investing in or owning satellites or other facilities
    independent from INTELSAT and Inmarsat, and successor or separated
    entities, or from providing services through reselling capacity
    over the facilities of satellite systems independent from INTELSAT
    and Inmarsat, and successor or separated entities. This subsection
    shall not be construed as restricting the types of contracts which
    can be executed or services which may be provided by COMSAT over
    the independent satellites or facilities described in this
    subsection.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 763. General criteria to ensure a pro-competitive
      privatization of INTELSAT and Inmarsat

-STATUTE-
      The President and the Commission shall secure a pro-competitive
    privatization of INTELSAT and Inmarsat that meets the criteria set
    forth in this section and sections 763a through 763c (!1) of this
    title. In securing such privatizations, the following criteria
    shall be applied as licensing criteria for purposes of part A of
    this subchapter:

      (1) Dates for privatization
        Privatization shall be obtained in accordance with the criteria
      of this subchapter of - 
          (A) INTELSAT as soon as practicable, but no later than April
        1, 2001; and
          (B) Inmarsat as soon as practicable, but no later than July
        1, 2000.
      (2) Independence
        The privatized successor entities and separated entities of
      INTELSAT and Inmarsat shall operate as independent commercial
      entities, and have a pro-competitive ownership structure. The
      successor entities and separated entities of INTELSAT and
      Inmarsat shall conduct an initial public offering in accordance
      with paragraph (5) to achieve such independence. Such offering
      shall substantially dilute the aggregate ownership of such
      entities by such signatories or former signatories. In
      determining whether a public offering attains such substantial
      dilution, the Commission shall take into account the purposes and
      intent, privatization criteria, and other provisions of this
      subchapter, as well as market conditions. No intergovernmental
      organization, including INTELSAT or Inmarsat, shall have - 
          (A) an ownership interest in INTELSAT or the successor or
        separated entities of INTELSAT; or
          (B) more than minimal ownership interest in Inmarsat or the
        successor or separated entities of Inmarsat.
      (3) Termination of privileges and immunities
        The preferential treatment of INTELSAT and Inmarsat shall not
      be extended to any successor entity or separated entity of
      INTELSAT or Inmarsat. Such preferential treatment includes - 
          (A) privileged or immune treatment by national governments;
          (B) privileges or immunities or other competitive advantages
        of the type accorded INTELSAT and Inmarsat and their
        signatories through the terms and operation of the INTELSAT
        Agreement and the associated Headquarters Agreement and the
        Inmarsat Convention; and
          (C) preferential access to orbital locations.

      Access to new, or renewal of access to, orbital locations shall
      be subject to the legal or regulatory processes of a national
      government that applies due diligence requirements intended to
      prevent the warehousing of orbital locations.
      (4) Prevention of expansion during transition
        During the transition period prior to privatization under this
      subchapter, INTELSAT and Inmarsat shall be precluded from
      expanding into additional services.
      (5) Conversion to stock corporations
        Any successor entity or separated entity created out of
      INTELSAT or Inmarsat shall be a national corporation or similar
      accepted commercial structure, subject to the laws of the nation
      in which incorporated, as follows:
          (A) An initial public offering of securities of any successor
        entity or separated entity - 
            (i) shall be conducted, for the successor entities of
          INTELSAT, on or about June 30, 2005, except that the
          Commission may extend this deadline in consideration of
          market conditions and relevant business factors relating to
          the timing of an initial public offering, but such extensions
          shall not permit such offering to be conducted later than
          December 31, 2005; and
            (ii) shall be conducted, for the successor entities of
          Inmarsat, not later than June 30, 2005, except that the
          Commission may extend this deadline to not later than
          December 31, 2004.

          (B) The shares of any successor entities and separated
        entities shall be listed for trading on one or more major stock
        exchanges with transparent and effective securities regulation.
          (C) A majority of the members of the board of directors of
        any successor entity or separated entity shall not be
        directors, employees, officers, or managers or otherwise serve
        as representatives of any signatory or former signatory. No
        member of the board of directors of any successor or separated
        entity shall be a director, employee, officer or manager of any
        intergovernmental organization remaining after the
        privatization.
          (D) Any successor entity or separated entity shall - 
            (i) have a board of directors with a fiduciary obligation;
            (ii) have no officers or managers who are officers or
          managers of any signatories or former signatories; and
            (iii) have no directors, officers, or managers who hold
          such positions in any intergovernmental organization.

          (E) Any transactions or other relationships between or among
        any successor entity, separated entity, INTELSAT, or Inmarsat
        shall be conducted on an arm's length basis.
          (F) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B), a successor
        entity may be deemed a national corporation and may forgo an
        initial public offering and public securities listing and still
        achieve the purposes of this section if - 
            (i) the successor entity certifies to the Commission that -
          
              (I) the successor entity has achieved substantial
            dilution of the aggregate amount of signatory or former
            signatory financial interest in such entity;
              (II) any signatories and former signatories that retain a
            financial interest in such successor entity do not possess,
            together or individually, effective control of such
            successor entity; and
              (III) no intergovernmental organization has any ownership
            interest in a successor entity of INTELSAT or more than a
            minimal ownership interest in a successor entity of
            Inmarsat;

            (ii) the successor entity provides such financial and other
          information to the Commission as the Commission may require
          to verify such certification; and
            (iii) the Commission determines, after notice and comment,
          that the successor entity is in compliance with such
          certification.

          (G) For purposes of subparagraph (F), the term "substantial
        dilution" means that a majority of the financial interests in
        the successor entity is no longer held or controlled, directly
        or indirectly, by signatories or former signatories.
      (6) Regulatory treatment
        Any successor entity or separated entity created after March
      17, 2000, shall apply through the appropriate national licensing
      authorities for international frequency assignments and
      associated orbital registrations for all satellites.
      (7) Competition policies in domiciliary country
        Any successor entity or separated entity shall be subject to
      the jurisdiction of a nation or nations that - 
          (A) have effective laws and regulations that secure
        competition in telecommunications services;
          (B) are signatories of the World Trade Organization Basic
        Telecommunications Services Agreement; and
          (C) have a schedule of commitments in such Agreement that
        includes non-discriminatory market access to their satellite
        markets.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Access permitted
      Beginning on March 17, 2000, users or providers of
    telecommunications services shall be permitted to obtain direct
    access to INTELSAT telecommunications services and space segment
    capacity through purchases of such capacity or services from
    INTELSAT. Such direct access shall be at the level commonly
    referred to by INTELSAT, on March 17, 2000, as "Level III".
    (b) Rulemaking
      Within 180 days after March 17, 2000, the Commission shall
    complete a rulemaking, with notice and opportunity for submission
    of comment by interested persons, to determine if users or
    providers of telecommunications services have sufficient
    opportunity to access INTELSAT space segment capacity directly from
    INTELSAT to meet their service or capacity requirements. If the
    Commission determines that such opportunity to access does not
    exist, the Commission shall take appropriate action to facilitate
    such direct access pursuant to its authority under this chapter and
    the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.]. The
    Commission shall take such steps as may be necessary to prevent the
    circumvention of the intent of this section.
    (c) Contract preservation
      Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the
    abrogation or modification of any contract.

    Sec. 765a. Signatory role

-STATUTE-
    (a) Limitations on signatories
      (1) National security limitations
        The Federal Communications Commission, after a public interest
      determination, in consultation with the executive branch, may
      restrict foreign ownership of a United States signatory if the
      Commission determines that not to do so would constitute a threat
      to national security.
      (2) No signatories required
        The United States Government shall not require signatories to
      represent the United States in INTELSAT or Inmarsat or in any
      successor entities after a pro-competitive privatization is
      achieved consistent with sections 763, 763a, and 763c (!1) of
      this title.

    (b) Clarification of privileges and immunities of COMSAT
      (1) Generally not immunized
        Notwithstanding any other law or executive agreement, COMSAT
      shall not be entitled to any privileges or immunities under the
      laws of the United States or any State on the basis of its status
      as a signatory of INTELSAT or Inmarsat.
      (2) Limited immunity
        COMSAT or any successor in interest shall not be liable for
      action taken by it in carrying out the specific, written
      instruction of the United States issued in connection with its
      relationships and activities with foreign governments,
      international entities, and the intergovernmental satellite
      organizations.
      (3) No joint or several liability
        If COMSAT is found liable for any action taken in its status as
      a signatory or a representative of the party to INTELSAT, any
      such liability shall be limited to the portion of the judgment
      that corresponds to COMSAT's percentage of the ownership of
      INTELSAT at the time the activity began which lead to the
      liability.
      (4) Provisions prospective
        Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to liability for any
      action taken by COMSAT before March 17, 2000.
    (c) Parity of treatment
      Notwithstanding any other law or executive agreement, the
    Commission shall have the authority to impose similar regulatory
    fees on the United States signatory which it imposes on other
    entities providing similar services.

    personal, from any entity for the purpose of furthering the
    authorized functions of the NTIA if such solicitation would create
    a conflict of interest or an appearance of a conflict of interest.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 923. Identification of reallocable frequencies

-STATUTE-
    (a) Identification required
      The Secretary shall, within 18 months after August 10, 1993, and
    within 6 months after August 5, 1997, prepare and submit to the
    President and the Congress a report identifying and recommending
    for reallocation bands of frequencies - 
        (1) that are allocated on a primary basis for Federal
      Government use;
        (2) that are not required for the present or identifiable
      future needs of the Federal Government;
        (3) that can feasibly be made available, as of the date of
      submission of the report or at any time during the next 15 years,
      for use under the 1934 Act [47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.] (other than
      for Federal Government stations under section 305 of the 1934 Act
      [47 U.S.C. 305]);
        (4) the transfer of which (from Federal Government use) will
      not result in costs to the Federal Government, or losses of
      services or benefits to the public, that are excessive in
      relation to the benefits to the public that may be provided by
      non-Federal licensees; and
        (5) that are most likely to have the greatest potential for
      productive uses and public benefits under the 1934 Act [47 U.S.C.
      151 et seq.] if allocated for non-Federal use.
    (b) Minimum amount of spectrum recommended
      (1) Initial reallocation report
        In accordance with the provisions of this section, the
      Secretary shall recommend for reallocation in the initial report
      required by subsection (a) of this section, for use other than by
      Federal Government stations under section 305 of the 1934 Act (47
      U.S.C. 305), bands of frequencies that in the aggregate span not
      less than 200 megahertz, that are located below 5 gigahertz, and
      that meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (1) through (5) of
      subsection (a) of this section. Such bands of frequencies shall
      include bands of frequencies, located below 3 gigahertz, that
      span in the aggregate not less than 100 megahertz.
      (2) Mixed uses permitted to be counted
        Bands of frequencies which a report of the Secretary under
      subsection (a) or (d)(1) of this section recommends be partially
      retained for use by Federal Government stations, but which are
      also recommended to be reallocated to be made available under the
      1934 Act [47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.] for use by non-Federal stations,
      may be counted toward the minimum spectrum required by paragraph
      (1) or (3) of this subsection, except that - 
          (A) the bands of frequencies counted under this paragraph may
        not count toward more than one-half of the minimums required by
        paragraph (1) or (3) of this subsection;
          (B) a band of frequencies may not be counted under this
        paragraph unless the assignments of the band to Federal
        Government stations under section 305 of the 1934 Act (47
        U.S.C. 305) are limited by geographic area, by time, or by
        other means so as to guarantee that the potential use to be
        made by such Federal Government stations is substantially less
        (as measured by geographic area, time, or otherwise) than the
        potential use to be made by non-Federal stations; and
          (C) the operational sharing permitted under this paragraph
        shall be subject to the interference regulations prescribed by
        the Commission pursuant to section 305(a) of the 1934 Act [47
        U.S.C. 305(a)] and to coordination procedures that the
        Commission and the Secretary shall jointly establish and
        implement to ensure against harmful interference.
      (3) Second reallocation report
        In accordance with the provisions of this section, the
      Secretary shall recommend for reallocation in the second report
      required by subsection (a) of this section, for use other than by
      Federal Government stations under section 305 of the 1934 Act (47
      U.S.C. 305), a band or bands of frequencies that - 
          (A) in the aggregate span not less than 12 megahertz;
          (B) are located below 3 gigahertz; and
          (C) meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (1) through (5)
        of subsection (a) of this section.
    (c) Criteria for identification
      (1) Needs of the Federal Government
        In determining whether a band of frequencies meets the criteria
      specified in subsection (a)(2) of this section, the Secretary
      shall - 
          (A) consider whether the band of frequencies is used to
        provide a communications service that is or could be available
        from a commercial provider or other vendor;
          (B) seek to promote - 
            (i) the maximum practicable reliance on commercially
          available substitutes;
            (ii) the sharing of frequencies (as permitted under
          subsection (b)(2) of this section);
            (iii) the development and use of new communications
          technologies; and
            (iv) the use of nonradiating communications systems where
          practicable; and

          (C) seek to avoid - 
            (i) serious degradation of Federal Government services and
          operations;
            (ii) excessive costs to the Federal Government and users of
          Federal Government services; and
            (iii) excessive disruption of existing use of Federal
          Government frequencies by amateur radio licensees.
      (2) Feasibility of use
        In determining whether a frequency band meets the criteria
      specified in subsection (a)(3) of this section, the Secretary
      shall - 
          (A) assume that the frequency will be assigned by the
        Commission under section 303 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 303)
        within 15 years;
          (B) assume reasonable rates of scientific progress and growth
        of demand for telecommunications services;
          (C) seek to include frequencies which can be used to
        stimulate the development of new technologies; and
          (D) consider the immediate and recurring costs to reestablish
        services displaced by the reallocation of spectrum.
      (3) Analysis of benefits
        In determining whether a band of frequencies meets the criteria
      specified in subsection (a)(5) of this section, the Secretary
      shall consider - 
          (A) the extent to which equipment is or will be available
        that is capable of utilizing the band;
          (B) the proximity of frequencies that are already assigned
        for commercial or other non-Federal use;
          (C) the extent to which, in general, commercial users could
        share the frequency with amateur radio licensees; and
          (D) the activities of foreign governments in making
        frequencies available for experimentation or commercial
        assignments in order to support their domestic manufacturers of
        equipment.
      (4) Power agency frequencies
        (A) Applicability of criteria
          The criteria specified by subsection (a) of this section
        shall be deemed not to be met for any purpose under this
        subchapter with regard to any frequency assignment to, or any
        frequency assignment used by, a Federal power agency for the
        purpose of withdrawing that assignment.
        (B) Mixed use eligibility
          The frequencies assigned to any Federal power agency may only
        be eligible for mixed use under subsection (b)(2) of this
        section in geographically separate areas, but in those cases
        where a frequency is to be shared by an affected Federal power
        agency and a non-Federal user, such use by the non-Federal user
        shall not cause harmful interference to the affected Federal
        power agency or adversely affect the reliability of its power
        system.
        (C) "Federal power agency" defined
          As used in this paragraph, the term "Federal power agency"
        means the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Bonneville Power
        Administration, the Western Area Power Administration, the
        Southwestern Power Administration, the Southeastern Power
        Administration, or the Alaska Power Administration.
      (5) Limitation on reallocation
        None of the frequencies recommended for reallocation in the
      reports required by this subsection shall have been recommended,
      prior to August 10, 1993, for reallocation to non-Federal use by
      international agreement.
    (d) Procedure for identification of reallocable bands of
      frequencies
      (1) Submission of preliminary identification to Congress
        Within 6 months after August 10, 1993, the Secretary shall
      prepare, make publicly available, and submit to the President,
      the Congress, and the Commission a report which makes a
      preliminary identification of reallocable bands of frequencies
      which meet the criteria established by this section.
      (2) Public comment
        The Secretary shall provide interested persons with the
      opportunity to submit, within 90 days after the date of its
      publication, written comment on the preliminary report required
      by paragraph (1). The Secretary shall immediately transmit a copy
      of any such comment to the Commission.
      (3) Comment and recommendations from Commission
        The Commission shall, within 90 days after the conclusion of
      the period for comment provided pursuant to paragraph (2), submit
      to the Secretary the Commission's analysis of such comments and
      the Commission's recommendations for responses to such comments,
      together with such other comments and recommendations as the
      Commission deems appropriate.
      (4) Direct discussions
        The Secretary shall encourage and provide opportunity for
      direct discussions among commercial representatives and Federal
      Government users of the spectrum to aid the Secretary in
      determining which frequencies to recommend for reallocation. The
      Secretary shall provide notice to the public and the Commission
      of any such discussions, including the name or names of any
      businesses or other persons represented in such discussions. A
      representative of the Commission (and of the Secretary at the
      election of the Secretary) shall be permitted to attend any such
      discussions. The Secretary shall provide the public and the
      Commission with an opportunity to comment on the results of any
      such discussions prior to the submission of the initial report
      required by subsection (a) of this section.
    (e) Timetable for reallocation and limitation
      (1) Timetable required
        The Secretary shall, as part of the reports required by
      subsections (a) and (d)(1) of this section, include a timetable
      that recommends effective dates by which the President shall
      withdraw or limit assignments of the frequencies specified in
      such reports.
      (2) Expedited reallocation
        (A) Required reallocation
          The Secretary shall, as part of the report required by
        subsection (d)(1) of this section, specifically identify and
        recommend for immediate reallocation bands of frequencies that
        in the aggregate span not less than 50 megahertz, that meet the
        criteria described in subsection (a) of this section, and that
        can be made available for reallocation immediately upon
        issuance of the report required by subsection (d)(1) of this
        section. Such bands of frequencies shall include bands of
        frequencies, located below 3 gigahertz, that in the aggregate
        span not less than 25 megahertz.
        (B) Permitted reallocation
          The Secretary may, as part of such report, identify and
        recommend bands of frequencies for immediate reallocation for a
        mixed use pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of this section, but
        such bands of frequencies may not count toward the minimums
        required by subparagraph (A).
      (3) Delayed effective dates
        In setting the recommended delayed effective dates, the
      Secretary shall - 
          (A) consider the need to reallocate bands of frequencies as
        early as possible, taking into account the requirements of
        paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 925(b) of this title;
          (B) be based on the useful remaining life of equipment that
        has been purchased or contracted for to operate on identified
        frequencies;
          (C) consider the need to coordinate frequency use with other
        nations; and
          (D) take into account the relationship between the costs to
        the Federal Government of changing to different frequencies and
        the benefits that may be obtained from commercial and other non-
        Federal uses of the reassigned frequencies.
    (f) Additional reallocation report
      If the Secretary receives a notice from the Commission pursuant
    to section 3002(c)(5) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the
    Secretary shall prepare and submit to the President, the
    Commission, and the Congress a report recommending for reallocation
    for use other than by Federal Government stations under section 305
    of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 305), bands of frequencies that are
    suitable for the licensees identified in the Commission's notice.
    The Commission shall, not later than one year after receipt of such
    report, prepare, submit to the President and the Congress, and
    implement, a plan for the immediate allocation and assignment of
    such frequencies under the 1934 Act [47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.] to
    incumbent licensees described in the Commission's notice.
    (g) Relocation of Federal Government stations
      (1) Eligible Federal entities
        Any Federal entity that operates a Federal Government station
      assigned to a band of frequencies specified in paragraph (2) and
      that incurs relocation costs because of the reallocation of
      frequencies from Federal use to non-Federal use shall receive
      payment for such costs from the Spectrum Relocation Fund, in
      accordance with section 928 of this title. For purposes of this
      paragraph, Federal power agencies exempted under subsection
      (c)(4) of this section that choose to relocate from the
      frequencies identified for reallocation pursuant to subsection
      (a) of this section, are eligible to receive payment under this
      paragraph.
      (2) Eligible frequencies
        The bands of eligible frequencies for purposes of this section
      are as follows:
          (A) the 216-220 megahertz band, the 1432-1435 megahertz band,
        the 1710-1755 megahertz band, and the 2385-2390 megahertz band
        of frequencies; and
          (B) any other band of frequencies reallocated from Federal
        use to non-Federal use after January 1, 2003, that is assigned
        by competitive bidding pursuant to section 309(j) of the
        Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)), except for bands
        of frequencies previously identified by the National
        Telecommunications and Information Administration in the
        Spectrum Reallocation Final Report, NTIA Special Publication 95-
        32 (1995).
      (3) Definition of relocation costs
        For purposes of this subsection, the term "relocation costs"
      means the costs incurred by a Federal entity to achieve
      comparable capability of systems, regardless of whether that
      capability is achieved by relocating to a new frequency
      assignment or by utilizing an alternative technology. Such costs
      include - 
          (A) the costs of any modification or replacement of
        equipment, software, facilities, operating manuals, training
        costs, or regulations that are attributable to relocation;
          (B) the costs of all engineering, equipment, software, site
        acquisition and construction costs, as well as any legitimate
        and prudent transaction expense, including outside consultants,
        and reasonable additional costs incurred by the Federal entity
        that are attributable to relocation, including increased
        recurring costs associated with the replacement facilities;
          (C) the costs of engineering studies, economic analyses, or
        other expenses reasonably incurred in calculating the estimated
        relocation costs that are provided to the Commission pursuant
        to paragraph (4) of this subsection;
          (D) the one-time costs of any modification of equipment
        reasonably necessary to accommodate commercial use of such
        frequencies prior to the termination of the Federal entity's
        primary allocation or protected status, when the eligible
        frequencies as defined in paragraph (2) of this subsection are
        made available for private sector uses by competitive bidding
        and a Federal entity retains primary allocation or protected
        status in those frequencies for a period of time after the
        completion of the competitive bidding process; and
          (E) the costs associated with the accelerated replacement of
        systems and equipment if such acceleration is necessary to
        ensure the timely relocation of systems to a new frequency
        assignment.
      (4) Notice to Commission of estimated relocation costs
        (A) The Commission shall notify the NTIA at least 18 months
      prior to the commencement of any auction of eligible frequencies
      defined in paragraph (2). At least 6 months prior to the
      commencement of any such auction, the NTIA, on behalf of the
      Federal entities and after review by the Office of Management and
      Budget, shall notify the Commission of estimated relocation costs
      and timelines for such relocation.
        (B) Upon timely request of a Federal entity, the NTIA shall
      provide such entity with information regarding an alternative
      frequency assignment or assignments to which their
      radiocommunications operations could be relocated for purposes of
      calculating the estimated relocation costs and timelines to be
      submitted to the Commission pursuant to subparagraph (A).
        (C) To the extent practicable and consistent with national
      security considerations, the NTIA shall provide the information
      required by subparagraphs (A) and (B) by the geographic location
      of the Federal entities' facilities or systems and the frequency
      bands used by such facilities or systems.
      (5) Notice to congressional committees and GAO
        The NTIA shall, at the time of providing an initial estimate of
      relocation costs to the Commission under paragraph (4)(A), submit
      to (!1) Committees on Appropriations and Energy and Commerce of
      the House of Representatives for approval, to the Committees on
      Appropriations and Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the
      Senate for approval, and to the Comptroller General a copy of
      such estimate and the timelines for relocation. Unless
      disapproved within 30 days, the estimate shall be approved. If
      disapproved, the NTIA may resubmit a revised initial estimate.

      (6) Implementation of procedures
        The NTIA shall take such actions as necessary to ensure the
      timely relocation of Federal entities' spectrum-related
      operations from frequencies defined in paragraph (2) to
      frequencies or facilities of comparable capability. Upon a
      finding by the NTIA that a Federal entity has achieved comparable
      capability of systems by relocating to a new frequency assignment
      or by utilizing an alternative technology, the NTIA shall
      terminate the entity's authorization and notify the Commission
      that the entity's relocation has been completed. The NTIA shall
      also terminate such entity's authorization if the NTIA determines
      that the entity has unreasonably failed to comply with the
      timeline for relocation submitted by the Director of the Office
      of Management and Budget under section 928(d)(2)(B) of this
      title.
    (h) Federal action to expedite spectrum transfer
      Any Federal Government station which operates on electromagnetic
    spectrum that has been identified in any reallocation report under
    this section shall, to the maximum extent practicable through the
    use of the authority granted under subsection (g) of this section
    and any other applicable provision of law, take action to relocate
    its spectrum use to other frequencies that are reserved for Federal
    use or to consolidate its spectrum use with other Federal
    Government stations in a manner that maximizes the spectrum
    available for non-Federal use.
    (i) "Federal entity" defined
      For purposes of this section, the term "Federal entity" means any
    department, agency, or other instrumentality of the Federal
    Government that utilizes a Government station license obtained
    under section 305 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 305).

    Sec. 924. Withdrawal or limitation of assignment to Federal
      Government stations

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      The President shall - 
        (1) within 6 months after receipt of a report by the Secretary
      under subsection (a), (d)(1), or (f) of section 923 of this
      title, withdraw the assignment to a Federal Government station of
      any frequency which the report recommends for immediate
      reallocation;
        (2) within any such 6-month period, limit the assignment to a
      Federal Government station of any frequency which the report
      recommends be made immediately available for mixed use under
      section 923(b)(2) of this title;
        (3) by the delayed effective date recommended by the Secretary
      under section 923(e) of this title (except as provided in
      subsection (b)(4) of this section), withdraw or limit the
      assignment to a Federal Government station of any frequency which
      the report recommends be reallocated or made available for mixed
      use on such delayed effective date;
        (4) assign or reassign other frequencies to Federal Government
      stations as necessary to adjust to such withdrawal or limitation
      of assignments; and
        (5) transmit a notice and description to the Commission and
      each House of Congress of the actions taken under this
      subsection.
    (b) Exceptions
      (1) Authority to substitute
        If the President determines that a circumstance described in
      paragraph (2) exists, the President - 
          (A) may substitute an alternative frequency or frequencies
        for the frequency that is subject to such determination and
        withdraw (or limit) the assignment of that alternative
        frequency in the manner required by subsection (a) of this
        section; and
          (B) shall submit a statement of the reasons for taking the
        action described in subparagraph (A) to the Commission,
        Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of
        Representatives, and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
        Transportation of the Senate.
      (2) Grounds for substitution
        For purposes of paragraph (1), the following circumstances are
      described in this paragraph:
          (A) the reassignment would seriously jeopardize the national
        defense interests of the United States;
          (B) the frequency proposed for reassignment is uniquely
        suited to meeting important governmental needs;
          (C) the reassignment would seriously jeopardize public health
        or safety;
          (D) the reassignment will result in costs to the Federal
        Government that are excessive in relation to the benefits that
        may be obtained from commercial or other non-Federal uses of
        the reassigned frequency; or
          (E) the reassignment will disrupt the existing use of a
        Federal Government band of frequencies by amateur radio
        licensees.
      (3) Criteria for substituted frequencies
        For purposes of paragraph (1), a frequency may not be
      substituted for a frequency identified and recommended by the
      report of the Secretary under section 923(a) of this title unless
      the substituted frequency also meets each of the criteria
      specified by section 923(a) of this title.
      (4) Delays in implementation
        If the President determines that any action cannot be completed
      by the delayed effective date recommended by the Secretary
      pursuant to section 923(e) of this title, or that such an action
      by such date would result in a frequency being unused as a
      consequence of the Commission's plan under section 925 of this
      title, the President may - 
          (A) withdraw or limit the assignment to Federal Government
        stations on a later date that is consistent with such plan,
        except that the President shall notify each committee specified
        in paragraph (1)(B) and the Commission of the reason that
        withdrawal or limitation at a later date is required; or
          (B) substitute alternative frequencies pursuant to the
        provisions of this subsection.

    Sec. 925. Distribution of frequencies by Commission

-STATUTE-
    (a) Allocation and assignment of immediately available frequencies
      With respect to the frequencies made available for immediate
    reallocation pursuant to section 923(e)(2) of this title, the
    Commission, not later than 18 months after August 10, 1993, shall
    issue regulations to allocate such frequencies and shall propose
    regulations to assign such frequencies.
    (b) Allocation and assignment of remaining available frequencies
      With respect to the frequencies made available for reallocation
    pursuant to section 923(e)(3) of this title, the Commission shall,
    not later than 1 year after receipt of the initial reallocation
    report required by section 923(a) of this title, prepare, submit to
    the President and the Congress, and implement, a plan for the
    allocation and assignment under the 1934 Act [47 U.S.C. 151 et
    seq.] of such frequencies. Such plan shall - 
        (1) not propose the immediate allocation and assignment of all
      such frequencies but, taking into account the timetable
      recommended by the Secretary pursuant to section 923(e) of this
      title, shall propose - 
          (A) gradually to allocate and assign the frequencies
        remaining, after making the reservation required by
        subparagraph (B), over the course of 10 years beginning on the
        date of submission of such plan; and
          (B) to reserve a significant portion of such frequencies for
        allocation and assignment beginning after the end of such 10-
        year period;

        (2) contain appropriate provisions to ensure - 
          (A) the availability of frequencies for new technologies and
        services in accordance with the policies of section 7 of the
        1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 157);
          (B) the availability of frequencies to stimulate the
        development of such technologies; and
          (C) the safety of life and property in accordance with the
        policies of section 1 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 151);

        (3) address (A) the feasibility of reallocating portions of the
      spectrum from current commercial and other non-Federal uses to
      provide for more efficient use of the spectrum, and (B)
      innovation and marketplace developments that may affect the
      relative efficiencies of different spectrum allocations;
        (4) not prevent the Commission from allocating frequencies, and
      assigning licenses to use frequencies, not included in the plan;
      and
        (5) not preclude the Commission from making changes to the plan
      in future proceedings.
    (c) Allocation and assignment of frequencies identified in second
      reallocation report
      (1) Plan and implementation
        With respect to the frequencies made available for reallocation
      pursuant to section 923(b)(3) of this title, the Commission
      shall, not later than one year after receipt of the second
      reallocation report required by section 923(a) of this title,
      prepare, submit to the President and the Congress, and implement,
      a plan for the immediate allocation and assignment under the 1934
      Act [47 U.S.C. Sec. 151 et seq.] of all such frequencies in
      accordance with section 309(j) of such Act [47 U.S.C. 309(j)].
      (2) Contents
        The plan prepared by the Commission under paragraph (1) shall
      consist of a schedule of allocation and assignment of those
      frequencies in accordance with section 309(j) of the 1934 Act in
      time for the assignment of those licenses or permits by September
      30, 2002.

    ACCELERATED AVAILABILITY FOR AUCTION OF 1,710-1,755 MEGAHERTZ FROM
                        INITIAL REALLOCATION REPORT
      Section 3002(b) of Pub. L. 105-33 provided that: "The band of
    frequencies located at 1,710-1,755 megahertz identified in the
    initial reallocation report under section 113(a) of the National
    Telecommunications and Information Administration Act (47 U.S.C.

    Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j))."

      COMMISSION OBLIGATION TO MAKE ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM AVAILABLE BY
                                  AUCTION
      Section 3002(c) of Pub. L. 105-33 provided that:
      "(1) In general. - The Commission shall complete all actions
    necessary to permit the assignment by September 30, 2002, by
    competitive bidding pursuant to section 309(j) of the
    Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)), of licenses for the
    use of bands of frequencies that - 
        "(A) in the aggregate span not less than 55 megahertz;
        "(B) are located below 3 gigahertz;
        "(C) have not, as of the date of enactment of this Act [Aug. 5,
      1997] - 
          "(i) been designated by Commission regulation for assignment
        pursuant to such section;
          "(ii) been identified by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant
        to section 113 of the National Telecommunications and
        Information Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923);
          "(iii) been allocated for Federal Government use pursuant to
        section 305 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 305);
          "(iv) been designated for reallocation under section 337 of
        the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 337] (as added by
        this Act); or
          "(v) been allocated or authorized for unlicensed use pursuant
        to part 15 of the Commission's regulations (47 C.F.R. Part 15),
        if the operation of services licensed pursuant to competitive
        bidding would interfere with operation of end-user products
        permitted under such regulations;
        "(D) include frequencies at 2,110-2,150 megahertz; and
        "(E) include 15 megahertz from within the bands of frequencies
      at 1,990-2,110 megahertz.
      "(2) Criteria for Reassignment. - In making available bands of
    frequencies for competitive bidding pursuant to paragraph (1), the
    Commission shall - 
        "(A) seek to promote the most efficient use of the
      electromagnetic spectrum;
        "(B) consider the cost of relocating existing uses to other
      bands of frequencies or other means of communication;
        "(C) consider the needs of existing public safety radio
      services (as such services are described in section 309(j)(2)(A)
      of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by this Act);
        "(D) comply with the requirements of international agreements
      concerning spectrum allocations; and
        "(E) coordinate with the Secretary of Commerce when there is
      any impact on Federal Government spectrum use.
      "(3) Use of bands at 2,110-2,150 megahertz. - The Commission
    shall reallocate spectrum located at 2,110-2,150 megahertz for
    assignment by competitive bidding unless the Commission determines
    that auction of other spectrum (A) better serves the public
    interest, convenience, and necessity, and (B) can reasonably be
    expected to produce greater receipts. If the Commission makes such
    a determination, then the Commission shall, within 2 years after
    the date of enactment of this Act [Aug. 5, 1997], identify an
    alternative 40 megahertz, and report to the Congress an
    identification of such alternative 40 megahertz for assignment by
    competitive bidding.
      "(4) Use of 15 megahertz from bands at 1,990-2,110 megahertz. -
    The Commission shall reallocate 15 megahertz from spectrum located
    at 1,990-2,110 megahertz for assignment by competitive bidding
    unless the President determines such spectrum cannot be reallocated
    due to the need to protect incumbent Federal systems from
    interference, and that allocation of other spectrum (A) better
    serves the public interest, convenience, and necessity, and (B) can
    reasonably be expected to produce comparable receipts. If the
    President makes such a determination, then the President shall,
    within 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, identify
    alternative bands of frequencies totalling 15 megahertz, and report
    to the Congress an identification of such alternative bands for
    assignment by competitive bidding.
      "(5) Notification to the Secretary of Commerce. - The Commission
    shall attempt to accommodate incumbent licensees displaced under
    this section by relocating them to other frequencies available for
    allocation by the Commission. The Commission shall notify the
    Secretary of Commerce whenever the Commission is not able to
    provide for the effective relocation of an incumbent licensee to a
    band of frequencies available to the Commission for assignment. The
    notification shall include - 
        "(A) specific information on the incumbent licensee;
        "(B) the bands the Commission considered for relocation of the
      licensee;
        "(C) the reasons the licensee cannot be accommodated in such
      bands; and
        "(D) the bands of frequencies identified by the Commission that
      are - 
          "(i) suitable for the relocation of such licensee; and
          "(ii) allocated for Federal Government use, but that could be
        reallocated pursuant to part B of the National
        Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization
        Act (as amended by this Act) [part B (Secs. 131-135) of title I
        of Pub. L. 102-538, see Tables for classification]."

    Sec. 928. Spectrum Relocation Fund

-STATUTE-
    (a) Establishment of Spectrum Relocation Fund
      There is established on the books of the Treasury a separate fund
    to be known as the "Spectrum Relocation Fund" (in this section
    referred to as the "Fund"), which shall be administered by the
    Office of Management and Budget (in this section referred to as
    "OMB"), in consultation with the NTIA.
    (b) Crediting of receipts
      The Fund shall be credited with the amounts specified in section
    309(j)(8)(D) of this title.
    (c) Used to pay relocation costs
      The amounts in the Fund from auctions of eligible frequencies are
    authorized to be used to pay relocation costs, as defined in
    section 923(g)(3) of this title, of an eligible Federal entity
    incurring such costs with respect to relocation from those
    frequencies.
    (d) Fund availability
      (1) Appropriation
        There are hereby appropriated from the Fund such sums as are
      required to pay the relocation costs specified in subsection (c)
      of this section.
      (2) Transfer conditions
        None of the funds provided under this subsection may be
      transferred to any eligible Federal entity - 
          (A) unless the Director of OMB has determined, in
        consultation with the NTIA, the appropriateness of such costs
        and the timeline for relocation; and
          (B) until 30 days after the Director of OMB has submitted to
        the Committees on Appropriations and Energy and Commerce of the
        House of Representatives for approval, to the Committees on
        Appropriations and Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the
        Senate for approval, and to the Comptroller General a detailed
        plan describing specifically how the sums transferred from the
        Fund will be used to pay relocation costs in accordance with
        such subsection and the timeline for such relocation.

      Unless disapproved within 30 days, the amounts in the Fund shall
      be available immediately. If the plan is disapproved, the
      Director may resubmit a revised plan.
      (3) Reversion of unused funds
        Any auction proceeds in the Fund that are remaining after the
      payment of the relocation costs that are payable from the Fund
      shall revert to and be deposited in the general fund of the
      Treasury not later than 8 years after the date of the deposit of
      such proceeds to the Fund.
    (e) Transfer to eligible Federal entities
      (1) Transfer
        (A) Amounts made available pursuant to subsection (d) of this
      section shall be transferred to eligible Federal entities, as
      defined in section 923(g)(1) of this title.
        (B) An eligible Federal entity may receive more than one such
      transfer, but if the sum of the subsequent transfer or transfers
      exceeds 10 percent of the original transfer - 
          (i) such subsequent transfers are subject to prior approval
        by the Director of OMB as required by subsection (d)(2)(A) of
        this section;
          (ii) the notice to the committees containing the plan
        required by subsection (d)(2)(B) of this section shall be not
        less than 45 days prior to the date of the transfer that causes
        such excess above 10 percent;
          (iii) such notice shall include, in addition to such plan, an
        explanation of need for such subsequent transfer or transfers;
        and
          (iv) the Comptroller General shall, within 30 days after
        receiving such plan, review such plan and submit to such
        committees an assessment of the explanation for the subsequent
        transfer or transfers.

        (C) Such transferred amounts shall be credited to the
      appropriations account of the eligible Federal entity which has
      incurred, or will incur, such costs, and shall, subject to
      paragraph (2), remain available until expended.
      (2) Retransfer to fund
        An eligible Federal entity that has received such amounts shall
      report its expenditures to OMB and shall transfer any amounts in
      excess of actual relocation costs back to the Fund immediately
      after the NTIA has notified the Commission that the entity's
      relocation is complete, or has determined that such entity has
      unreasonably failed to complete such relocation in accordance
      with the timeline required by subsection (d)(2)(A) of this
      section.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 941. Child-friendly second-level Internet domain

-STATUTE-
    (a) Responsibilities
      The NTIA shall require the registry selected to operate and
    maintain the United States country code Internet domain to
    establish, operate, and maintain a second-level domain within the
    United States country code domain that provides access only to
    material that is suitable for minors and not harmful to minors (in
    this section referred to as the "new domain").
    (b) Conditions of contracts
      (1) Initial registry
        The NTIA shall not exercise any option periods under any
      contract between the NTIA and the initial registry to operate and
      maintain the United States country code Internet domain unless
      the initial registry agrees, during the 90-day period beginning
      upon December 4, 2002, to carry out, and to operate the new
      domain in accordance with, the requirements under subsection (c)
      of this section. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to
      prevent the initial registry of the United States country code
      Internet domain from participating in the NTIA's process for
      selecting a successor registry or to prevent the NTIA from
      awarding, to the initial registry, the contract to be successor
      registry subject to the requirements of paragraph (2).
      (2) Successor registries
        The NTIA shall not enter into any contract for operating and
      maintaining the United States country code Internet domain with
      any successor registry unless such registry enters into an
      agreement with the NTIA, during the 90-day period after selection
      of such registry, that provides for the registry to carry out,
      and the new domain to operate in accordance with, the
      requirements under subsection (c) of this section.
    (c) Requirements of new domain
      The registry and new domain shall be subject to the following
    requirements:
        (1) Written content standards for the new domain, except that
      the NTIA shall not have any authority to establish such
      standards.
        (2) Written agreements with each registrar for the new domain
      that require that use of the new domain is in accordance with the
      standards and requirements of the registry.
        (3) Written agreements with registrars, which shall require
      registrars to enter into written agreements with registrants, to
      use the new domain in accordance with the standards and
      requirements of the registry.
        (4) Rules and procedures for enforcement and oversight that
      minimize the possibility that the new domain provides access to
      content that is not in accordance with the standards and
      requirements of the registry.
        (5) A process for removing from the new domain any content that
      is not in accordance with the standards and requirements of the
      registry.
        (6) A process to provide registrants to the new domain with an
      opportunity for a prompt, expeditious, and impartial dispute
      resolution process regarding any material of the registrant
      excluded from the new domain.
        (7) Continuous and uninterrupted service for the new domain
      during any transition to a new registry selected to operate and
      maintain new domain or the United States country code domain.
        (8) Procedures and mechanisms to promote the accuracy of
      contact information submitted by registrants and retained by
      registrars in the new domain.
        (9) Operationality of the new domain not later than one year
      after December 4, 2002.
        (10) Written agreements with registrars, which shall require
      registrars to enter into written agreements with registrants, to
      prohibit two-way and multiuser interactive services in the new
      domain, unless the registrant certifies to the registrar that
      such service will be offered in compliance with the content
      standards established pursuant to paragraph (1) and is designed
      to reduce the risk of exploitation of minors using such two-way
      and multiuser interactive services.
        (11) Written agreements with registrars, which shall require
      registrars to enter into written agreements with registrants, to
      prohibit hyperlinks in the new domain that take new domain users
      outside of the new domain.
        (12) Any other action that the NTIA considers necessary to
      establish, operate, or maintain the new domain in accordance with
      the purposes of this section.
    (d) Option periods for initial registry
      The NTIA shall grant the initial registry the option periods
    available under the contract between the NTIA and the initial
    registry to operate and maintain the United States country code
    Internet domain if, and may not grant such option periods unless,
    the NTIA finds that the initial registry has satisfactorily
    performed its obligations under this Act and under the contract.
    Nothing in this section shall preempt or alter the NTIA's authority
    to terminate such contract for the operation of the United States
    country code Internet domain for cause or for convenience.
    (e) Treatment of registry and other entities
      (1) In general
        Only to the extent that such entities carry out functions under
      this section, the following entities are deemed to be interactive
      computer services for purposes of section 230(c) of the
      Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 230(c)):
          (A) The registry that operates and maintains the new domain.
          (B) Any entity that contracts with such registry to carry out
        functions to ensure that content accessed through the new
        domain complies with the limitations applicable to the new
        domain.
          (C) Any registrar for the registry of the new domain that is
        operating in compliance with its agreement with the registry.
      (2) Savings provision
        Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be construed to affect the
      applicability of any other provision of title II of the
      Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 201 et seq.] to the
      entities covered by subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph
      (1).
    (f) Education
      The NTIA shall carry out a program to publicize the availability
    of the new domain and to educate the parents of minors regarding
    the process for utilizing the new domain in combination and
    coordination with hardware and software technologies that provide
    for filtering or blocking. The program under this subsection shall
    be commenced not later than 30 days after the date that the new
    domain first becomes operational and accessible by the public.
    (g) Coordination with Federal Government
      The registry selected to operate and maintain the new domain
    shall - 
        (1) consult with appropriate agencies of the Federal Government
      regarding procedures and actions to prevent minors and families
      who use the new domain from being targeted by adults and other
      children for predatory behavior, exploitation, or illegal
      actions; and
        (2) based upon the consultations conducted pursuant to
      paragraph (1), establish such procedures and take such actions as
      the registry may deem necessary to prevent such targeting.

    The consultations, procedures, and actions required under this
    subsection shall be commenced not later than 30 days after the date
    that the new domain first becomes operational and accessible by the
    public.
    (h) Compliance report
      The registry shall prepare, on an annual basis, a report on the
    registry's monitoring and enforcement procedures for the new
    domain. The registry shall submit each such report, setting forth
    the results of the review of its monitoring and enforcement
    procedures for the new domain, to the Committee on Energy and
    Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on
    Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate.
    (i) Suspension of new domain
      If the NTIA finds, pursuant to its own review or upon a good
    faith petition by the registry, that the new domain is not serving
    its intended purpose, the NTIA shall instruct the registry to
    suspend operation of the new domain until such time as the NTIA
    determines that the new domain can be operated as intended.
    (j) Definitions
      For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall
    apply:

      that - 
          (A) the average person, applying contemporary community
        standards, would find, taking the material as a whole and with
        respect to minors, that it is designed to appeal to, or is
        designed to pander to, the prurient interest;
          (B) the material depicts, describes, or represents, in a
        manner patently offensive with respect to minors, an actual or
        simulated sexual act or sexual contact, an actual or simulated
        normal or perverted sexual act, or a lewd exhibition of the
        genitals or post-pubescent female breast; and

-MISC1-
                           FINDINGS AND PURPOSES                       
      Pub. L. 107-317, Sec. 2, Dec. 4, 2002, 116 Stat. 2766, provided
    that:
      "(a) Findings. - The Congress finds that - 
        "(1) the World Wide Web presents a stimulating and entertaining
      opportunity for children to learn, grow, and develop
      educationally and intellectually;
        "(2) Internet technology also makes available an extensive
      amount of information that is harmful to children, as studies
      indicate that a significant portion of all material available on
      the Internet is related to pornography;
        "(3) young children, when trying to use the World Wide Web for
      positive purposes, are often presented - either mistakenly or
      intentionally - with material that is inappropriate for their
      age, which can be extremely frustrating for children, parents,
      and educators;
        "(4) exposure of children to material that is inappropriate for
      them, including pornography, can distort the education and
      development of the Nation's youth and represents a serious harm
      to American families that can lead to a host of other problems
      for children, including inappropriate use of chat rooms, physical
      molestation, harassment, and legal and financial difficulties;
        "(5) young boys and girls, older teens, troubled youth,
      frequent Internet users, chat room participants, online risk
      takers, and those who communicate online with strangers are at
      greater risk for receiving unwanted sexual solicitation on the
      Internet;
        "(6) studies have shown that 19 percent of youth (ages 10 to
      17) who used the Internet regularly were the targets of unwanted
      sexual solicitation, but less than 10 percent of the
      solicitations were reported to the police;
        "(7) children who come across illegal content should report it
      to the congressionally authorized CyberTipline, an online
      mechanism developed by the National Center for Missing and
      Exploited Children, for citizens to report sexual crimes against
      children;
        "(8) the CyberTipline has received more than 64,400 reports,
      including reports of child pornography, online enticement for
      sexual acts, child molestation (outside the family), and child
      prostitution;
        "(9) although the computer software and hardware industries,
      and other related industries, have developed innovative ways to
      help parents and educators restrict material that is harmful to
      minors through parental control protections and self-regulation,
      to date such efforts have not provided a national solution to the
      problem of minors accessing harmful material on the World Wide
      Web;
        "(10) the creation of a 'green-light' area within the United
      States country code Internet domain, that will contain only
      content that is appropriate for children under the age of 13, is
      analogous to the creation of a children's section within a
      library and will promote the positive experiences of children and
      families in the United States; and
        "(11) while custody, care, and nurture of the child reside
      first with the parent, the protection of the physical and
      psychological well-being of minors by shielding them from
      material that is harmful to them is a compelling governmental
      interest.
      "(b) Purposes. - The purposes of this Act [see Short Title of
    2002 Amendment note set out under section 901 of this title] are - 
        "(1) to facilitate the creation of a second-level domain within
      the United States country code Internet domain for the location
      of material that is suitable for minors and not harmful to
      minors; and
        "(2) to ensure that the National Telecommunications and
      Information Administration oversees the creation of such a second-
      level domain and ensures the effective and efficient
      establishment and operation of the new domain."

      points that were not capable of receiving 911 calls as of August
      3, 2007, for the incremental cost of upgrading from Phase I to
      Phase II compliance. Such grants shall be subject to all other

      imposed by a State or other taxing jurisdiction within which the
      applicant is located are being obligated or expended for any
      purpose other than the purposes for which such charges are
      designated or presented during the period beginning 180 days
      immediately preceding the date of the application and continuing
      through the period of time during which the funds from the grant
      are available to the applicant.
      (3) Condition of grant
        Each applicant for a grant under this section shall agree, as a
      condition of receipt of the grant, that if the State or other
      taxing jurisdiction within which the applicant is located, during
      any period of time during which the funds from the grant are
      available to the applicant, obligates or expends designated E-911
      charges for any purpose other than the purposes for which such
      charges are designated or presented, all of the funds from such

      Except as provided in subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this
    section and sections 1007(a) and 1008(b) and (d) of this title, a
    telecommunications carrier shall ensure that its equipment,
    facilities, or services that provide a customer or subscriber with
    the ability to originate, terminate, or direct communications are
    capable of - 
        (1) expeditiously isolating and enabling the government,
      pursuant to a court order or other lawful authorization, to
      intercept, to the exclusion of any other communications, all wire
      and electronic communications carried by the carrier within a
      service area to or from equipment, facilities, or services of a
      subscriber of such carrier concurrently with their transmission
      to or from the subscriber's equipment, facility, or service, or
      at such later time as may be acceptable to the government;
        (2) expeditiously isolating and enabling the government,

      access call-identifying information that is reasonably available
      to the carrier - 
          (A) before, during, or immediately after the transmission of
        a wire or electronic communication (or at such later time as
        may be acceptable to the government); and
          (B) in a manner that allows it to be associated with the
        communication to which it pertains,

      except that, with regard to information acquired solely pursuant
      to the authority for pen registers and trap and trace devices (as
      defined in section 3127 of title 18), such call-identifying
      information shall not include any information that may disclose

        (3) delivering intercepted communications and call-identifying
      information to the government, pursuant to a court order or other
      lawful authorization, in a format such that they may be
      transmitted by means of equipment, facilities, or services
      procured by the government to a location other than the premises
      of the carrier; and
        (4) facilitating authorized communications interceptions and
      access to call-identifying information unobtrusively and with a
      minimum of interference with any subscriber's telecommunications
      service and in a manner that protects - 
          (A) the privacy and security of communications and call-
        identifying information not authorized to be intercepted; and
          (B) information regarding the government's interception of

    (b) Limitations
      (1) Design of features and systems configurations

        services, features, or system configurations to be adopted by
        any provider of a wire or electronic communication service, any
        manufacturer of telecommunications equipment, or any provider
        of telecommunications support services; or
          (B) to prohibit the adoption of any equipment, facility,
        service, or feature by any provider of a wire or electronic
        communication service, any manufacturer of telecommunications
        equipment, or any provider of telecommunications support
        services.

        transport or switching of communications for private networks
        or for the sole purpose of interconnecting telecommunications
        carriers.
      (3) Encryption
        A telecommunications carrier shall not be responsible for
      decrypting, or ensuring the government's ability to decrypt, any
      communication encrypted by a subscriber or customer, unless the
      encryption was provided by the carrier and the carrier possesses
      the information necessary to decrypt the communication.
    (c) Emergency or exigent circumstances
      In emergency or exigent circumstances (including those described
    in sections 2518(7) or (11)(b) and 3125 of title 18 and section
    1805(e) of title 50), a carrier at its discretion may comply with
    subsection (a)(3) of this section by allowing monitoring at its
    premises if that is the only means of accomplishing the
    interception or access.
    (d) Mobile service assistance requirements
      A telecommunications carrier that is a provider of commercial
    mobile service (as defined in section 332(d) of this title)

      of another carrier are not reasonably available to law
      enforcement for implementing the interception of communications
      or access to call-identifying information; and
        (2) compliance with the requirements of this subchapter is
      reasonably achievable through the application of available
      technology to the equipment, facility, or service at issue or
      would have been reasonably achievable if timely action had been
      taken.
    (b) Time for compliance
      Upon issuing an order enforcing this subchapter, the court shall
    specify a reasonable time and conditions for complying with its
    order, considering the good faith efforts to comply in a timely
    manner, any effect on the carrier's, manufacturer's, or service
    provider's ability to continue to do business, the degree of
    culpability or delay in undertaking efforts to comply, and such
    other matters as justice may require.
    (c) Limitations
      An order enforcing this subchapter may not - 
        (1) require a telecommunications carrier to meet the
      Government's (!1) demand for interception of communications and
      acquisition of call-identifying information to any extent in
      excess of the capacity for which the Attorney General has agreed

        (2) require any telecommunications carrier to comply with
      assistance capability requirement (!2) of section 1002 of this
      title if the Commission has determined (pursuant to section
      1008(b)(1) of this title) that compliance is not reasonably
      achievable, unless the Attorney General has agreed (pursuant to
      section 1008(b)(2) of this title) to pay the costs described in
      section 1008(b)(2)(A) of this title; or

        (3) require a telecommunications carrier to modify, for the
      purpose of complying with the assistance capability requirements
      of section 1002 of this title, any equipment, facility, or
      service deployed on or before January 1, 1995, unless - 
          (A) the Attorney General has agreed to pay the
        telecommunications carrier for all reasonable costs directly
        associated with modifications necessary to bring the equipment,
        facility, or service into compliance with those requirements;

        telecommunications carrier, may agree, subject to the
        availability of appropriations, to pay the telecommunications
        carrier for the additional reasonable costs of making
        compliance with such assistance capability requirements
        reasonably achievable; and
          (B) if the Attorney General does not agree to pay such costs,
        the telecommunications carrier shall be deemed to be in
        compliance with such capability requirements.
    (c) Allocation of funds for payment

    be available without fiscal year limitation to the Attorney General
    for making payments to telecommunications carriers, equipment
    manufacturers, and providers of telecommunications support services
    pursuant to section 1008 of this title.
    (b) Deposits to Fund
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any agency of the
    United States with law enforcement or intelligence responsibilities

    balances that are available until expended, upon compliance with
    any Congressional notification requirements for reprogrammings of
    funds applicable to the appropriation from which the deposit is to
    be made.
    (c) Termination
      (1) The Attorney General may terminate the Fund at such time as
    the Attorney General determines that the Fund is no longer
    necessary.
      (2) Any balance in the Fund at the time of its termination shall
    be deposited in the General Fund of the Treasury.
      (3) A decision of the Attorney General to terminate the Fund
    shall not be subject to judicial review.
    (d) Availability of funds for expenditure
      Funds shall not be available for obligation unless an
    implementation plan as set forth in subsection (e) of this section
    is submitted to each member of the Committees on the Judiciary and
    Appropriations of both the House of Representatives and the Senate
    and the Congress does not by law block or prevent the obligation of
    such funds. Such funds shall be treated as a reprogramming of funds
    under section 605 of the Department of Commerce, Justice, and
    State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act,
    1997, and shall not be available for obligation or expenditure

      intercepts, pen registers, and trap and trace devices that
      authorized law enforcement agencies may seek to conduct, set
      forth on a county-by-county basis for wireline services and on a
      market service area basis for wireless services, and the
      historical baseline of electronic surveillance activity upon
      which such capacity requirements are based;
        (3) a prioritized list of carrier equipment, facilities, and
      services deployed on or before January 1, 1995, to be modified by
      carriers at the request of law enforcement based on its
      investigative needs;
        (4) a projected reimbursement plan that estimates the cost for
      the coming fiscal year and for each fiscal year thereafter, based
      on the prioritization of law enforcement needs as outlined in
      (3),(!1) of modification by carriers of equipment, facilities and
      services, installed on or before January 1, 1995.

    (f) Annual report to Congress
      The Attorney General shall submit to the Congress each year a
    report specifically detailing all deposits and expenditures made
    pursuant to subchapter I (!2) of this chapter in each fiscal year.
    This report shall be submitted to each member of the Committees on
    the Judiciary and Appropriations of both the House of
    Representatives and the Senate, and to the Speaker and minority
    leader of the House of Representatives and to the majority and
    minority leaders of the Senate, no later than 60 days after the end
    of each fiscal year.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1103. Approval of loan guarantees

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authority to approve loan guarantees
      Subject to the provisions of this section and consistent with the
    purpose of this chapter, the Board may approve loan guarantees
    under this chapter.
    (b) Regulations
      (1) Requirements
        The Administrator (as defined in section 1104 of this title),
      under the direction of and for approval by the Board, shall
      prescribe regulations to implement the provisions of this chapter
      and shall do so not later than 120 days after funds authorized to
      be appropriated under section 1109 of this title have been
      appropriated in a bill signed into law.
      (2) Elements
        The regulations prescribed under paragraph (1) shall - 
          (A) set forth the form of any application to be submitted to
        the Board under this chapter;
          (B) set forth time periods for the review and consideration
        by the Board of applications to be submitted to the Board under
        this chapter, and for any other action to be taken by the Board
        with respect to such applications;
          (C) provide appropriate safeguards against the evasion of the
        provisions of this chapter;
          (D) set forth the circumstances in which an applicant,
        together with any affiliate of an applicant, shall be treated
        as an applicant for a loan guarantee under this chapter;
          (E) include requirements that appropriate parties submit to
        the Board any documents and assurances that are required for
        the administration of the provisions of this chapter; and
          (F) include such other provisions consistent with the purpose
        of this chapter as the Board considers appropriate.
      (3) Construction
        (A) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit the
      Board from requiring, to the extent and under circumstances
      considered appropriate by the Board, that affiliates of an
      applicant be subject to certain obligations of the applicant as a
      condition to the approval or maintenance of a loan guarantee
      under this chapter.
        (B) If any provision of this chapter or the application of such
      provision to any person or entity or circumstance is held to be
      invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of
      this chapter, or the application of such provision to such person
      or entity or circumstance other than those as to which it is held
      invalid, shall not be affected thereby.
    (c) Authority limited by appropriations acts
      The Board may approve loan guarantees under this chapter only to
    the extent provided for in advance in appropriations Acts, and the
    Board may accept credit risk premiums from a non-Federal source in
    order to cover the cost of a loan guarantee under this chapter, to
    the extent that appropriations of budget authority are insufficient
    to cover such costs.
    (d) Requirements and criteria applicable to approval
      (1) In general
        The Board shall utilize the underwriting criteria developed
      under subsection (g) of this section, and any relevant
      information provided by the departments and agencies with which
      the Board consults under section 1102 of this title, to determine
      which loans may be eligible for a loan guarantee under this
      chapter.
      (2) Prerequisites
        In addition to meeting the underwriting criteria under
      paragraph (1), a loan may not be guaranteed under this chapter
      unless - 
          (A) the loan is made to finance the acquisition, improvement,
        enhancement, construction, deployment, launch, or
        rehabilitation of the means by which local television broadcast
        signals will be delivered to a nonserved area or underserved
        area;
          (B) the proceeds of the loan will not be used for operating,
        advertising, or promotion expenses, or for the acquisition of
        licenses for the use of spectrum in any competitive bidding
        under section 309(j) of this title;
          (C) the proposed project, as determined by the Board in
        consultation with the National Telecommunications and
        Information Administration, is not likely to have a substantial
        adverse impact on competition that outweighs the benefits of
        improving access to the signals of a local television station
        in a nonserved area or underserved area and is commercially
        viable;
          (D)(i) the loan - 
            (I) is provided by any entity engaged in the business of
          commercial lending - 
              (aa) if the loan is made in accordance with loan-to-one-
            borrower and affiliate transaction restrictions to which
            the entity is subject under applicable law; or
              (bb) if item (aa) does not apply, the loan is made only
            to a borrower that is not an affiliate of the entity and
            only if the amount of the loan and all outstanding loans by
            that entity to that borrower and any of its affiliates does
            not exceed 10 percent of the net equity of the entity; or

            (II) is provided by a nonprofit corporation, including the
          National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation,
          engaged primarily in commercial lending, if the Board
          determines that such nonprofit corporation has one or more
          issues of outstanding long-term debt that is rated within the
          highest 3 rating categories of a nationally recognized
          statistical rating organization;

          (ii) if the loan is provided by a lender described in clause
        (i)(II) and the Board determines that the making of the loan by
        such lender will cause a decline in such lender's debt rating
        as described in that clause, the Board at its discretion may
        disapprove the loan guarantee on this basis;
          (iii) no loan may be made for purposes of this chapter by a
        governmental entity or affiliate thereof, or by the Federal
        Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, or any institution
        supervised by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or any
        affiliate of such entities;
          (iv) any loan must have terms, in the judgment of the Board,
        that are consistent in material respects with the terms of
        similar obligations in the private capital market;
          (v) for purposes of clause (i)(I)(bb), the term "net equity"
        means the value of the total assets of the entity, less the
        total liabilities of the entity, as recorded under generally
        accepted accounting principles for the fiscal quarter ended
        immediately prior to the date on which the subject loan is
        approved;
          (E) repayment of the loan is required to be made within a
        term of the lesser of - 
            (i) 25 years from the date of the execution of the loan; or
            (ii) the economically useful life, as determined by the
          Board or in consultation with persons or entities deemed
          appropriate by the Board, of the primary assets to be used in
          the delivery of the signals concerned; and

          (F) the loan meets any additional criteria developed under
        subsection (g) of this section.
      (3) Protection of United States financial interests
        The Board may not approve the guarantee of a loan under this
      chapter unless - 
          (A) the Board has been given documentation, assurances, and
        access to information, persons, and entities necessary, as
        determined by the Board, to address issues relevant to the
        review of the loan by the Board for purposes of this chapter;
        and
          (B) the Board makes a determination in writing that - 
            (i) to the best of its knowledge upon due inquiry, the
          assets, facilities, or equipment covered by the loan will be
          utilized economically and efficiently;
            (ii) the terms, conditions, security, and schedule and
          amount of repayments of principal and the payment of interest
          with respect to the loan protect the financial interests of
          the United States and are reasonable;
            (iii) the value of collateral provided by an applicant is
          at least equal to the unpaid balance of the loan amount
          covered by the loan guarantee (the "Amount" for purposes of
          this clause); and if the value of collateral provided by an
          applicant is less than the Amount, the additional required
          collateral is provided by any affiliate of the applicant;
            (iv) all necessary and required regulatory and other
          approvals, spectrum licenses, and delivery permissions have
          been received for the loan and the project under the loan;
            (v) the loan would not be available on reasonable terms and
          conditions without a loan guarantee under this chapter; and
            (vi) repayment of the loan can reasonably be expected.
    (e) Considerations
      (1) Type of market
        (A) Priority considerations
          To the maximum extent practicable, the Board shall give
        priority in the approval of loan guarantees under this chapter
        in the following order:
            (i) First, to projects that will serve households in
          nonserved areas. In considering such projects, the Board
          shall balance projects that will serve the largest number of
          households with projects that will serve remote, isolated
          communities (including noncontiguous States) in areas that
          are unlikely to be served through market mechanisms.
            (ii) Second, to projects that will serve households in
          underserved areas. In considering such projects, the Board
          shall balance projects that will serve the largest number of
          households with projects that will serve remote, isolated
          communities (including noncontiguous States) in areas that
          are unlikely to be served through market mechanisms.

        Within each category, the Board shall consider the project's
        estimated cost per household and shall give priority to those
        projects that provide the highest quality service at the lowest
        cost per household.
        (B) Additional consideration
          The Board should give additional consideration to projects
        that also provide high-speed Internet service.
        (C) Prohibitions
          The Board may not approve a loan guarantee under this chapter
        for a project that - 
            (i) is designed primarily to serve 1 or more of the top 40
          designated market areas (as that term is defined in section
          122(j) of title 17); or
            (ii) would alter or remove National Weather Service
          warnings from local broadcast signals.
      (2) Other considerations
        The Board shall consider other factors, which shall include
      projects that would - 
          (A) offer a separate tier of local broadcast signals, but for
        applicable Federal, State, or local laws or regulations;
          (B) provide lower projected costs to consumers of such
        separate tier; and
          (C) enable the delivery of local broadcast signals consistent
        with the purpose of this chapter by a means reasonably
        compatible with existing systems or devices predominantly in
        use.
      (3) Further consideration
        In implementing this chapter, the Board shall support the use
      of loan guarantees for projects that would serve households not
      likely to be served in the absence of loan guarantees under this
      chapter.
    (f) Guarantee limits
      (1) Limitation on aggregate value of loans
        The aggregate value of all loans for which loan guarantees are
      issued under this chapter (including the unguaranteed portion of
      such loans) may not exceed $1,250,000,000.
      (2) Guarantee level
        A loan guarantee issued under this chapter may not exceed an
      amount equal to 80 percent of a loan meeting in its entirety the
      requirements of subsection (d)(2)(A) of this section. If only a
      portion of a loan meets the requirements of that subsection, the
      Board shall determine that percentage of the loan meeting such
      requirements (the "applicable portion") and may issue a loan
      guarantee in an amount not exceeding 80 percent of the applicable
      portion.
    (g) Underwriting criteria
      Within the period provided for under subsection (b)(1) of this
    section, the Board shall, in consultation with the Director of the
    Office of Management and Budget and an independent public
    accounting firm, develop underwriting criteria relating to the
    guarantee of loans that are consistent with the purpose of this
    chapter, including appropriate collateral and cash flow levels for
    loans guaranteed under this chapter, and such other matters as the
    Board considers appropriate.
    (h) Credit risk premiums
      (1) Establishment and acceptance
        (A) In general
          The Board may establish and approve the acceptance of credit
        risk premiums with respect to a loan guarantee under this
        chapter in order to cover the cost, as defined in section
        661a(5) of title 2, of the loan guarantee. To the extent that
        appropriations of budget authority are insufficient to cover
        the cost, as so determined, of a loan guarantee under this
        chapter, credit risk premiums shall be accepted from a non-
        Federal source under this subsection on behalf of the
        applicant for the loan guarantee.
        (B) Authority limited by appropriations Acts
          Credit risk premiums under this subsection shall be imposed
        only to the extent provided for in advance in appropriations
        Acts.
      (2) Credit risk premium amount
        (A) In general
          The Board shall determine the amount of any credit risk
        premium to be accepted with respect to a loan guarantee under
        this chapter on the basis of - 
            (i) the financial and economic circumstances of the
          applicant for the loan guarantee, including the amount of
          collateral offered;
            (ii) the proposed schedule of loan disbursements;
            (iii) the business plans of the applicant for providing
          service;
            (iv) any financial commitment from a broadcast signal
          provider; and
            (v) the concurrence of the Director of the Office of
          Management and Budget as to the amount of the credit risk
          premium.
        (B) Proportionality
          To the extent that appropriations of budget authority are
        sufficient to cover the cost, as determined under section
        661a(5) of title 2, of loan guarantees under this chapter, the
        credit risk premium with respect to each loan guarantee shall
        be reduced proportionately.
        (C) Payment of premiums
          Credit risk premiums under this subsection shall be paid to
        an account (the "Escrow Account") established in the Treasury
        which shall accrue interest and such interest shall be retained
        by the account, subject to subparagraph (D).
        (D) Deductions from Escrow Account
          If a default occurs with respect to any loan guaranteed under
        this chapter and the default is not cured in accordance with
        the terms of the underlying loan or loan guarantee agreement,
        the Administrator, in accordance with subsections (i) and (j)
        of section 1104 of this title, shall liquidate, or shall cause
        to be liquidated, all assets collateralizing such loan as to
        which it has a lien or security interest. Any shortfall between
        the proceeds of the liquidation net of costs and expenses
        relating to the liquidation, and the guarantee amount paid
        pursuant to this chapter shall be deducted from funds in the
        Escrow Account and credited to the Administrator for payment of
        such shortfall. At such time as determined under subsection
        (d)(2)(E) of this section when all loans guaranteed under this
        chapter have been repaid or otherwise satisfied in accordance
        with this chapter and the regulations promulgated hereunder,
        remaining funds in the Escrow Account, if any, shall be
        refunded, on a pro rata basis, to applicants whose loans
        guaranteed under this chapter were not in default, or where any
        default was cured in accordance with the terms of the
        underlying loan or loan guarantee agreement.
    (i) Limitations on guarantees for certain cable operators
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no loan
    guarantee under this chapter may be granted or used to provide
    funds for a project that extends, upgrades, or enhances the
    services provided over any cable system to an area that, as of
    December 21, 2000, is covered by a cable franchise agreement that
    expressly obligates a cable system operator to serve such area.
    (j) Judicial review
      The decision of the Board to approve or disapprove the making of
    a loan guarantee under this chapter shall not be subject to
    judicial review.
    (k) Applicability of APA
      Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j) of this section,
    the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 and chapter 7 of title
    5 (commonly referred to as the Administrative Procedure Act), shall
    apply to actions taken under this chapter.

    CHAPTER 10 - LOCAL TV

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1104. Administration of loan guarantees

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      The Administrator of the Rural Utilities Service (in this chapter
    referred to as the "Administrator") shall issue and otherwise
    administer loan guarantees that have been approved by the Board in
    accordance with sections 1102 and 1103 of this title.
    (b) Security for protection of United States financial interests
      (1) Terms and conditions
        An applicant shall agree to such terms and conditions as are
      satisfactory, in the judgment of the Board, to ensure that, as
      long as any principal or interest is due and payable on a loan
      guaranteed under this chapter, the applicant - 
          (A) shall maintain assets, equipment, facilities, and
        operations on a continuing basis;
          (B) shall not make any discretionary dividend payments that
        impair its ability to repay obligations guaranteed under this
        chapter;
          (C) shall remain sufficiently capitalized; and
          (D) shall submit to, and cooperate fully with, any audit of
        the applicant under section 1105(a)(2) of this title.
      (2) Collateral
        (A) Existence of adequate collateral
          An applicant shall provide the Board such documentation as is
        necessary, in the judgment of the Board, to provide
        satisfactory evidence that appropriate and adequate collateral
        secures a loan guaranteed under this chapter.
        (B) Form of collateral
          Collateral required by subparagraph (A) shall consist solely
        of assets of the applicant, any affiliate of the applicant, or
        both (whichever the Board considers appropriate), including
        primary assets to be used in the delivery of signals for which
        the loan is guaranteed.
        (C) Review of valuation
          The value of collateral securing a loan guaranteed under this
        chapter may be reviewed by the Board, and may be adjusted
        downward by the Board if the Board reasonably believes such
        adjustment is appropriate.
      (3) Lien on interests in assets
        Upon the Board's approval of a loan guarantee under this
      chapter, the Administrator shall have liens on assets securing
      the loan, which shall be superior to all other liens on such
      assets, and the value of the assets (based on a determination
      satisfactory to the Board) subject to the liens shall be at least
      equal to the unpaid balance of the loan amount covered by the
      loan guarantee, or that value approved by the Board under section
      1103(d)(3)(B)(iii) of this title.
      (4) Perfected security interest
        With respect to a loan guaranteed under this chapter, the
      Administrator and the lender shall have a perfected security
      interest in assets securing the loan that are fully sufficient to
      protect the financial interests of the United States and the
      lender.
      (5) Insurance

-STATUTE-
    (a) Reinstatement of applicants as tentative selectees
      (1) In general
        Notwithstanding the order of the Federal Communications
      Commission in the proceeding described in paragraph (3), the
      Commission shall - 
          (A) reinstate each applicant as a tentative selectee under

        with the rules of the Commission, at any time before the
        Commission's final licensing action in the covered rural
        service area licensing proceeding.
      (2) Exemption from petitions to deny
        For purposes of the amended applications filed pursuant to
      paragraph (1)(B), the provisions of section 309(d)(1) of this
      title shall not apply.
      (3) Proceeding
        The proceeding described in this paragraph is the proceeding of
      the Commission In re Applications of Cellwave Telephone Services
      L.P., Futurewave General Partners L.P., and Great Western
      Cellular Partners, 7 FCC Rcd No. 19 (1992).
    (b) Continuation of license proceeding; fee assessment
      (1) Award of licenses
        The Commission shall award licenses under the covered rural
      service area licensing proceeding within 90 days after December
      21, 2000.
      (2) Service requirements
        The Commission shall provide that, as a condition of an
      applicant receiving a license pursuant to the covered rural
      service area licensing proceeding, the applicant shall provide
      cellular radiotelephone service to subscribers in accordance with
      sections 22.946 and 22.947 of the Commission's rules (47 CFR
      22.946, 22.947); except that the time period applicable under
      section 22.947 of the Commission's rules (or any successor rule)
      to the applicants identified in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of
      subsection (d)(1) of this section shall be 3 years rather than 5
      years and the waiver authority of the Commission shall apply to
      such 3-year period.
      (3) Calculation of license fee
        (A) Fee required
          The Commission shall establish a fee for each of the licenses
        under the covered rural service area licensing proceeding. In
        determining the amount of the fee, the Commission shall
        consider - 
            (i) the average price paid per person served in the
          Commission's Cellular Unserved Auction (Auction No. 12); and
            (ii) the settlement payments required to be paid by the
          permittees pursuant to the consent decree set forth in the
          Commission's order, In re the Tellesis Partners (7 FCC Rcd
          3168 (1992)), multiplying such payments by two.
        (B) Notice of fee
          Within 30 days after the date an applicant files the amended
        application permitted by subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section,
        the Commission shall notify each applicant of the fee
        established for the license associated with its application.
      (4) Payment for licenses
        No later than 18 months after the date that an applicant is
      granted a license, each applicant shall pay to the Commission the
      fee established pursuant to paragraph (3) for the license granted
      to the applicant under paragraph (1).
      (5) Auction authority
        If, after the amendment of an application pursuant to
      subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, the Commission finds that
      the applicant is ineligible for grant of a license to provide
      cellular radiotelephone services for a rural service area or the
      applicant does not meet the requirements under paragraph (2) of
      this subsection, the Commission shall grant the license for which
      the applicant is the tentative selectee ( (!1) pursuant to
      subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section by competitive bidding
      pursuant to section 309(j) of this title.

    (c) Prohibition of transfer
      During the 5-year period that begins on the date that an
    applicant is granted any license pursuant to subsection (a) of this
    section, the Commission may not authorize the transfer or
    assignment of that license under section 310 of this title. Nothing
    in this chapter may be construed to prohibit any applicant granted
    a license pursuant to subsection (a) of this section from
    contracting with other licensees to improve cellular telephone
    service.

        (as defined in section 332(d)(1) of this title) to transmit
        emergency alerts to subscribers to, or users of, the commercial
        mobile service provided by such licensee;
          (B) to require any licensee providing commercial mobile
        service that elects, in whole or in part, under paragraph (2)
        not to transmit emergency alerts to provide clear and
        conspicuous notice at the point of sale of any devices with
        which its commercial mobile service is included, that it will
        not transmit such alerts via the service it provides for the
        device; and
          (C) to require any licensee providing commercial mobile
        service that elects under paragraph (2) not to transmit
        emergency alerts to notify its existing subscribers of its
        election.
      (2) Election
        (A) In general
          Within 30 days after the Commission issues its order under
        paragraph (1), each licensee providing commercial mobile
        service shall file an election with the Commission with respect
        to whether or not it intends to transmit emergency alerts.
        (B) Transmission standards; notification
          If a licensee providing commercial mobile service elects to

          elected to transmit emergency alerts to withdraw its election
          without regulatory penalty or forfeiture upon advance written
          notification of the withdrawal to its affected subscribers;
            (ii) for a commercial mobile service licensee to elect to
          transmit emergency alerts at a date later than provided in
          subparagraph (A); and

        President. Within 2 years after the Commission completes the
        proceeding under paragraph (1), the Commission shall examine
        the issue of whether a commercial mobile service provider
        should continue to be permitted to offer its subscribers such
        capability. The Commission shall submit a report with its

      shall not be liable to any subscriber to, or user of, such
      person's service or equipment for -

      The Congress finds the following:
        (1) The deployment and adoption of broadband technology has
      resulted in enhanced economic development and public safety for
      communities across the Nation, improved health care and
      educational opportunities, and a better quality of life for all
      Americans.
        (2) Continued progress in the deployment and adoption of
      broadband technology is vital to ensuring that our Nation remains
      competitive and continues to create business and job growth.
        (3) Improving Federal data on the deployment and adoption of
      broadband service will assist in the development of broadband
      technology across all regions of the Nation.
        (4) The Federal Government should also recognize and encourage
      complementary State efforts to improve the quality and usefulness
      of broadband data and should encourage and support the
      partnership of the public and private sectors in the continued
      growth of broadband services and information technology for the
      residents and businesses of the Nation.

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      The Commission and each State commission with regulatory
    jurisdiction over telecommunications services shall encourage the
    deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced
    telecommunications capability to all Americans (including, in
    particular, elementary and secondary schools and classrooms) by
    utilizing, in a manner consistent with the public interest,
    convenience, and necessity, price cap regulation, regulatory
    forbearance, measures that promote competition in the local
    telecommunications market, or other regulating methods that remove
    barriers to infrastructure investment.
    (b) Inquiry
      The Commission shall, within 30 months after February 8, 1996,
    and annually thereafter, initiate a notice of inquiry concerning
    the availability of advanced telecommunications capability to all
    Americans (including, in particular, elementary and secondary
    schools and classrooms) and shall complete the inquiry within 180
    days after its initiation. In the inquiry, the Commission shall
    determine whether advanced telecommunications capability is being
    deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion. If
    the Commission's determination is negative, it shall take immediate
    action to accelerate deployment of such capability by removing
    barriers to infrastructure investment and by promoting competition
    in the telecommunications market.
    (c) Demographic information for unserved areas
      As part of the inquiry required by subsection (b), the Commission
    shall compile a list of geographical areas that are not served by
    any provider of advanced telecommunications capability (as defined
    by subsection (d)(1)) (!1) and to the extent that data from the
    Census Bureau is available, determine, for each such unserved area -
     

        (1) the population;
        (2) the population density; and
        (3) the average per capita income.
    (d) Definitions
      For purposes of this subsection: (!2)

      (1) Advanced telecommunications capability
        The term "advanced telecommunications capability" is defined,
      without regard to any transmission media or technology, as high-
      speed, switched, broadband telecommunications capability that
      enables users to originate and receive high-quality voice, data,
      graphics, and video telecommunications using any technology.

      possible, communities of a population size, population density,
      topography, and demographic profile that are comparable to the
      population size, population density, topography, and demographic
      profile of various communities within the United States. The
      Commission shall include in the comparison under this subsection -
       
          (A) a geographically diverse selection of countries; and
          (B) communities including the capital cities of such
        countries.
      (3) Similarities and differences
        The Commission shall identify relevant similarities and
      differences in each community, including their market structures,
      the number of competitors, the number of facilities-based
      providers, the types of technologies deployed by such providers,
      the applications and services those technologies enable, the
      regulatory model under which broadband service capability is
      provided, the types of applications and services used, business
      and residential use of such services, and other media available
      to consumers.

      (1) In general
        For the purpose of evaluating, on a statistically significant
      basis, the national characteristics of the use of broadband
      service capability, the Commission shall conduct and make public
      periodic surveys of consumers in urban, suburban, and rural areas
      in the large business, small business, and residential consumer
      markets to determine - 
          (A) the types of technology used to provide the broadband
        service capability to which consumers subscribe;
          (B) the amounts consumers pay per month for such capability;
          (C) the actual data transmission speeds of such capability;
          (D) the types of applications and services consumers most
        frequently use in conjunction with such capability;
          (E) for consumers who have declined to subscribe to broadband
        service capability, the reasons given by such consumers for
        declining such capability;
          (F) other sources of broadband service capability which
        consumers regularly use or on which they rely; and
          (G) any other information the Commission deems appropriate
        for such purpose.
      (2) Public availability
        The Commission shall make publicly available the results of
      surveys conducted under this subsection at least once per year.
    (d) Improving Census data on broadband
      The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Federal
    Communications Commission, shall expand the American Community
    Survey conducted by the Bureau of the Census to elicit information
    for residential households, including those located on native
    lands, to determine whether persons at such households own or use a
    computer at that address, whether persons at that address subscribe
    to Internet service and, if so, whether such persons subscribe to
    dial-up or broadband Internet service at that address.
    (e) Proprietary information
      Nothing in this chapter shall reduce or remove any obligation the
    Commission has to protect proprietary information, nor shall this
    chapter be construed to compel the Commission to make publicly
    available any proprietary information.

        connection with projects funded by any such grant.
    (e) Use of funds
      A grant awarded to an eligible entity under subsection (b) shall
    be used - 
        (1) to provide a baseline assessment of broadband service
      deployment in each State;
        (2) to identify and track - 
          (A) areas in each State that have low levels of broadband
        service deployment;
          (B) the rate at which residential and business users adopt
        broadband service and other related information technology
        services; and
          (C) possible suppliers of such services;

        (3) to identify barriers to the adoption by individuals and
      businesses of broadband service and related information
      technology services, including whether or not - 
          (A) the demand for such services is absent; and
          (B) the supply for such services is capable of meeting the
        demand for such services;

        (4) to identify the speeds of broadband connections made
      available to individuals and businesses within the State, and, at
      a minimum, to rely on the data rate benchmarks for broadband
      service utilized by the Commission to reflect different speed
      tiers, to promote greater consistency of data among the States;
        (5) to create and facilitate in each county or designated
      region in a State a local technology planning team - 
          (A) with members representing a cross section of the
        community, including representatives of business,

          sector; and
            (iii) develop a tactical business plan for achieving its
          goals, with specific recommendations for online application
          development and demand creation;

        (6) to work collaboratively with broadband service providers
      and information technology companies to encourage deployment and
      use, especially in unserved areas and areas in which broadband
      penetration is significantly below the national average, through
      the use of local demand aggregation, mapping analysis, and the
      creation of market intelligence to improve the business case for
      providers to deploy;
        (7) to establish programs to improve computer ownership and
      Internet access for unserved areas and areas in which broadband
      penetration is significantly below the national average;
        (8) to collect and analyze detailed market data concerning the
      use and demand for broadband service and related information
      technology services;
        (9) to facilitate information exchange regarding the use and
      demand for broadband services between public and private sectors;
      and
        (10) to create within each State a geographic inventory map of
      broadband service, including the data rate benchmarks for
      broadband service utilized by the Commission to reflect different
      speed tiers, which shall - 
          (A) identify gaps in such service through a method of
        geographic information system mapping of service availability
        based on the geographic boundaries of where service is
        available or unavailable among residential or business
        customers; and
          (B) provide a baseline assessment of statewide broadband
        deployment in terms of households with high-speed availability.
    (f) Participation limit
      For each State, an eligible entity may not receive a new grant
    under this section to fund the activities described in subsection
    (d) within such State if such organization obtained prior grant
    awards under this section to fund the same activities in that State
    in each of the previous 4 consecutive years.
    (g) Reporting; broadband inventory map
      The Secretary of Commerce shall - 
        (1) require each recipient of a grant under subsection (b) to
      submit a report on the use of the funds provided by the grant;
      and
        (2) create a web page on the Department of Commerce website
      that aggregates relevant information made available to the public
      by grant recipients, including, where appropriate, hypertext
      links to any geographic inventory maps created by grant
      recipients under subsection (e)(10).
