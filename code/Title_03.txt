-STATUTE-
      Congress shall be in session on the sixth day of January
    succeeding every meeting of the electors. The Senate and House of
    Representatives shall meet in the Hall of the House of
    Representatives at the hour of 1 o'clock in the afternoon on that
    day, and the President of the Senate shall be their presiding
    officer. Two tellers shall be previously appointed on the part of
    the Senate and two on the part of the House of Representatives, to
    whom shall be handed, as they are opened by the President of the
    Senate, all the certificates and papers purporting to be
    certificates of the electoral votes, which certificates and papers
    shall be opened, presented, and acted upon in the alphabetical
    order of the States, beginning with the letter A; and said tellers,
    having then read the same in the presence and hearing of the two
    Houses, shall make a list of the votes as they shall appear from
    the said certificates; and the votes having been ascertained and
    counted according to the rules in this subchapter provided, the
    result of the same shall be delivered to the President of the
    Senate, who shall thereupon announce the state of the vote, which
    announcement shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the
    persons, if any, elected President and Vice President of the United
    States, and, together with a list of the votes, be entered on the
    Journals of the two Houses. Upon such reading of any such
    certificate or paper, the President of the Senate shall call for
    objections, if any. Every objection shall be made in writing, and
    shall state clearly and concisely, and without argument, the ground
    thereof, and shall be signed by at least one Senator and one Member
    of the House of Representatives before the same shall be received.
    When all objections so made to any vote or paper from a State shall
    have been received and read, the Senate shall thereupon withdraw,
    and such objections shall be submitted to the Senate for its
    decision; and the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall, in
    like manner, submit such objections to the House of Representatives
    for its decision; and no electoral vote or votes from any State
    which shall have been regularly given by electors whose appointment
    has been lawfully certified to according to section 6 of this title
    from which but one return has been received shall be rejected, but
    the two Houses concurrently may reject the vote or votes when they
    agree that such vote or votes have not been so regularly given by
    electors whose appointment has been so certified. If more than one
    return or paper purporting to be a return from a State shall have
    been received by the President of the Senate, those votes, and
    those only, shall be counted which shall have been regularly given
    by the electors who are shown by the determination mentioned in
    section 5 of this title to have been appointed, if the
    determination in said section provided for shall have been made, or
    by such successors or substitutes, in case of a vacancy in the
    board of electors so ascertained, as have been appointed to fill
    such vacancy in the mode provided by the laws of the State; but in
    case there shall arise the question which of two or more of such
    State authorities determining what electors have been appointed, as
    mentioned in section 5 of this title, is the lawful tribunal of
    such State, the votes regularly given of those electors, and those
    only, of such State shall be counted whose title as electors the
    two Houses, acting separately, shall concurrently decide is
    supported by the decision of such State so authorized by its law;
    and in such case of more than one return or paper purporting to be
    a return from a State, if there shall have been no such
    determination of the question in the State aforesaid, then those
    votes, and those only, shall be counted which the two Houses shall
    concurrently decide were cast by lawful electors appointed in
    accordance with the laws of the State, unless the two Houses,
    acting separately, shall concurrently decide such votes not to be

      only until a President or Vice President qualifies; and
        (2) if his discharge of the powers and duties of the office is

    Presidential term, but not after a qualified and prior-entitled
    individual is able to act, except that the removal of the
    disability of an individual higher on the list contained in
    paragraph (1) of this subsection or the ability to qualify on the
    part of an individual higher on such list shall not terminate his
    service.
      (3) The taking of the oath of office by an individual specified
    in the list in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be held to
    constitute his resignation from the office by virtue of the holding
    of which he qualifies to act as President.
      (e) Subsections (a), (b), and (d) of this section shall apply
    only to such officers as are eligible to the office of President
    under the Constitution. Subsection (d) of this section shall apply

                          SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE                      
      This Reorganization Plan shall become effective at such time or
    times on or before April 1, 1978, as the President shall specify,
    but not sooner than the earliest time allowable under Section 906
    of Title 5 of the United States Code.

                         MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT                     
    To the Congress of the United States:
      I herewith transmit my plan for the Reorganization of the
    Executive Office of the President (EOP), Reorganization Plan No. 1
    of 1977. This plan is the first of a series I intend to submit
    under the reorganization authority vested in me by the
    Reorganization Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-17) [5 U.S.C. 901-912].
    It adheres to the purposes set forth in Section 901(a) of the Act
    [5 U.S.C. 901(a)].
      This plan in conjunction with the other steps I am taking will:
        Eliminate seven of the seventeen units now within the EOP and
      modify the rest. There were 19 units when I took office; the
      President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and the Economic
      Policy Board have already been abolished. Thus with this plan I
      will have eliminated nine of 19 EOP units.
        Reduce EOP staffing by about 250 which includes the White House
      staff reduction of 134 or 28 percent which I have already
      ordered.
        Improve efficiency by centralizing administrative functions;
      and
        Improve the process by which information is provided for
      Presidential decisionmaking.
      These recommendations arise from a careful, systematic study of
    the EOP. They are based on the premise that the EOP exists to serve
    the President and should be structured to meet his needs. They will
    reduce waste and cost while improving the service the President,
    and the nation, receive from the EOP.
      The EOP now consists of the immediate White House Office, the
    Vice President's Office, the Office of Management and Budget, and
    fourteen other agencies. The EOP has a budget authority of about
    $80,000,000 and 1,712 full time employees.
      The White House Office concentrates on close personal support
    including policy and political advice and administrative and
    operational services. The Office of the Vice President provides
    similar support to him. OMB's primary mission is to develop and
    implement the budget; it also carries out a number of management
    and reorganization activities.
      Three EOP units have responsibility for policy development:
        National Security Council.
        Domestic Council.
        Council on International Economic Policy.
      The other 11 are more specialized offices that offer analysis and
    advice, help develop policy in certain areas, or carry out special
    projects. These are:
        Council of Economic Advisers.
        Council on Wage and Price Stability.
        Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations.
        Council on Environmental Quality.
        Office of Science and Technology Policy.
        Office of Drug Abuse Policy.
        Office of Telecommunications Policy.
        Intelligence Oversight Board.
        Federal Property Council.
        Energy Resources Council.
        Economic Opportunity Council.
      To make the EOP more effective, four steps are necessary:
        I. Strengthen management of policy issues.
        II. Limit the EOP, wherever possible, to functions directly
      related to the President's work.
        III. Centralize administrative services.
        IV. Reduce size of White House and EOP staffs.

             I. STRENGTHEN PROCESS MANAGEMENT OF POLICY ISSUES         
      Perhaps the most important function of the President's staff is
    to make sure he has the wide variety of views and facts he needs to
    make decisions. By building a more orderly system for collecting
    information and advice, the President can make sure that he will
    hear all the views he should - and hear them in time. To better
    insure that this happens, I am taking the following actions to:
        Institute for domestic and economic issues, a system similar to
      the Presidential Review Memorandum process currently used for
      National Security issues.
        Create a committee of Presidential advisers, chaired by the
      Vice President, to set priorities among issues and oversee their
      staffing.
        Assure that Presidential decision memoranda on policy issues
      are coordinated with Cabinet and EOP advisers most involved with
      the issue.
        Consolidate under the Staff Secretary the two current White
      House paper circulation systems.
        Appoint a group of advisers to review the decisionmaking
      process periodically.
        Give the Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs and
      Policy clear responsibility for managing the way in which
      domestic and most economic policy issues are prepared for
      Presidential decision.
        Assign follow-up responsibility for Presidential decisions as
      follows: immediate follow-up will be handled by the NSC or
      Domestic Policy Staff most directly involved in the issue; long
      term follow-up on selected issues will be handled by the
      Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Relations.
      These actions recognize that the White House and Executive Office
    staff must use their proximity to the President to insure that the
    full resources of the government and the public are brought to bear
    on Presidential decisions in a timely fashion. It is my purpose in
    instituting these changes to strengthen Cabinet participation in
    Presidential decisions.

     II. RATIONALIZE EOP STRUCTURE BY LIMITING EOP, WHEREVER POSSIBLE,
      TO FUNCTIONS WHICH BEAR A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP TO THE WORK OF THE
                                 PRESIDENT
      As the President's principal staff institution, there are several
    major things the EOP must do:
        Provide day-to-day operational support (e.g., scheduling,
      appointments) and help the President communicate with the public,
      the Congress, and the press.
        Manage the budget and coordinate Administration positions on
      matters before the Congress.
        Manage the Presidential decisionmaking processes efficiently
      and fairly, and bring the President the widest possible range of
      opinions.
        Help the President: plan and set priorities; monitor and
      evaluate progress toward achieving the President's objectives;
      understand and resolve major conflicts among line subordinates;
      manage crises, especially in national security matters.
      In order to restructure the EOP around these basic functions, the
    functions of seven units should be discontinued or transferred, and
    ten units, including the White House Office, should be retained but
    modified.
      Seven units should be discontinued or their functions
    transferred. These are:
        1. Office of Drug Abuse Policy.
        2. Office of Telecommunications Policy.
        3. Council on International Economic Policy.
        4. Federal Property Council.
        5. Energy Resources Council.
        6. Economic Opportunity Council.
        7. Domestic Council.
      The functions of the Office of Drug Abuse Policy (ODAP) can be
    performed by a smaller staff reporting to a Presidential adviser in
    the EOP. The Office itself will be discontinued.
      Much of the work done by the Office of Telecommunications Policy
    (OTP) can be more effectively performed outside the EOP. It is
    important that the EOP have the capacity to resolve differences and
    that the President have immediate advice on telecommunications and
    information policy, especially on national security, emergency
    preparedness and privacy issues. This only requires a small staff
    within EOP. The Office of Management and Budget would take
    responsibility for Federal telecommunications procurement and
    management policy and arbitration of interagency disputes about
    frequency allocation. All other functions except developing
    Presidential policy options would be transferred to a new office
    within the Department of Commerce, headed by a new Assistant
    Secretary for Communications and Information, who will perform many
    of the functions previously performed by the head of the OTP.
      I propose that the Economic Opportunity Council be discontinued;
    it is dormant and its only active function (preparation of the
    Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance) is being performed by
    OMB. Three other units are also inactive and should be
    discontinued: Council on International Economic Policy, the Federal
    Property Council, and the Energy Resources Council.
      The Domestic Council should be abolished. It has rarely
    functioned as a Council, because it is too large and its membership
    too diverse to make decisions efficiently. Its functions have been
    performed entirely by its staff. This Domestic Policy Staff should
    report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs and
    Policy. Under the policy process system described earlier, they
    should manage the process which coordinates the making of domestic
    and most economic policy. They should work closely with the Cabinet
    departments and agencies to insure that the views of the Cabinet
    and agency heads are brought to the President before decisions are
    made.
      The ten EOP units which will continue with some modification are:
        1. White House Office.
        2. Office of the Vice President.
        3. Office of Management and Budget.
        4. Council on Environmental Quality.
        5. Council of Economic Advisers.
        6. Office of Science and Technology Policy.
        7. Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations.
        8. National Security Council.
        9. Intelligence Oversight Board.
        10. Council on Wage and Price Stability.
      The operations of the Office of the Vice President reflect the
    combination of constitutional, statutory, and Presidentially
    assigned duties that make it unique among EOP units. Because his
    interests and assignments cover the same range as the President's,
    the Vice President requires a staff with expertise in diverse
    areas. Its basic functions should not be changed. However, I
    propose that certain support functions - involving accounting,
    personnel services, and supply - be transferred to a centralized
    EOP Administrative Unit.
      The Office of Management and Budget would remain as a separate
    entity in the EOP, but some functional changes should be made. Four
    functions should be transferred from OMB to other parts of the
    government:
        Administration to the new EOP Central Administrative Unit;
        Executive Department/Labor Relations (except for Pay Agent,
      Executive Level Pools, and Legislative Analysis) to the Civil
      Service Commission;
        Advisory Committee Management Secretariat to the General
      Services Administration;
        Statistical Policy (except Forms Clearance) to the Department
      of Commerce.
      I have asked the OMB to reorganize its management arm to
    emphasize major Presidential initiatives, such as reorganization,
    program evaluation, paperwork reduction, and regulatory reform.
      The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) should remain in the
    EOP as an environmental adviser to the President. The CEQ's major
    purpose is to provide an independent assessment of our policies for
    improving the environment. Toward this end, it will analyze long
    term trends and conditions in the environment. It will advise OMB
    on the reorganization of natural resources functions within the
    Federal government. The Council will retain the functions it now
    has under NEPA and Executive Order No. 11514 with the exception of
    routine review of the adequacy of impact statements and the
    administrative aspects of their receipt and handling. The EPA will
    take over CEQ's evaluation responsibility under the Federal
    Nonnuclear Energy Research Development Act of 1974 [section 5901 et
    seq. of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare]. The CEQ will
    continue to review and publish the Annual Report on Environmental
    Quality.
      The strength of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEQ) lies in
    its economic analysis of current policy choices. It also presents
    objective economic data, makes macroeconomic forecasts, and
    analyzes economic trends and their impact on the national economy.
    It will continue with a small reduction in staff.
      The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) should retain
    those science, engineering, and technology functions which can be
    so useful in helping the President and his advisers make decisions
    about policy and budget issues. Instead of the Intergovernmental
    Science, Engineering, and Technology Advisory Panels, the President
    should rely on an intergovernmental relations working group,
    chaired by the Science Adviser. The Federal Coordinating Council on
    Science and Technology should operate as a sub-Cabinet working
    group chaired by the Science Adviser. The reorganization work of
    the President's Committee on Science and Technology would be part
    of the overall reorganization effort. The responsibility for
    preparing certain reports should be transferred to the National
    Science Foundation.
      The proposal places manageable limits on OSTP's broad mandate
    while emphasizing functions that support the President.
      The Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations
    (STR) is now operating effectively and will be retained essentially
    as is. With the difficult negotiations now underway in Geneva, the
    benefits of transferring the STR to another agency are outweighed
    by the potential reduction in its effectiveness as an international
    negotiator.
      The National Security Council (NSC) will be retained in its
    present form and its staff slightly reduced.
      Intelligence Oversight Board (IOB) should be retained to insure
    that abuses of the past are not repeated and to emphasize
    Presidential concerns regarding intelligence issues.
      The Council of Wage and Price Stability (COWPS) is a necessary
    weapon in the continuing fight against inflation and will be
    retained. To be sure that its work is closely coordinated with the
    economic analyses performed by the Council of Economic Advisers
    (CEA), COWPS should be directed by the Chairman of CEA.

                 III. CENTRALIZE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS             
      About 380 (22 percent) of the full-time, permanent EOP personnel
    perform administrative support services in EOP units. Most EOP
    units besides the White House and OMB are too small to provide a
    full complement of administrative services. They depend on the
    White House, OMB, GSA, other federal departments, or several of
    these sources for many of these services. This approach is
    inefficient; the quality is uneven and the coordination poor. Some
    services are duplicated, others inconsistently distributed (excess
    capacity in some units and deficiencies in others), and most too
    costly.
      I propose to combine administrative support operations into a
    Central Administrative Unit in EOP to provide support in
    administrative services common to all EOP entities. It should be a
    separate EOP entity because of the need to assure equal access by
    all other units.
      This consolidation will result in:
        Saving of roughly 40 positions and about $1.1 million, improved
      and more innovative services.
        A focus for monitoring the efficiency and responsibility of
      administrative services.
        A base for an effective EOP budget/planning system through
      which the President can manage an integrated EOP rather than a
      collection of disparate units.
      The EOP has never before been organized as a single, unified
    entity serving the President. It is only by viewing it as a whole
    that we can improve efficiency through steps like the Central
    Administrative Unit.

             IV. REDUCE THE SIZE OF WHITE HOUSE AND EOP STAFFS         
      I am reducing the White House staff by 28 percent, from the 485 I
    inherited from my predecessor to 351. This involves cuts in my
    policy and administrative staffs as well as transfers to the
    Central Administrative Unit.
      I estimate that this plan and the other steps I am taking will
    reduce staff levels in the EOP by about 250, from 1,712 full-time
    permanent positions to about 1,460 and will save the taxpayers at
    least $6 million.
      As in the rest of the government, I will be reluctant to add
    staff unless necessary to help me do my job better.
      I ask that you support me in improving the operations of the
    Executive Office of the President by approving the attached
    reorganization plan.
      In summary this plan would:
        Abolish the Domestic Council and establish a Domestic Policy
      Staff.
        Establish within the EOP a Central Administrative Unit.
        Transfer certain functions of the Council on Environmental
      Quality to the President for redelegation.
        Abolish the Office of Drug Abuse Policy and vest functions in
      the President for redelegation.
        Abolish the Office of Telecommunications Policy and transfer
      functions to the Department of Commerce and to the President for
      redelegation.
        Create an Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications
      and Information.
        Vest some Office of Science and Technology Policy functions in
      the President for redelegation.
        Abolish the Economic Opportunity Council and vest those
      functions in the President for redelegation.
        Transfer the Committee Management Secretariat function of the
      Office of Management and Budget to the President for
      redelegation.
        Make other incidental transfers attendant to those mentioned
      above.
      Each of the changes set forth in the plan accompanying this
    message is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set
    forth in Section 901(a) of Title 5 of the United States Code. I
    have taken care to determine that all functions abolished by the
    plan are done so only under statutory authority provided by Section
    903(b) of Title 5 of the United States Code. The provisions in the
    plan for the appointment and pay of any head or officer of any
    agency have been found by me to be necessary.
      As we continue our studies of other parts of the Executive
    Branch, we will find more ways to improve services in the EOP and
    elsewhere. This plan is only a beginning, but I am confident that
    it represents a major step toward a more efficient government that
    will serve the needs of the people and the President well.

        EX. ORD. NO. 13199. ESTABLISHMENT OF WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF
                 FAITH-BASED AND NEIGHBORHOOD PARTNERSHIPS
      Ex. Ord. No. 13199, Jan. 29, 2001, 66 F.R. 8499, as amended by
    Ex. Ord. No. 13498, Sec. 1, Feb. 5, 2009, 74 F.R. 6533, provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President of the United States
    by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
    and in order to help the Federal Government coordinate a national
    effort to expand opportunities for faith-based and other community
    organizations and to strengthen their capacity to better meet
    social needs in America's communities, it is hereby ordered as
    follows:
      Section 1. Policy. Faith-based and other neighborhood
    organizations are vital to our Nation's ability to address the
    needs of low-income and other underserved persons and communities.
    The American people are key drivers of fundamental change in our
    country, and few institutions are closer to the people than our
    faith-based and other neighborhood organizations. It is critical
    that the Federal Government strengthen the ability of such
    organizations and other nonprofit providers in our neighborhoods to
    deliver services effectively in partnership with Federal, State,
    and local governments and with other private organizations, while
    preserving our fundamental constitutional commitments guaranteeing
    the equal protection of the laws and the free exercise of religion
    and forbidding the establishment of religion. The Federal
    Government can preserve these fundamental commitments while
    empowering faith-based and neighborhood organizations to deliver
    vital services in our communities, from providing mentors and
    tutors to school children to giving ex-offenders a second chance at
    work and a responsible life to ensuring that families are fed. The
    Federal Government must also ensure that any organization receiving
    taxpayers' dollars must be held accountable for its performance.
    Through rigorous evaluation, and by offering technical assistance,
    the Federal Government must ensure that organizations receiving
    Federal funds achieve measurable results in furtherance of valid
    public purposes.
      Sec. 2. Establishment. There is established a White House Office
    of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships (Office) within the
    Executive Office of the President that will have lead
    responsibility in the executive branch to establish policies,
    priorities, and objectives for the Federal Government's
    comprehensive effort to enlist, equip, enable, empower, and expand
    the work of faith-based and other community organizations to the
    extent permitted by law.
      Sec. 3. Functions. The principal functions of the Office are, to
    the extent permitted by law: (a) to develop, lead, and coordinate
    the Administration's policy agenda affecting faith-based and other
    community programs and initiatives, expand the role of such efforts
    in communities, and increase their capacity through executive
    action, legislation, Federal and private funding, and regulatory
    relief;
      (b) to ensure that Administration and Federal Government policy
    decisions and programs are consistent with the President's stated
    goals with respect to faith-based and other community initiatives;
      (c) to ensure that services paid for with Federal Government
    funds are provided in a manner consistent with fundamental
    constitutional commitments guaranteeing the equal protection of the
    laws and the free exercise of religion and prohibiting laws
    respecting an establishment of religion;
      (d) to promote effective training for persons providing federally
    funded social services in faith-based and neighborhood
    organizations;
      (e) to promote the better use of program evaluation and research,
    in order to ensure that organizations deliver services as specified
    in grant agreements, contracts, memoranda of understanding, and
    other arrangements;
      (f) to help integrate the President's policy agenda affecting
    faith-based and other community organizations across the Federal
    Government;
      (g) to coordinate public education activities designed to
    mobilize public support for faith-based and community nonprofit
    initiatives through volunteerism, special projects, demonstration
    pilots, and public-private partnerships;
      (h) to encourage private charitable giving to support faith-based
    and community initiatives;
      (i) to bring concerns, ideas, and policy options to the President
    for assisting, strengthening, and replicating successful faith-
    based and other community programs;
      (j) to provide policy and legal education to State, local, and
    community policymakers and public officials seeking ways to empower
    faith-based and other community organizations and to improve the
    opportunities, capacity, and expertise of such groups;
      (k) to develop and implement strategic initiatives under the
    President's agenda to strengthen the institutions of civil society
    and America's families and communities;
      (l) to showcase and herald innovative grassroots nonprofit
    organizations and civic initiatives;
      (m) to eliminate unnecessary legislative, regulatory, and other
    bureaucratic barriers that impede effective faith-based and other
    community efforts to solve social problems;
      (n) to monitor implementation of the President's agenda affecting
    faith-based and other community organizations; and
      (o) to ensure that the efforts of faith-based and other community
    organizations meet high standards of excellence and accountability.

    established or ad hoc committees, task forces, or interagency
    groups.

      (c) The Office shall coordinate with the liaison and point of
    contact designated by each executive department and agency with
    respect to this initiative.

      EX. ORD. NO. 13503. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF
                               URBAN AFFAIRS
      Ex. Ord. No. 13503, Feb. 19, 2009, 74 F.R. 8139, provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to take
    a coordinated and comprehensive approach to developing and
    implementing an effective strategy concerning urban America, it is
    hereby ordered as follows:
      Section 1. Policy. About 80 percent of Americans live in urban
    areas, and the economic health and social vitality of our urban
    communities are critically important to the prosperity and quality
    of life for Americans. Vibrant cities spawn innovation, economic
    growth, and cultural enrichment through the businesses,
    universities, and civic, cultural, religious, and nonprofit
    institutions they attract. Forward-looking policies that encourage
    wise investment and development in our urban areas will create
    employment and housing opportunities and make our country more
    competitive, prosperous, and strong. In the past, insufficient
    attention has been paid to the problems faced by urban areas and to
    coordinating the many Federal programs that affect our cities. A
    more comprehensive approach is needed, both to develop an effective
    strategy for urban America and to coordinate the actions of the
    many executive departments and agencies whose actions impact urban
    life.
      Sec. 2. Establishment. There is established within the Executive
    Office of the President the White House Office of Urban Affairs
    (the "Office").
      Sec. 3. Functions. The principal functions of the Office are, to
    the extent permitted by law:
      (a) to provide leadership for and coordinate the development of
    the policy agenda for urban America across executive departments
    and agencies;
      (b) to coordinate all aspects of urban policy;
      (c) to work with executive departments and agencies to ensure
    that appropriate consideration is given by such departments and
    agencies to the potential impact of their actions on urban areas;
      (d) to work with executive departments and agencies, including
    the Office of Management and Budget, to ensure that Federal
    Government dollars targeted to urban areas are effectively spent on
    the highest-impact programs; and
      (e) to engage in outreach and work closely with State and local
    officials, with nonprofit organizations, and with the private
    sector, both in seeking input regarding the development of a
    comprehensive urban policy and in ensuring that the implementation
    of Federal programs advances the objectives of that policy.
      Sec. 4. Coordination. In performing its functions, the Office
    shall work closely with all relevant executive departments and
    agencies, and offices and councils within the Executive Office of
    the President, including but not limited to:
      (a) the Department of the Treasury;
      (b) the Department of Justice;
      (c) the Department of Commerce;
      (d) the Department of Labor;
      (e) the Department of Health and Human Services;
      (f) the Department of Housing and Urban Development;
      (g) the Department of Transportation;
      (h) the Department of Energy;
      (i) the Department of Education; and
      (j) the Environmental Protection Agency.
      Sec. 5. Administration. (a) The Office may work with established
    or ad hoc committees, task forces, and interagency groups.
      (b) The Office shall have a staff headed by the Deputy Assistant
    to the President and Director of Urban Affairs (Director). The
    Director shall report jointly to the Assistant to the President for
    Intergovernmental Affairs and Public Liaison and to the Assistant
    to the President for Domestic Policy. The Office shall have such
    staff and other assistance as may be necessary to carry out the
    provisions of this order.
      (c) All executive departments and agencies shall cooperate with
    the Office and provide such information, support, and assistance to
    the Office as the Director may request, to the extent permitted by
    law.
      Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be
    construed to impair or otherwise affect:
        (i) authority granted by law to a department, agency, or the
      head thereof; or
        (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
      Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
      proposals.
      (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable
    law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
      (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
    or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in
    equity by any party against the United States, its departments,
    agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any
    other person.

    as follows:

        (13) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;
        (14) the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers;
        (15) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency;

    Recovery) shall serve as Executive Director of the Council and
    shall coordinate the Council's activities. At the direction of the
    Co-Chairs, the Council may establish subgroups consisting
    exclusively of Council members or their designees, as appropriate.
      Sec. 3. Mission and Functions. The Council shall perform the
    following functions, to the extent permitted by law:

          WHITE HOUSE TASK FORCE ON MIDDLE-CLASS WORKING FAMILIES      
      Memorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 30, 2009, 74
    F.R. 5979, provided:
      Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
      For many years, middle-class Americans have been working harder,
    yet not enjoying their fair share of the fruits of a growing
    economy. While the productivity of the American workforce grew
    during the decade ending in 2007, middle-income workers saw their
    real incomes fall. The current economic situation has exacerbated
    the challenges facing middle-class Americans, with health care
    coverage, safe and steady employment opportunities, effective and
    affordable education, owning a home, and saving for retirement
    slipping out of reach. It is a high priority of my Administration
    to achieve a secure future for middle-class working families, one
    in which they share in prosperous times and are cushioned during
    hard times. To these ends, I hereby direct the following:
      Section 1. White House Task Force on Middle-Class Working
    Families. There is established within the Office of the Vice
    President, a White House Task Force on Middle-Class Working
    Families (Task Force) to focus on raising the living standards of
    middle-class working families in the United States of America. The
    Vice President shall serve as Chair of the Task Force.
      (a) Membership of the Task Force. In addition to the Vice
    President, the Task Force shall consist exclusively of the heads of
    the executive branch departments, agencies, and offices listed
    below:
      (1) the Department of Commerce;
      (2) the Department of Labor;
      (3) the Department of Health and Human Services;
      (4) the Department of Education;
      (5) the Office of Management and Budget;
      (6) the National Economic Council;
      (7) the Domestic Policy Council;
      (8) the Council of Economic Advisers; and
      (9) such other executive branch departments, agencies, or offices
    as the President may designate.
      A member of the Task Force may designate, to perform the Task
    Force functions of the member, any person who is a part of the
    member's department, agency, or office, and who is a full-time
    officer or employee of the Federal Government. At the direction of
    the Chair, the Task Force may establish subgroups consisting
    exclusively of Task Force members or their designees under this
    section, as appropriate.
      (b) Administration of the Task Force. The Department of Labor
    shall provide funding and administrative support for the Task Force
    to the extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations.
    The Vice President shall designate an Executive Director of the
    Task Force, who shall coordinate the work of the Task Force.
      Sec. 2. Mission and Functions of the Task Force. The Task Force
    shall work with a wide array of executive departments and agencies
    that have responsibility for key issues facing middle-class working
    families, expedite administrative reforms, propose Executive
    Orders, and develop legislative and policy proposals that can be of
    special importance to middle-class working families. The functions
    of the Task Force are advisory only and shall include, but shall
    not be limited to, producing a detailed set of recommendations to:
      (a) expand education and lifelong training opportunities;
      (b) improve work and family balance;
      (c) restore labor standards, including workplace safety;
      (d) protect the incomes of middle-class working families; and
      (e) protect retirement security.
      Sec. 3. Outreach. Consistent with the objectives set out in
    section 2 of this memorandum, the Task Force, in accordance with
    applicable law, in addition to regular meetings, shall conduct
    outreach with representatives of labor, business, nonprofit
    organizations, State and local government agencies, and other
    interested persons that will assist with the Task Force's
    development of a detailed set of recommendations.
      Sec. 4. Transparency and Reports. The Task Force shall facilitate
    the posting on the Internet of submissions by outside parties and
    engage in an open, two-way dialogue with the American people. The
    Task Force shall present to the President annual reports, beginning
    1 year from the date of this memorandum, on its findings and
    recommendations, which shall be made available to the public and
    posted on the Internet.
      Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) The heads of executive
    departments and agencies shall assist and provide information to
    the Task Force, consistent with applicable law, as may be necessary
    to carry out the functions of the Task Force. Each executive
    department and agency shall bear its own expense for participating
    in the Task Force.
      (b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or
    otherwise affect:
      (i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency,
    or the head thereof; or
      (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
    Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
    proposals.
      (c) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with
    applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
      (d) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any
    right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or
    in equity by any party against the United States, its departments,
    agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any
    other person.
      Sec. 6. Publication. The Secretary of Labor is authorized and
    directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

      "Sec. 2. The Congress declares it to be the purpose of this Act
    to promote the orderly transfer of the executive power in
    connection with the expiration of the term of office of a President

    requires that such transitions in the office of President be
    accomplished so as to assure continuity in the faithful execution
    of the laws and in the conduct of the affairs of the Federal
    Government, both domestic and foreign. Any disruption occasioned by
    the transfer of the executive power could produce results
    detrimental to the safety and well-being of the United States and
    its people. Accordingly, it is the intent of the Congress that
    appropriate actions be authorized and taken to avoid or minimize
    any disruption. In addition to the specific provisions contained in
    this Act directed toward that purpose, it is the intent of the
    Congress that all officers of the Government so conduct the affairs
    of the Government for which they exercise responsibility and
    authority as (1) to be mindful of problems occasioned by
    transitions in the office of President, (2) to take appropriate
    lawful steps to avoid or minimize disruptions that might be
    occasioned by the transfer of the executive power, and (3)
    otherwise to promote orderly transitions in the office of
    President.

    a rate per annum, payable monthly by the Secretary of the Treasury,
    which is equal to the annual rate of basic pay, as in effect from
    time to time, of the head of an executive department, as defined in
    section 101 of title 5, United States Code. However, such allowance
    shall not be paid for any period during which such former President
    holds an appointive or elective office or position in or under the

    highest annual rate of basic pay now or hereafter provided by law
    for positions at level II of the Executive Schedule under section
    5313 of title 5, United States Code. Amounts provided for
    'Allowances and Office Staff for Former Presidents' may be used to
    pay fees of an independent contractor who is not a member of the
    staff of the office of a former President for the review of
    Presidential records of a former President in connection with the
    transfer of such records to the National Archives and Records
    Administration or a Presidential Library without regard to the
    limitation on staff compensation set forth herein.
      "(c) The Administrator of General Services shall furnish for each
    former President suitable office space appropriately furnished and
    equipped, as determined by the Administrator, at such place within
    the United States as the former President shall specify.
      "(d) [Repealed. Pub. L. 86-682, Sec. 12(c), Sept. 2, 1960, 74

    receive from the United States a monetary allowance at a rate of
    $20,000 per annum, payable monthly by the Secretary of the
    Treasury, if such widow shall waive the right to each other annuity
    or pension to which she is entitled under any other Act of
    Congress. The monetary allowance of such widow - 
        "(1) commences on the day after the former President dies;
        "(2) terminates on the last day of the month before such widow -
       
          "(A) dies; or
          "(B) remarries before becoming 60 years of age; and
        "(3) is not payable for any period during which such widow
      holds an appointive or elective office or position in or under
      the Federal Government or the government of the District of
      Columbia to which is attached a rate of pay other than a nominal
      rate.
      "(f) As used in this section, the term 'former President' means a
    person - 
        "(1) who shall have held the office of President of the United
      States of America;
        "(2) whose service in such office shall have terminated other
      than by removal pursuant to section 4 of article II of the
      Constitution of the United States of America; and
        "(3) who does not then currently hold such office.
      "(g) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Administrator
    of General Services up to $1,000,000 for each former President and
    up to $500,000 for the spouse of each former President each fiscal
    year for security and travel related expenses: Provided, That under
    the provisions set forth in section 3056, paragraph (a),

    President and/or spouse was not receiving protection for a lifetime
