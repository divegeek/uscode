    Sec. 153. Perfecting bona fide claims to lands; exchange of private
      lands

-STATUTE-
      In all cases of unperfected bona fide claims lying within the
    said boundaries of said reserve, which claims have been properly
    initiated prior to September 2, 1902, said claims may be perfected
    upon compliance with the requirements of the laws respecting
    settlement, residence, improvements, and so forth, in the same
    manner in all respects as claims are perfected to other Government
    lands: Provided, That to the extent that the lands within said
    reserve are held in private ownership the Secretary of the Interior
    is authorized in his discretion to exchange therefor public lands
    of like area and value, which are surveyed, vacant, unappropriated,
    not mineral, not timbered, and not required for reservoir sites or
    other public uses or purposes. The private owners must, at their
    expense and by appropriate instruments of conveyance, surrender to
    the Government a full and unencumbered right and title to the
    private lands included in any exchange before patents are issued
    for or any rights attached to the public lands included therein,
    and no charge of any kind shall be made for issuing such patents.
    Upon completion of any exchange the lands surrendered to the
    Government shall become a part of said reserve in a like manner as
    if they had been public lands at the time of the establishment of
    said reserve. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed
    to authorize the issuance of any land scrip, and the State of South
    Dakota is granted the privilege of selecting from the public lands
    in said State an equal quantity of land in lieu of such portions of
    section sixteen included within said reserve as have not been sold
    or disposed of by said State and are not covered by an unperfected
    bona fide claim as above mentioned.

    CHAPTER 4 - SAINT ELIZABETHS HOSPITAL
    SUBCHAPTER III - MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

-HEAD-
    Sec. 225. Findings and purposes

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) Governmentally administered mental health services in the
      District of Columbia are currently provided through two separate
      public entities, the federally administered Saint Elizabeths
      Hospital and the Mental Health Services Administration of the
      District of Columbia Department of Human Resources.
        (2) The District of Columbia has a continuing responsibility to
      provide mental health services to its residents.
        (3) The Federal Government, through its operation of a national
      mental health program at Saint Elizabeths Hospital, has for over
      100 years assisted the District of Columbia in carrying out that
      responsibility.
        (4) Since its establishment by Congress in 1855, Saint
      Elizabeths Hospital has developed into a respected national
      mental health hospital and study, training, and treatment center,
      providing a range of quality mental health and related services,
      including - 
          (i) acute and chronic inpatient psychiatric care;
          (ii) outpatient psychiatric and substance abuse clinical and
        related services;
          (iii) Federal court system forensic psychiatry referral,
        evaluation, and patient treatment services for prisoners, and
        for individuals awaiting trial or requiring post-trial or post-
        sentence psychiatric evaluation;
          (iv) patient care and related services for designated classes
        of individuals entitled to mental health benefits under Federal
        law, such as certain members and employees of the United States
        Armed Forces and the Foreign Service, and residents of American
        overseas dependencies;
          (v) District of Columbia court system forensic psychiatry
        referral, evaluation, and patient treatment services for
        prisoners, and for individuals awaiting trial or requiring post-
        trial or postsentence psychiatric evaluation;
          (vi) programs for special populations such as the mentally
        ill deaf;
          (vii) support for basic and applied clinical psychiatric
        research and related patient services conducted by the National
        Institute of Mental Health and other institutions; and
          (viii) professional and paraprofessional training in the
        major mental health disciplines.

        (5) The continuation of the range of services currently
      provided by federally administered Saint Elizabeths Hospital must
      be assured, as these services are integrally related to - 
          (i) the availability of adequate mental health services to
        District of Columbia residents, nonresidents who require mental
        health services while in the District of Columbia, individuals
        entitled to mental health services under Federal law, and
        individuals referred by both Federal and local court systems;
        and
          (ii) the Nation's capacity to increase our knowledge and
        understanding about mental illness and to facilitate and
        continue the development and broad availability of sound and
        modern methods and approaches for the treatment of mental
        illness.

        (6) The assumption of all or selected functions, programs, and
      resources of Saint Elizabeths Hospital from the Federal
      Government by the District of Columbia, and the integration of
      those functions, resources, and programs into a comprehensive
      mental health care system administered solely by the District of
      Columbia, will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the
      services currently provided through those two separate entities
      by shifting the primary focus of care to an integrated community-
      based system.
        (7) Such assumption of all or selected functions, programs, and
      resources of Saint Elizabeths Hospital by the District of
      Columbia would further the principle of home rule for the
      District of Columbia.

      (b) It is the intent of Congress that - 
        (1) the District of Columbia have in operation no later than
      October 1, 1993, an integrated coordinated mental health system
      in the District which provides - 
          (A) high quality, cost-effective, and community-based
        programs and facilities;
          (B) a continuum of inpatient and outpatient mental health
        care, residential treatment, and support services through an
        appropriate balance of public and private resources; and
          (C) assurances that patient rights and medical needs are
        protected;

        (2) the comprehensive District mental health care system be in
      full compliance with the Federal court consent decree in Dixon v.
      Heckler;
        (3) the District and Federal Governments bear equitable shares
      of the costs of a transition from the present system to a
      comprehensive District mental health system;
        (4) the transition to a comprehensive District mental health
      system provided for by this subchapter be carried out with
      maximum consideration for the interests of employees of the
      Hospital and provide a right-of-first-refusal to such employees
      for employment at comparable levels in positions created under
      the system implementation plan;
        (5) the Federal Government have the responsibility for the
      retraining of Hospital employees to prepare such employees for
      the requirements of employment in a comprehensive District mental
      health system;
        (6) the Federal Government continue high quality mental health
      research, training, and demonstration programs at Saint
      Elizabeths Hospital;
        (7) the District government establish and maintain
      accreditation and licensing standards for all services provided
      in District mental health facilities which assure quality care
      consistent with appropriate Federal regulations and comparable
      with standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
      Hospitals; and
        (8) the comprehensive mental health system plan include a
      component for direct services for the homeless mentally ill.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Applicability
      The Mayor shall insure that the requirements of the Buy American
    Act of 1933, as amended [41 U.S.C. 10a et seq.], apply to all
    procurements made under this subchapter.
    (b) Determination by Mayor
      (1) If the Mayor, after consultation with the United States Trade
    Representative, determines that a foreign country which is party to
    an agreement described in paragraph (2) has violated the terms of
    the agreement by discriminating against certain types of products
    produced in the United States that are covered by the agreement,
    the United States Trade Representative shall rescind the waiver of
    the Buy American Act [41 U.S.C. 10a et seq.] with respect to such
    types of products produced in that foreign country.
      (2) An agreement referred to in paragraph (1) is any
    agreement,(!1) between the United States and a foreign country
    pursuant to which the head of an agency of the United States
    Government has waived the requirements of the Buy American Act with
    respect to certain products produced in the foreign country.

    (c) Report to Congress
      The Mayor shall submit to Congress a report on the amount of
    purchases from foreign entities under this subchapter from foreign
    entities in fiscal years 1992 and 1993. Such report shall
    separately indicate the dollar value of items for which the Buy
    American Act [41 U.S.C. 10a et seq.] was waived pursuant to any
    agreement described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, the Trade
    Agreement Act of 1979 (19 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.), or any
    international agreement to which the United States is a party.
    (d) "Buy American Act" defined
      For purposes of this section, the term "Buy American Act" means
    title III of the Act entitled "An Act making appropriations for the
    Treasury and Post Office Departments for the fiscal year ending
    June 30, 1934, and for other purposes", approved March 3, 1933 (41
    U.S.C. 10a et seq.).
    (e) Restrictions on contract awards
      No contract or subcontract made with funds authorized under this
    subchapter (!2) may be awarded for the procurement of an article,
    material, or supply produced or manufactured in a foreign country
    whose government unfairly maintains in government procurement a
    significant and persistent pattern or practice of discrimination
    against United States products or services which results in
    identifiable harm to United States businesses, as identified by the
    President pursuant to (!3) (g)(1)(A) of section 305 of the Trade
    Agreements Act of 1979 (19 U.S.C. 2515(g)(1)(A)). Any such
    determination shall be made in accordance with section 305.


    (f) Prohibition against fraudulent use of "Made in America" labels
      If it has been finally determined by a court or Federal agency
    that any person intentionally affixed a label bearing a "Made in
    America" inscription, or any inscription with the same meaning, to
    any product sold in or shipped to the United States that is not
    made in the United States, that person shall be ineligible to
    receive any contract or subcontract under this subchapter, pursuant
    to the debarment, suspension, and ineligibility procedures in
    subpart 9.4 of chapter 1 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations.

    Sec. 323. Transfer and release to State of residence or legal
      domicile, or to relative

-STATUTE-
      If, at the time of arrival in the United States, the residence or
    the legal domicile of an eligible person appearing to be in need of
    care and treatment in a mental hospital is known to be in a State,
    or whenever thereafter such a person's residence or legal domicile
    in a State is ascertained, the Secretary shall, if the person is
    then under his care (whether directly or pursuant to a contract or
    other arrangement under section 322 or 324 of this title), endeavor
    to arrange with the proper authorities of such State, or of a
    political subdivision thereof, for the assumption of responsibility
    for the care and treatment of such person by such authorities and
    shall, upon the making of such arrangement in writing, transfer and
    release such person to such authorities. In the event the State of
    the residence or legal domicile of an eligible person cannot be
    ascertained, or the Secretary is unable to arrange with the proper
    authorities of such State, or of a political subdivision thereof,
    for the assumption of responsibility for his care and treatment,
    the Secretary may, if he determines that the best interests of such
    person will be served thereby, transfer and release the eligible
    person to a relative who agrees in writing to assume responsibility
    for such person after having been fully informed as to his
    condition.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Persons liable; scope of liability; compromise or waiver;
      investigations; judicial proceedings
      Any person hospitalized under section 324 of this title or his
    estate, shall be liable to pay or contribute toward the payment of
    the costs or charges for his care and treatment to the same extent
    as such person would, if resident in the District of Columbia, be
    liable to pay, under the laws of the District of Columbia, for his
    care and maintenance in a hospital for the mentally ill in that
    jurisdiction. The Secretary may, in his discretion, where in his
    judgment substantial justice will be best served thereby or the
    probable recovery will not warrant the expense of collection,
    compromise or waive the whole or any portion of any claim under
    this section. In carrying out this section, the Secretary may make
    or cause to be made such investigations as may be necessary to
    determine the ability of any person hospitalized under section 324
    of this title to pay or contribute toward the cost of his
    hospitalization. All collections or reimbursement on account of the
    costs and charges for the care of the eligible person shall be
    deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. Any judicial
    proceedings to recover such costs or charges shall be brought in
    the name of the United States in any court of competent
    jurisdiction.
    (b) "Costs or charges" defined
      As used in this section, the term "costs or charges" means, in
    the case of hospitalization at a hospital under the jurisdiction of
    the Department of Health and Human Services, a per diem rate
    prescribed by the Secretary on a basis comparable to that charged
    for any other paying patients and, in the case of persons
    hospitalized elsewhere, the contract rate or a per diem rate fixed
    by the Secretary on the basis of the contract rate.

      involving property rights executed by a resident shall be
      promptly delivered, upon the death of the resident, to the proper
      court of record.
        (2) If a resident dies intestate and the heirs or legal
      representative of the deceased cannot be immediately ascertained,
      the Director shall retain all property left by the decedent for a
      three-year period beginning on the date of the death. If
      entitlement to such property is established to the satisfaction
      of the Director at any time during the three-year period, the
      Director shall distribute the decedent's property, in equal pro-
      rata shares when multiple beneficiaries have been identified, to
      the highest following categories of identified survivors (listed
      in the order of precedence indicated):
          (A) The surviving spouse or legal representative.
          (B) The children of the deceased.
          (C) The parents of the deceased.
          (D) The siblings of the deceased.
          (E) The next-of-kin of the deceased.
    (b) Sale of effects
      (1)(A) If the disposition of the estate of a resident of the
    Retirement Home cannot be accomplished under subsection (a)(2) of
    this section or if a resident dies testate and the nominated
    fiduciary, legatees, or heirs of the resident cannot be immediately
    ascertained, the entirety of the deceased resident's domiciliary
    estate and the entirety of any ancillary estate that is unclaimed
    at the end of the three-year period beginning on the date of the
    death of the resident shall escheat to the Retirement Home.
      (B) Upon the sale of any such unclaimed estate property, the
    proceeds of the sale shall be deposited in the Armed Forces
    Retirement Home Trust Fund.
      (C) If a personal representative or other fiduciary is appointed
    to administer a deceased resident's estate and the administration
    is completed before the end of such three-year period, the balance
    of the entire net proceeds of the estate, less expenses, shall be
    deposited directly in the Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund.
    The heirs or legatees of the deceased resident may file a claim
    made with the Secretary of Defense to reclaim such proceeds. A
    determination of the claim by the Secretary shall be subject to
    judicial review exclusively by the United States Court of Federal
    Claims.
      (2)(A) The Director of a facility of the Retirement Home may
    designate an attorney who is a full-time officer or employee of the
    United States or a member of the Armed Forces on active duty to
    serve as attorney or agent for the facility in any probate
    proceeding in which the Retirement Home may have a legal interest
    as nominated fiduciary, testamentary legatee, escheat legatee, or
    in any other capacity.
      (B) An attorney designated under this paragraph may, in the
    domiciliary jurisdiction of the deceased resident and in any
    ancillary jurisdiction, petition for appointment as fiduciary. The
    attorney shall have priority over any petitioners (other than the
    deceased resident's nominated fiduciary, named legatees, or heirs)
    to serve as fiduciary. In a probate proceeding in which the heirs
    of an intestate deceased resident cannot be located and in a
    probate proceeding in which the nominated fiduciary, legatees, or
    heirs of a testate deceased resident cannot be located, the
    attorney shall be appointed as the fiduciary of the deceased
    resident's estate.
      (3) The designation of an employee or representative of a
    facility of the Retirement Home as personal representative of the
    estate of a resident of the Retirement Home or as a legatee under
    the will or codicil of the resident shall not disqualify an
    employee or staff member of that facility from serving as a
    competent witness to a will or codicil of the resident.
      (4) After the end of the three-year period beginning on the date
    of the death of a resident of a facility, the Director of the
    facility shall dispose of all property of the deceased resident
    that is not otherwise disposed of under this subsection, including
    personal effects such as decorations, medals, and citations to
    which a right has not been established under subsection (a) of this
    section. Disposal may be made within the discretion of the Director
    by - 
        (A) retaining such property or effects for the facility;
        (B) offering such items to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, a
      State, another military home, a museum, or any other institution
      having an interest in such items; or
        (C) destroying any items determined by the Director to be
      valueless.
    (c) Transfer of proceeds to Fund
      The net proceeds received by the Directors from the sale of
    effects under subsection (b) of this section shall be deposited in
    the Fund.
    (d) Subsequent claim
      (1) A claim for the net proceeds of the sale under subsection (b)
    of this section of the effects of a deceased may be filed with the
    Secretary of Defense at any time within six years after the death
    of the deceased, for action under section 2771 of title 10.
      (2) A claim referred to in paragraph (1) may not be considered by
    a court or the Secretary unless the claim is filed within the time
    period prescribed in such paragraph.
      (3) A claim allowed by the Secretary under paragraph (1) shall be
    certified to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment from the
    Fund in the amount found due, including any interest relating to
    the amount. No claim may be allowed or paid in excess of the net
    proceeds of the estate deposited in the Fund under subsection (c)
    of this section plus interest.
    (e) Unclaimed property
      In the case of property delivered to the Retirement Home under
    section 2575 of title 10, the Director of the facility shall
    deliver the property to the owner, the heirs or next of kin of the
    owner, or the legal representative of the owner, if a right to the
    property is established to the satisfaction of the Director of the
