       EX. ORD. NO. 13231. CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION IN THE
                              INFORMATION AGE
      Ex. Ord. No. 13231, Oct. 16, 2001, 66 F.R. 53063, as amended by
    Ex. Ord. No. 13284, Sec. 2, Jan. 23, 2003, 68 F.R. 4075; Ex. Ord.
    No. 13286, Sec. 7, Feb. 28, 2003, 68 F.R. 10620; Ex. Ord. No.
    13385, Sec. 5, Sept. 29, 2005, 70 F.R. 57990, provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to
    ensure protection of information systems for critical
    infrastructure, including emergency preparedness communications and
    the physical assets that support such systems, in the information
    age, it is hereby ordered as follows:
      Section 1. Policy. The information technology revolution has
    changed the way business is transacted, government operates, and
    national defense is conducted. Those three functions now depend on
    an interdependent network of critical information infrastructures.
    It is the policy of the United States to protect against disruption
    of the operation of information systems for critical infrastructure
    and thereby help to protect the people, economy, essential human
    and government services, and national security of the United
    States, and to ensure that any disruptions that occur are
    infrequent, of minimal duration, and manageable, and cause the
    least damage possible. The implementation of this policy shall
    include a voluntary public-private partnership, involving corporate
    and nongovernmental organizations.
      Sec. 2. Continuing Authorities. This order does not alter the
    existing authorities or roles of United States Government
    departments and agencies. Authorities set forth in 44 U.S.C.
    chapter 35, and other applicable law, provide senior officials with
    responsibility for the security of Federal Government information
    systems.
      (a) Executive Branch Information Systems Security. The Director
    of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has the responsibility
    to develop and oversee the implementation of government-wide
    policies, principles, standards, and guidelines for the security of
    information systems that support the executive branch departments
    and agencies, except those noted in section 2(b) of this order. The
    Director of OMB shall advise the President and the appropriate
    department or agency head when there is a critical deficiency in
    the security practices within the purview of this section in an
    executive branch department or agency.
      (b) National Security Information Systems. The Secretary of
    Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) shall have
    responsibility to oversee, develop, and ensure implementation of
    policies, principles, standards, and guidelines for the security of
    information systems that support the operations under their
    respective control. In consultation with the Assistant to the
    President for National Security Affairs and the affected
    departments and agencies, the Secretary of Defense and the DCI
    shall develop policies, principles, standards, and guidelines for
    the security of national security information systems that support
    the operations of other executive branch departments and agencies
    with national security information.
        (i) Policies, principles, standards, and guidelines developed
      under this subsection may require more stringent protection than
      those developed in accordance with section 2(a) of this order.
        (ii) The Assistant to the President for National Security
      Affairs shall advise the President and the appropriate department
      or agency when there is a critical deficiency in the security
      practices of a department or agency within the purview of this
      section.
        (iii) National Security Systems. The National Security
      Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Committee, as
      established by and consistent with NSD-42 and chaired by the
      Department of Defense, shall be designated as the "Committee on
      National Security Systems."
      (c) Additional Responsibilities. The heads of executive branch
    departments and agencies are responsible and accountable for
    providing and maintaining adequate levels of security for
    information systems, including emergency preparedness
    communications systems, for programs under their control. Heads of
    such departments and agencies shall ensure the development and,
    within available appropriations, funding of programs that
    adequately address these mission systems, especially those critical
    systems that support the national security and other essential
    government programs. Additionally, security should enable, and not
    unnecessarily impede, department and agency business operations.
      Sec. 3. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council. The
    National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC), established on
    October 16, 2001, shall provide the President through the Secretary
    of Homeland Security with advice on the security of the critical
    infrastructure sectors and their information systems.
      (a) Membership. The NIAC shall be composed of not more than 30
    members appointed by the President, taking appropriate account of
    the benefits of having members (i) from the private sector,
    including but not limited to banking and finance, transportation,
    energy, communications, and emergency services organizations and
    institutions of higher learning, and State, local, and tribal
    governments, (ii) with senior leadership responsibilities for the
    reliability and availability, which include security, of the
    critical infrastructure and key resource sectors, (iii) with
    expertise relevant to the functions of the NIAC, and (iv) with
    experience equivalent to that of a chief executive of an
    organization. Unless otherwise determined by the President, no full-
    time officer or employee of the executive branch shall be
    appointed to serve as a member of the NIAC. The President shall
    designate from among the members of the NIAC a Chair and a Vice
    Chair, who shall perform the functions of the Chair if the Chair is
    absent, disabled, or in the instance of a vacancy in the Chair.
      (b) Functions of the NIAC. The NIAC shall meet periodically to:
        (i) enhance the partnership of the public and private sectors
      in protecting critical infrastructures and their information
      systems and provide reports on this issue to the President
      through the Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate;
        (ii) propose and develop ways to encourage private industry to
      perform periodic risk assessments;
        (iii) monitor the development and operations of private sector
      coordinating councils and their information sharing mechanisms
      and provide recommendations to the President through the
      Secretary of Homeland Security on how these organizations can
      best foster improved cooperation among the sectors, the
      Department of Homeland Security, and other Federal Government
      entities;
        (iv) report to the President through the Secretary of Homeland
      Security, who shall ensure appropriate coordination with the
      Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and
      Counterterrorism, the Assistant to the President for Economic
      Policy, and the Assistant to the President for National Security
      Affairs under the terms of this order; and
        (v) advise sector specific agencies with critical
      infrastructure responsibilities to include issues pertaining to
      sector and government coordinating councils and their information
      sharing mechanisms.
      (c) Administration of the NIAC.
        (i) The NIAC may hold hearings, conduct inquiries, and
      establish subcommittees, as appropriate.
        (ii) Upon request of the Chair, and to the extent permitted by
      law, the heads of the executive departments and agencies shall
      provide the NIAC with information and advice relating to its
      functions.
        (iii) Senior Federal Government officials may participate in
      the meetings of the NIAC, as appropriate.
        (iv) Members shall serve without compensation for their work on
      the NIAC. However, members may be reimbursed for travel expenses,
      including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law
      for persons serving intermittently in Federal Government service
      (5 U.S.C. 5701-5707).
        (v) To the extent permitted by law and subject to the
      availability of appropriations, the Department of Homeland
      Security shall provide the NIAC with administrative services,
      staff, and other support services, and such funds as may be
      necessary for the performance of the NIAC's functions.
      Sec. 4. Judicial Review. This order does not create any right or
    benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in
    equity, against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
    other entities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

    protection program, designated under section 132 of this title, to
    enter into a voluntary agreement to promote critical infrastructure

    (g) Definitions
      In this section:
      (1) Interoperable communications
        The term "interoperable communications" means the ability of
      emergency response providers and relevant Federal, State, and
      local government agencies to communicate with each other as
      necessary, through a dedicated public safety network utilizing
      information technology systems and radio communications systems,
      and to exchange voice, data, and video with one another on
      demand, in real time, as necessary.
      (2) Emergency response providers
        The term "emergency response providers" has the meaning that
      term has under section 101 of this title.
    (h) Omitted
    (i) Sense of Congress regarding interoperable communications
      (1) Finding
        The Congress finds that - 
          (A) many first responders working in the same jurisdiction or
        in different jurisdictions cannot effectively and efficiently
        communicate with one another; and
          (B) their inability to do so threatens the public's safety
        and may result in unnecessary loss of lives and property.
      (2) Sense of Congress
        It is the sense of Congress that interoperable emergency
      communications systems and radios should continue to be deployed
      as soon as practicable for use by the first responder community,
      and that upgraded and new digital communications systems and new
      digital radios must meet prevailing national, voluntary consensus
      standards for interoperability.

        (1) an organizational chart depicting the covered entities
      after their restructuring pursuant to this chapter;
        (2) a summary description of how the authority under this
      section will be used to help carry out that restructuring; and
        (3) the information specified in section 663(b)(2) of Public
      Law 104-208 (5 U.S.C. 5597 note).

    As used in the preceding sentence, the "appropriate committees of
    Congress" are the Committees on Appropriations, Government Reform,
    and the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, and the
    Committees on Appropriations, Governmental Affairs, and the
    Judiciary of the Senate.
    (c) Authority
      The Attorney General and the Secretary may, to the extent
    necessary to help carry out their respective strategic
    restructuring plan described in subsection (b) of this section,
    make voluntary separation incentive payments to employees. Any such
    payment - 
        (1) shall be paid to the employee, in a lump sum, after the
      employee has separated from service;
        (2) shall be paid from appropriations or funds available for
      the payment of basic pay of the employee;
        (3) shall be equal to the lesser of - 
          (A) the amount the employee would be entitled to receive
        under section 5595(c) of title 5; or
          (B) an amount not to exceed $25,000, as determined by the
        Attorney General or the Secretary;

        (4) may not be made except in the case of any qualifying
      employee who voluntarily separates (whether by retirement or
      resignation) before the end of - 
          (A) the 3-month period beginning on the date on which such
        payment is offered or made available to such employee; or
          (B) the 3-year period beginning on November 25, 2002,

      whichever occurs first;
        (5) shall not be a basis for payment, and shall not be included
      in the computation, of any other type of Government benefit; and
        (6) shall not be taken into account in determining the amount
      of any severance pay to which the employee may be entitled under
      section 5595 of title 5, based on any other separation.
    (d) Additional agency contributions to the retirement fund
      (1) In general
        In addition to any payments which it is otherwise required to
      make, the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland
      Security shall, for each fiscal year with respect to which it
      makes any voluntary separation incentive payments under this
      section, remit to the Office of Personnel Management for deposit
      in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Civil
      Service Retirement and Disability Fund the amount required under
      paragraph (2).
      (2) Amount required
        The amount required under this paragraph shall, for any fiscal
      year, be the amount under subparagraph (A) or (B), whichever is
      greater.
        (A) First method
          The amount under this subparagraph shall, for any fiscal
        year, be equal to the minimum amount necessary to offset the
        additional costs to the retirement systems under title 5
        (payable out of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability
        Fund) resulting from the voluntary separation of the employees
        described in paragraph (3), as determined under regulations of
        the Office of Personnel Management.
        (B) Second method
          The amount under this subparagraph shall, for any fiscal
        year, be equal to 45 percent of the sum total of the final
        basic pay of the employees described in paragraph (3).
      (3) Computations to be based on separations occurring in the
        fiscal year involved
        The employees described in this paragraph are those employees
      who receive a voluntary separation incentive payment under this
      section based on their separating from service during the fiscal
      year with respect to which the payment under this subsection
      relates.
      (4) Final basic pay defined
        In this subsection, the term "final basic pay" means, with
      respect to an employee, the total amount of basic pay which would
      be payable for a year of service by such employee, computed using
      the employee's final rate of basic pay, and, if last serving on
      other than a full-time basis, with appropriate adjustment
      therefor.
    (e) Effect of subsequent employment with the Government
      An individual who receives a voluntary separation incentive
    payment under this section and who, within 5 years after the date
    of the separation on which the payment is based, accepts any
    compensated employment with the Government or works for any agency
    of the Government through a personal services contract, shall be
    required to pay, prior to the individual's first day of employment,
    the entire amount of the incentive payment. Such payment shall be
    made to the covered entity from which the individual separated or,
    if made on or after the transfer date, to the Deputy Secretary or
    the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security (for
    transfer to the appropriate component of the Department of Homeland
    Security, if necessary).
    (f) Effect on employment levels
      (1) Intended effect
        Voluntary separations under this section are not intended to
      necessarily reduce the total number of full-time equivalent
      positions in any covered entity.
      (2) Use of voluntary separations
        A covered entity may redeploy or use the full-time equivalent
      positions vacated by voluntary separations under this section to
      make other positions available to more critical locations or more
      critical occupations.

      The Attorney General and the Secretary may each, during a period
    ending not later than 5 years after November 25, 2002, conduct a
    demonstration project for the purpose of determining whether one or
    more changes in the policies or procedures relating to methods for
    disciplining employees would result in improved personnel
    management.
    (b) Scope
      A demonstration project under this section - 
        (1) may not cover any employees apart from those employed in or
      under a covered entity; and
        (2) shall not be limited by any provision of chapter 43, 75, or
      77 of title 5.
    (c) Procedures

    project within 120 days after the filing of an appeal or other
    formal request for review (referred to in subsection (c)(2) of this
    section), an employee shall be entitled to file a civil action to

      accorded exclusive recognition under chapter 71 of title 5.

      full-time or permanent part-time Federal employee, obtain such
      information and advice only in a manner that seeks individual
      advice and does not involve collective judgment or consensus
      advice or deliberation; and
        (iii) at the request of any agency head (or the agency head's
      designee under section 2(c) of this order) who is a member of the

            conduct certifications under this subsection; and

      their lives while battling the evils of terrorism around the
      world.
        (3) Personnel of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) charged

      around the world are often put in harm's way during their service
      to the United States.
        (4) Personnel of the Central Intelligence Agency have also lost
      their lives while battling the evils of terrorism around the
      world.

        (6) United States military personnel, CIA personnel, FBI

                                 FINDINGS                             
      Pub. L. 108-330, Sec. 2, Oct. 16, 2004, 118 Stat. 1275, provided
    that: "The Congress finds the following:
        "(1) Influential financial management leadership is of vital
      importance to the mission success of the Department of Homeland
      Security. For this reason, the Chief Financial Officer of the
      Department must be a key figure in the Department's management.
        "(2) To provide a sound financial leadership structure, the
      provisions of law enacted by the Chief Financial Officers Act of
      1990 (Public Law 101-576) [see Short Title of 1990 Amendment note
      set out under section 501 of Title 31, Money and Finance] provide
      that the Chief Financial Officer of each of the Federal executive
      departments is to be a Presidential appointee who reports
      directly to the Secretary of that department on financial
      management matters. Because the Department of Homeland Security
      was only recently created, the provisions enacted by that Act
      must be amended to include the Department within these
      provisions.
        "(3) The Department of Homeland Security was created by
      consolidation of 22 separate Federal agencies, each with its own
      accounting and financial management system. None of these systems
      was developed with a view to executing the mission of the
      Department of Homeland Security to prevent terrorist attacks
      within the United States, reduce the Nation's vulnerability to
      terrorism, and minimize the damage and assist in the recovery
      from terrorist attacks. For these reasons, a strong Chief
      Financial Officer is needed within the Department both to
      consolidate financial management operations, and to insure that
      management control systems are comprehensively designed to
      achieve the mission and execute the strategy of the Department.
        "(4) The provisions of law enacted by the Chief Financial
      Officers Act of 1990 require agency Chief Financial Officers to
      improve the financial information available to agency managers
      and the Congress. Those provisions also specify that agency
      financial management systems must provide for the systematic
      measurement of performance. In the case of the Department of
      Homeland Security, therefore, it is vitally important that
      management control systems be designed with a clear view of a
      homeland security strategy, including the priorities of the
      Department in addressing those risks of terrorism deemed most
      significant based upon a comprehensive assessment of potential
      threats, vulnerabilities, criticality, and consequences. For this
      reason, Federal law should be amended to clearly state the
      responsibilities of the Chief Financial Officer of the Department
      of Homeland Security to provide management control information,
      for the benefit of managers within the Department and to help
      inform the Congress, that permits an assessment of the
      Department's performance in executing a homeland security
      strategy."

        (1) procure the temporary or intermittent services of experts

      of Representatives detailing the projects for which the authority
      granted by subsection (a) was used, the rationale for its use,
      the funds spent using that authority, the outcome of each project
      for which that authority was used, and the results of any audits
      of such projects.

    (b) Exception
      An entity described in subsection (a) may have a direct financial
    interest in the development or construction of an individual system
    or element of a system of systems if - 
        (1) the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies to the
      Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of
      Representatives, the Committee on Homeland Security of the House
      of Representatives, the Committee on Transportation and
      Infrastructure of the House of Representatives, the Committee on
      Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the
      Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation of the Senate

    Part G - Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies

-HEAD-
    Sec. 442. Litigation management

-STATUTE-
    (a) Federal cause of action
      (1) In general
        There shall exist a Federal cause of action for claims arising
      out of, relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when
      qualified anti-terrorism technologies have been deployed in
      defense against or response or recovery from such act and such
      claims result or may result in loss to the Seller. The
      substantive law for decision in any such action shall be derived
      from the law, including choice of law principles, of the State in
      which such acts of terrorism occurred, unless such law is
      inconsistent with or preempted by Federal law. Such Federal cause
      of action shall be brought only for claims for injuries that are
      proximately caused by sellers that provide qualified anti-
      terrorism technology to Federal and non-Federal government
      customers.
      (2) Jurisdiction
        Such appropriate district court of the United States shall have
      original and exclusive jurisdiction over all actions for any
      claim for loss of property, personal injury, or death arising out
      of, relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when
      qualified anti-terrorism technologies have been deployed in
      defense against or response or recovery from such act and such
      claims result or may result in loss to the Seller.
    (b) Special rules
      In an action brought under this section for damages the following
    provisions apply:
      (1) Punitive damages
        No punitive damages intended to punish or deter, exemplary
      damages, or other damages not intended to compensate a plaintiff
      for actual losses may be awarded, nor shall any party be liable
      for interest prior to the judgment.
      (2) Noneconomic damages
        (A) In general
          Noneconomic damages may be awarded against a defendant only
        in an amount directly proportional to the percentage of
        responsibility of such defendant for the harm to the plaintiff,
        and no plaintiff may recover noneconomic damages unless the
        plaintiff suffered physical harm.
        (B) Definition
          For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term "noneconomic
        damages" means damages for losses for physical and emotional
        pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, mental
        anguish, disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of
        society and companionship, loss of consortium, hedonic damages,
        injury to reputation, and any other nonpecuniary losses.
    (c) Collateral sources
      Any recovery by a plaintiff in an action under this section shall
    be reduced by the amount of collateral source compensation, if any,
    that the plaintiff has received or is entitled to receive as a
    result of such acts of terrorism that result or may result in loss
    to the Seller.
    (d) Government contractor defense
      (1) In general
        Should a product liability or other lawsuit be filed for claims
      arising out of, relating to, or resulting from an act of
      terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies approved by
      the Secretary, as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this
      subsection, have been deployed in defense against or response or
      recovery from such act and such claims result or may result in
      loss to the Seller, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that
      the government contractor defense applies in such lawsuit. This
      presumption shall only be overcome by evidence showing that the
      Seller acted fraudulently or with willful misconduct in
      submitting information to the Secretary during the course of the
      Secretary's consideration of such technology under this
      subsection. This presumption of the government contractor defense
      shall apply regardless of whether the claim against the Seller
      arises from a sale of the product to Federal Government or non-
      Federal Government customers.
      (2) Exclusive responsibility
        The Secretary will be exclusively responsible for the review
      and approval of anti-terrorism technology for purposes of
      establishing a government contractor defense in any product
      liability lawsuit for claims arising out of, relating to, or
      resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism
      technologies approved by the Secretary, as provided in this
      paragraph and paragraph (3), have been deployed in defense
      against or response or recovery from such act and such claims
      result or may result in loss to the Seller. Upon the Seller's
      submission to the Secretary for approval of anti-terrorism
      technology, the Secretary will conduct a comprehensive review of
      the design of such technology and determine whether it will
      perform as intended, conforms to the Seller's specifications, and
      is safe for use as intended. The Seller will conduct safety and
      hazard analyses on such technology and will supply the Secretary
      with all such information.
      (3) Certificate
        For anti-terrorism technology reviewed and approved by the
      Secretary, the Secretary will issue a certificate of conformance
      to the Seller and place the anti-terrorism technology on an
      Approved Product List for Homeland Security.
    (e) Exclusion
      Nothing in this section shall in any way limit the ability of any
    person to seek any form of recovery from any person, government, or
    other entity that - 
        (1) attempts to commit, knowingly participates in, aids and
      abets, or commits any act of terrorism, or any criminal act
      related to or resulting from such act of terrorism; or
        (2) participates in a conspiracy to commit any such act of
      terrorism or any such criminal act.

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      (1) Liability insurance required
        Any person or entity that sells or otherwise provides a
      qualified anti-terrorism technology to Federal and non-Federal
      Government customers ("Seller") shall obtain liability insurance
      of such types and in such amounts as shall be required in
      accordance with this section and certified by the Secretary to
      satisfy otherwise compensable third-party claims arising out of,
      relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified
      anti-terrorism technologies have been deployed in defense against
      or response or recovery from such act.
      (2) Maximum amount
        For the total claims related to 1 such act of terrorism, the
      Seller is not required to obtain liability insurance of more than
      the maximum amount of liability insurance reasonably available
      from private sources on the world market at prices and terms that
      will not unreasonably distort the sales price of Seller's anti-
      terrorism technologies.
      (3) Scope of coverage
        Liability insurance obtained pursuant to this subsection shall,
      in addition to the Seller, protect the following, to the extent
      of their potential liability for involvement in the manufacture,
      qualification, sale, use, or operation of qualified anti-
      terrorism technologies deployed in defense against or response
      or recovery from an act of terrorism:
          (A) Contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, vendors and
        customers of the Seller.
          (B) Contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, and vendors of
        the customer.
      (4) Third party claims
        Such liability insurance under this section shall provide
      coverage against third party claims arising out of, relating to,
      or resulting from the sale or use of anti-terrorism technologies.
    (b) Reciprocal waiver of claims
      The Seller shall enter into a reciprocal waiver of claims with
    its contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, vendors and customers,
    and contractors and subcontractors of the customers, involved in
    the manufacture, sale, use or operation of qualified anti-terrorism
    technologies, under which each party to the waiver agrees to be
    responsible for losses, including business interruption losses,
    that it sustains, or for losses sustained by its own employees
    resulting from an activity resulting from an act of terrorism when
    qualified anti-terrorism technologies have been deployed in defense
    against or response or recovery from such act.
    (c) Extent of liability
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, liability for all
    claims against a Seller arising out of, relating to, or resulting
    from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies
    have been deployed in defense against or response or recovery from
    such act and such claims result or may result in loss to the
    Seller, whether for compensatory or punitive damages or for
    contribution or indemnity, shall not be in an amount greater than
    the limits of liability insurance coverage required to be
    maintained by the Seller under this section.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 466. Sense of Congress reaffirming the continued importance
      and applicability of the Posse Comitatus Act

-STATUTE-
    (a) Findings
      Congress finds the following:
        (1) Section 1385 of title 18 (commonly known as the "Posse
      Comitatus Act") prohibits the use of the Armed Forces as a posse
      comitatus to execute the laws except in cases and under
      circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of
      Congress.
        (2) Enacted in 1878, the Posse Comitatus Act was expressly
      intended to prevent United States Marshals, on their own
      initiative, from calling on the Army for assistance in enforcing
      Federal law.
        (3) The Posse Comitatus Act has served the Nation well in
      limiting the use of the Armed Forces to enforce the law.
        (4) Nevertheless, by its express terms, the Posse Comitatus Act
      is not a complete barrier to the use of the Armed Forces for a
      range of domestic purposes, including law enforcement functions,
      when the use of the Armed Forces is authorized by Act of Congress
      or the President determines that the use of the Armed Forces is
      required to fulfill the President's obligations under the
      Constitution to respond promptly in time of war, insurrection, or
      other serious emergency.
        (5) Existing laws, including chapter 15 of title 10 (commonly
      known as the "Insurrection Act"), and the Robert T. Stafford
      Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et
      seq.), grant the President broad powers that may be invoked in
      the event of domestic emergencies, including an attack against
      the Nation using weapons of mass destruction, and these laws
      specifically authorize the President to use the Armed Forces to
      help restore public order.
    (b) Sense of Congress
      Congress reaffirms the continued importance of section 1385 of
    title 18, and it is the sense of Congress that nothing in this
    chapter should be construed to alter the applicability of such
    section to any use of the Armed Forces as a posse comitatus to
    execute the laws.

      notify the person providing the training of the determination and
      that person shall not provide the training or if such training
      has commenced that person shall immediately terminate the
      training.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Short title
      This part may be cited as the "Homeland Security Information
    Sharing Act".
    (b) Findings
      Congress finds the following:
        (1) The Federal Government is required by the Constitution to
      provide for the common defense, which includes terrorist attack.
        (2) The Federal Government relies on State and local personnel
      to protect against terrorist attack.
        (3) The Federal Government collects, creates, manages, and
      protects classified and sensitive but unclassified information to
      enhance homeland security.
        (4) Some homeland security information is needed by the State
      and local personnel to prevent and prepare for terrorist attack.
        (5) The needs of State and local personnel to have access to
      relevant homeland security information to combat terrorism must
      be reconciled with the need to preserve the protected status of
      such information and to protect the sources and methods used to
      acquire such information.
        (6) Granting security clearances to certain State and local
      personnel is one way to facilitate the sharing of information
      regarding specific terrorist threats among Federal, State, and
      local levels of government.
        (7) Methods exist to declassify, redact, or otherwise adapt
      classified information so it may be shared with State and local
      personnel without the need for granting additional security
      clearances.
        (8) State and local personnel have capabilities and
      opportunities to gather information on suspicious activities and
      terrorist threats not possessed by Federal agencies.
        (9) The Federal Government and State and local governments and
      agencies in other jurisdictions may benefit from such
      information.
        (10) Federal, State, and local governments and intelligence,
      law enforcement, and other emergency preparation and response
      agencies must act in partnership to maximize the benefits of
      information gathering and analysis to prevent and respond to
      terrorist attacks.
        (11) Information systems, including the National Law
      Enforcement Telecommunications System and the Terrorist Threat
      Warning System, have been established for rapid sharing of
      classified and sensitive but unclassified information among
      Federal, State, and local entities.
        (12) Increased efforts to share homeland security information
      should avoid duplicating existing information systems.
    (c) Sense of Congress
      It is the sense of Congress that Federal, State, and local
    entities should share homeland security information to the maximum
    extent practicable, with special emphasis on hard-to-reach urban
    and rural communities.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 482. Facilitating homeland security information sharing
      procedures

-STATUTE-
    (a) Procedures for determining extent of sharing of homeland
      security information
      (1) The President shall prescribe and implement procedures under
    which relevant Federal agencies - 
        (A) share relevant and appropriate homeland security
      information with other Federal agencies, including the
      Department, and appropriate State and local personnel;
        (B) identify and safeguard homeland security information that
      is sensitive but unclassified; and
        (C) to the extent such information is in classified form,
      determine whether, how, and to what extent to remove classified
      information, as appropriate, and with which such personnel it may
      be shared after such information is removed.

      (2) The President shall ensure that such procedures apply to all
    agencies of the Federal Government.
      (3) Such procedures shall not change the substantive requirements
    for the classification and safeguarding of classified information.
      (4) Such procedures shall not change the requirements and
    authorities to protect sources and methods.
    (b) Procedures for sharing of homeland security information
      (1) Under procedures prescribed by the President, all appropriate
    agencies, including the intelligence community, shall, through
    information sharing systems, share homeland security information
    with Federal agencies and appropriate State and local personnel to
    the extent such information may be shared, as determined in
    accordance with subsection (a) of this section, together with
    assessments of the credibility of such information.
      (2) Each information sharing system through which information is
    shared under paragraph (1) shall - 
        (A) have the capability to transmit unclassified or classified
      information, though the procedures and recipients for each
      capability may differ;
        (B) have the capability to restrict delivery of information to
      specified subgroups by geographic location, type of organization,
      position of a recipient within an organization, or a recipient's
      need to know such information;
        (C) be configured to allow the efficient and effective sharing
      of information; and
        (D) be accessible to appropriate State and local personnel.

      (3) The procedures prescribed under paragraph (1) shall establish
    conditions on the use of information shared under paragraph (1) - 
        (A) to limit the redissemination of such information to ensure
      that such information is not used for an unauthorized purpose;
        (B) to ensure the security and confidentiality of such
      information;
        (C) to protect the constitutional and statutory rights of any
      individuals who are subjects of such information; and
        (D) to provide data integrity through the timely removal and
      destruction of obsolete or erroneous names and information.

      (4) The procedures prescribed under paragraph (1) shall ensure,
    to the greatest extent practicable, that the information sharing
    system through which information is shared under such paragraph
    include existing information sharing systems, including, but not
    limited to, the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System,
    the Regional Information Sharing System, and the Terrorist Threat
    Warning System of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
      (5) Each appropriate Federal agency, as determined by the
    President, shall have access to each information sharing system
    through which information is shared under paragraph (1), and shall
    therefore have access to all information, as appropriate, shared
    under such paragraph.
      (6) The procedures prescribed under paragraph (1) shall ensure
    that appropriate State and local personnel are authorized to use
    such information sharing systems - 
        (A) to access information shared with such personnel; and
        (B) to share, with others who have access to such information
      sharing systems, the homeland security information of their own
      jurisdictions, which shall be marked appropriately as pertaining
      to potential terrorist activity.

      (7) Under procedures prescribed jointly by the Director of
    Central Intelligence and the Attorney General, each appropriate
    Federal agency, as determined by the President, shall review and
    assess the information shared under paragraph (6) and integrate
    such information with existing intelligence.
    (c) Sharing of classified information and sensitive but
      unclassified information with State and local personnel
      (1) The President shall prescribe procedures under which Federal
    agencies may, to the extent the President considers necessary,
    share with appropriate State and local personnel homeland security
    information that remains classified or otherwise protected after
    the determinations prescribed under the procedures set forth in
    subsection (a) of this section.
      (2) It is the sense of Congress that such procedures may include
    1 or more of the following means:
        (A) Carrying out security clearance investigations with respect
      to appropriate State and local personnel.
        (B) With respect to information that is sensitive but
      unclassified, entering into nondisclosure agreements with
      appropriate State and local personnel.
        (C) Increased use of information-sharing partnerships that

        a group (commonly known as "collective and noncollective
        collaboration"), and across multiple levels of national
        security information and controlled unclassified information;
          (N) provides a resolution process that enables changes by
        authorized officials regarding rules and policies for the
        access, use, and retention of information within the scope of
        the information sharing environment; and
          (O) incorporates continuous, real-time, and immutable audit
        capabilities, to the maximum extent practicable.
    (c) Preliminary report

      using tearlines to separate out data from the sources and methods
      by which the data are obtained;

        necessary to protect national security; and

        (3) require the heads of Federal departments and agencies to
      promote a culture of information sharing by - 
          (A) reducing disincentives to information sharing, including

      (3) Specification of the funds available to each agency that will
    be transferred to the Department as a result of transfers under the
    plan.
        -- The attached tables [not set out in the Code] provide
      estimates of the funds available to the agencies and entities
      that will be transferred to the Department by operation of the
      Act. The two tables include total funding (mandatory and
      discretionary including fees) and discretionary funding net of
      fees. The tables provide the enacted levels for 2002 and 2002
      supplementals, and the President's requested levels for 2003.

      Because of the current state of the 2003 budget process,
      information concerning the funds that will be available to each
      transferring agency on the date of the proposed transfers is not
      currently available and will not likely be available during the
      time period in which the President is to submit this
      Reorganization Plan. As additional information becomes available,
      it will be provided as may be required in accordance with the
      procedures under the Act for modification of this Plan or other
      applicable law.

      (4) Specification of the proposed allocations within the
    Department of unexpended funds transferred in connection with
    transfers under the plan.
        -- The attached tables [not set out in the Code] provide
      estimates of the unobligated balances as of September 30, 2002,
      for the agencies and programs that will be transferred to the
      Department. The first table provides estimates of unobligated
      balances for the accounts that are moving to the Department in
      whole. The second table provides estimates of the unobligated
      balances in the accounts of which only a portion will be
      transferring to the new Department. These latter estimates,
      however, are of the unobligated balances for the full account,
      only a portion of which are associated with the activities that
      will be transferred to the Department. In addition, these
      unobligated balances are based on the Department of Treasury's
      estimates as of September 30, 2002, which are the latest
      available figures. Since October 1, 2002, Departments and
      agencies (except the Department of Defense) have been operating
      under continuing resolutions, and, as such, have been spending
      these balances to maintain current operations.

      Authority to reallocate unexpended funds of agencies transferred
      under this Plan is found in H.J. Res. 124 [Pub. L. 107-294, Nov.
      23, 2002, 116 Stat. 2062], the continuing resolution in effect
      currently and until January 11, 2003. The resolution provides
      authority for the Office of Management and Budget to transfer an
      amount not to exceed $140,000,000 from unobligated balances of
      appropriations enacted before October 1, 2002 "for organizations
      and entities that will be transferred to the new Department and
      for salaries and expenses associated with the initiation of the
      Department." Such authority may be exercised upon providing 15
      days' notice to the Appropriations Committees. We anticipate that
      it may be necessary to provide funding through such transfers
      both for transferring entities and for salaries and expenses
      associated with the initiation of the Department, including, for
      example, those associated with establishing the Office of the
      Secretary and other new offices provided for in the Act. Any plan
      to use such funding will follow the procedures required under the
      continuing resolution, including the provision of at least 15
      days' notice to the Appropriations Committees.

      (5) Specification of any proposed disposition of property,
    facilities, contracts, records, and other assets and obligations of
    agencies transferred under the plan.
        -- There is no intention to dispose of property, facility,
      contracts, records, and other assets and obligations of agencies
      transferred under the plan. All of such assets and obligations
      will transfer with each agency pursuant to Section 1511(d)(1) of
      the Act [6 U.S.C. 551(d)(1)].
        -- Prior to and during the transition period (as defined by
      Section 1501(a)(2) of the Act [6 U.S.C. 541(a)(2)]), the
      Department may identify property, facilities, contracts, records,
      and other assets and obligations of agencies transferred that
      would be candidates for disposition due to duplication, non-use,
      obsolescence, and the like. If and when any such proposed
      dispositions are identified, we will follow provisions of the Act
      relating to modification of this plan or further notification of
      Congress.

      (6) Specification of the proposed allocations within the
    Department of the functions of the agencies and subdivisions that
    are not related directly to securing the homeland.
        -- As agencies and subdivisions are transferred into the
      Department, any functions of those entities that are not directly
      related to securing the homeland will continue to be allocated to
      the agencies and subdivisions in which they are currently
      incorporated.

      REORGANIZATION PLAN MODIFICATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
                                 SECURITY

                               INTRODUCTION                           
      This Reorganization Plan Modification is submitted pursuant to
    the Homeland Security Act ("the Act") of 2002 [Pub. L. 107-296,
    Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2135]. All elements of the Department of
    Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002 ("the
    Plan") [set out above] remain as submitted except for those
    modifications addressed herein.

                          PURPOSE OF MODIFICATION                      
      This modification of the Plan is to establish and specify
    organizational units within the Border and Transportation Security
    Directorate. This modification presents a structural change, but
    does not consolidate, discontinue, or diminish transferred
    agencies' current operations in the field.

                            PLAN MODIFICATIONS                        
      (a) Rename the "Bureau of Border Security" the "Bureau of
    Immigration and Customs Enforcement." As required by the Act, this
    Bureau will be headed by an Assistant Secretary who will report
    directly to the Undersecretary for Border and Transportation
    Security.
        This Bureau will comprise Immigration Naturalization Service
      (INS) interior enforcement functions, including the detention and
      removal program, the intelligence program, and the investigations
      program. At the same time, pursuant to this modification, the
      interior enforcement resources and missions of the Customs
      Service and the Federal Protective Service will be added to this
      Bureau. The mission of the Bureau is:
        1. To enforce the full range of immigration and customs laws
      within the interior of the United States; and,
        2. To protect specified federal buildings.

      The Assistant Secretary will:
        1. Establish and oversee the administration of the policies for
      performing the detention and removal program, the intelligence
      program, and the investigation program functions as are - 
          (a) transferred to the Under Secretary for Border and
        Transportation Security by Section 441 of the Act [6 U.S.C.
        251] and delegated to the Assistant Secretary by the Under
        Secretary for Border and Transportation Security; or
          (b) otherwise vested in the Assistant Secretary by law.
        2. Advise the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation
      Security with respect to any policy or operation of the Bureau
      that may affect the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration
      Services established under subtitle E of the Act [probably means
      subtitle E of title IV of the Act, 6 U.S.C. 271 et seq.],
      including potentially conflicting policies and operations.
      (b) Rename the "Customs Service" the "Bureau of Customs and
    Border Protection." This Bureau will be headed by the Commissioner
    of Customs and will report to the Under Secretary for Border and
    Transportation Security.
        The Bureau will contain the resources and missions relating to
      borders and ports of entry of the Customs Service, the INS,
      including the Border Patrol and the inspections program, and the
      agricultural inspections function of the Agricultural Quarantine
      Inspection program.
      The Commissioner will:
        1. Establish and oversee the administration of the policies for
      performing the Border Patrol and inspections program functions as
      are - 
          (a) transferred to the Under Secretary for Border and
        Transportation Security by Section 441 of the Act [6 U.S.C.
        251] and delegated to the Commissioner by the Under Secretary
        for Border and Transportation Security; or
          (b) otherwise vested in the Assistant Secretary [probably
        should be "Commissioner"] by law.
        2. Advise the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation
      Security with respect to any policy or operation of the Bureau
      that may affect the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration
      Services established under subtitle E of the Act [probably means
      subtitle E of title IV of the Act, 6 U.S.C. 271 et seq.],
      including potentially conflicting policies and operations.

    March 1, 2003

      ELEMENTS REQUIRED BY THE ACT TO BE SUBMITTED WITH MODIFIED PLAN  
      (1) Identification of any functions of agencies transferred to
    the Department pursuant to this Act that will not be transferred to
    the Department under the plan.
      None.

      (2) Specification of the steps to be taken by the Secretary to
    organize the Department, including the delegation or assignment of
    functions transferred to the Department among officers of the
    Department in order to permit the Department to carry out the
    functions transferred under the plan.
      See plan modifications above.

      (3) Specification of the funds available to each agency that will
    be transferred to the Department as a result of transfers under the
    plan.
      The table attached at Tab A [not set out in the Code] provides
    estimates of the funds available to the agencies affected by this
    modification that will be transferred to the Department by
    operation of the Act. The table includes total funding (mandatory
    and discretionary including fees) and discretionary funding net of
    fees. The table provides the President's requested levels for 2003.
      Because of the current state of the 2003 budget process,
    information concerning the funds that will be available to each
    transferring agency on the date of the proposed transfers is not
    currently available. As additional information becomes available,
    it will be provided as may be required in accordance with the
    procedures under the Act for modification of this Plan or other
    applicable law.

      (4) Specification of the proposed allocations within the
    Department of unexpended funds transferred in connection with
    transfers under the plan.
      The table attached at Tab B [not set out in the Code] provides
    updated estimates of the unobligated balances as of September 30,
    2002, for the agencies affected by this modification that will be
    transferred to the Department. Since October 1, 2002, these
    agencies have been operating under continuing resolutions, and, as
    such, have been spending these balances to maintain current
    operations. As additional information becomes available, it will be
    provided as may be required in accordance with the procedures under
    the Act for modification of this Plan or other applicable law.

      (5) Specification of any proposed disposition of property,
    facilities, contracts, records, and other assets and obligations of
    agencies transferred under the plan.
      There is no intention to dispose of property, facilities,
    contracts, records, and other assets and obligations of agencies
    transferred under this modification. All such assets and
    obligations will transfer with each agency pursuant to Section
    1511(d)(1) of the Act [6 U.S.C. 551(d)(1)].

      (6) Specification of the proposed allocations within the
    Department of the functions of the agencies and subdivisions that
    are not related directly to securing the homeland.
      The functions of the agencies affected by this modification that
    are not directly related to securing the homeland will continue to
    be performed by the bureaus formed by this planned reorganization.

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      In allocating funds among States and high-risk urban areas

    Administrator shall consider, for each State or high-risk urban
    area - 
        (1) its relative threat, vulnerability, and consequences from
      acts of terrorism, including consideration of - 
          (A) its population, including appropriate consideration of
        military, tourist, and commuter populations;
          (B) its population density;
          (C) its history of threats, including whether it has been the
        target of a prior act of terrorism;
          (D) its degree of threat, vulnerability, and consequences
        related to critical infrastructure (for all critical
        infrastructure sectors) or key resources identified by the
        Administrator or the State homeland security plan, including
        threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences related to critical
        infrastructure or key resources in nearby jurisdictions;
          (E) the most current threat assessments available to the
        Department;
          (F) whether the State has, or the high-risk urban area is
        located at or near, an international border;
          (G) whether it has a coastline bordering an ocean (including
        the Gulf of Mexico) or international waters;
          (H) its likely need to respond to acts of terrorism occurring
        in nearby jurisdictions;
          (I) the extent to which it has unmet target capabilities;
          (J) in the case of a high-risk urban area, the extent to
        which that high-risk urban area includes - 
            (i) those incorporated municipalities, counties, parishes,
          and Indian tribes within the relevant eligible metropolitan
          area, the inclusion of which will enhance regional efforts to
          prevent, prepare for, protect against, and respond to acts of
          terrorism; and
            (ii) other local and tribal governments in the surrounding
          area that are likely to be called upon to respond to acts of
          terrorism within the high-risk urban area; and

          (K) such other factors as are specified in writing by the
        Administrator; and

        (2) the anticipated effectiveness of the proposed use of the
      grant by the State or high-risk urban area in increasing the
      ability of that State or high-risk urban area to prevent, prepare
      for, protect against, and respond to acts of terrorism, to meet
      its target capabilities, and to otherwise reduce the overall risk
      to the high-risk urban area, the State, or the Nation.
    (b) Types of threat
      In assessing threat under this section, the Administrator shall
    consider the following types of threat to critical infrastructure
    sectors and to populations in all areas of the United States, urban
    and rural:

        to a State or high-risk urban area for otherwise permissible
        uses under subsection (a) on the basis that a State or high-
        risk urban area has previously used State or local funds to
        support the same or similar uses; or

          purpose, or category of personnel, or personnel-related,
          costs.
        (B) Analysts

      (4) Construction
        (A) In general
          A grant awarded under section 604 or 605 of this title may
        not be used to acquire land or to construct buildings or other

      emergency response providers who are not otherwise compensated
      for travel to or participation in training or exercises related
      to the purposes of this part. Any such reimbursement shall not be
      considered compensation for purposes of rendering an emergency
      response provider an employee under the Fair Labor Standards Act

      under those sections for the reimbursement of the cost of any
      activity relating to preventing, preparing for, protecting
      against, or responding to acts of terrorism that is a Federal
      duty and usually performed by a Federal agency, and that is being
      performed by a State or local government under agreement with a
      Federal agency.
    (e) Flexibility in unspent homeland security grant funds
      Upon request by the recipient of a grant under section 604 or 605
    of this title, the Administrator may authorize the grant recipient
    to transfer all or part of the grant funds from uses specified in
    the grant agreement to other uses authorized under this section, if
    the Administrator determines that such transfer is in the interests
    of homeland security.
    (f) Equipment standards
      If an applicant for a grant under section 604 or 605 of this
    title proposes to upgrade or purchase, with assistance provided
    under that grant, new equipment or systems that do not meet or
    exceed any applicable national voluntary consensus standards
    developed under section 747 of this title, the applicant shall
    include in its application an explanation of why such equipment or
    systems will serve the needs of the applicant better than equipment
    or systems that meet or exceed such standards.

      requirements for regional plans.
    (b) Planning committees
      (1) In general
        Any State or high-risk urban area receiving a grant under

        population, and high-threat jurisdictions.
      (3) Existing planning committees
        Nothing in this subsection may be construed to require that any

            (iii) coordinate allocation of grant funds to avoid
          duplicative or inconsistent purchases by the recipients;
            (iv) make the programs more accessible and user friendly to
          applicants; and
            (v) ensure the programs are coordinated to enhance the
          overall preparedness of the Nation;

          (D) submit the information and recommendations under
        subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to the appropriate committees
        of Congress; and
          (E) provide the appropriate committees of Congress, the
        Comptroller General, and any officer or employee of the
        Government Accountability Office with full access to any
        information collected or reviewed in preparing the submission
        under subparagraph (D).
      (2) Scope of task
        Nothing in this subsection shall authorize the elimination, or
      the alteration of the purposes, as delineated by statute,
      regulation, or guidance, of any grant program that exists on
      August 3, 2007, nor authorize the review or preparation of
      proposals on the elimination, or the alteration of such purposes,
      of any such grant program.
    (d) Sense of Congress
      It is the sense of Congress that, in order to ensure that the
    Nation is most effectively able to prevent, prepare for, protect
    against, and respond to all hazards, including natural disasters,
    acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters - 
        (1) the Department should administer a coherent and coordinated
      system of both terrorism-focused and all-hazards grants;
        (2) there should be a continuing and appropriate balance
      between funding for terrorism-focused and all-hazards
      preparedness, as reflected in the authorizations of
      appropriations for grants under the amendments made by titles I
      and II, as applicable, of the Implementing Recommendations of the
      9/11 Commission Act of 2007; and
        (3) with respect to terrorism-focused grants, it is necessary
      to ensure both that the target capabilities of the highest risk
      areas are achieved quickly and that basic levels of preparedness,
      as measured by the attainment of target capabilities, are
      achieved nationwide.

        Congress as to the additional statutory authorities that the
        Administrator determines necessary.
    (b) Employees designated to serve
      The plan shall include procedures under which the Secretary shall
    designate employees of the Department who are not employees of the
    Agency and shall, in conjunction with the heads of other Executive
    agencies, designate employees of those other Executive agencies, as
    appropriate, to serve on the Surge Capacity Force.
    (c) Capabilities

      incidents; and
        (2) includes a sufficient number of full-time, highly trained
      individuals credentialed in accordance with section 320 of this
      title to lead and manage the Surge Capacity Force.
    (d) Training
      The plan shall ensure that the Administrator provides appropriate
    and continuous training to members of the Surge Capacity Force to
    ensure such personnel are adequately trained on the Agency's
    programs and policies for natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and
    other man-made disasters.
    (e) No impact on agency personnel ceiling
      Surge Capacity Force members shall not be counted against any
    personnel ceiling applicable to the Federal Emergency Management
    Agency.
    (f) Expenses
      The Administrator may provide members of the Surge Capacity Force
    with travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, at
    rates authorized for employees of agencies under subchapter I of
    chapter 57 of title 5 for the purpose of participating in any
    training that relates to service as a member of the Surge Capacity
    Force.
    (g) Immediate implementation of Surge Capacity Force involving
      Federal employees
      As soon as practicable after October 4, 2006, the Administrator
    shall develop and implement - 
        (1) the procedures under subsection (b); and
        (2) other elements of the plan needed to establish the portion

      high-risk cargo for inspection.
    (b) Requirement
      The Secretary, acting through the Commissioner, shall require the
    electronic transmission to the Department of additional data
    elements for improved high-risk targeting, including appropriate
    security elements of entry data, as determined by the Secretary, to
    be provided as advanced information with respect to cargo destined
    for importation into the United States prior to loading of such
    cargo on vessels at foreign seaports.
    (c) Consideration
      The Secretary, acting through the Commissioner, shall - 
        (1) consider the cost, benefit, and feasibility of - 
          (A) requiring additional nonmanifest documentation;

      If at any time a C-TPAT participant's security measures and
    supply chain security practices fail to meet any of the
    requirements under this part, the Commissioner may deny the
    participant benefits otherwise available under this part, in whole
    or in part. The Commissioner shall develop procedures that provide

      Not later than 30 days after the completion of the pilot program
    conducted pursuant to subsection (c), the Secretary shall submit a

      Ex. Ord. No. 13416, Dec. 5, 2006, 71 F.R. 71033, provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, and to strengthen the
    security of the Nation's surface transportation systems and thereby
    enhance the protection of the people, property, and territory of
    the United States of America against terrorist attacks, it is
    hereby ordered as follows:
      Section 1. Policy. The security of our Nation's surface
    transportation systems is a national priority, vital to our
    economy, and essential to the security of our Nation. Federal,
    State, local, and tribal governments, the private sector, and the
    public share responsibility for the security of surface
    transportation. It is the policy of the United States to protect
    the people, property, and territory of the United States by
    facilitating the implementation of a comprehensive, coordinated,
    and efficient security program to protect surface transportation
    systems within and adjacent to the United States against terrorist
    attacks.
      Sec. 2. Definitions. For purposes of this order:

      (c) "security guideline" means any security-related guidance that
    the Secretary recommends, for implementation on a voluntary basis,
    to enhance the security of surface transportation;
      (d) "security requirement" means any "regulatory action" as
    defined in section 3 of Executive Order 12866 of September 30,
    1993, as amended (Regulatory Planning and Review), including
    security directives when appropriate, to implement measures to
    enhance the security of surface transportation;
      (e) "surface transportation modes" means mass transit, commuter
    and long-distance passenger rail, freight rail, commercial vehicles
    (including intercity buses), and pipelines, and related
    infrastructure (including roads and highways), that are within the
    territory of the United States, but does not include electric
    grids; and
      (f) "surface transportation" means any conveyance of people,
    goods, or commodities using one or more surface transportation
    modes.
      Sec. 3. Functions of the Secretary of Homeland Security. The
    Secretary is the principal Federal official responsible for
    infrastructure protection activities for surface transportation. To
    implement the policy set forth in section 1 of this order, the
    Secretary shall, consistent with the National Infrastructure
    Protection Plan (NIPP), in coordination with the Secretary of
    Transportation, and in consultation with the heads of other
    relevant agencies:
      (a) assess the security of each surface transportation mode and
    evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of current Federal
    Government surface transportation security initiatives;
      (b) building upon current security initiatives, not later than
    December 31, 2006, develop a comprehensive transportation systems
    sector specific plan, as defined in the NIPP;
      (c) not later than 90 days after the comprehensive transportation
    systems sector specific plan is completed, develop an annex to such
    plan that addresses each surface transportation mode, which shall
    also include, at a minimum - 
      (i) an identification of existing security guidelines and
    security requirements and any security gaps, a description of how
    the transportation systems sector specific plan will be implemented
    for such mode, and the respective roles, responsibilities, and
    authorities of Federal, State, local, and tribal governments and
    the private sector;
      (ii) schedules and protocols for annual reviews of the
    effectiveness of surface transportation security-related
    information sharing mechanisms in bringing about the timely
    exchange of surface transportation security information among
    Federal, State, local, and tribal governments and the private
    sector, as appropriate; and
      (iii) a process for assessing (A) compliance with any security
    guidelines and security requirements issued by the Secretary for
    surface transportation, and (B) the need for revision of such

    attack, draft appropriate security guidelines or security
    requirements to mitigate such risks, and ensure that, prior to
    their issuance, draft security requirements are transmitted to the
    Office of Management and Budget for review in accordance with
    Executive Order 12866 and draft security guidelines receive
    appropriate interagency review;
      (e) develop, implement, and lead a process, in collaboration with
    other agencies, State, local, and tribal governments, and the
    private sector, as appropriate, to coordinate research,

      (f) use security grants authorized by law to assist in
    implementing security requirements and security guidelines issued
    pursuant to law and consistent with subsection (c) of this section.
      Sec. 4. Duties of Heads of Other Agencies. Heads of agencies, as
    appropriate, shall provide such assistance and information as the
    Secretary may request to implement this order.
      Sec. 5. General Provisions. This order:
      (a) shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and the
    authorities of agencies, or heads of agencies, vested by law, and
    subject to the availability of appropriations;

      the determination the Secretary provides the appropriate
      congressional committees and the public transportation agency
      written notification detailing the need for the security plan,
      the reasons grant funding has not been made available, and the
      reason the agency has been designated high risk.
    (d) Consistency with other plans
      The Secretary shall ensure that the security plans developed by
    public transportation agencies under this section are consistent
    with the security assessments developed by the Department and the
    National Strategy for Public Transportation Security developed
    under section 1133 of this title.

      based grant funds under section 1135 of this title, unless the
      Secretary notifies the appropriate congressional committees that
      the Secretary has determined an adjustment is necessary to
      respond to an urgent threat or other significant national
      security factors.
    (g) Shared facilities
      The Secretary shall encourage the development and implementation
    of coordinated assessments and security plans to the extent a
    public transportation agency shares facilities (such as tunnels,
    bridges, stations, or platforms) with another public transportation
    agency, a freight or passenger railroad carrier, or over-the-road
    bus operator that are geographically close or otherwise co-located.
    (h) Nondisclosure of information
      (1) Submission of information to Congress

        remedy contained in the preliminary order. Such hearings shall
        be conducted expeditiously. If a hearing is not requested in

          described in subsection (a) or (b) was a contributing factor
          in the unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint.
          (ii) Showing by employer
            Notwithstanding a finding by the Secretary of Labor that
          the complainant has made the showing required under clause
          (i), no investigation otherwise required under paragraph (A)
          shall be conducted if the employer demonstrates, by clear and
          convincing evidence, that the employer would have taken the
          same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that
          behavior.
          (iii) Criteria for determination by Secretary of Labor

          (b) was a contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel
          action alleged in the complaint.

          employer demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that

        or denying the complaint. At any time before issuance of a
        final order, a proceeding under this subsection may be
        terminated on the basis of a settlement agreement entered into
        by the Secretary of Labor, the complainant, and the person
        alleged to have committed the violation.
        (B) Remedy

        order was issued to require compliance with such order. The
        appropriate United States district court shall have
        jurisdiction, without regard to the amount in controversy or
        the citizenship of the parties, to enforce such order.
        (B) Attorney fees
          The court, in issuing any final order under this paragraph,
        may award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney
        and expert witness fees) to any party whenever the court
        determines such award is appropriate.
      (7) De novo review

      Secretary of Labor has not issued a final decision within 210
      days after the filing of the complaint and if the delay is not
      due to the bad faith of the employee, the employee may bring an
      original action at law or equity for de novo review in the
      appropriate district court of the United States, which shall have
      jurisdiction over such an action without regard to the amount in
      controversy, and which action shall, at the request of either
      party to such action, be tried by the court with a jury. The
      action shall be governed by the same legal burdens of proof
      specified in paragraph (2)(B) for review by the Secretary of
      Labor.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Railroad tank car vulnerability assessment
      (1) Assessment
        The Secretary shall assess the likely methods of a deliberate
      terrorist attack against a railroad tank car used to transport
      toxic-inhalation-hazard materials, and for each method assessed,
      the degree to which it may be successful in causing death,
      injury, or serious adverse effects to human health, the
      environment, critical infrastructure, national security, the
      national economy, or public welfare.
      (2) Threats
        In carrying out paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider the
      most current threat information as to likely methods of a
      successful terrorist attack on a railroad tank car transporting
      toxic-inhalation-hazard materials, and may consider the
      following:
          (A) Explosive devices placed along the tracks or attached to
        a railroad tank car.
          (B) The use of missiles, grenades, rockets, mortars, or other
        high-caliber weapons against a railroad tank car.
      (3) Physical testing
        In developing the assessment required under paragraph (1), the
      Secretary shall conduct physical testing of the vulnerability of
      railroad tank cars used to transport toxic-inhalation-hazard
      materials to different methods of a deliberate attack, using
      technical information and criteria to evaluate the structural
      integrity of railroad tank cars.
      (4) Report
        Not later than 30 days after the completion of the assessment
      under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall provide to the
      appropriate congressional committees a report, in the appropriate
      format, on such assessment.
    (b) Railroad tank car dispersion modeling
      (1) In general
        The Secretary, acting through the National Infrastructure
      Simulation and Analysis Center, shall conduct an air dispersion
      modeling analysis of release scenarios of toxic-inhalation-hazard
      materials resulting from a terrorist attack on a loaded railroad
      tank car carrying such materials in urban and rural environments.
      (2) Considerations
        The analysis under this subsection shall take into account the
      following considerations:
          (A) The most likely means of attack and the resulting
        dispersal rate.
          (B) Different times of day, to account for differences in
