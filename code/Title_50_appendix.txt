    provided:
      WHEREAS recent events in Korea and elsewhere constitute a grave
    threat to the peace of the world and imperil the efforts of this
    country and those of the United Nations to prevent aggression and
    armed conflict; and
      WHEREAS world conquest by communist imperialism is the goal of
    the forces of aggression that have been loosed upon the world; and
      WHEREAS, if the goal of communist imperialism were to be
    achieved, the people of this country would no longer enjoy the full
    and rich life they have with God's help built for themselves and
    their children; they would no longer enjoy the blessings of the
    freedom of worshipping as they severally choose, the freedom of
    reading and listening to what they choose, the right of free speech
    including the right to criticize their Government, the right to
    choose those who conduct their Government, the right to engage
    freely in collective bargaining, the right to engage freely in
    their own business enterprises, and the many other freedoms and
    rights which are a part of our way of life; and
      Whereas the increasing menace of the forces of communist
    aggression requires that the national defense of the United States
    be strengthened as speedily as possible:
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, HARRY S. TRUMAN, President of the United
    States of America, do proclaim the existence of a national
    emergency, which requires that the military, naval, air, and
    civilian defenses of this country be strengthened as speedily as
    possible to the end that we may be able to repeal any and all
    threats against our national security and to fulfill our
    responsibilities in the efforts being made through the United
    Nations and otherwise to bring about lasting peace.
      I summon all citizens to make a united effort for the security
    and well-being of our beloved country and to place its needs
    foremost in thought and action that the full moral and material
    strength of the Nation may be readied for the dangers which
    threaten us.
      I summon our farmers, our workers in industry, and our
    businessmen to make a mighty production effort to meet the defense
    requirements of the Nation and to this end to eliminate all waste
    and inefficiency and to subordinate all lesser interests to the
    common good.
      I summon every person and every community to make, with a spirit
    of neighborliness, whatever sacrifices are necessary for the
    welfare of the Nation.
      I summon all State and local leaders and officials to cooperate
    fully with the military and civilian defense agencies of the United
    States in the national defense program.
      I summon all citizens to be loyal to the principles upon which
    our Nation is founded, to keep faith with our friends and allies,
    and to be firm in our devotion to the peaceful purposes for which
    the United Nations was founded.
      I am confident that we will meet the dangers that confront us
    with courage and determination, strong in the faith that we can
    thereby "secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our
    Posterity."

    Ord. No. 8382, Mar. 25, 1940, 5 F.R. 1185, provided:
      WHEREAS the treaties of the United States, in any war in which
    the United States is a neutral, impose on the United States certain
    obligations to both neutral and belligerent nations;
      AND WHEREAS the treaties of the United States, in any war in
    which the United States is a neutral, require that the United
    States exert all the vigilance within their power to carry out
    their obligations as a neutral;
      AND WHEREAS treaties of the United States require that the Panama
    Canal shall be free and open, on terms of entire equality, to the

    laid down in Article 3 of the so-called Hay-Pauncefote treaty
    concluded between the United States and Great Britain, November 18,
    1901:
      NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by
    section 5 of the Panama Canal Act, approved August 24, 1912 (ch.
    390, sec. 5, 37 Stat. 562), as amended by the act of July 5, 1932
    (ch. 425, 47 Stat. 578), I hereby prescribe the following
    regulations governing the passage and control of vessels through
    the Panama Canal or any part thereof, including the locks and
    approaches thereto, in any war in which the United States is a
    neutral;
      1. Whenever considered necessary, in the opinion of the Governor
    of the Panama Canal, to prevent damage or injury to vessels or to
    prevent damage or injury to the Canal or its appurtenances, or to
    secure the observance of the rules, regulations, rights, or
    obligations of the United States, the Canal authorities may at any
    time, as a condition precedent to transit of the Canal, inspect any
    vessel, belligerent or neutral, other than a public vessel,
    including its crew and cargo, and, for and during the passage
    through the Canal, place armed guards thereon, and take full
    possession and control of such vessel and remove therefrom the
    officers and crew thereof and all other persons not specially
    authorized by the Canal authorities to go or remain on board
    thereof during such passage.
      2. A public vessel of a belligerent or neutral nation shall be
    permitted to pass through the Canal only after her commanding
    officer has given written assurance to the authorities of the
    Panama Canal that the rules, regulations, and treaties of the
    United States will be faithfully observed.
      3. Possession of cameras on board vessels; photographing from
    vessels. While on board any vessel in transit through the Panama
    Canal, no person shall (a) have or remain in possession of any
    camera, or (b) make any photograph, sketch, picture, drawing, map,
    or graphical representation of any of the locks of the Panama
    Canal, or of any portion of any such lock, or of any area within or
    adjacent to any such lock, or of any object or structure within or
    upon any such area, without first obtaining the permission of the
    Governor of The Panama Canal, and promptly submitting the product
    obtained to the Governor for such action as he may deem necessary.
    The master of every vessel that transmits the Panama Canal (a)
    shall prior to the beginning of each transit cause all cameras on
    board such vessel, or which are brought on board by embarking
    passengers, or otherwise, to be collected and delivered to him, and
    shall retain the said cameras in his possession, in a secure and
    inaccessible place, until the disembarkation of the original
    possessors thereof or until the transit through the Canal is
    completed, and (b) shall during such transit take such further
    action, in cooperation with the Canal authorities, as may be
    necessary to prevent the making, by any person on board such vessel
    in the waters of the Canal Zone, of any photograph, sketch,
    picture, drawing, map, or graphical representation which is
    forbidden by this paragraph; but these provisions shall not apply
    with respect to any person who has obtained permission as provided
    in this paragraph. Any person who shall violate any provision of
    this paragraph shall be punishable as provided in section 9 of
    title 2 of the [former] Canal Zone Code.
      The foregoing regulations are in addition to the "Rules and
    Regulations for the Operation and Navigation of the Panama Canal
    and Approaches Thereto, including all Waters under its
    Jurisdiction" prescribed by Executive Order No. 4314 of September

    provided:
      WHEREAS the peace of the world and the security of the United
    States and of all American States are endangered by reason of the
    establishment by the Sino-Soviet powers of an offensive military
    capability in Cuba, including bases for ballistic missiles with a
    potential range covering most of North and South America;
      WHEREAS by a Joint Resolution passed by the Congress of the
    United States and approved on October 3, 1962, it was declared that
    the United States is determined to prevent by whatever means may be
    necessary, including the use of arms, the Marxist-Leninist regime
    in Cuba from extending, by force or the threat of force, its
    aggressive or subversive activities to any part of this hemisphere,
    and to prevent in Cuba the creation or use of an externally
    supported military capability endangering the security of the
    United States; and
      WHEREAS the Organ of Consultation of the American Republics
    meeting in Washington on October 23, 1962, recommended that the
    Member States, in accordance with Articles 6 and 8 of the Inter-
    American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, take all measures,
    individually and collectively, including the use of armed force,
    which they may deem necessary to ensure that the Government of Cuba
    cannot continue to receive from the Sino-Soviet powers military
    material and related supplies which may threaten the peace and
    security of the Continent and to prevent the missiles in Cuba with
    offensive capability from ever becoming an active threat to the
    peace and security of the Continent:
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOHN F. KENNEDY, President of the United
    States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority
    conferred upon me by the Constitution and statutes of the United
    States, in accordance with the aforementioned resolutions of the
    United States Congress and of the Organ of Consultation of the
    American Republics, and to defend the security of the United
    States, do hereby proclaim that the forces under my command are
    ordered, beginning at 2:00 P.M. Greenwich time October 24, 1962, to
    interdict, subject to the instructions herein contained, the
    delivery of offensive weapons and associated material to Cuba.
      For the purposes of this Proclamation, the following are declared
    to be prohibited materiel:
      Surface-to-surface missiles; bomber aircraft; bombs, air-to-
    surface rockets and guided missiles; warheads for any of the above
    weapons; mechanical or electronic equipment to support or operate
    the above items; and any other classes of materiel hereafter
    designated by the Secretary of Defense for the purpose of
    effectuating this Proclamation.
      To enforce this order, the Secretary of Defense shall take
    appropriate measures to prevent the delivery of prohibited materiel
    to Cuba, employing the land, sea and air forces of the United
    States in cooperation with any forces that may be made available by
    other American States.
      The Secretary of Defense may make such regulations and issue such
    directives as he deems necessary to ensure the effectiveness of
    this order, including the designation, within a reasonable distance
    of Cuba, of prohibited or restricted zones and of prescribed
    routes.
      Any vessel or craft which may be proceeding toward Cuba may be
    intercepted and may be directed to identify itself, its cargo,
    equipment and stores and its ports of call, to stop, to lie to, to
    submit to visit and search, or to proceed as directed. Any vessel
    or craft which fails or refuses to respond to or comply with
    directions shall be subject to being taken into custody. Any vessel
    or craft which it is believed is en route to Cuba and may be
    carrying prohibited materiel or may itself constitute such materiel
    shall, wherever possible, be directed to proceed to another
    destination of its own choice and shall be taken into custody if it
    fails or refuses to obey such directions. All vessels or craft
    taken into custody shall be sent into a port of the United States
    for appropriate disposition.
      In carrying out this order, force shall not be used except in
    case of failure or refusal to comply with directions, or with
    regulations or directives of the Secretary of Defense issued
    hereunder, after reasonable efforts have been made to communicate
    them to the vessel or craft, or in case of self-defense. In any
    case, force shall be used only to the extent necessary.
      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the
    seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
     Done in the City of Washington this twenty-third day of October in

    United States Government or of the Government of any nation, except
    that of an enemy or ally of enemy nation, and other than such

-HEAD-
    Sec. 4. Licenses to enemy or ally of enemy insurance or reinsurance
      companies; change of name; doing business in United States

-STATUTE-
      (a) Every enemy or ally of enemy insurance or reinsurance
    company, and every enemy or ally of enemy, doing business within
    the United States through an agency or branch office, or otherwise,
    may within thirty days after the passage of this Act [Oct. 6,
    1917], apply to the President for a license to continue to do
    business; and, within thirty days after such application, the
    President may enter an order either granting or refusing to grant
    such license. The license, if granted, may be temporary or
    otherwise, and for such period of time, and may contain such
    provisions and conditions regulating the business, agencies,
    managers and trustees and the control and disposition of the funds
    of the company, or of such enemy or ally of enemy, as the President
    shall deem necessary for the safety of the United States; and any
    license granted hereunder may be revoked or regranted or renewed in
    such manner and at such times as the President shall determine:
    Provided, however, That reasonable notice of his intent to refuse
    to grant a license or to revoke a license granted to any
    reinsurance company shall be given by him to all insurance
    companies incorporated within the United States and known to the
    President to be doing business with such reinsurance company:
    Provided further, That no insurance company, organized within the
    United States, shall be obligated to continue any existing
    contract, entered into prior to the beginning of the war, with any
    enemy or ally of enemy insurance or reinsurance company, but any
    such company may abrogate and cancel any such contract by serving
    thirty days' notice in writing upon the President of its election
    to abrogate such contract.
      For a period of thirty days after the passage of this Act [Oct.
    6, 1917], and further pending the entry of such order by the
    President, after application made by any enemy or ally of enemy
    insurance or reinsurance company, within such thirty days as above
    provided, the provisions of the President's proclamation of April
    sixth, nineteen hundred and seventeen, relative to agencies in the
    United States of certain insurance companies, as modified by the
    provisions of the President's proclamation of July thirteenth,
    nineteen hundred and seventeen, relative to marine and war-risk
    insurance, shall remain in full force and effect so far as it
    applies to such German insurance companies, and the conditions of
    said proclamation of April sixth, nineteen hundred and seventeen,
    as modified by said proclamation of July thirteenth, nineteen
    hundred and seventeen, shall also during said period of thirty days
    after the passage of this Act [Oct. 6, 1917], and pending the order
    of the President as herein provided, apply to any enemy or ally of
    enemy insurance or reinsurance company, anything in this Act
    [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix] to the
    contrary notwithstanding. It shall be unlawful for any enemy or
    ally of enemy insurance or reinsurance company, to whom license is
    granted, to transmit out of the United States any funds belonging
    to or held for the benefit of such company or to use any such funds
    as the basis for the establishment directly or indirectly of any
    credit within or outside of the United States to, or for the
    benefit of, or on behalf of, or on account of, an enemy or ally of
    enemy.
      For a period of thirty days after the passage of this Act [Oct.
    6, 1917], and further pending the entry of such order by the
    President, after application made within such thirty days by any
    enemy or ally of enemy, other than an insurance or reinsurance
    company as above provided, it shall be lawful for such enemy or
    ally of enemy to continue to do business in this country and for
    any person to trade with, to, from, for, on account of, on behalf
    of or for the benefit of such enemy or ally of enemy, anything in
    this Act [said sections] to the contrary notwithstanding: Provided,
    however, That the provisions of sections three and sixteen hereof
    [sections 3 and 16 of this Appendix] shall apply to any act or
    attempted act of transmission or transfer of money or other
    property out of the United States and to the use or attempted use
    of such money or property as the basis for the establishment of any
    credit within or outside of the United States to, or for the
    benefit of, or on behalf of, or on account of, an enemy or ally of
    enemy.
      If no license is applied for within thirty days after the passage
    of this Act [Oct. 6, 1917], or if a license shall be refused to any
    enemy or ally of enemy, whether insurance or reinsurance company,
    or other person, making application, or if any license granted
    shall be revoked by the President, the provisions of sections three
    and sixteen hereof [sections 3 and 16 of this Appendix] shall
    forthwith apply to all trade or to any attempt to trade with, to,
    from, for, buy, on account of, or on behalf of, or for the benefit
    of such company or other person: Provided, however, That after such
    refusal or revocation, anything in this Act [said sections] to the
    contrary notwithstanding, it shall be lawful for a policyholder or
    for an insurance company, not an enemy or ally of enemy, holding
    insurance or having effected reinsurance in or with such enemy or
    ally of enemy insurance or reinsurance company, to receive payment
    of, and for such enemy or ally of enemy insurance or reinsurance
    company to pay any premium, return premium, claim, money, security,
    or other property due or which may become due on or in respect to
    such insurance or reinsurance in force at the date of such refusal
    or revocation of license; and nothing in this Act [said sections]
    shall vitiate or nullify then existing policies or contracts of
    insurance or reinsurance, or the conditions thereof; and any such
    policyholder or insurance company, not an enemy or ally of enemy,
    having any claim to or upon money or other property of the enemy or
    ally of enemy insurance or reinsurance company in the custody or
    control of the alien property custodian, hereinafter provided for,
    or of the Treasurer of the United States, may make application for
    the payment thereof and may institute suit as provided in section
    nine hereof [section 9 of this Appendix].
      (b) During the present war, no enemy, or ally of enemy, and no
    partnership of which he is a member or was a member at the
    beginning of the war, shall for any purpose assume or use any name
    other than that by which such enemy or partnership was ordinarily
    known at the beginning of the war, except under license from the
    President.
      Whenever, during the present war, in the opinion of the President
    the public safety or public interest requires, the President may
    prohibit any or all foreign insurance companies from doing business
    in the United States, or the President may license such company or
    companies to do business upon such terms as he may deem proper.

      WHEREAS, certain insurance companies, incorporated under the laws
    of the German Empire, have been admitted to transact the business
    of insurance in various States of the United States, by means of
    separate United States branches established pursuant to the laws of
    such States, and are now engaged in business under the supervision
    of the Insurance Departments thereof, with assets in the United
    States deposited with Insurance Departments or in the hands of
    resident trustees, citizens of the United States, for the
    protection of all policyholders in the United States;
      AND WHEREAS, the interests of the citizens of the United States
    in the protection afforded by such insurance are of great
    magnitude, so that it is deemed to be important that the agencies
    of such companies in the United States be permitted to continue in
    business;
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, WOODROW WILSON, President of the United States
    of America, by virtue of the powers vested in me as such, hereby
    declare and proclaim that such branch establishments of German
    insurance companies now engaged in the transaction of business in
    the United States pursuant to the laws of the several States are
    hereby authorized and permitted to continue the transaction of
    their business in accordance with the laws of such States in the
    same manner and to the same extent as though a state of war did not
    now exist; provided, however, that all funds of such establishments
    now in the possession of their managers or agents, or which shall
    hereafter come into their possession, shall be subject to such
    rules and regulations concerning the payment and disposition
    thereof as shall be prescribed by the insurance supervising
    officials of the State in which the principal office of such

      WHEREAS, certain insurance companies, incorporated under the laws
    of the German Empire, have been admitted to transact the business
    of marine and war risk insurance in various States of the United
    States, by means of separate United States branches established
    pursuant to the laws of such States, and are now engaged in such
    business under the supervision of the Insurance Departments
    thereof, with assets in the United States deposited with Insurance
    Departments or in the hands of resident trustees, citizens of the
    United States, for the protection of all policyholders in the
    United States;
      AND WHEREAS, the nature of marine and war risk insurance is such
    that those conducting it must of necessity be in touch with the
    movements of ships and cargoes, and it has been considered by the
    Government of great importance that this information should not be
    obtained by alien enemies;
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, WOODROW WILSON, President of the United States
    of America, by virtue of the powers vested in me as such, hereby
    declare and proclaim that such branch establishments of German
    insurance companies now engaged in the transaction of business in
    the United States pursuant to the laws of the several States are
    hereby prohibited from continuing the transaction of the business
    of marine and war risk insurance either as direct insurers or re-
    insurers; and all individuals, firms, and insurance companies
    incorporated under the laws of any of the States or Territories of
    the United States, or of any foreign country, and established
    pursuant to the laws of such States and now engaged in the United
    States in the business of marine and war risk insurance either as
    direct insurers or re-insurers are hereby prohibited from
    reinsuring with companies incorporated under the laws of the German
    Empire, no matter where located; and all persons in the United
    States are prohibited from insuring against marine or war risks
    with insurance companies incorporated under the laws of the German
    Empire or with individuals, firms, and insurance companies
    incorporated under the laws of any of the States or Territories of
    the United States or of any foreign country and now engaged in the
    business of marine or war risk insurance in the United States,
    which re-insure business originating in the United States with
    companies incorporated under the laws of the German Empire, no
    matter where located.
      The foregoing prohibitions shall extend and operate as to all
    existing contracts for insurance and re-insurance which are hereby
    suspended for the period of the war, except that they shall not
    operate to vitiate or prevent the insurance or re-insurance of, and
    the payment or receipt of, premiums on insurance or re-insurance
    under existing contracts on vessels or interest at risk on the date
    of this proclamation, and such insurance or re-insurance, if for a
    voyage, shall continue in force until arrival at destination, and
    if for time, until thirty days from the date of this proclamation.

    [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix] so far as

    or any national thereof has or has had any interest, or as may be
    otherwise necessary to enforce the provisions of this subdivision,
    and in any case in which a report could be required, the President
    may, in the manner hereinabove provided, require the production, or

    issued hereunder shall to the extent thereof be a full acquittance
    and discharge for all purposes of the obligation of the person
    making the same; and no person shall be held liable in any court

    any powers heretofore conferred on the Secretary of the Treasury by
    or under any statute or Executive order, or to revoke or limit any
    powers heretofore conferred upon the Attorney General by or under
    any statute or Executive order other than Executive Order No. 9989

      trade with enemy prior to passage of Act; conveyance of property
      to custodian; voluntary payment to custodian by holder; acts
      under order, rule, or regulation

-STATUTE-
      (a) Every corporation incorporated within the United States, and
    every unincorporated association, or company, or trustee, or
    trustees within the United States, issuing shares or certificates
    representing beneficial interests, shall, under such rules and
    regulations as the President may prescribe and, within sixty days
    after the passage of this Act [Oct. 6, 1917] and at such other
    times thereafter as the President may require, transmit to the
    alien property custodian a full list, duly sworn to, of every
    officer, director, or stockholder known to be, or whom the
    representative of such corporation, association, company, or
    trustee has reasonable cause to believe to be an enemy or ally of
    enemy resident within the territory, or a subject or citizen
    residing outside of the United States, of any nation with which the
    United States is at war, or resident within the territory, or a
    subject or citizen residing outside of the United States, of any
    ally of any nation with which the United States is at war, together
    with the amount of stock or shares owned by each such officer,
    director, or stockholder, or in which he has any interest.
      The President may also require a similar list to be transmitted
    of all stock or shares owned on February third, nineteen hundred
    and seventeen, by any person now defined as an enemy or ally of
    enemy, or in which any such person had any interest; and he may
    also require a list to be transmitted of all cases in which said
    corporation, association, company, or trustee has reasonable cause
    to believe that the stock or shares on February third, nineteen
    hundred and seventeen, were owned or are owned by such enemy or
    ally of enemy, though standing on the books in the name of another:
    Provided, however, That the name of any such officer, director, or
    stockholder, shall be stricken permanently or temporarily from such
    list by the alien property custodian when he shall be satisfied
    that he is not such enemy or ally of enemy.
      Any person in the United States who holds or has or shall hold or
    have custody or control of any property beneficial or otherwise,
    alone or jointly with others, of, for, or on behalf of an enemy or
    ally of enemy, or of any person whom he may have reasonable cause
    to believe to be an enemy or ally of enemy and any person in the
    United States who is or shall be indebted in any way to an enemy or
    ally of enemy, or to any person whom he may have reasonable cause
    to believe to be an enemy or ally of enemy, shall, with such
    exceptions and under such rules and regulations as the President
    shall prescribe, and within thirty days after the passage of this
    Act [Oct. 6, 1917], or within thirty days after such property shall
    come within his custody or control, or after such debt shall become
    due, report the fact to the alien-property custodian by written
    statement under oath containing such particulars as said custodian
    shall require. The President may also require a similar report of
    all property so held, of, for, or on behalf of, and of all debts so
    owed to, any person now defined as an enemy or ally of enemy, on
    February third, nineteen hundred and seventeen: Provided, That the
    name of any person shall be stricken from the said report by the
    alien property custodian, either temporarily or permanently, when
    he shall be satisfied that such person is not an enemy or ally of
    enemy. The President may extend the time for filing the lists or
    reports required by this section for an additional period not
    exceeding ninety days.
      (b) Nothing in this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44
    of this Appendix] contained shall render valid or legal, or be
    construed to recognize as valid or legal, any act or transaction
    constituting trade with, to, from, for or on account of, or on
    behalf or for the benefit of an enemy performed or engaged in since
    the beginning of the war and prior to the passage of this Act [said
    sections] or any such act or transaction hereafter performed or
    engaged in except as authorized hereunder, which would otherwise
    have been or be void, illegal, or invalid at law. No conveyance,
    transfer, delivery, payment, or loan of money or other property, in
    violation of section three hereof [section 3 of this Appendix],
    made after the passage of this Act [Oct. 6, 1917] and not under
    license as herein provided shall confer or create any right or
    remedy in respect thereof; and no person shall by virtue of any
    assignment, indorsement, or delivery to him of any debt, bill,
    note, or other obligation or chose in action by, from, or on behalf
    of, or on account of, or for the benefit of an enemy or ally of
    enemy have any right or remedy against the debtor, obligor, or
    other person liable to pay, fulfill, or perform the same unless
    said assignment, indorsement, or delivery was made prior to the
    beginning of the war or shall be made under license as herein
    provided, or unless, if made after the beginning of the war and
    prior to the date of passage of this Act [Oct. 6, 1917], the person
    to whom the same was made shall prove lack of knowledge and of
    reasonable cause to believe on his part that the same was made by,
    from or on behalf of, or on account of, or for the benefit of an
    enemy or ally of enemy; and any person who knowingly pays,
    discharges, or satisfies any such debt, note, bill, or other
    obligation or chose in action shall, on conviction thereof, be
    deemed to violate section three hereof [section 3 of this
    Appendix]: Provided, That nothing in this Act [said sections]
    contained shall prevent the carrying out, completion, or
    performance of any contract, agreement, or obligation originally
    made with or entered into by an enemy or ally of enemy where, prior
    to the beginning of the war and not in contemplation thereof, the
    interest of such enemy or ally of enemy devolved by assignment or
    otherwise upon a person not an enemy or ally of enemy, and no enemy
    or ally of enemy will be benefited by such carrying out,
    completion, or performance otherwise than by release from
    obligation thereunder.
      Nothing in this Act [said sections] shall be deemed to prevent
    payment of money belonging or owing to an enemy or ally of enemy to
    a person within the United States not an enemy or ally of enemy,
    for the benefit of such person or of any other person within the
    United States, not an enemy or ally of enemy, if the funds so paid
    shall have been received prior to the beginning of the war and such
    payments arise out of transactions entered into prior to the
    beginning of the war, and not in contemplation thereof: Provided,
    That such payment shall not be made without the license of the
    President, general or special, as provided in this Act [said
    sections].
      Nothing in this Act [said sections] shall be deemed to authorize
    the prosecution of any suit or action at law or in equity in any
    court within the United States by an enemy or ally of enemy prior
    to the end of the war, except as provided in section ten hereof
    [section 10 of this Appendix]: Provided, however, That an enemy or
    ally of enemy licensed to do business under this Act [said
    sections] may prosecute and maintain any such suit or action so far
    as the same arises solely out of the business transacted within the
    United States under such license and so long as such license
    remains in full force and effect: And provided further, That an
    enemy or ally of enemy may defend by counsel any suit in equity or
    action at law which may be brought against him.
      Receipt of notice from the President to the effect that he has
    reasonable ground to believe that any person is an enemy or ally of
    enemy shall be prima facie defense to any one receiving the same,
    in any suit or action at law or in equity brought or maintained, or
    to any right or set-off or recoupment asserted by, such person and
    based on failure to complete or perform since the beginning of the
    war any contract or other obligation. In any prosecution under
    section sixteen hereof [section 16 of this Appendix] proof of
    receipt of notice from the President to the effect that he has
    reasonable cause to believe that any person is an enemy or ally of
    enemy shall be prima facie evidence that the person receiving such
    notice has reasonable cause to believe such other person to be an
    enemy or ally of enemy within the meaning of section three hereof
    [section 3 of this Appendix].
      (c) If the President shall so require any money or other property
    including (but not thereby limiting the generality of the above)
    patents, copyrights, applications therefor, and rights to apply for
    the same, trade marks, choses in action, and rights and claims of
    every character and description owing or belonging to or held for,
    by, on account of, or on behalf of, or for the benefit of, an enemy
    or ally of enemy not holding a license granted by the President
    hereunder, which the President after investigation shall determine
    is so owning or so belongs or is so held, shall be conveyed,
    transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid over to the Alien
    Property Custodian, or the same may be seized by the Alien Property
    Custodian; and all property thus acquired shall be held,
    administered and disposed of as elsewhere provided in this Act
    [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix].
      Any requirement made pursuant to this Act [said sections], or a
    duly certified copy thereof, may be filed, registered, or recorded
    in any office for the filing, registering, or recording of
    conveyances, transfers, or assignments of any such property or
    rights as may be covered by such requirement (including the proper
    office for filing, registering, or recording conveyances,
    transfers, or assignments of patents, copyrights, trade-marks, or
    any rights therein or any other rights); and if so filed,
    registered, or recorded shall impart the same notice and have the
    same force and effect as a duly executed conveyance, transfer, or
    assignment to the Alien Property Custodian so filed, registered, or
    recorded.
      Whenever any such property shall consist of shares of stock or
    other beneficial interest in any corporation, association, or
    company or trust, it shall be the duty of the corporation,
    association, or company or trustee or trustees issuing such shares
    or any certificates or other instruments representing the same or
    any other beneficial interest to cancel upon its, his, or their
    books all shares of stock or other beneficial interest standing
    upon its, his, or their books in the name of any person or persons,
    or held for, on account of, or on behalf of, or for the benefit of
    any person or persons who shall have been determined by the
    President, after investigation, to be an enemy or ally of enemy,
    and which shall have been required to be conveyed, transferred,
    assigned, or delivered to the Alien Property Custodian or seized by
    him, and in lieu thereof to issue certificates or other instruments
    for such shares or other beneficial interest to the Alien Property
    Custodian or otherwise, as the Alien Property Custodian shall
    require.
      The sole relief and remedy of any person having any claim to any
    money or other property heretofore or hereafter conveyed,
    transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid over to the Alien
    Property Custodian, or required so to be, or seized by him shall be
    that provided by the terms of this Act [said sections], and in the
    event of sale or other disposition of such property by the Alien
    Property Custodian, shall be limited to and enforced against the
    net proceeds received therefrom and held by the Alien Property
    Custodian or by the Treasurer of the United States.
      (d) If not required to pay, convey, transfer, assign, or deliver
    under the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, any person
    not an enemy or ally of enemy who owes to, or holds for, or on
    account of, or on behalf of, or for the benefit of an enemy or of
    an ally of enemy not holding a license granted by the President
    hereunder, any money or other property, or to whom any obligation
    or form of liability to such enemy or ally of enemy is presented
    for payment, may, at his option, with the consent of the President,
    pay, convey, transfer, assign, or deliver to the alien property
    custodian said money or other property under such rules and
    regulations as the President shall prescribe.
      (e) No person shall be held liable in any court for or in respect
    to anything done or omitted in pursuance of any order, rule, or
    regulation made by the President under the authority of this Act
    [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix].
      Any payment, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or delivery of
    money or property made to the alien property custodian hereunder
    shall be a full acquittance and discharge for all purposes of the
    obligation of the person making the same to the extent of same. The
    alien property custodian and such other persons as the President
    may appoint shall have power to execute, acknowledge, and deliver
    any such instrument or instruments as may be necessary or proper to
    evidence upon the record or otherwise such acquittance and
    discharge, and shall, in case of payment to the alien property
    custodian of any debt or obligation owed to an enemy or ally of
    enemy, deliver up any notes, bonds, or other evidences of
    indebtedness or obligation, or any security therefor in which such
    enemy or ally of enemy had any right or interest that may have come
    into the possession of the alien property custodian, with like
    effect as if he or they, respectively, were duly appointed by the
    enemy or ally of enemy, creditor, or obligee. The President shall
    issue to every person so appointed a certificate of the appointment
    and authority of such person, and such certificate shall be
    received in evidence in all courts within the United States.
    Whenever any such certificate of authority shall be offered to any
    registrar, clerk, or other recording officer, Federal or otherwise,
    within the United States, such officer shall record the same in
    like manner as a power of attorney, and such record or a duly
    certified copy thereof shall be received in evidence in all courts
    of the United States or other courts within the United States.

    TRADING WITH THE ENEMY ACT OF 1917
    ACT OCT. 6, 1917, CH. 106, 40 STAT. 411

-HEAD-
    Sec. 9. Claims to property transferred to custodian; notice of
      claim; filing; return of property; suits to recover; sale of
      claimed property in time of war or during national emergency

-STATUTE-
      (a) Any person not an enemy or ally of enemy claiming any
    interest, right, or title in any money or other property which may
    have been conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to
    the Alien Property Custodian or seized by him hereunder and held by
    him or by the Treasurer of the United States, or to whom any debt
    may be owing from an enemy or ally of enemy whose property or any
    part thereof shall have been conveyed, transferred, assigned,
    delivered, or paid to the Alien Property Custodian or seized by him
    hereunder and held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States
    may file with the said custodian a notice of his claim under oath
    and in such form and containing such particulars as the said
    custodian shall require; and the President, if application is made
    therefor by the claimant, may order the payment, conveyance,
    transfer, assignment, or delivery to said claimant of the money or
    other property so held by the Alien Property Custodian or by the
    Treasurer of the United States, or of the interest therein to which
    the President shall determine said claimant is entitled: Provided,
    That no such order by the President shall bar any person from the
    prosecution of any suit at law or in equity against the claimant to
    establish any right, title, or interest which he may have in such
    money or other property. If the President shall not so order within
    sixty days after the filing of such application or if the claimant
    shall have filed the notice as above required and shall have made
    no application to the President, said claimant may institute a suit
    in equity in the United States District Court for the District of
    Columbia or in the district court of the United States for the
    district in which such claimant resides, or, if a corporation,
    where it has its principal place of business (to which suit the
    Alien Property Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States, as
    the case may be, shall be made a party defendant), to establish the
    interest, right, title, or debt so claimed, and if so established
    the court shall order the payment, conveyance, transfer,
    assignment, or delivery to said claimant of the money or other
    property so held by the Alien Property Custodian or by the
    Treasurer of the United States or the interest therein to which the
    court shall determine said claimant is entitled. If suit shall be
    so instituted, then such money or property shall be retained in the
    custody of the Alien Property Custodian, or in the Treasury of the
    United States, as provided in this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39,
    and 41 to 44 of this Appendix], and until any final judgment or
    decree which shall be entered in favor of the claimant shall be
    fully satisfied by payment or conveyance, transfer, assignment, or
    delivery by the defendant, or by the Alien Property Custodian, or
    Treasurer of the United States on order of the court, or until
    final judgment or decree shall be entered against the claimant or
    suit otherwise terminated: Provided further, That upon a
    determination made by the President, in time of war or during any
    national emergency declared by the President, that the interest and
    welfare of the United States require the sale of any property or
    interest or any part thereof claimed in any suit filed under this
    subsection and pending on or after the date of enactment [Oct. 22,
    1962] of this proviso the Alien Property Custodian or any successor
    officer, or agency may sell such property or interest or part
    thereof, in conformity with law applicable to sales of property by
    him, at any time prior to the entry of final judgment in such suit.
    No such sale shall be made until thirty days have passed after the
    publication of notice in the Federal Register of the intention to
    sell. The net proceeds of any such sale shall be deposited in a
    special account established in the Treasury, and shall be held in
    trust by the Secretary of the Treasury pending the entry of final
    judgment in such suit. Any recovery of any claimant in any such
    suit in respect of the property or interest or part thereof so sold
    shall be satisfied from the net proceeds of such sale unless such
    claimant, within sixty days after receipt of notice of the amount
    of net proceeds of sale serves upon the Alien Property Custodian,
    or any successor officer or agency, and files with the court an
    election to waive all claims to the net proceeds, or any part
    thereof, and to claim just compensation instead. If the court finds
    that the claimant has established an interest, right, or title in
    any property in respect of which such an election has been served
    and filed, it shall proceed to determine the amount which will
    constitute just compensation for such interest, right, or title,
    and shall order payment to the claimant of the amount so
    determined. An order for the payment of just compensation hereunder
    shall be a judgment against the United States and shall be payable
    first from the net proceeds of the sale in an amount not to exceed
    the amount the claimant would have received had he elected to
    accept his proportionate part of the net proceeds of the sale, and
    the balance, if any, shall be payable in the same manner as are
    judgments in cases arising under section 1346 of title 28, United
    States Code. The Alien Property Custodian or any successor officer
    or agency shall, immediately upon the entry of final judgment,
    notify the Secretary of the Treasury of the determination by final
    judgment of the claimant's interest and right to the proportionate
    part of the net proceeds from the sale, and the final determination
    by judgment of the amount of just compensation in the event the
    claimant has elected to recover just compensation for the interest
    in the property he claimed.
      (b) In respect of all money or other property conveyed,
    transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the Alien Property
    Custodian or seized by him hereunder and held by him or by the
    Treasurer of the United States, if the President shall determine
    that the owner thereof at the time such money or other property was
    required to be so conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or
    paid to the Alien Property Custodian or at the time when it was
    voluntarily delivered to him or was seized by him was -

    the fact that at the time of such return he was in fact entitled to
    such return under any other provision of this Act [sections 1 to 6,
    7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix]; or
      (17) A partnership, association, or other unincorporated body of

      Then the President, without any application being made therefor,
    may order the payment, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or
    delivery of such money or other property held by the Alien Property
    Custodian or by the Treasurer of the United States, or of the
    interest therein to which the President shall determine such person
    entitled, either to the said owner or to the person by whom said
    property was conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid
    over to the Alien Property Custodian: Provided, That no person
    shall be deemed or held to be a citizen or subject of Germany or
    Austria or Hungary or Austria-Hungary for the purposes of this
    section, even though he was such citizen or subject at the time
    first specified in this subsection, if he has become or shall
    become, ipso facto or through exercise of option, a citizen or
    subject of any nation or State or free city other than Germany,
    Austria, or Hungary, (first) under the terms of such treaties of
    peace as have been or may be concluded subsequent to November 11,
    1918, between Germany or Austria or Hungary (of the one part) and
    the United States and/or three or more of the following-named
    powers: The British Empire, France, Italy, and Japan (of the other
    part), or (second) under the terms of such treaties as have been or
    may be concluded in pursuance of the treaties of peace aforesaid
    between any nation, State, or free city (of the one part) whose
    territories, in whole or in part, on August 4, 1914, formed a
    portion of the territory of Germany or Austria-Hungary and the
    United States and/or three or more of the following-named powers:
    The British Empire, France, Italy, and Japan (of the other part).
    For the purposes of this section any citizen or subject of a State
    or free city which at the time of the proposed return of money or
    other property of such citizen or subject hereunder forms a part of
    the territory of any one of the following nations: Germany,
    Austria, or Hungary, shall be deemed to be a citizen or subject of
    such nation. And the receipt of the said owner or of the person by
    whom said money or other property was conveyed, transferred,
    assigned, delivered, or paid over to the Alien Property Custodian
    shall be a full acquittance and discharge of the Alien Property
    Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States, as the case may
    be, and of the United States in respect to all claims of all
    persons heretofore or hereafter claiming any right, title, or
    interest in said money or other property, or compensation or
    damages arising from the capture of such money or other property by
    the President or the Alien Property Custodian: Provided further,
    however, That except as herein provided no such action by the
    President shall bar any person from the prosecution of any suit at
    law or in equity to establish any right, title, or interest which
    he may have therein.
      (c) Any person whose money or other property the President is
    authorized to return under the provisions of subsection (b) hereof
    may file notice of claim for the return of such money or other
    property, as provided in subsection (a) hereof, and thereafter may
    make application to the President for allowance of such claim
    and/or may institute suit in equity to recover such money or other
    property, as provided in said subsection, and with like effect. The
    President or the court, as the case may be, may make the same
    determinations with respect to citizenship and other relevant facts
    that the President is authorized to make under the provisions of
    subsection (b) hereof.
      (d) Whenever an individual, deceased, would have been entitled,
    if living, to the return of any money or other property without
    filing the written consent provided for in subsection (m), then his
    legal representative may proceed for the return of such money or
    other property in the same manner as such individual might proceed
    if living, and such money or other property may be returned to such
    legal representative without requiring the appointment of an
    administrator, or an ancillary administrator, by a court in the
    United States, or to any such ancillary administrator, for
    distribution directly to the persons entitled thereto. Return in
    accordance with the provisions of this subsection may be made in
    any case where an application or court proceeding by any legal
    representative, under the provisions of this subsection before its
    amendment by the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 [Act Mar. 10,
    1928, ch. 167, Sec. 12(a), 45 Stat. 271] is pending and
    undetermined at the time of the enactment of such Act. All bonds or
    other security given under the provisions of this subsection before
    such amendment shall be canceled or released and all sureties
    thereon discharged.
      (e) No money or other property shall be returned nor any debt
    allowed under this section to any person who is a citizen or
    subject of any nation which was associated with the United States
    in the prosecution of the war, unless such nation in like case
    extends reciprocal rights to citizens of the United States:
    Provided, That any arrangement made by a foreign nation for the
    release of money and other property of American citizens and
    certified by the Secretary of State to the Attorney General as fair
    and the most advantageous arrangement obtainable shall be regarded
    as meeting this requirement; nor in any event shall a debt be
    allowed under this section unless it was owing to and owned by the
    claimant prior to October 6, 1917, and as to claimants other than
    citizens of the United States unless it arose with reference to the
    money or other property held by the Alien Property Custodian or
    Treasurer of the United States hereunder; nor shall a debt be
    allowed under this section unless notice of the claim has been
    filed, or application therefor has been made, prior to the date of
    the enactment of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 [Act Mar.
    10, 1928, ch. 167, 45 Stat. 254].
      (f) Except as herein provided, the money or other property
    conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the Alien
    Property Custodian, shall not be liable to lien, attachment,
    garnishment, trustee process, or execution, or subject to any order
    or decree of any court.
      (g) Whenever an individual, deceased, would have been entitled,
    if living, to the return of any money or other property upon filing
    the written consent provided for in subsection (m), then his legal
    representative may proceed for the return of such money or other
    property in the same manner as such individual might proceed if
    living, and such money or other property may be returned, upon
    filing the written consent provided for in subsection (m), to such
    legal representative without requiring the appointment of an
    administrator, or an ancillary administrator, by a court in the
    United States, or to any such ancillary administrator, for
    distribution to the persons entitled thereto. This subsection shall
    not be construed as extinguishing or diminishing any right which
    any citizen of the United States may have had under this subsection
    prior to its amendment by the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928
    [Act Mar. 10, 1928, ch. 167, Sec. 12(c), 45 Stat. 271] to receive
    in full his interest in the property of any individual dying before
    such amendment.
      (h) The aggregate value of the money or other property returned
    under paragraphs (9) and (10) of subsection (b) to any one person,
    irrespective of the number of trusts involved, shall in no case
    exceed $10,000.
      (i) For the purposes of paragraphs (9) and (10) of subsection (b)
    of this section accumulated net income, dividends, interest,
    annuities, and other earnings, shall be considered as part of the
    principal.
      (j) The Alien Property Custodian is authorized and directed to
    return to the person entitled thereto, whether or not an enemy or
    ally of enemy and regardless of the value, any patent, trademark,
    print, label, copyright, or right therein or claim thereto, which
    was conveyed, transferred, assigned, or delivered to the Alien
    Property Custodian, or seized by him, and which has not been sold,
    licensed, or otherwise disposed of under the provisions of this Act
    [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix], and to
    return any such patent, trademark, print, label, copyright, or
    right therein or claim thereto, which has been licensed, except
    that any patent, trade-mark, print, label, copyright, or right
    therein or claim thereto, which is returned by the Alien Property
    Custodian and which has been licensed, or in respect of which any
    contract has been entered into, or which is subject to any lien or
    encumbrance, shall be returned subject to the license, contract,
    lien, or encumbrance.
      (k) Except as provided in section 27 [section 27 of this
    Appendix], paragraphs (12) to (22), both inclusive, of subsection
    (b) of this section shall apply to the proceeds received from the
    sale, license, or other disposition of any patent, trademark,
    print, label, copyright, or right therein or claim thereto,
    conveyed, transferred, assigned, or delivered to the Alien Property
    Custodian, or seized by him.
      (l) This section shall apply to royalties paid to the Alien
    Property Custodian, in accordance with a judgment or decree in a
    suit brought under subsection (f) of section 10 [section 10(f) of
    this Appendix]; but shall not apply to any other money paid to the
    Alien Property Custodian under section 10 [section 10 of this
    Appendix].
      (m) No money or other property shall be returned under paragraph
    (12), (13), (14), or (16) of subsection (b) or under subsection (g)
    or (n) or (to the extent therein provided) under subsection (p),
    unless the person entitled thereto files a written consent to a
    postponement of the return of an amount equal to 20 per centum of
    the aggregate value of such money or other property (at the time,
    as nearly as may be, of the return), as determined by the Alien
    Property Custodian, and the investment of such amount in accordance
    with the provisions of section 25 [section 25 of this Appendix].
    Such amount shall be deducted from the money to be returned to such
    person, so far as possible, and the balance shall be deducted from
    the proceeds of the sale of so much of the property as may be
    necessary, unless such person pays the balance to the Alien
    Property Custodian, except that no property shall be sold prior to
    the expiration of six years from the date of the enactment of the
    Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 [Act Mar. 10, 1928, ch. 167,
    45 Stat. 254] without the consent of the person entitled thereto.
    The amounts so deducted shall be returned to the persons entitled
    thereto as provided in subsection (f) of section 25 [section 25(f)
    of this Appendix]. The sale of any such property shall be made in
    accordance with the provisions of section 12 [section 12 of this
    Appendix], except that the provisions of such section relating to
    sales or resales to, or for the benefit of, citizens of the United
    States shall not be applicable. If such aggregate value of the
    money or other property to be returned under paragraph (12), (13),
    (14), or (16) of subsection (b) or under subsection (g) is less
    than $2,000, then the written consent shall not be required and the
    money or other property shall be returned in full without the
    temporary retention and investment of 20 per centum thereof.
      (n) In the case of property consisting of stock or other interest
    in any corporation, association, company, or trust, or of bonded or
    other indebtedness thereof, evidenced by certificates of stock or
    by bonds or by other certificates of interest therein or
    indebtedness thereof, or consisting of dividends or interest or
    other accruals thereon, where the right, title, and interest in the
    property (but not the actual certificate or bond or other
    certificate of interest or indebtedness) was conveyed, transferred,
    assigned, delivered, or paid to the Alien Property Custodian, or
    seized by him, if the President determines that the owner thereof
    or of any interest therein has acquired such ownership by
    assignment, transfer, or sale of such certificate or bond or other
    certificate of interest or indebtedness, (it being the intent of
    this subsection that such assignment, transfer, or sale shall not
    be deemed invalid hereunder by reason of such conveyance, transfer,
    assignment, delivery, or payment to the Alien Property Custodian or
    seizure by him) and that the written consent provided for in
    subsection (m) of this section has been filed, then the President
    may make in respect of such property an order of the same
    character, upon the same conditions, and with the same effect, as
    in cases provided for in subsection (b), including the benefits of
    subsection (c).
      (o) The provisions of paragraph (12), (13), (14), (17), (18),
    (19), (20), (21), or (22) of subsection (b), or of subsection (m)
    or (n) of this section, and (except to the extent therein provided)
    the provisions of paragraph (16) of subsection (b), shall not be
    construed as diminishing or extinguishing any right under any other
    provision of this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of
    this Appendix] in force immediately prior to the enactment of the
    Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 [Act Mar. 10, 1928, ch. 167,
    45 Stat. 254].
      (p) The Alien Property Custodian shall transfer the money or
    other property in the trust of any partnership, association, or
    other unincorporated body of individuals, or corporation, the
    existence of which has terminated, to trusts in the names of the
    persons (including the German Government and members of the former
    ruling family) who have succeeded to its claim or interest; and the
    provisions of subsection (a) of this section relating to the
    collection of a debt (by order of the President or of a court) out
    of money or other property held by the Alien Property Custodian or
    the Treasurer of the United States shall be applicable to the debts
    of such successor and any such debt may be collected out of the
    money or other property in any of such trusts if not returnable
    under subsection (a) of this section. Subject to the above
    provisions as to the collection of debts, each such successor
    (except the German Government and members of the former ruling
    family) may proceed for the return of the amount so transferred to
    his trust, in the same manner as such partnership, association, or
    other unincorporated body of individuals, or corporation might
    proceed if still in existence. If such partnership, association, or
    other unincorporated body of individuals, or corporation, would
    have been entitled to the return of its money or other property
    only upon filing the written consent provided for in subsection
    (m), then the successor shall be entitled to the return under this
    subsection only upon filing such written consent.
      (q) The return of money or other property under paragraph (15),
    (17), (18), (19), (20), (21), or (22) of subsection (b) (relating
    to the return of Austrian and Hungarian nationals) shall be subject
    to the limitations imposed by subsections (d) and (e) of section 7
    of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 [Act Mar. 10, 1928, ch.
    167, Sec. 7(d), (e), 45 Stat. 265, 266].

    TITLE 50, APPENDIX - WAR AND NATIONAL DEFENSE
    TRADING WITH THE ENEMY ACT OF 1917
    ACT OCT. 6, 1917, CH. 106, 40 STAT. 411

-HEAD-
    Sec. 10. Acts permitted; applications for patents, or registration
      of trade-marks or copyrights; payment of tax in relation thereto;
      licenses under enemy owned patent or copyright; statements by
      licensees; term and cancellation; suits against licensees;
      restraining infringements; powers of attorney; keeping secret
      inventions

-STATUTE-
      Nothing contained in this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41
    to 44 of this Appendix] shall be held to make unlawful any of the
    following acts:
      (a) Repealed. Aug. 8, 1946, ch. 910, Sec. 13, 60 Stat. 944.
      (b) Any citizen of the United States, or any corporation
    organized within the United States, may, when duly authorized by
    the President, pay to an enemy or ally of enemy any tax, annuity,
    or fee which may be required by the laws of such enemy or ally of
    enemy nation in relation to patents and trade-marks, prints,
    labels, and copyrights; and any such citizen or corporation may
    file and prosecute an application for letters patent or for
    registration of trade-mark, print, label, or copyright in the
    country of an enemy, or of an ally of enemy after first submitting
    such application to the President and receiving license so to file
    and prosecute, and to pay the fees required by law and customary
    agents' fees, the maximum amount of which in each case shall be
    subject to the control of the President.
      (c) Any citizen of the United States or any corporation organized
    within the United States desiring to manufacture, or cause to be
    manufactured, a machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or
    design, or to carry on, or to use any trade-mark, print, label or
    cause to be carried on, a process under any patent or copyrighted
    matter owned or controlled by an enemy or ally of enemy at any time
    during the existence of a state of war may apply to the President
    for a license; and the President is authorized to grant such a
    license, nonexclusive or exclusive as he shall deem best, provided
    he shall be of the opinion that such grant is for the public
    welfare, and that the applicant is able and intends in good faith
    to manufacture, or cause to be manufactured, the machine,
    manufacture, composition of matter, or design, or to carry on, or
    cause to be carried on, the process or to use the trade-mark,
    print, label or copyrighted matter. The President may prescribe the
    conditions of this license, including the fixing of prices of
    articles and products necessary to the health of the military and
    naval forces of the United States or the successful prosecution of
    the war, and the rules and regulations under which such license may
    be granted and the fee which shall be charged therefor, not
    exceeding $100, and not exceeding one per centum of the fund
    deposited as hereinafter provided. Such license shall be a complete
    defense to any suit at law or in equity instituted by the enemy or
    ally of enemy owners of the letters patent, trade-mark, print,
    label or copyright, or otherwise, against the licensee for
    infringement or for damages, royalty, or other money award on
    account of anything done by the licensee under such license, except
    as provided in subsection (f) hereof.
      (d) The licensee shall file with the President a full statement
    of the extent of the use and enjoyment of the license, and of the
    prices received in such form and at such stated periods (at least
    annually) as the President may prescribe; and the licensee shall
    pay at such times as may be required to the alien property
    custodian not to exceed five per centum of the gross sums received
    by the licensee from the sale of said inventions or use of the
    trade-mark, print, label or copyrighted matter, or, if the
    President shall so order, five per centum of the value of the use
    of such inventions, trade-marks, prints, labels or copyrighted
    matter to the licensee as established by the President; and sums so
    paid shall be deposited by said alien property custodian forthwith
    in the Treasury of the United States as a trust fund for the said
    licensee and for the owner of the said patent, trade-mark, print,
    label or copyright registration as hereinafter provided, to be paid
    from the Treasury upon order of the court, as provided in
    subsection (f) of this section, or upon the direction of the alien
    property custodian.
      (e) Unless surrendered or terminated as provided in this Act
    [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix], any
    license granted hereunder shall continue during the term fixed in
    the license or in the absence of any such limitation during the
    term of the patent, trade-mark, print, label, or copyright
    registration under which is it granted. Upon violation by the
    licensee of any of the provisions of this Act [said sections], or
    of the conditions of the license, the President may, after due
    notice and hearing, cancel any license granted by him.
      (f) The owner of any patent, trade-mark, print, label, or
    copyright under which a license is granted hereunder may, after the
    end of the war and until the expiration of one year thereafter,
    file a bill in equity against the licensee in the district court of
    the United States for the district in which the said licensee
    resides, or, if a corporation, in which it has its principal place
    of business (to which suit the Treasurer of the United States shall
    be made a party), for recovery from the said licensee for all use
    and enjoyment of the said patented invention, trade-mark, print,
    label, or copyrighted matter: Provided, however, That whenever suit
    is brought, as above, notice shall be filed with the alien property
    custodian within thirty days after date of entry of suit: Provided
    further, That the licensee may make any and all defenses which
    would be available were no license granted. The court on due
    proceedings had may adjudge and decree to the said owner payment of
    a reasonable royalty. The amount of said judgment and decree, when
    final, shall be paid on order of the court to the owner of the
    patent from the fund deposited by the licensee, so far as such
    deposit will satisfy said judgment and decree; and the said payment
    shall be in full or partial satisfaction of said judgment and
    decree, as the facts may appear; and if, after payment of all such
    judgments and decrees, there shall remain any balance of said
    deposit, such balance shall be repaid to the licensee on order of
    the alien property custodian. If no suit is brought within one year
    after the end of the war, or no notice is filed as above required,
    then the licensee shall not be liable to make any further deposits,
    and all funds deposited by him shall be repaid to him on order of
    the alien property custodian. Upon entry of suit and notice filed
    as above required, or upon repayment of funds as above provided,
    the liability of the licensee to make further reports to the
    President shall cease.
      If suit is brought as above provided, the court may, at any time,
    terminate the license, and may, in such event, issue an injunction
    to restrain the licensee from infringement thereafter, or the
    court, in case the licensee, prior to suit, shall have made
    investment of capital based on possession of the license, may
    continue the license for such period and upon such terms and with
    such royalties as it shall find to be just and reasonable.
      In the case of any such patent, trade-mark, print, label, or
    copyright, conveyed, assigned, transferred, or delivered to the
    Alien Property Custodian or seized by him, any suit brought under
    this subsection, within the time limited therein, shall be
    considered as having been brought by the owner within the meaning
    of this subsection, in so far as such suit relates to royalties for
    the period prior to the sale by the Alien Property Custodian of
    such patent, trade-mark, print, label, or copyright, if brought
    either by the Alien Property Custodian or by the person who was the
    owner thereof immediately prior to the date such patent, trade-
    mark, print, label, or copyright was seized or otherwise acquired
    by the Alien Property Custodian.
      (g) Any enemy, or ally of enemy, may institute and prosecute
    suits in equity against any person other than a licensee under this
    Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix] to
    enjoin infringement of letters patent, trade-mark, print, label,
    and copyrights in the United States owned or controlled by said
    enemy or ally of enemy, in the same manner and to the extent that
    he would be entitled so to do if the United States was not at war:
    Provided, That no final judgment or decree shall be entered in
    favor of such enemy or ally of enemy by any court except after
    thirty days' notice to the alien property custodian. Such notice
    shall be in writing and shall be served in the same manner as civil
    process of Federal courts.
      (h) All powers of attorney heretofore or hereafter granted by an
    enemy or ally of enemy to any person within the United States, in
    so far as they may be requisite to the performance of acts
    authorized in subsections (a) and (g) of this section, shall be
    valid.
      (i) Whenever the publication of an invention by the granting of a
    patent may, in the opinion of the President, be detrimental to the
    public safety or defense, or may assist the enemy or endanger the
    successful prosecution of the war, he may order that the invention
    be kept secret and withhold the grant of a patent until the end of
    the war: Provided, That the invention disclosed in the application
    for said patent may be held abandoned upon it being established
    before or by the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual
    Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark
    Office that, in violation of said order, said invention has been
    published or that an application for a patent therefor has been
    filed in any other country, by the inventor or his assigns or legal
    representatives, without the consent or approval of the
    commissioner or under a license of the President.
      When an applicant whose patent is withheld as herein provided and
    who faithfully obeys the order of the President above referred to
    shall tender his invention to the Government of the United States
    for its use, he shall, if he ultimately receives a patent, have the
    right to sue for compensation in the United States Court of Federal
    Claims, such right to compensation to begin from the date of the
    use of the invention by the Government.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 12. Property transferred to Alien Property Custodian

-STATUTE-
      All moneys (including checks and drafts payable on demand) paid
    to or received by the alien property custodian pursuant to this Act
    [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix] shall be
    deposited forthwith in the Treasury of the United States, and may
    be invested and reinvested by the Secretary of the Treasury in
    United States bonds or United States certificates of indebtedness,
    under such rules and regulations as the President shall prescribe
    for such deposit, investment, and sale of securities; and as soon
    after the end of the war as the President shall deem practicable,
    such securities shall be sold and the proceeds deposited in the
    Treasury.
      All other property of an enemy, or ally of enemy, conveyed,
    transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the alien property
    custodian hereunder shall be safely held and administered by him
    except as hereinafter provided; and the President is authorized to
    designate as a depositary, or depositaries, of property of an enemy
    or ally of enemy, any bank, or banks, or trust company, or trust
    companies, or other suitable depositary or depositaries, located
    and doing business in the United States. The alien property
    custodian may deposit with such designated depositary or
    depositaries, or with the Secretary of the Treasury, any stocks,
    bonds, notes, time drafts, time bills of exchange, or other
    securities, or property (except money or checks or drafts payable
    on demand which are required to be deposited with the Secretary of
    the Treasury) and such depositary or depositaries shall be
    authorized and empowered to collect any dividends or interest or
    income that may become due and any maturing obligations held for
    the account of such custodian. Any moneys collected on said account
    shall be paid and deposited forthwith by said depositary or by the
    alien property custodian into the Treasury of the United States as
    hereinbefore provided.
      The President shall require all such designated depositaries to
    execute and file bonds sufficient in his judgment to protect
    property on deposit, such bonds to be conditioned as he may direct.
      The alien property custodian shall be vested with all of the
    powers of a common-law trustee in respect of all property, other
    than money, which has been or shall be, or which has been or shall
    be required to be, conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or
    paid over to him in pursuance of the provisions of this Act [said
    sections], and, in addition thereto, acting under the supervision
    and direction of the President, and under such rules and
    regulations as the President shall prescribe, shall have power to
    manage such property and do any act or things in respect thereof or
    make any disposition thereof or of any part thereof, by sale or
    otherwise, and exercise any rights or powers which may be or become
    appurtenant thereto or to the ownership thereof in like manner as
    though he were the absolute owner thereof: Provided, That any
    property sold under this Act [said sections] except when sold to
    the United States, shall be sold only to American citizens, at
    public sale to the highest bidder, after public advertisement of
    time and place of sale which shall be where the property or a major
    portion thereof is situated, unless the President stating the
    reasons therefor, in the public interest shall otherwise determine:
    Provided further, That when sold at public sale, the alien property
    custodian upon the order of the President stating the reasons
    therefor, shall have the right to reject all bids and resell such
    property at public sale or otherwise as the President may direct.
    Any person purchasing property from the alien property custodian
    for an undisclosed principal, or for re-sale to a person not a
    citizen of the United States, or for the benefit of a person not a
    citizen of the United States, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,
    and, upon conviction, shall be subject to a fine of not more than
    $10,000, or imprisonment for not more than ten years, or both, and
    the property shall be forfeited to the United States. It shall be
    the duty of every corporation incorporated within the United States
    and every unincorporated association, or company, or trustee, or
    trustees within the United States issuing shares or certificates
    representing beneficial interests to transfer such shares or
    certificates upon its, his, or their books into the name of the
    alien property custodian upon demand, accompanied by the
    presentation of the certificates which represent such shares or
    beneficial interests. The alien property custodian shall forthwith
    deposit in the Treasury of the United States, as hereinbefore
    provided, the proceeds of any such property or rights so sold by
    him.
      Any money or property required or authorized by the provisions of
    this Act [said sections] to be paid, conveyed, transferred,
    assigned, or delivered to the alien property custodian shall, if
    said custodian shall so direct by written order, be paid, conveyed,
    transferred, assigned, or delivered to the Treasurer of the United
    States with the same effect as if to the alien property custodian.
      After the end of the war any claim of any enemy or of an ally of
    enemy to any money or other property received and held by the alien
    property custodian or deposited in the United States Treasury,
    shall be settled as Congress shall direct: Provided, however, That
    on order of the President as set forth in section nine hereof
    [section 9 of this Appendix], or of the court, as set forth in
    sections nine and ten hereof [sections 9 and 10 of this Appendix],
    the alien property custodian or the Treasurer of the United States,
    as the case may be, shall forthwith convey, transfer, assign, and
    pay to the person to whom the President shall so order, or in whose

-STATUTE-
      During the present war, whenever there is reasonable cause to
    believe that the manifest or the additional statements under oath
    required by the preceding section [section 13 of this Appendix] are
    false or that any vessel, domestic or foreign, is about to carry
    out of the United States any property to or for the account or
    benefit of an enemy, or ally of enemy, or any property or person
    whose export, taking out, or transport will be in violation of law,
    the collector of customs for the district in which such vessel is
    located is authorized and empowered subject to review by the
    President to refuse clearance to any such vessel, domestic or
    foreign, for which clearance is required by law, and by formal
    notice served upon the owners, master, or person or persons in
    command or charge of any domestic vessel for which clearance is not
    required by law, to forbid the departure of such vessel from the
    port, and it shall thereupon be unlawful for such vessel to depart.
      The collector of customs shall, during the present war, in each
    case report to the President the amount of gold or silver coin or
    bullion or other moneys of the United States contained in any cargo
    intended for export. Such report shall include the names and
    addresses of the consignors and consignees, together with any facts
    known to the collector with reference to such shipment and
    particularly those which may indicate that such gold or silver coin
    or bullion or moneys of the United States may be intended for
    delivery or may be delivered, directly or indirectly, to an enemy
    or an ally of enemy.

      "(b)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury may impose a civil penalty
    of not more than $50,000 on any person who violates any license,
    order, rule, or regulation issued under this Act.
      "(2) Any property, funds, securities, papers, or other articles
    or documents, or any vessel, together with its tackle, apparel,
    furniture, and equipment, that is the subject of a violation under
    paragraph (1) shall, at the discretion of the Secretary of the
    Treasury, be forfeited to the United States Government.
      "(3) The penalties provided under this subsection may not be

      1992 - Pub. L. 102-484, which directed substitution of "(a)
    Whoever" for "That whoever" and addition of subsec. (b) at end, was
    executed to reflect the probable intent of Congress in light of the
    intervening general amendment by Pub. L. 102-393 (see below), by
    adding subsec. (b) after subsec. (a).
      Pub. L. 102-393 amended section generally, substituting subsecs.
    (a) to (c) for former undesignated provisions which read as
    follows: "Whoever shall willfully violate any of the provisions of
    this Act or of any license, rule, or regulation issued thereunder,
    and whoever shall willfully violate, neglect, or refuse to comply
    with any order of the President issued in compliance with the

    punished by a like fine, imprisonment, or both, and any property,
    funds, securities, papers, or other articles or documents, or any

      No property or interest or proceeds shall be returned under this
    Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix], nor
    shall any payment be made or judgment awarded in respect of any

    agency of the United States under this Act [said sections] unless
    satisfactory evidence is furnished to the President or such officer
    or agency as he may designate, or the court, as the case may be,
    that the aggregate of the fees to be paid to all agents, attorneys
    at law or in fact, or representatives, for services rendered in
    connection with such return or payment or judgment does not exceed
    10 per centum of the value of such property or interest or proceeds
    or of such payment. Any agent, attorney at law or in fact, or
    representative, believing that the aggregate of the fees should be
    in excess of such 10 per centum may in the case of any return of,
    or the making of any payment in respect of, such property or
    interest or proceeds by the President or such officer or agency as
    he may designate, petition the district court of the United States
    for the district in which he resides for an order authorizing fees
    in excess of 10 per centum and shall name such officer or agency as
    respondent. The court hearing such petition, or a court awarding
    any judgment in respect of any such property or interest or
    proceeds, as the case may be, shall approve an aggregate of fees in
    excess of 10 per centum of the value of such property or interest
    or proceeds only upon a finding that there exist special
    circumstances of unusual hardship which require the payment of such
    excess. Any person accepting any fee in excess of an amount
    approved hereunder, or retaining for more than thirty days any
    portion of a fee, accepted prior to approval hereunder, in excess
    of the fee as approved, shall be guilty of a violation of this Act

    Sec. 24. Payment of taxes and expenses by Alien Property Custodian

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Alien Property Custodian is authorized to pay all taxes
    (including special assessments), heretofore or hereafter lawfully
    assessed by any body politic against any money or other property
    held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States under this Act
    [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix], and to
    pay the necessary expenses incurred by him or by any depositary for
    him in securing the possession, collection, or control of any such
    money or other property, or in protecting or administering the
    same. Such taxes and expenses shall be paid out of the money or
    other property against which such taxes are assessed or in respect
    of which such expenses are incurred, or (if such money or other
    property is insufficient) out of any other money or property held
    for the same person, notwithstanding the fact that a claim may have
    been filed or suit instituted under this Act [said sections]. No
    claim shall be filed with the Alien Property Custodian or allowed
    by him or by the President of the United States, nor shall any suit
    be instituted or maintained against the Alien Property Custodian or
    the Treasurer of the United States, or the United States, under any
    provisions of law, by any person who was an enemy or ally of enemy
    as defined in the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended [said
    sections], and no allowance of any such claim now pending shall be
    made, nor judgment entered in any such suit heretofore or hereafter
    instituted, for the recovery of any deduction or deductions,
    heretofore or hereafter made by the Alien Property Custodian from
    money or properties, or income therefrom, held by him or by the
    Treasurer of the United States hereunder, for the general or
    administrative expenses of the office of the Alien Property
    Custodian, which deduction or deductions on the collection of any
    income do not exceed the sum of two per centum of such income or
    which on the return of any moneys or properties or income
    therefrom, do not exceed the sum of two per centum of the aggregate
    value thereof at the time or times as nearly as may be, of such
    deduction or deductions, or, for the recovery of any deduction or
    deductions heretofore or hereafter made by the Alien Property
    Custodian from money or properties or income therefrom held by him
    or by the Treasurer of the United States hereunder, for any and all
    necessary expenses incurred and actually disbursed by the Alien
    Property Custodian or by any depositary for him in securing the
    possession, collection or control of any such money or properties
    or income therefrom, or in protecting or administering the same, as
    said general or administrative and other expenses and said
    aggregate value of returned money or properties or income therefrom
    have been heretofore or shall be hereafter determined by said Alien
    Property Custodian.
      (b) In the case of income, war-profits, excess-profits, or estate
    taxes imposed by any Act of Congress, the amount thereof shall,
    under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal
    Revenue with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, be
    computed in the same manner (except as hereinafter in this section
    provided) as though the money or other property had not been seized
    by or paid to the Alien Property Custodian, and shall be paid as
    far as practicable, in accordance with subsection (a) of this
    section. Pending final determination of the tax liability the Alien
    Property Custodian is authorized to return, in accordance with the
    provisions of this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of
    this Appendix], money or other property in any trust in such
    amounts as may be determined, under regulations prescribed by the
    Commissioner of Internal Revenue with the approval of the Secretary
    of the Treasury, to be consistent with the prompt payment of the
    full amount of the internal-revenue taxes. Notwithstanding the
    expiration of any period of limitation provided by law, credit or
    refund of any income, war-profits, or excess-profits tax
    erroneously or illegally assessed or collected may be made or
    allowed if claim therefor was filed with the Commissioner of
    Internal Revenue by the Alien Property Custodian on or before
    February 15, 1933.
      (c) So much of the net income of a taxpayer for the taxable year
    1917, or any succeeding taxable year, as represents the gain
    derived from the sale or exchange by the Alien Property Custodian
    of any property conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid
    to him, or seized by him, may at the option of the taxpayer be
    segregated from the net income and separately taxed at the rate of
    30 per centum. This subsection shall be applied and the amount of
    net income to be so segregated shall be determined, under
    regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with
    the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, as nearly as may be
    in the same manner as provided in section 208 of the Revenue Act of
    1926 (relating to capital net gains), but without regard to the
    period for which the property was held by the Alien Property
    Custodian before its sale or exchange, and whether or not the
    taxpayer is an individual.
      (d) Any property sold or exchanged by the Alien Property
    Custodian (whether before or after the date of the enactment of the
    Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 [Mar. 10, 1928]) shall be
    considered as having been compulsorily or involuntarily converted,
    within the meaning of the income, excess-profits, and war-profits
    tax laws and regulations; and the provisions of such laws and
    regulations relating to such a conversion shall (under regulations
    prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with the
    approval of the Secretary of the Treasury) apply in the case of the
    proceeds of such sale or exchange. For the purpose of determining
    whether the proceeds of such conversion have been expended within
    such time as will entitle the taxpayer to the benefits of such laws
    and regulations relating to such a conversion, the date of the
    return of the proceeds to the person entitled thereto shall be
    considered as the date of the conversion.
      (e) In case of any internal-revenue tax imposed in respect of
    property conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the
    Alien Property Custodian, or seized by him, and imposed in respect
    of any period (in the taxable year 1917 or any succeeding taxable
    year) during which such property was held by him or by the
    Treasurer of the United States, no interest or civil penalty shall
    be assessed upon, collected from, or paid by or on behalf of, the
    taxpayer; nor shall any interest be credited or paid to the
    taxpayer in respect of any credit or refund allowed or made in
    respect of such tax.
      (f) The benefits of subsections (c), (d), and (e) shall be
    extended to the taxpayer if claim therefor is filed before the
    expiration of the period of limitations properly applicable
    thereto, or before the expiration of six months after the date of
    the enactment of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 [Mar. 10,
    1928], whichever date is the later. The benefits of subsection (d)
    shall also be extended to the taxpayer if claim therefor is filed
    before the expiration of six months after the return of the
    proceeds.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 25. Investments by Custodian in participating certificates
      issued by Secretary of the Treasury; transfers to and payments
      from German, Austrian or Hungarian special deposit accounts;
      allocation of payments

-STATUTE-
      (a)(1) The Alien Property Custodian is authorized and directed to
    invest, from time to time upon the request of the Secretary of the
    Treasury, out of the funds held by the Alien Property Custodian or
    by the Treasurer of the United States for the Alien Property
    Custodian, an amount not to exceed $40,000,000 in the aggregate, in
    one or more participating certificates issued by the Secretary of
    the Treasury in accordance with the provisions of this section.
      (2) When in the case of any trust written consent under
    subsection (m) of section 9 [section 9(m) of this Appendix] has
    been filed, an amount equal to the portion of such trust the return
    of which is temporarily postponed under such subsection shall be
    credited against the investment made under paragraph (1) of this
    subsection. If the total amount so credited is in excess of the
    amount invested under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the excess
    shall be invested by the Alien Property Custodian in accordance
    with the provisions of this subsection, without regard to the
    $40,000,000 limitation in paragraph (1). If the amount invested
    under paragraph (1) of this subsection is in excess of the total
    amount so credited, such excess shall, from time to time on request
    of the Alien Property Custodian, be paid to him out of the funds in
    the German special deposit account created by section 4 of the
    Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928, and such payments shall have
    priority over any payments therefrom other than the payments under
    paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of such section (relating to
    expenses of administration).
      (b) The Alien Property Custodian is authorized and directed to
    invest, in one or more participating certificates issued by the
    Secretary of the Treasury, out of the unallocated interest fund, as
    defined in section 28 [section 28 of this Appendix] - 
      (1) The sum of $25,000,000. If, after the allocation under
    section 26 [section 26 of this Appendix] has been made, the amount
    of the unallocated interest fund allocated to the trust described
    in subsection (c) of such section is found to be in excess of
    $25,000,000, such excess shall be invested by the Alien Property
    Custodian in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. If
    the amount so allocated is found to be less than $25,000,000 any
    participating certificate or certificates that have been issued
    shall be corrected accordingly; and
      (2) The balance of such unallocated interest fund remaining after
    the investment provided for in paragraph (1) and the payment of
    allocated earnings in accordance with the provisions of subsection
    (b) of section 26 [section 26(b) of this Appendix] have been made.
      (c) If the amount of such unallocated interest fund, remaining
    after the investment required by paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of
    this section has been made, is insufficient to pay the allocated
    earnings in accordance with subsection (b) of section 26 [section
    26(b) of this Appendix], then the amount necessary to make up the
    deficiency shall be paid out of the funds in the German special
    deposit account created by section 4 of the Settlement of War
    Claims Act of 1928, and such payment shall have priority over any
    payments therefrom other than the payments under paragraph (1) of
    subsection (c) of such section (relating to expenses of
    administration) and the payments under paragraph (2) of subsection
    (a) of this section.
      (d) The Alien Property Custodian is authorized and directed
    (after the payment of debts under section 9 [section 9 of this
    Appendix]) to transfer to the Secretary of the Treasury, for
    deposit in such special deposit account, all money and the proceeds
    of all property, including all income, dividends, interest,
    annuities, and earnings accumulated in respect thereof, owned by
    the German Government or any member of the former ruling family.
    All money and other property shall be held to be owned by the
    German Government (1) if no claim thereto has been filed with the
    Alien Property Custodian prior to the expiration of three years
    from the date of the enactment of the Settlement of War Claims Act
    of 1928 [Mar. 10, 1928], or (2) if any claim has been filed before
    the expiration of such period (whether before or after the
    enactment of such Act), then if the ownership thereof under any
    such claim is not established by a decision of the Alien Property
    Custodian or by suit in court instituted, under section 9 [section
    9 of this Appendix], within one year after the decision of the
    Alien Property Custodian, or after the date of the enactment of the
    Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928, whichever date is later. The
    amounts so transferred under this subsection shall be credited upon
    the final payment due the United States from the German Government
    on account of the awards of the Mixed Claims Commission.
      (e) The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to
    issue to the Alien Property Custodian, upon such terms and
    conditions and under such regulations as the Secretary of the
    Treasury may prescribe, one or more participating certificates,
    bearing interest payable annually (as nearly as may be) at the rate
    of 5 per centum per annum, as evidence of the investment by the
    Alien Property Custodian under subsection (a), and one or more non-
    interest bearing participating certificates, as evidence of the
    investment by the Alien Property Custodian under subsection (b).
    All such certificates shall evidence a participating interest, in
    accordance with, and subject to the priorities of, the provisions
    of section 4 of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928, in the
    funds in the German special deposit account created by such
    section, except that - 
      (1) The United States shall assume no liability, directly or
    indirectly, for the payment of any such certificates, or of the
    interest thereon, except out of funds in such special deposit
    account available therefor, and all such certificates shall so
    state on their face; and
      (2) Such certificates shall not be transferable, except that the
    Alien Property Custodian may transfer any such participating
    certificate evidencing the interest of a substantial number of the
    owners of the money invested, to a trustee duly appointed by such
    owners.
      (f) Any amount of principal or interest paid to the Alien
    Property Custodian in accordance with the provisions of subsection
    (c) of section 4 of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 shall
    be allocated pro rata among the persons filing written consents
    under subsection (m) of section 9 of this Act [section 9(m) of this
    Appendix], and the amounts so allocated shall be paid to such
    persons. If any person to whom any amount is payable under this
    subsection has died (or if, in the case of a partnership,
    association, or other unincorporated body of individuals, or a
    corporation, its existence has terminated), payment shall be made
    to the persons determined by the Alien Property Custodian to be
    entitled thereto.
      (g) The Alien Property Custodian is authorized and directed
    (after the payment of debts under section 9 [section 9 of this
    Appendix]) to transfer to the Secretary of the Treasury, for
    deposit in the special deposit account (Austrian or Hungarian, as
    the case may be), created by section 7 of the Settlement of War
    Claims Act of 1928, all money and the proceeds of all property,
    including all income, dividends, interest, annuities, and earnings
    accumulated in respect thereof, owned by the Austrian Government or
    any corporation all the stock of which was owned by or on behalf of
    the Austrian Government (including the property of the Imperial
    Royal Tobacco Monopoly, also known under the name of K. K.
    Oesterreichische Tabak Regie), or owned by the Hungarian Government
    or by any corporation all the stock of which was owned by or on
    behalf of the Hungarian Government.

    Sec. 26. Allocation of "unallocated interest fund"

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Alien Property Custodian shall allocate among the various
    trusts the funds in the "unallocated interest fund" (as defined in
    section 28 [section 28 of this Appendix]). Such allocation shall be
    based upon the earnings (determined by the Secretary of the
    Treasury) on the total amounts deposited under section 12 [section
    12 of this Appendix].
      (b) The Alien Property Custodian, when the allocation has been
    made, is authorized and directed to pay to each person entitled, in
    accordance with a final decision of a court of the United States or
    of the District of Columbia, or of an opinion of the Attorney
    General, to the distribution of any portion of such unallocated
    interest fund, the amount allocated to his trust, except as
    provided in subsection (c) of this section.
      (c) In the case of persons entitled, under paragraph (12), (13),
    (14), or (16) of subsection (b) of section 9 [section 9(b)(12),
    (13), (14), or (16) of this Appendix], to such return, and in the
    case of persons who would be entitled to such return thereunder if
    all such money or property had not been returned under paragraph
    (9) or (10) of such subsection [section 9(b)(9) or (10) of this
    Appendix], and in the case of persons entitled to such return under
    subsection (n) of section 9 [section 9(n) of this Appendix], an
    amount equal to the aggregate amount allocated to their trusts
    shall be credited against the sum of $25,000,000 invested in
    participating certificates under paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of
    section 25 [section 25(b)(1) of this Appendix]. If the aggregate
    amount so allocated is in excess of $25,000,000, an amount equal to
    the excess shall be invested in the same manner. Upon the repayment
    of any of the amounts so invested, under the provisions of section
    4 of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928, the amount so repaid
    shall be distributed pro rata among such persons, notwithstanding
    any receipts or releases given by them.
      (d) The unallocated interest fund shall be available for carrying
    out the provisions of this section, including the expenses of
    making the allocation.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 29. Waiver by Custodian of demand for property; acceptance of
      less amount; approval of Attorney General

-STATUTE-
      (a) Where the Alien Property Custodian has made demand or
    requirement for the conveyance, transfer, assignment, delivery, or
    payment to him of any money or other property of any enemy or ally
    of enemy (whether or not suit or proceeding for the enforcement
    thereof has been begun and whether or not any judgment or decree in
    respect thereof has been made or entered) and where the whole or
    any part of such money or other property would, if conveyed,
    transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to him, be returnable
    under any provision of this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41
    to 44 of this Appendix], the Alien Property Custodian may, in his
    discretion, and on such terms and conditions as he may prescribe,
    waive such demand or requirement, or accept in full satisfaction of
    such demand, requirement, judgment, or decree, a less amount than
    that demanded or required by him.
      (b) The Alien Property Custodian shall not make any such waiver
    or compromise except with the approval of the Attorney General; nor
    (if any part of such money or property would be returnable only
    upon the filing of the written consent required by subsection (m)
    of section 9 [section 9(m) of this Appendix]) unless, after
    compliance with the terms and conditions of such waiver or
    compromise, the Alien Property Custodian or the Treasurer of the
    United States will hold (in respect of such enemy or ally of enemy)
    for investment as provided in section 25 [section 25 of this
    Appendix], an amount equal to 20 per centum of the sum of (1) the
    value of the money or other property held by the Alien Property
    Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States at the time of such
    waiver or compromise, plus (2) the value of the money or other
    property to which the Alien Property Custodian would be entitled
    under such demand or requirement if the waiver or compromise had
    not been made.
      (c) Where the Alien Property Custodian has made demand or
    requirement for the conveyance, transfer, assignment, delivery, or
    payment to him of any money or other property of any enemy or ally
    of enemy (whether or not suit or proceeding for the enforcement
    thereof has been begun and whether or not any judgment or decree in
    respect thereof has been made or entered) and where the interest or
    right of such enemy or ally of enemy in such money or property has
    not, prior to the enactment of the Settlement of War Claims Act of
    1928 [Mar. 10, 1928], vested in enjoyment, the Alien Property
    Custodian may, in his discretion, and on such terms and conditions
    as he may prescribe, waive such demand and requirement, without
    compliance with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section,
    but only with the approval of the Attorney General.
      (d) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the
    Alien Property Custodian to make any waiver or compromise
    authorized by this section, and the Alien Property Custodian may
    proceed in respect of any demand or requirement referred to in
    subsection (a) or (c) as if this section had not been enacted.
      (e) All money or other property received by the Alien Property
    Custodian as a result of any action or proceeding (whether begun
    before or after the enactment of the Settlement of War Claims Act
    of 1928 [Mar. 10, 1928], and whether or not for the enforcement of
    a demand or requirement as above specified) shall for the purposes
    of this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this
    Appendix] be considered as forming a part of the trust in respect
    of which such action or proceeding was brought, and shall be
    subject to return in the same manner and upon the same conditions
    as any other money or property in such trust, except as otherwise
    provided in subsection (b) of this section.

    Sec. 32. Return of property

-STATUTE-
    (a) Conditions precedent
      The President, or such officer or agency as he may designate, may
    return any property or interest vested in or transferred to the
    Alien Property Custodian (other than any property or interest
    acquired by the United States prior to December 18, 1941), or the
    net proceeds thereof, whenever the President or such officer or
    agency shall determine - 
        (1) that the person who has filed a notice of claim for return,
      in such form as the President or such officer or agency may
      prescribe, was the owner of such property or interest immediately
      prior to its vesting in or transfer to the Alien Property
      Custodian, or is the legal representative (whether or not
      appointed by a court in the United States), or successor in
      interest by inheritance, devise, bequest, or operation of law, of
      such owner; and
        (2) that such owner, and legal representative or successor in
      interest, if any, are not - 
          (A) the Government of Germany, Japan, Bulgaria, Hungary, or
        Rumania; or
          (B) a corporation or association organized under the laws of
        such nation: Provided, That any property or interest or
        proceeds which, but for the provisions of this subdivision (B),
        might be returned under this section to any such corporation or
        association, may be returned to the owner or owners of all the
        stock of such corporation or of all the proprietary and
        beneficial interest in such association, if their ownership of
        such stock or proprietary and beneficial interest existed
        immediately prior to vesting in or transfer to the Alien
        Property Custodian and continuously thereafter to the date of
        such return (without regard to purported divestments or
        limitations of such ownership by any government referred to in
        subdivision (A) hereof) and if such ownership was by one or
        more citizens of the United States or by one or more
        corporations organized under the laws of the United States or
        any State, Territory, or possession thereof, or the District of
        Columbia: Provided further, That such owner or owners shall
        succeed to those obligations limited in aggregate amount to the
        value of such property or interest or proceeds, which are
        lawfully assertible against the corporation or association by
        persons not ineligible to receive a return under this section;
        or
          (C) an individual voluntarily resident at any time since
        December 7, 1941, within the territory of such nation, other
        than a citizen of the United States or a diplomatic or consular
        officer of Italy or of any nation with which the United States
        has not at any time since December 7, 1941, been at war:
        Provided, That an individual who, while in the territory of a
        nation with which the United States has at any time since
        December 7, 1941, been at war, was deprived of life or
        substantially deprived of liberty pursuant to any law, decree,
        or regulation of such nation discriminating against political,
        racial, or religious groups, shall not be deemed to have
        voluntarily resided in such territory; or
          (D) an individual who was at any time after December 7, 1941,
        a citizen or subject of Germany, Japan, Bulgaria, Hungary, or
        Rumania, and who on or after December 7, 1941, and prior to the
        date of the enactment of this section [Mar. 8, 1946], was
        present (other than in the service of the United States) in the
        territory of such nation or in any territory occupied by the
        military or naval forces thereof or engaged in any business in
        any such territory: Provided, That notwithstanding the
        provisions of this subdivision (D) return may be made to an
        individual who, as a consequence of any law, decree, or
        regulation of the nation of which he was then a citizen or
        subject, discriminating against political, racial, or religious
        groups, has at no time between December 7, 1941, and the time
        when such law, decree, or regulation was abrogated, enjoyed
        full rights of citizenship under the law of such nation: And
        provided further, That, notwithstanding the provisions of
        subdivision (C) hereof and of this subdivision (D), return may
        be made to an individual who at all times since December 7,
        1941, was a citizen of the United States, or to an individual
        who, having lost United States citizenship solely by reason of
        marriage to a citizen or subject of a foreign country,
        reacquired such citizenship prior to September 29, 1950, if
        such individual would have been a citizen of the United States
        at all times since December 7, 1941, but for such marriage: And
        provided further, That the aggregate book value of returns made
        pursuant to the foregoing proviso shall not exceed $9,000,000;
        and any return under such proviso may be made if the book value
        of any such return, taken together with the aggregate book
        value of returns already made under such proviso does not
        exceed $9,000,000; and for the purposes of this proviso the
        term "book value" means the value, as of the time of vesting,
        entered on the books of the Alien Property Custodian for the
        purpose of accounting for the property or interest involved; or
          (E) a foreign corporation or association which at any time
        after December 7, 1941, was controlled or 50 per centum or more
        of the stock of which was owned by any person or persons
        ineligible to receive a return under subdivisions (A), (B),
        (C), or (D) hereof: Provided, That notwithstanding the
        provisions of this subdivision (E) return may be made to a
        corporation or association so controlled or owned, if such
        corporation or association was organized under the laws of a
        nation any of whose territory was occupied by the military or
        naval forces of any nation with which the United Stats has at
        any time since December 7, 1941, been at war, and if such
        control or ownership arose after March 1, 1938, as an incident
        to such occupation and was terminated prior to the enactment of
        this section [Mar. 8, 1946];

      and
        (3) that the property or interest claimed, or the net proceeds
      of which are claimed, was not at any time after September 1,
      1939, held or used, by or with the assent of the person who was
      the owner thereof immediately prior to vesting in or transfer to
      the Alien Property Custodian, pursuant to any arrangement to
      conceal any property or interest within the United States of any
      person ineligible to receive a return under subsection (a)(2)
      hereof;
        (4) that the Alien Property Custodian has no actual or
      potential liability under the Renegotiation Act [section 1191 of
      this Appendix] or the Act of October 31, 1942 (56 Stat. 1013; 35
      U.S.C. Secs. 89 to 96), in respect of the property or interest or
      proceeds to be returned and that the claimant and his predecessor
      in interest, if any, have no actual or potential liability of any
      kind under the Renegotiation Act or the said Act of October 31,
      1942; or in the alternative that the claimant has provided
      security or undertakings adequate to assure satisfaction of all
      such liabilities or that property or interest or proceeds to be
      retained by the Alien Property Custodian are adequate therefor;
      and
        (5) that such return is in the interest of the United States.
    (b) Extension of filing time limitation for redetermination of
      excessive profits
      Notwithstanding the limitation prescribed in the Renegotiation
    Act [section 1191 of this Appendix] upon the time within which
    petitions may be filed in The Tax Court of the United States,(!1)
    any person to whom any property or interest or proceeds are
    returned hereunder shall, for a period of ninety days (not counting
    Sunday or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia as the last
    day) following return, have the right to file such a petition for a
    redetermination in respect of any final order of the Renegotiation
    Board (!2) determining excessive profits, made against the Alien
    Property Custodian, or of any determination, not embodied in an
    agreement, of excessive profits, so made by or on behalf of a
    Secretary.


    (c) Inventions
      Any person to whom any invention, whether patented or unpatented,
    or any right or interest therein is returned hereunder shall be
    bound by any notice or order issued or agreement made pursuant to
    the Act of October 31, 1942 (56 Stat. 1013; 35 U.S.C. Secs. 89 to
    96), in respect of such invention or right or interest, and such
    person to whom a licensor's interest is returned shall have all
    rights assertible by a licensor pursuant to section 2 of the said
    Act.
    (d) Rights and duties
      Except as otherwise provided herein, and except to the extent
    that the President or such officer or agency as he may designate
    may otherwise determine, any person to whom return is made
    hereunder shall have all rights, privileges, and obligations in
    respect to the property or interest returned or the proceeds of
    which are returned which would have existed if the property or
    interest had not vested in the Alien Property Custodian, but no
    cause of action shall accrue to such person in respect of any
    deduction or retention of any part of the property or interest or
    proceeds by the Alien Property Custodian for the purpose of paying
    taxes, costs, or expenses in connection with such property or
    interest or proceeds: Provided, That except as provided in
    subsections (b) and (c) hereof, no person to whom a return is made
    pursuant to this section, nor the successor in interest of such
    person, shall acquire or have any claim or right of action against
    the United States or any department, establishment or agency
    thereof, or corporation owned thereby, or against any person
    authorized or licensed by the United States, founded upon the
    retention, sale, or other disposition, or use, during the period it
    was vested in the Alien Property Custodian, of the returned
    property, interest, or proceeds. Any notice to the Alien Property
    Custodian in respect of any property or interest or proceeds shall
    constitute notice to the person to whom such property or interest
    or proceeds is returned and such person shall succeed to all
    burdens and obligations in respect of such property or interest or
    proceeds which accrued during the time of retention by the Alien
    Property Custodian, but the period during which the property or
    interest or proceeds returned were vested in the Alien Property
    Custodian shall not be included for the purpose of determining the
    application of any statute of limitations to the assertion of any
    rights by such person in respect of such property or interest or
    proceeds.
    (e) Legal proceeding unaffected
      No return hereunder shall bar the prosecution of any suit at law
    or in equity against a person to whom return has been made, to
    establish any right, title, or interest, which may exist or which
    may have existed at the time of vesting, in or to the property or
    interest returned, but no such suit may be prosecuted by any person
    ineligible to receive a return under subsection (a)(2) hereof. With
    respect to any such suit, the period during which the property or
    interest or proceeds returned were vested in the Alien Property
    Custodian shall not be included for the purpose of determining the
    application of any statute of limitations.
    (f) Notice of intention
      At least thirty days before making any return to any person other
    than a resident of the United States or a corporation organized
    under the laws of the United States, or any State, Territory, or
    possession thereof, or the District of Columbia, the President or
    such officer or agency as he may designate shall publish in the
    Federal Register a notice of intention to make such return,
    specifying therein the person to whom return is to be made and the
    place where the property or interest or proceeds to be returned are
    located. Publication of a notice of intention to return shall
    confer no right of action upon any person to compel the return of
    any such property or interest or proceeds, and such notice of
    intention to return may be revoked by appropriate notice in the
    Federal Register. After publication of such notice of intention and
    prior to revocation thereof, the property or interest or proceeds
    specified shall be subject to attachment at the suit of any citizen
    or resident of the United States or any corporation organized under
    the laws of the United States, or any State, Territory, or
    possession thereof, or the District of Columbia, in the same manner
    as property of the person to whom return is to be made: Provided,
    That notice of any writ of attachment which may issue prior to
    return shall be served upon the Alien Property Custodian. Any such
    attachment proceeding shall be subject to the provisions of law
    relating to limitation of actions applicable to actions at law in
    the jurisdiction in which such proceeding is brought, but the
    period during which the property or interest or proceeds were
    vested in the Alien Property Custodian shall not be included for
    the purpose of determining the period of limitation. No officer of
    any court shall take actual possession, without the consent of the
    Alien Property Custodian, of any property or interest or proceeds
    so attached, and publication of a notice of revocation of intention
    to return shall invalidate any attachment with respect to the
    specified property or interest or proceeds, but if there is no such
    revocation, the President or such officer or agency as he may
    designate shall accord full effect to any such attachment in
    returning any such property or interest or proceeds.
    (g) Payment of expenses of Custodian
      Without limitation by or upon any other existing provision of law
    with respect to the payment of expenses by the Alien Property
    Custodian, the Custodian may retain or recover from any property or
    interest or proceeds returned pursuant to this section or section
    9(a) of this Act [section 9(a) of this Appendix] an amount not
    exceeding that expended or incurred by him for the conservation,
    preservation, or maintenance of such property or interest or
    proceeds, or other property or interest or proceeds returned to the
    same person.
    (h) Designation of successor organizations to receive heirless
      property; time for application; payment of funds: time,
      allocation, claims barred by acceptance and conditions
      The President may designate one or more organizations as
    successors in interest to deceased persons who, if alive, would be
    eligible to receive returns under the provisos of subdivision (C)
    or (D) of subsection (a)(2) thereof.(!3) In the case of any
    organization not so designated before the date of enactment of this
    amendment, such organization may be so designated only if it
    applies for such designation within three months after such date of
    enactment.

      The President, or such officer as he may designate, shall, before
    the expiration of the one-year period which begins on the date of
    enactment of this amendment, pay out of the War Claims Fund to
    organizations designated before or after the date of enactment of
    this amendment pursuant to this subsection the sum of $500,000. If
    there is more than one such designated organization, such sum shall
    be allocated among such organizations in the proportions in which
    the proceeds of heirless property were distributed, pursuant to
    agreements to which the United States was a party, by the
    Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees and successor
    organizations thereto. Acceptance of payment pursuant to this
    subsection by any such organization shall constitute a full and
    complete discharge of all claims filed by such organization
    pursuant to this section, as it existed before the date of
    enactment of this amendment.
      No payment may be made to any organization designated under this
    section unless it has given firm and responsible assurances
    approved by the President that (1) the payment will be used on the
    basis of need in the rehabilitation and settlement of persons in
    the United States who suffered substantial deprivation of liberty
    or failed to enjoy the full rights of citizenship within the
    meaning of subdivisions (C) and (D) of subsection (a)(2) of this
    section; (2) it will make to the President, with a copy to be
    furnished to the Congress, such reports (including a detailed
    annual report on the use of the payment made to it) and permit such
    examination of its books as the President, or such officer or
    agency as he may designate, may from time to time require; and (3)
    it will not use any part of such payment for legal fees, salaries,
    or other administrative expenses connected with the filing of
    claims for such payment or for the recovery of any property or
    interest under this section.
      As used in this subsection, "organization" means only a nonprofit
    charitable corporation incorporated on or before January 1, 1950,
    under the laws of any State of the United States or of the District
    of Columbia with the power to sue and be sued.

-MISC2-
                       PURPOSE OF ACT AUGUST 5, 1947                   
      Congress in enacting act Aug. 5, 1947, outlined the purpose of
    the act as follows:
      "Whereas article 79 of the Treaty of Peace with Italy, signed at
    Paris on February 10, 1947, grants to the Allied and Associated
    Powers the right to seize and retain 'all property rights and
    interests which on the coming into force of the present treaty are
    within its territory and belong to Italy or to Italian nationals,
    and to apply such property or the proceeds thereof to such purposes
    as it may desire, within the limits of its claims and those of its
    nationals against Italy or Italian nationals, including debts,
    other than claims fully satisfied under other articles of the
    present treaty' and further provides that 'All Italian property, or
    the proceeds thereof, in excess of the amount of such claims, shall
    be returned'; and
      "Whereas, pursuant to article 79 of the treaty of peace,
    negotiations have been entered into between the Governments of the
    United States and of Italy looking toward an agreement under which,
    upon the return of property, formerly Italian, in the United
    States, Italy will place at the disposal of the United States funds
    to be used in meeting certain claims of nationals of the United
    States; and
      "Whereas, for the purpose of carrying out such agreement, it is
    desirable to authorize, in accordance with the procedures provided
    for in section 32 of the Trading With the Enemy Act of October 6,
    1917 (40 Stat. 411), as amended [this section], return to Italy or
    citizens or subjects of Italy, or corporations or associations
    organized under the laws of Italy, of property vested in or
    transferred to the United States or its agencies; and
      "Whereas, for the purpose of aiding the revival of the Italian
    economy and establishing it on a self-sustaining basis, it is
    desirable that there be returned or transferred to Italy those
    Italian vessels acquired by the United States after December 7,
    1941, for use in the war effort and now owned by the United States
    and vessels of a total tonnage approximately equal to the tonnage
    of those Italian vessels seized by the United States after
    September 1, 1939, and lost while being employed in the United
    States war effort."

                        RETURN OF ITALIAN PROPERTY                    
      Section 1 of act Aug. 5, 1947, provided: "That the President, or
    such officer or agency as he may designate, is hereby authorized to
    return, in accordance with the procedures provided for in section
    32 of the Trading With the Enemy Act, as amended [this section],
    any property or interest, or the net proceeds thereof, which has
    been, since December 18, 1941, vested in or transferred to any
    officer or agency of the United States pursuant to the Trading With
    the Enemy Act, as amended [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44
    of this Appendix], and which immediately prior to such vesting or
    transfer was the property or interest of Italy or a citizen or
    subject of Italy, or a corporation or association organized under
    the laws of Italy."

                 TRANSFER OF VESSELS TO ITALIAN GOVERNMENT             
      Section 4 of act Aug. 5, 1947, provided: "The President is
    authorized upon such terms as he deems necessary (a) to transfer to
    the Government of Italy all vessels which were under Italian
    registry and flag on September 1, 1939, and were thereafter
    acquired by the United States and are now owned by the United
    States; and (b) with respect to any vessel under Italian registry
    and flag on September 1, 1939, and subsequently seized in United
    States ports and thereafter lost while being employed in the United
    States war effort, to transfer to the Government of Italy surplus
    merchant vessels of the United States of a total tonnage
    approximately equal to the total tonnage of the Italian vessels
    lost: Provided, That no monetary compensation shall be paid either
    for the use by the United States or its agencies of former Italian
    vessels so acquired or seized or for the return or transfer of such
    vessels or substitute vessels."

-HEAD-
    Sec. 34. Payment of debts

-STATUTE-
    (a) Claims allowable; defenses
      Any property or interest vested in or transferred to the Alien
    Property Custodian (other than any property or interest acquired by
    the United States prior to December 18, 1941), or the net proceeds
    thereof, shall be equitably applied by the Custodian in accordance
    with the provisions of this section to the payment of debts owed by
    the person who owned such property or interest immediately prior to
    its vesting in or transfer to the Alien Property Custodian. No debt
    claim shall be allowed under this section if it was not due and
    owing at the time of such vesting or transfer, or if it arose from
    any action or transactions prohibited by or pursuant to this Act
    [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix] and not
    licensed or otherwise authorized pursuant thereto, or (except in
    the case of debt claims acquired by the Custodian) if it was at the
    time of such vesting or transfer due and owing to any person who
    has since the beginning of the war been convicted of violation of
    this Act, as amended [said sections], sections 1 to 6 of the
    Criminal Code, title I of the Act of June 15, 1917 (ch. 30, 40
    Stat. 217), as amended; the Act of April 20, 1918 (ch. 59, 40 Stat.
    534), as amended; the Act of June 8, 1934 (!1) (ch. 327, 52 Stat.
    631), as amended; the Act of January 12, 1938 (ch. 2, 52 Stat. 3);
    title I, Alien Registration Act, 1940 (ch. 439, 54 Stat. 670); the
    Act of October 17, 1940 (ch. 897, 54 Stat. 1201); or the Act of
    June 25, 1942 (ch. 447, 56 Stat. 390). Any defense to the payment
    of such claims which would have been available to the debtor shall
    be available to the Custodian, except that the period from and
    after the beginning of the war shall not be included for the
    purpose of determining the application of any statute of
    limitations. Debt claims allowable hereunder shall include only
    those of citizens of the United States or of the Philippine
    Islands; those of corporations organized under the laws of the
    United States or any State, Territory, or possession thereof, or
    the District of Columbia or the Philippine Islands; those of other
    natural persons who are and have been since the beginning of the
    war residents of the United States and who have not during the war
    been interned or paroled pursuant to the Alien Enemy Act; and those
    acquired by the Custodian. Legal representatives (whether or not
    appointed by a court in the United States) or successors in
    interest by inheritance, devise, bequest, or operation of law or
    debt claimants, other than persons who would themselves be
    disqualified hereunder from allowance of a debt claim, shall be
    eligible for payment to the same extent as their principals or
    predecessors would have been.

    (b) Time limit for filing claims; extension; notice
      The Custodian shall fix a date or dates after which the filing of
    debt claims in respect of any or all debtors shall be barred, and
    may extend the time so fixed, and shall give at least sixty days'
    notice thereof by publication in the Federal Register. In no event
    shall the time extend beyond the expiration of two years from the
    date of the last vesting in or transfer to the Custodian of any
    property or interest of a debtor in respect of whose debts the date
    is fixed, or from the date of enactment of this section [Aug. 8,
    1946], whichever is later. No debt shall be paid prior to the
    expiration of one hundred and twenty days after publication of the
    first such notice in respect of the debtor, nor in any event shall
    any payment of a debt claim be made out of any property or interest
    or proceeds in respect of which a suit or proceeding pursuant to
    this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix]
    for return is pending and was instituted prior to the expiration of
    such one hundred and twenty days.
    (c) Examination of claims
      The Custodian shall examine the claims, and such evidence in
    respect thereof as may be presented to him or as he may introduce
    into the record, and shall make a determination, with respect to
    each claim, of allowance or disallowance, in whole or in part.
    (d) Funds for debt payments
      Payment of debt claims shall be made only out of such money
    included in, or received as net proceeds from the sale, use, or
    other disposition of, any property or interest owned by the debtor
    immediately prior to its vesting in or transfer to the Alien
    Property Custodian, as shall remain after deduction of (1) the
    amount of the expenses of the Office of Alien Property Custodian
    (including both expenses in connection with such property or
    interest or proceeds thereof, and such portion as the Custodian
    shall fix of the other expenses of the Office of Alien Property
    Custodian), and of taxes, as defined in section 36 hereof [section
    36 of this Appendix], paid by the Custodian in respect of such
    property or interest or proceeds, and (2) such amount, if any, as
    the Custodian may establish as a cash reserve for the future
    payment of such expenses and taxes. If the money available
    hereunder for the payment of debt claims against the debtor is
    insufficient for the satisfaction of all claims allowed by the
    Custodian, ratable payments shall be made in accordance with
    subsection (g) hereof to the extent permitted by the money
    available and additional payments shall be made whenever the
    Custodian shall determine that substantial further money has become
    available, through liquidation of any such property or interest or
    otherwise. The Custodian shall not be required through any judgment
    of any court, levy of execution, or otherwise to sell or liquidate
    any property or interest vested in or transferred to him, for the
    purpose of paying or satisfying any debt claim.
    (e) Amount payable; disallowance; notice; review; additional
      evidence; judgment
      If the aggregate of debt claims filed as prescribed does not
    exceed the money from which, in accordance with subsection (d) of
    this section, payment may be made, the Custodian shall pay each
    claim to the extent allowed, and shall serve by registered mail, on
    each claimant whose claim is disallowed in whole or in part, a
    notice of such disallowance. Within sixty days after the date of
    mailing of the Custodian's determination, any debt claimant whose
    claim has been disallowed in whole or in part may file in the
    United States District Court for the District of Columbia a
    complaint for review of such disallowance naming the Custodian as
    defendant. Such complaint shall be served on the Custodian. The
    Custodian, within forty-five days after service on him, shall
    certify and file in said court a transcript of the record of
    proceedings in the Office of Alien Property Custodian with respect
    to the claim in question. Upon good cause shown such time may be
    extended by the court. Such record shall include the claim as
    filed, such evidence with respect thereto as may have been
    presented to the Custodian or introduced into the record by him,
    and the determination of the Custodian with respect thereto,
    including any findings made by him. The court may, in its
    discretion, take additional evidence, upon a showing that such
    evidence was offered to and excluded by the Custodian, or could not
    reasonably have been adduced before him or was not available to
    him. The court shall enter judgment affirming, modifying, or
    reversing the Custodian's determination, and directing payment in
    the amount, if any, which it finds due.
    (f) Pro rata payments; notice; review; additional evidence;
      intervention; judgment
      If the aggregate of debt claims filed as prescribed exceeds the
    money from which, in accordance with subsection (d) hereof, payment
    may be made, the Custodian shall prepare and serve by registered
    mail on all claimants a schedule of all debt claims allowed and the
    proposed payment to each claimant. In preparing such schedule, the
    Custodian shall assign priorities in accordance with the provisions
    of subsection (g) hereof. Within sixty days after the date of
    mailing of such schedule, any claimant considering himself
    aggrieved may file in the United States District Court for the
    District of Columbia a complaint for review of such schedule,
    naming the Custodian as defendant. A copy of such complaint shall
    be served upon the Custodian and on each claimant named in the
    schedule. The Custodian, within forty-five days after service on
    him, shall certify and file in said court a transcript of the
    record of proceedings in the Office of Alien Property Custodian
    with respect to such schedule. Upon good cause shown such time may
    be extended by the court. Such record shall include the claims in
    question as filed, such evidence with respect thereto as may have
    been presented to the Custodian or introduced into the record by
    him, any findings or other determinations made by the Custodian
    with respect thereto, and the schedule prepared by the Custodian.
    The court may, in its discretion, take additional evidence, upon a
    showing that such evidence was offered to and excluded by the
    Custodian or could not reasonably have been adduced before him or
    was not available to him. Any interested debt claimant who has
    filed a claim with the Custodian pursuant to this section, upon
    timely application to the court, shall be permitted to intervene in
    such review proceedings. The court shall enter judgment affirming
    or modifying the schedule as prepared by the Custodian and
    directing payment, if any be found due, pursuant to the schedule as
    affirmed or modified and to the extent of the money from which, in
    accordance with subsection (d) hereof, payment may be made. Pending
    the decision of the court on such complaint for review, and pending
    final determination of any appeal from such decision, payment may
    be made only to an extent, if any, consistent with the contentions
    of all claimants for review.
    (g) Priority of claims
      Debt claims shall be paid in the following order of priority: (1)
    Wage and salary claims, not to exceed $600; (2) claims entitled to
    priority under sections 191 and 193 of title 31 (!2) of the United
    States Code [31 U.S.C. 3713(a) and 9309], except as provided in
    subsection (h) hereof, (3) all other claims for services rendered,
    for expenses incurred in connection with such services, for rent,
    for goods and materials delivered to the debtor, and for payments
    made to the debtor for goods or services not received by the
    claimant; (4) all other debt claims. No payment shall be made to
    claimants within a subordinate class unless the money from which,
    in accordance with subsection (d) hereof, payment may be made
    permits payment in full of all allowed claims in every prior class.

    (h) Priority as debt due United States
      No debt of any kind shall be entitled to priority under any law
    of the United States or any State, Territory, or possession
    thereof, or the District of Columbia, solely by reason of becoming
    a debt due or owing to the United States as a result of its
    acquisition by the Alien Property Custodian.
    (i) Exclusiveness of relief
      The sole relief and remedy available to any person seeking
    satisfaction of a debt claim out of any property or interest which
    shall have been vested in or transferred to the Alien Property
    Custodian (other than any property or interest acquired by the
    United States prior to December 18, 1941), or the proceeds thereof,
    shall be the relief and remedy provided in this section, and suits
    for the satisfaction of debt claims shall not be instituted,
    prosecuted, or further maintained except in conformity with this
    section: Provided, That no person asserting any interest, right, or
    title in any property or interest or proceeds acquired by the Alien
    Property Custodian, shall be barred from proceeding pursuant to
    this Act [sections 1 to 6, and 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this
    Appendix] for the return thereof, by reason of any proceeding which
    he may have brought pursuant to this section; nor shall any
    security interest asserted by the creditor in any such property or
    interest or proceeds be deemed to have been waived solely by reason
    of such proceeding. The Alien Property Custodian shall treat all
    debt claims now filed with him as claims filed pursuant to this
    section. Nothing contained in this section shall bar any person
    from the prosecution of any suit at law or in equity against the
    original debtor or against any other person who may be liable for
    the payment of any debt for which a claim might have been filed
    hereunder. No purchaser, lessee, licensee, or other transferee of
    any property or interest from the Alien Property Custodian shall,
    solely by reason of such purchase, lease, license, or transfer,
    become liable for the payment of any debt owed by the person who
    owned such property or interest prior to its vesting in or transfer
    to the Alien Property Custodian. Payment by the Alien Property
    Custodian to any debt claimant shall constitute, to the extent of
    payment, a discharge of the indebtedness represented by the claim.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 36. Taxes

-STATUTE-
    (a) Liability; exemptions
      The vesting in or transfer to the Alien Property Custodian of any
    property or interest (other than any property or interest acquired
    by the United States prior to December 18, 1941), or the receipt by
    him of any earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof shall not
    render inapplicable any Federal, State, Territorial, or local tax
    for any period prior or subsequent to the date of such vesting or
    transfer, nor render applicable the exemptions provided in title II
    of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] with respect to
    service performed in the employ of the United States Government or
    of any instrumentality of the United States.
    (b) Payment by Custodian; liability of former owner; enforcement of
      tax liability; transfer of property
      The Alien Property Custodian shall, notwithstanding the filing of
    any claim or the institution of any suit under this Act [sections 1
    to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix], pay any tax incident
    to any such property or interest, or the earnings, increment, or
    proceeds thereof, at the earliest time appearing to him to be not
    contrary to the interest of the United States. The former owner
    shall not be liable for any such tax accruing while such property,
    interest, earnings, increment, or proceeds are held by the Alien
    Property Custodian, unless they are returned pursuant to this Act
    [said sections] without payment of such tax by the Alien Property
    Custodian. Every such tax shall be paid by the Alien Property
    Custodian to the same extent, as nearly as may be deemed
    practicable, as though the property or interest had not been vested
    in or transferred to the Alien Property Custodian, and shall be
    paid only out of the property or interest, or earnings, increment,
    or proceeds thereof, to which they are incident or out of other
    property or interests acquired from the same former owner, or
    earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof. No tax liability may be
    enforced from any property or interest or the earnings, increment
    or proceeds thereof while held by the Alien Property Custodian
    except with his consent. Where any property or interest is
    transferred, otherwise than pursuant to section 9(a) or 32 hereof
    [section 9(a) or 32(a) of this Appendix], the Alien Property
    Custodian may transfer the property or interest free and clear of
    any tax, except to the extent of any lien for a tax existing and
    perfected at the date of vesting, and the proceeds of such transfer
    shall, for tax purposes, replace the property or interest in the
    hands of the Alien Property Custodian.
    (c) Computation; suspension of limitations, etc.
      Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the
    manner of computing any Federal taxes, including without limitation
    by reason of this enumeration, the applicability in such
    computation of credits, deductions, and exemptions to which the
    former owner is or would be entitled, and the time and manner of
    any payment of such taxes and the extent of any compliance by the
    Custodian with provisions of Federal law and regulations applicable
    with respect to Federal taxes, shall be in accordance with
    regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with
    the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury to effectuate this
    section. Statutes of limitations on assessment, collection, refund,
    or credit of Federal taxes shall be suspended, with respect to any
    vested property or interest, or the earnings, increment or proceeds
    thereof, while vested and for six months thereafter; but no
    interest shall be paid upon any refund with respect to any period
    during which the statute of limitations is so suspended.
    (d) "Tax" defined
      The word "tax" as used in this section shall include, without
    limitation by reason of this enumeration, any property, income,
    excess-profits, war-profits, excise, estate and employment tax,
    import duty, and special assessment; and also any interest,
    penalty, additional amount, or addition thereto not arising from
    any act, omission, neglect, failure, or delay on the part of the
    Custodian.
    (e) Exemptions
      Any tax exemption accorded to the Alien Property Custodian by
    specific provision of existing law shall not be affected by this
    section.

      hostilities" shall mean the date of enactment of this Act [May
      16, 1946];
        (3) with respect to any other war the term "date of cessation
      of hostilities" shall mean the date specified by proclamation of

      Ex. Ord. No. 10244, May 17, 1951, 16 F.R. 4639, provided:
      1. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General are hereby
    jointly designated as the officers authorized to conclude and give
    effect to agreements relating to the settlement of intercustodial
    conflicts involving enemy property made pursuant to the said act of
    September 28, 1950 [this section], and to exercise all powers
    incident thereto which are conferred by such act, including,
    without limitation, the powers to receive, transfer, release or
    return property, interests therein, or proceeds thereof.
      2. It is the policy of this order that the Secretary of State,
    with the concurrence of the Attorney General, shall perform all
    functions necessary or appropriate to give effect to any agreement
    made pursuant to the said act of September 28, 1950 [this section],
    with relation to the protection of American interests in property
    outside the United States, and that the Attorney General, with the
    concurrence of the Secretary of State, shall perform all functions
    necessary or appropriate to give effect to any such agreement with
    relation to property subject to the jurisdiction of the United
    States, and that all other functions relating to the effectuation
    of any such agreement shall be performed as may be agreed by the
    Secretary of State and the Attorney General. However, no action
    taken hereunder by either the Secretary of State or the Attorney
    General shall be considered to be invalid on the ground that under
    the provisions of this order such action was within the
    jurisdiction of the Secretary of State rather than the Attorney
    General, or vice versa, or that concurrence was not obtained, or
    that such action was not joint.
      3. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General may each
    delegate to the other or to any other officer, person, or agency
    within his respective department such of his functions under this
    order as he may deem necessary.
      4. Any money, property, or interest received as reimbursement by
    the United States by virtue of any agreement made pursuant to the
    said act of September 28, 1950 [this section], shall be
    administered and disposed of by the Attorney General as vested
    property pursuant to the said Trading With the Enemy Act, as
    amended [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix].
    Any other money, property, or interest received by the Secretary of
    State or the Attorney General pursuant to any such agreement shall
    be administered and disposed of pursuant to the provisions of such
    agreement.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 451. Short title; Congressional declaration of policy

-STATUTE-
      (a) This Act may be cited as the "Military Selective Service
    Act".
      (b) The Congress declares that an adequate armed strength must be
    achieved and maintained to insure the security of this Nation.
      (c) The Congress further declares that in a free society the
    obligations and privileges of serving in the armed forces and the
    reserve components thereof should be shared generally, in
    accordance with a system of selection which is fair and just, and
    which is consistent with the maintenance of an effective national
    economy.
      (d) The Congress further declares, in accordance with our
    traditional military policy as expressed in the National Defense
    Act of 1916, as amended, that it is essential that the strength and
    organization of the National Guard, both Ground and Air, as an
    integral part of the first line defenses of this Nation, be at all
    times maintained and assured.
      To this end, it is the intent of the Congress that whenever
    Congress shall determine that units and organizations are needed
    for the national security in excess of those of the Regular
    components of the Ground Forces and the Air Forces, and those in
    active service under this title [sections 451 to 471a of this
    Appendix], the National Guard of the United States, both Ground and
    Air, or such part thereof as may be necessary, together with such
    units of the Reserve components as are necessary for a balanced
    force, shall be ordered to active Federal service and continued
    therein so long as such necessity exists.
      (e) The Congress further declares that adequate provision for
    national security requires maximum effort in the fields of
    scientific research and development, and the fullest possible
    utilization of the Nation's technological, scientific, and other
    critical manpower resources.
      (f) The Congress further declares that the Selective Service
    System should remain administratively independent of any other
    agency, including the Department of Defense.

      Proc. No. 4360, Mar. 29, 1975, 40 F.R. 14567, 89 Stat. 1255,
    provided:
      Under authority vested in the President by the Military Selective
    Service Act (62 Stat. 604), as amended [see References In Text note
    set out under section 451 of this Appendix], procedures have been
    established for the registration of male citizens of the United
    States and of other male persons who are subject to registration
    under section 3 of said act, as amended (85 Stat. 348) [this
    section].
      In order to evaluate an annual registration system, existing
    procedures are being terminated and will be replaced by new
    procedures which will provide for periodic registration.
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States
    of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
    Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including the
    Military Selective Service Act, as amended, do hereby revoke
    Proclamations No. 2799 of July 20, 1948, No. 2937 of August 16,
    1951, No. 2938 of August 16, 1951, No. 2942 of August 30, 1951, No.

    4101 of January 13, 1972; thereby terminating the present
    procedures for registration under the Military Selective Service
    Act, as amended.
      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth
    day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-five,
    and of the Independence of the United States of America the one
    hundred ninety-ninth.
                                                         Gerald R. Ford.

       PROC. NO. 4771. REGISTRATION UNDER THE SELECTIVE SERVICE ACT   
      Proc. No. 4771, July 2, 1980, 45 F.R. 45247, 94 Stat. 3775, as
    amended by Proc. No. 7275, Feb. 22, 2000, 65 F.R. 9199, provided:
      Section 3 of the Military Selective Service Act, as amended (50
    U.S.C. App. 453), provides that male citizens of the United States
    and other male persons residing in the United States who are
    between the ages of 18 and 26, except those exempted by Sections 3
    and 6(a) of the Military Selective Service Act [50 U.S.C. App. 453
    and 456(a)], must present themselves for registration at such time
    or times and place or places, and in such manner as determined by
    the President. Section 6(k) [50 U.S.C. App. 456(k)] provides that
    such exceptions shall not continue after the cause for the
    exemption ceases to exist.
      The Congress of the United States has made available the funds
    (H.J. Res. 521, approved by me on June 27, 1980 [Pub. L. 96-282,

    between the ages of eighteen years and six months and twenty-six
    years, at the time fixed for his registration, or who attains the
    age of eighteen years and six months after having been required to
    register pursuant to section 3 of this title [section 453 of this
    Appendix], or who is otherwise liable as provided in section 6(h)
    of this title [section 456(h) of this Appendix], shall be liable

    Provided, That each registrant shall be immediately liable for
    classification and examination, and shall, as soon as practicable
    following his registration, be so classified and examined, both
    physically and mentally, in order to determine his availability for
    induction for training and service in the Armed Forces: Provided
    further, That, notwithstanding any other provision of law, any
    registrant who has failed or refused to report for induction shall
    continue to remain liable for induction and when available shall be
    immediately inducted. The President is authorized, from time to
    time, whether or not a state of war exists, to select and induct
    into the Armed Forces of the United States for training and service
    in the manner provided in this title [said sections] (including but
    not limited to selection and induction by age group or age groups)
    such number of persons as may be required to provide and maintain
    the strength of the Armed Forces.
      At such time as the period of active service in the Armed Forces

    persons deferred under the provisions of section 6 of this title
    [section 456 of this Appendix] shall not be relieved from liability
    for induction into the National Security Training Corps solely by
    reason of having exceeded the age of nineteen years during the
    period of such deferment. The President is authorized, from time to
    time, whether or not a state of war exists, to select and induct

    further, That the passing requirement for the Armed Forces
    Qualification Test shall be fixed at a percentile score of 10

    requirements fixed by the preceding two provisos may be modified by
    the President under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe.
      No persons shall be inducted for such training and service until
    adequate provision shall have been made for such shelter, sanitary
    facilities, water supplies, heating and lighting arrangements,
    medical care, and hospital accommodations for such persons as may
    be determined by the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of
    Homeland Security to be essential to the public and personal
    health.
      The persons inducted into the Armed Forces for training and
    service under this title [said sections] shall be assigned to
    stations or units of such forces. Persons inducted into the land

    be used for the purpose of transporting or maintaining in violation
    of the provisions of this paragraph any person inducted into, or
    enlisted, appointed, or ordered to active duty in, the Armed Forces
    under the provisions of this title [said sections].

    United States Coast Guard), may provide, by regulations which shall
    be as nearly uniform as practicable, for the release from training
    and service in the armed forces prior to serving the periods

    appointment in a reserve component of the armed forces shall, upon
    discharge from such enlistment under honorable conditions, be
    transferred to a reserve component of the armed forces of the
    United States and shall serve therein for a period of six years or
    until sooner discharged. Each such person shall, so long as he is a
    member of such reserve component, be liable to be ordered to active
    duty, but except in time of war or national emergency declared by
    the Congress no such person shall be ordered to active duty,
    without his consent and except as hereinafter provided, for more
    than one month in any year. In case the Secretary of the Army, the
    Secretary of the Navy, or the Secretary of the Air Force determines
    that enlistment, enrollment, or appointment in, or assignment to,
    an organized unit of a reserve component or an officers' training
    program of the armed force in which he served is available to, and
    can without undue hardship be filled by, any such person, it shall
    be the duty of such person to enlist, enroll, or accept appointment
    in, or accept assignment to, such organized unit or officers'
    training program and to serve satisfactorily therein for a period
    of four years. Any such person who fails or refuses to perform such
    duty may be ordered to active duty, without his consent, for an
    additional period of not more than twelve consecutive months. Any
    such person who enlists or accepts appointment in any such
    organized unit and serves satisfactorily therein for a period of
    four years shall, except in time of war or national emergency
    declared by the Congress, be relieved from any further liability
    under this subsection to serve in any reserve component of the
    armed forces of the United States, but nothing in this subsection
    shall be construed to prevent any such person, while in a reserve
    component of such forces, from being ordered or called to active
    duty in such forces. The Secretary of Defense is authorized to
    prescribe regulations governing the transfer of such persons within
    and between reserve components of the armed forces and determining,
    for the purpose of the requirements of the foregoing provisions of
    this paragraph, the credit to be allowed any person so transferring
    for his previous service in one or more reserve components.
      (3) Each person who, subsequent to June 19, 1951, and on or
    before August 9, 1955, is inducted, enlisted, or appointed, under

    components thereof, or in the National Security Training Corps
    prior to attaining the twenty-sixth anniversary of his birth, shall
    be required to serve on active training and service in the Armed
    Forces or in training in the National Security Training Corps, and
    in a reserve component, for a total period of eight years, unless
    sooner discharged on grounds of personal hardship, in accordance
    with regulations and standards prescribed by the Secretary of
    Defense (or the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the
    United States Coast Guard). Each such person, on release from
    active training and service in the Armed Forces or from training in
    the National Security Training Corps, shall, if physically and
    mentally qualified, be transferred to a reserve component of the
    Armed Forces, and shall serve therein for the remainder of the
    period which he is required to serve under this paragraph and shall
    be deemed to be a member of the reserve component during that
    period. If the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, or
    the Secretary of the Air Force, or the Secretary of Transportation
    with respect to the United States Coast Guard, determines that
    enlistment, enrollment, or appointment in, or assignment to, an
    organized unit of a reserve component or an officers' training
    program of the armed force in which he served is available to, and
    can, without undue personal hardship, be filled by such a person,
    that person shall enlist, enroll, or accept appointment in, or
    accept assignment to, the organized unit or officers' training
    program, and serve satisfactorily therein.

    serving under that induction, receive compensation from that
    person.

    which the Director of Selective Service may establish, with respect
    to the identification, selection, and deferment of needed
    professional and scientific personnel and those engaged in, and

    the performance of its duties under this subsection the National
    Security Council shall consider the needs of both the Armed Forces
    and the civilian segment of the population.

    impartial manner, under such rules and regulations as the President
    may prescribe, from the persons who are liable for such training
    and service and who at the time of selection are registered and
    classified, but not deferred or exempted: Provided, That in the
    selection of persons for training and service under this title
    [sections 451 to 471a of this Appendix], and in the interpretation
    and execution of the provisions of this title [said sections],
    there shall be no discrimination against any person on account of
    race or color: Provided further, That in the classification of
    registrants within the jurisdiction of any local board, the
    registrants of any particular registration may be classified, in
    the manner prescribed by and in accordance with rules and
    regulations prescribed by the President, before, together with, or
    after the registrants of any prior registration or registrations;
    and in the selection for induction of persons within the
    jurisdiction of any local board and within any particular
    classification, persons who were registered at any particular
    registration may be selected, in the manner prescribed by and in
    accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the President,
    before, together with, or after persons who were registered at any
    prior registration or registrations: And provided further, That
    nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the selection or
    induction of persons by age group or groups under rules and
    regulations prescribed by the President: And provided further, That
    - 
        (1) no local board shall order for induction for training and
      service in the Armed Forces of the United States any person who
      has not attained the age of nineteen unless there is not within
      the jurisdiction of such local board a sufficient number of
      persons who are deemed by such local board to be available for
      induction and who have attained the age of nineteen to enable
      such local board to meet a call for men which it has been ordered
      to furnish for induction;
        (2) no local board shall order for induction for training and
      service in the Armed Forces of the United States any person who
      has not attained the age of nineteen, if there is any person
      within the jurisdiction of such local board who (i) is as much as
      ninety days older, (ii) has not attained the age of nineteen, and
      (iii) is deemed by the local board to be available for induction;

    this title [sections 451 to 471a of this Appendix] shall be

    of Columbia, and for subdivisions thereof, on the basis of the
    actual number of men in the several States, Territories,
    possessions, and the District of Columbia, and the subdivisions
    thereof, who are liable for such training and service but who are
    not deferred after classification, except that credits shall be
    given in fixing such quotas for residents of such subdivisions who
    are in the armed forces of the United States on the date fixed for
    determining such quotas. After such quotas are fixed, credits shall
    be given in filling such quotas for residents of such subdivisions
    who subsequently become members of such forces. Until the actual
    numbers necessary for determining the quotas are known, the quotas
    may be based on estimates, and subsequent adjustments therein shall
    be made when such actual numbers are known. All computations under
    this subsection shall be made in accordance with such rules and
    regulations as the President may prescribe.
      (c) Terminated

      Proc. No. 3945, Nov. 26, 1969, 34 F.R. 19017, 83 Stat. 972,
    provided:
      WHEREAS section 5(a)(1) of the Military Selective Service Act of
    1967, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 455(a)(1)) [now the Military
    Selective Service Act], provides that selection of persons for
    training and service under that Act shall be made in an impartial
    manner without discrimination on account of race or color, under
    such rules and regulations as the President may prescribe; and
      WHEREAS section 5(a)(2) of that Act (50 U.S.C. App. 455(a)(2))
    limited the President's authority to prescribe rules and
    regulations by requiring, in effect, the selection of registrants
    through a method known as "oldest first"; and
      WHEREAS such section 5(a)(2) has been repealed by Public Law 91-
    124 of November 26, 1969:
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States
    of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in
    me by section 5(a) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967,
    as amended, and having determined that a method of random selection
    will provide the most equitable basis for selection of registrants
    for military training and service, do hereby proclaim the
    following:
      That a random selection sequence will be established by a drawing
    to be conducted in Washington, D.C., on December 1, 1969, and will
    be applied nationwide. The random selection method will use 366
    days to represent the birthdays (month and day only) of all
    registrants who, prior to January 1, 1970, shall have attained
    their nineteenth year of age but not their twenty-sixth. The
    drawing, commencing with the first day selected and continuing
    until all 366 days are drawn, shall be accomplished impartially.
      On the day designated above, a supplemental drawing or drawings
    will be conducted to determine alphabetically the random selection
    sequence by name among registrants who have the same birthday.
      The random selection sequence obtained as described above shall
    determine the order of selection of registrants who prior to
    January 1, 1970, shall have attained their nineteenth year of age
    but not their twenty-sixth and who are not volunteers and not
    delinquents. New random selection sequences shall be established,
    in a similar manner, for registrants who attain their nineteenth
    year of age on or after January 1, 1970.
      The random sequence number determined for any registrant shall
    apply to him so long as he remains subject to induction for
    military training and service by random selection.
      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth
    day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-
    nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the
    one hundred and ninety-fourth.
                                                          Richard Nixon.

    except after a declaration of war or national emergency made by the
    Congress subsequent to the date of enactment of this title [June
    24, 1948], if - 
        (A) the local board determines that he is regularly enlisted or
      commissioned in any organized unit of a reserve component of the
      armed force in which he served, provided such unit is reasonably
      accessible to such person without unduly interrupting his normal
      pursuits and activities (including attendance at a college or
      university in which he is regularly enrolled), or in a reserve
      component (other than in an organized unit) of such armed force
      in any case in which enlistment or commission in an organized
      unit of a reserve component of such armed force is not available
      to him; or
        (B) the local board determines that enlistment or commission in
      a reserve component of such armed force is not available to him
      or that he has voluntarily enlisted or accepted appointment in an
      organized unit of a reserve component of an armed force other
      than the armed force in which he served.

    Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to be applicable to any
    person to whom paragraph (1) of this subsection is applicable.
      (3) Except as provided in section 5(a) of this Act [section
    455(a) of this Appendix], and notwithstanding any other provision
    of this Act, no person who (A) has served honorably on active duty
    after September 16, 1940, for a period of not less than one year in
    the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, the Marine Corps, or the Coast
    Guard, or (B) subsequent to September 16, 1940, was discharged for
    the convenience of the Government after having served honorably on
    active duty for a period of not less than six months in the Army,
    the Air Force, the Navy, the Marine Corps, or the Coast Guard, or
    (C) has served for a period of not less than twenty-four months (i)
    as a commissioned officer in the Public Health Service or (ii) as a
    commissioned officer in the Coast and Geodetic Survey,(!2) shall be
    liable for induction for training and service under this Act,
    except after a declaration of war or national emergency made by the
    Congress subsequent to the date of enactment of this title [June
    24, 1948].

      (4) No person who is honorably discharged upon the completion of
    an enlistment pursuant to section 4(c) [section 454(c) of this
    Appendix] shall be liable for induction for training and service
    under this title [sections 451 to 471a of this Appendix], except
    after a declaration of war or national emergency made by the
    Congress subsequent to the date of enactment of this title [June
    24, 1948].
      (5) For the purposes of computation of the periods of active duty
    referred to in paragraphs (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection, no
    credit shall be allowed for - 
        (A) periods of active duty training performed as a member of a
      reserve component pursuant to an order or call to active duty
      solely for training purposes;
        (B) periods of active duty in which the service consisted
      solely of training under the Army specialized training program,
      the Army Air Force college training program, or any similar
      program under the jurisdiction of the Navy, Marine Corps, or
      Coast Guard;
        (C) periods of active duty as a cadet at the United States
      Military Academy or United States Coast Guard Academy, or as a
      midshipman at the United States Naval Academy, or in a

      candidate for admission to any of such academies; or
        (D) periods of active duty in any of the armed forces while
      being processed for entry into or separation from any educational
      program or institution referred to in paragraphs (B) or (C);

      (c)(1) Persons who, on February 1, 1951, were members of
    organized units of the federally recognized National Guard, the
    federally recognized Air National Guard, the Officers' Reserve
    Corps, the Regular Army Reserve, the Air Force Reserve, the
    Enlisted Reserve Corps, the Naval Reserve, the Marine Corps
    Reserve, the Coast Guard Reserve, or the Public Health Service
    Reserve, shall, so long as they continue to be such members and
    satisfactorily participate in scheduled drills and training periods
    as prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, be exempt from training
    and service by induction under the provisions of this title
    [sections 451 to 471a of this Appendix], but shall not be exempt
    from registration unless on active duty.
      (2)(A) Any person, other than a person referred to in subsection
    (d) of this section, who - 
        (i) prior to the issuance of orders for him to report for
      induction; or
        (ii) prior to the date scheduled for his induction and pursuant
      to a proclamation by the Governor of a State to the effect that
      the authorized strength of any organized unit of the National
      Guard of that State cannot be maintained by the enlistment or
      appointment of persons who have not been issued orders to report
      for induction under this title [sections 451 to 471a of this
      Appendix]; or
        (iii) prior to the date scheduled for his induction and
      pursuant to a determination by the President that the strength of
      the Ready Reserve of the Army Reserve, Naval Reserve, Marine
      Corps Reserve, Air Force Reserve, or Coast Guard Reserve cannot
      be maintained by the enlistment or appointment of persons who
      have not been issued orders to report for induction under this
      title [sections 451 to 471a of this Appendix];

    enlists or accepts appointment, before attaining the age of 26
    years, in the Ready Reserve of any Reserve component of the Armed
    Forces, the Army National Guard, or the Air National Guard, shall
    be deferred from training and service under this title [sections
    451 to 471a of this Appendix] so long as he serves satisfactorily
    as a member of an organized unit of such Reserve or National Guard
    in accordance with section 10147 of title 10 or section 502 of
    title 32, United States Code, as the case may be, or satisfactorily
    performs such other Ready Reserve service as may be prescribed by
    the Secretary of Defense. Enlistments or appointments under
    subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this clause may be accepted
    notwithstanding the provisions of section 15(d) of this title
    [section 465(d) of this Appendix]. Notwithstanding the provisions
    of subsection (h) of this section, no person deferred under this
    clause who has completed six years of such satisfactory service as
    a member of the Ready Reserve or National Guard, and who during
    such service has performed active duty for training with an armed
    force for not less than twelve consecutive weeks, shall be liable
    for induction for training and service under this Act, except after
    a declaration of war or national emergency made by the Congress
    after August 9, 1955. In no event shall the number of enlistments
    or appointments made under authority of this paragraph in any
    fiscal year in any Reserve component of the Armed Forces or in the
    Army National Guard or the Air National Guard cause the personnel
    strength of such Reserve component or the Army National Guard or
    the Air National Guard, as the case may be, to exceed the personnel
    strength for which funds have been made available by the Congress
    for such fiscal year.
      (B) A person who, under any provision of law, is exempt or
    deferred from training and service under this Act by reason of
    membership in a reserve component, the Army National Guard, or the
    Air National Guard, as the case may be, shall, if he becomes a
    member of another reserve component, the Army National Guard, or
    the Air National Guard, as the case may be, continue to be exempt
    or deferred to the same extent as if he had not become a member of
    another reserve component, the Army National Guard, or the Air
    National Guard, as the case may be, so long as he continues to
    serve satisfactorily.
      (C) Except as provided in subsection (b) and the provisions of
    this subsection, no person who becomes a member of a reserve
    component after February 1, 1951, shall thereby be exempt from
    registration or training and service by induction under the
    provisions of this Act.
      (D) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the
    President, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe,
    may provide that any person enlisted or appointed after October 4,
    1961, in the Ready Reserve of any reserve component of the Armed
    Forces (other than under section 12103 of title 10, United States
    Code), the Army National Guard, or the Air National Guard, prior to
    attaining age of twenty-six years, or any person enlisted or
    appointed in the Army National Guard or the Air National Guard or
    enlisted in the Ready Reserve of any reserve component prior to
    attaining the age of eighteen years and six months and deferred
    under the prior provisions of this paragraph as amended by the Act
    of October 4, 1961, Public Law 87-378 (75 Stat. 807), or under
    section 262 of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952, as amended [50
    U.S.C. 1013], who fails to serve satisfactorily during his
    obligated period of service as a member of such Ready Reserve or
    National Guard or the Ready Reserve of another reserve component or
    the National Guard of which he becomes a member, may be selected
    for training and service and inducted into the armed force of which
    such reserve component is a part, prior to the selection and
    induction of other persons liable therefor.
      (d)(1) Within such numbers as may be prescribed by the Secretary
    of Defense, any person who (A) has been or may hereafter be
    selected for enrollment or continuance in the senior division,
    Reserve Officers' Training Corps, or the Air Reserve Officers'
    Training Corps, or the Naval Reserve Officers' Training Corps, or
    the naval and Marine Corps officer candidate training program
    established by the Act of August 13, 1946 (60 Stat. 1057), as
    amended, or the Reserve officers' candidate program of the Navy, or
    the platoon leaders' class of the Marine Corps, or the officer
    procurement programs of the Coast Guard and the Coast Guard
    Reserve, or appointed an ensign, United States Navy Reserve, while
    undergoing professional training; (B) agrees, in writing, to accept
    a commission, if tendered, and to serve, subject to order of the
    Secretary of the military department having jurisdiction over him
    (or the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the United
    States Coast Guard), not less than two years on active duty after
    receipt of a commission; and (C) agrees to remain a member of a
    regular or reserve component until the eighth anniversary of the
    receipt of a commission in accordance with his obligation under the
    first sentence of section 651 of title 10, United States Code, or
    until the sixth anniversary of the receipt of a commission in
    accordance with his obligation under the second sentence of section
    651 of title 10, United States Code, shall be deferred from
    induction under this title [sections 451 to 471a of this Appendix]
    until after completion or termination of the course of instruction
    and so long as he continues in a regular or reserve status upon
    being commissioned, but shall not be exempt from registration. Such
    persons, except those persons who have previously completed an
    initial period of military training or an equivalent period of
    active military training and service, shall be required while
    enrolled in such programs to complete a period of training equal
    (as determined under regulations approved by the Secretary of
    Defense or the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the
    United States Coast Guard) in duration and type of training to an
    initial period of military training. There shall be added to the
    obligated active commissioned service of any person who has agreed
    to perform such obligatory service in return for financial
    assistance while attending a civilian college under any such
    training program a period of not to exceed one year. Except as
    provided in paragraph (5), upon the successful completion by any
    person of the required course of instruction under any program
    listed in clause (A) of the first sentence of this paragraph, such
    person shall be tendered a commission in the appropriate reserve
    component of the Armed Forces if he is otherwise qualified for such
    appointment. If, at the time of, or subsequent to, such
    appointment, the armed force in which such person is commissioned
    does not require his service on active duty in fulfillment of the
    obligation undertaken by him in compliance with clause (B) of the
    first sentence of this paragraph, such person shall be ordered to
    active duty for training with such armed force in the grade in
    which he was commissioned for a period of active duty for training
    of not more than six months (not including duty performed under
    section 10147 of title 10, United States Code), as determined by
    the Secretary of the military department concerned to be necessary
    to qualify such person for a mobilization assignment. Upon being
    commissioned and assigned to a reserve component, such person shall
    be required to serve therein, or in a reserve component of any
    other armed force in which he is later appointed, until the eighth
    anniversary of the receipt of such commission pursuant to the
    provisions of this section. So long as such person performs
    satisfactory service, as determined under regulations prescribed by
    the Secretary of Defense, he shall be deferred from training and
    service under the provisions of this Act. If such person fails to
    perform satisfactory service, and such failure is not excused under
    regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, his commission
    may be revoked by the Secretary of the military department
    concerned.
      (2) In addition to the training programs enumerated in paragraph
    (1) of this subsection, and under such regulations as the Secretary
    of Defense (or the Secretary of the Treasury (!3) with respect to
    the United States Coast Guard) may approve, the Secretaries of the
    military departments and the Secretary of the Treasury (!3) are
    authorized to establish officer candidate programs leading to the
    commissioning of persons on active duty. Any person heretofore or
    hereafter enlisted in the Army Reserve, the Navy Reserve, the
    Marine Corps Reserve, the Air Force Reserve, or the Coast Guard
    Reserve who thereafter has been or may be commissioned therein upon
    graduation from an Officers' Candidate School of such Armed Force
    shall, if not ordered to active duty as a commissioned officer, be
    deferred from training and service under the provisions of this Act
    so long as he performs satisfactory service as a commissioned
    officer in an appropriate unit of the Ready Reserve, as determined
    under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the department
    concerned. If such person fails to perform satisfactory service in
    such unit, and such failure is not excused under such regulations,
    his commission may be revoked by such Secretary.

      (3) Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to preclude the
    President from providing, by regulations prescribed under
    subsection (h) of this section, for the deferment from training and
    service of any category or categories of students for such periods
    of time as he may deem appropriate.
      (4) Omitted.
      (5) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), upon the successful completion
    by any person of the required course of instruction under any
    Reserve Officers' Training Corps program listed in clause (A) of
    the first sentence of paragraph (1) and subject to the approval of
    the Secretary of the military department having jurisdiction over
    him, such person may, without being relieved of his obligation
    under that sentence, be tendered, and accept, a commission in the
    National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration instead of a
    commission in the appropriate reserve component of the Armed
    Forces. If he does not serve on active duty as a commissioned
    officer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for
    at least six years, he shall, upon discharge therefrom, be tendered
    a commission in the appropriate reserve component of the Armed
    Forces, if he is otherwise qualified for such appointment, and, in
    fulfillment of his obligation under the first sentence of paragraph
    (1), remain a member of a reserve component until the sixth
    anniversary of the receipt of his commission in the National
    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. While a member of a reserve
    component he may, in addition to as otherwise provided by law, be
    ordered to active duty for such period that, when added to the
    period he served on active duty as a commissioned officer of the
    National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, equals two years.
      (e) Fully qualified and accepted aviation cadet applicants of the
    Army, Navy, or Air Force who have signed an agreement of service
    shall, in such numbers as may be designated by the Secretary of
    Defense, be deferred, during the period covered by the agreement
    but not to exceed four months, from induction for training and
    service under this title [sections 451 to 471a of this Appendix]
    but shall not be exempt from registration.
      (f) The Vice President of the United States; the governors of the
    several States, Territories, and possessions, and all other
    officials chosen by the voters of the entire State, Territory, or
    possession; members of the legislative bodies of the United States
    and of the several States, Territories, and possessions; judges of
    the courts of record of the United States and of the several
    States, Territories, possessions, and the District of Columbia
    shall, while holding such offices, be deferred from training and
    service under this title [sections 451 to 471a of this Appendix] in
    the armed forces of the United States.
      (g)(1) Regular or duly ordained ministers of religion, as defined
    in this title [sections 451 to 471a of this Appendix], shall be
    exempt from training and service, but not from registration, under
    this title [said sections].
      (2) Students preparing for the ministry under the direction of
    recognized churches or religious organizations, who are
    satisfactorily pursuing full-time courses of instruction in
    recognized theological or divinity schools, or who are
    satisfactorily pursuing full-time courses of instruction leading to
    their entrance into recognized theological or divinity schools in
    which they have been preenrolled, shall be deferred from training
    and service, but not from registration, under this title [sections
    451 to 471a of this Appendix]. Persons who are or may be deferred
    under the provisions of this subsection shall remain liable for
    training and service in the Armed Forces under the provisions of
    section 4(a) of this Act [section 454(a) of this Appendix] until
    the thirty-fifth anniversary of the date of their birth. The
    foregoing sentence shall not be construed to prevent the exemption
    or continued deferment of such persons if otherwise exempted or
    deferrable under any other provision of this Act.
      (h) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection the President
    is authorized, under such rules and regulations as he may
    prescribe, to provide for the deferment from training and service
    in the Armed Forces of any or all categories of persons whose
    employment in industry, agriculture, or other occupations or
    employment, or whose continued service in an Office (other than an
    Office described in subsection (f)) under the United States or any
    State, territory, or possession, or the District of Columbia, or
    whose activity in study, research, or medical, dental, veterinary,
    optometric, osteopathic, scientific, pharmaceutical, chiropractic,
    chiropodial, or other endeavors is found to be necessary to the
    maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest: Provided,
    That no person within any such category shall be deferred except
    upon the basis of his individual status: Provided further, That
    persons who are or may be deferred under the provisions of this
    section shall remain liable for training and service in the Armed
    Forces under the provisions of section 4(a) of this Act [section
    454(a) of this Appendix] until the thirty-fifth anniversary of the
    date of their birth. This proviso shall not be construed to prevent
    the continued deferment of such persons if otherwise deferrable
    under any other provisions of this Act. The President is also
    authorized, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe,
    to provide for the deferment from training and service in the Armed
    Forces (1) of any or all categories of persons in a status with
    respect to persons (other than wives alone, except in cases of
    extreme hardship) dependent upon them for support which renders
    their deferment advisable, and (2) of any or all categories of
    those persons found to be physically, mentally, or morally
    deficient or defective. For the purpose of determining whether or
    not the deferment of any person is advisable, because of his status
    with respect to persons dependent upon him for support, any
    payments of allowances which are payable by the United States to
    the dependents of persons serving in the Armed Forces of the United
    States shall be taken into consideration, but the fact that such
    payments of allowances are payable shall not be deemed conclusively
    to remove the grounds for deferment when the dependency is based
    upon financial considerations and shall not be deemed to remove the
    ground for deferment when the dependency is based upon other than
    financial considerations and cannot be eliminated by financial
    assistance to the dependents. Except as otherwise provided in this
    subsection, the President is also authorized, under such rules and
    regulations as he may prescribe, to provide for the deferment from
    training and service in the Armed Forces of any or all categories
    of persons who have children, or wives and children, with whom they
    maintain a bona fide family relationship in their homes. No
    deferment from such training and service in the Armed Forces shall
    be made in the case of any individual except upon the basis of the
    status of such individual. There shall be posted in a conspicuous
    place at the office of each local board a list setting forth the
    names and classifications of those persons who have been classified
    by such local board. The President may, in carrying out the
    provisions of this title [sections 451 to 471a of this Appendix],
    recommend criteria for the classification of persons subject to
    induction under this title [said sections], and to the extent that
    such action is determined by the President to be consistent with
    the national interest, recommend that such criteria be administered
    uniformly throughout the United States whenever practicable; except
    that no local board, appeal board, or other agency of appeal of the
    Selective Service System shall be required to postpone or defer any
    person by reason of his activity in study, research, or medical,
    dental, veterinary, optometric, osteopathic, scientific,
    pharmaceutical, chiropractic, chiropodial, or other endeavors found
    to be necessary to the maintenance of the national health, safety,
    or interest solely on the basis of any test, examination, selection
    system, class standing, or any other means conducted, sponsored,
    administered, or prepared by any agency or department of the
    Federal Government, or any private institution, corporation,
    association, partnership, or individual employed by an agency or
    department of the Federal Government.
      (i)(1) Any person who is satisfactorily pursuing a full-time
    course of instruction at a high school or similar institution of
    learning and is issued an order for induction shall, upon the facts
    being presented to the local board, have his induction postponed
    (A) until the time of his graduation therefrom, or (B) until he
    attains the twentieth anniversary of his birth, or (C) until he
    ceases satisfactorily to pursue such course of instruction,
    whichever is the earliest. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
    any person who attains the twentieth anniversary of his birth after
    beginning his last academic year of high school shall have his
    induction postponed until the end of that academic year if and so
    long as he continues to pursue satisfactorily a full-time course of
    instruction.
      (2) Any person who while satisfactorily pursuing a full-time
    course of instruction at a college, university, or similar
    institution is ordered to report for induction under this title
    [sections 451 to 471a of this Appendix], shall, upon the
    appropriate facts being presented to the local board, have his
    induction postponed (A) until the end of the semester or term, or
    academic year in the case of his last academic year, or (B) until
    he ceases satisfactorily to pursue such course of instruction,
    whichever is the earlier.
      (j) Nothing contained in this title [sections 451 to 471a of this
    Appendix] shall be construed to require any person to be subject to
    combatant training and service in the armed forces of the United
    States who, by reason of religious training and belief, is
    conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form. As
    used in this subsection, the term "religious training and belief"
    does not include essentially political, sociological, or
    philosophical views, or a merely personal moral code. Any person
    claiming exemption from combatant training and service because of
    such conscientious objections whose claim is sustained by the local
    board shall, if he is inducted into the armed forces under this
    title [said sections], be assigned to noncombatant service as
    defined by the President, or shall, if he is found to be
    conscientiously opposed to participation in such noncombatant
    service, in lieu of such induction, be ordered by his local board,
    subject to such regulations as the President may prescribe, to
    perform for a period equal to the period prescribed in section 4(b)
    [section 454(b) of this Appendix] such civilian work contributing
    to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest as
    the Director may deem appropriate and any such person who knowingly
    fails or neglects to obey any such order from his local board shall
    be deemed, for the purposes of section 12 of this title [section
    462 of this Appendix], to have knowingly failed or neglected to
    perform a duty required of him under this title [said sections].
    The Director shall be responsible for finding civilian work for
    persons exempted from training and service under this subsection
    and for the placement of such persons in appropriate civilian work
    contributing to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or
    interest.
      (k) No exception from registration, or exemption or deferment
    from training and service, under this title [sections 451 to 471a
    of this Appendix], shall continue after the cause therefor ceases
    to exist.
      (l) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, no person
    between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one shall be discharged
    from service in the armed forces of the United States while this
    title [sections 451 to 471a of this Appendix] is in effect because
    such person entered such service without the consent of his parent

-STATUTE-
    (a) Establishment; construction; appointment of Director;
      termination and reestablishment of Office of Selective Service
      Records
      (1) There is established in the executive branch of the
    Government an agency to be known as the Selective Service System,
    and a Director of Selective Service who shall be the head thereof.
      (2) The Selective Service System shall include a national
    headquarters, at least one State headquarters in each State,
    Territory, and possession of the United States, and in the District

      (4) The functions of the Office of Selective Service Records
    (established by the Act of March 31, 1947 [sections 321 to 329 of
    this Appendix]) and of the Director of the Office of Selective
    Service Records are transferred to the Selective Service System and
    the Director of Selective Service, respectively. The personnel,
    property, records, and unexpended balances (available or to be made
    available) of appropriations, allocations, and other funds of the
    Office of Selective Service Records are transferred to the
    Selective Service System. The Office of Selective Service Records
    shall cease to exist upon the taking effect of the provisions of
    this title [sections 451 to 471a of this Appendix]: Provided, That,
    effective upon the termination of this title [said sections] and
    notwithstanding such termination in other respects, (A) the said
    Office of Selective Service Records is reestablished on the same
    basis and with the same functions as obtained prior to the

    reestablished Office of Selective Service Records.
    (b) Administrative provisions
      The President is authorized to undertake the following:
        (1) To prescribe the necessary rules and regulations to carry
      out the provisions of this title [sections 451 to 471a of this
      Appendix].
        (2) To appoint, upon recommendation of the respective governor
      or comparable executive official, a State director of the
      Selective Service System for each headquarters in each State,
      Territory, and possession of the United States and for the
      District of Columbia, who shall represent the governor and be in
      immediate charge of the state headquarters of the Selective
      Service System: Provided, That no State director shall serve
      concurrently in an elected or appointed position of a State or
      local government; to employ such number of civilians, and,
      subject to subsection (e), to order to active duty with their
      consent and to assign to the Selective Service System such
      officers of the selective-service section of the State
      headquarters and headquarters detachments and such other officers
      of the federally recognized National Guard of the United States
      or other armed forces personnel (including personnel of the
      reserve components thereof), as may be necessary for the
      administration of the national and of the several State
      headquarters of the Selective Service System.
        (3) To create and establish within the Selective Service System
      civilian local boards, civilian appeal boards, and such other
      civilian agencies, including agencies of appeal, as may be
      necessary to carry out its functions with respect to the
      registration, examination, classification, selection, assignment,
      delivery for induction, and maintenance of records of persons
      registered under this title [sections 451 to 471a of this
      Appendix], together with such other duties as may be assigned
      under this title [said sections]: Provided, That no person shall
      be disqualified from serving as a counselor to registrants,
      including service as Government appeal agent, because of his
      membership in a Reserve component of the Armed Forces. He shall
      create and establish one or more local boards in each county or
      political subdivision corresponding thereto of each State,
      territory, and possession of the United States, and in the
      District of Columbia. The local board and/or its staff shall
      perform their official duties only within the county or political
      subdivision corresponding thereto for which the local board is
      established, or in the case of an intercounty board, within the
      area for which such board is established, except that the staffs
      of local boards in more than one county of a State or comparable
      jurisdiction may be collocated or one staff may serve local
      boards in more than one county of a State or comparable
      jurisdiction when such action is approved by the Governor or
      comparable executive official or officials. Each local board
      shall consist of three or more members to be appointed by the
      President from recommendations made by the respective Governors
      or comparable executive officials. In making such appointments
      after the date of the enactment of the Act enacting this sentence
      [Sept. 28, 1971], the President is requested to appoint the
      membership of each local board so that to the maximum extent
      practicable it is proportionately representative of the race and
      national origin of those registrants within its jurisdiction, but
      no action by any local board shall be declared invalid on the
      ground that any board failed to conform to any particular quota
      as to race or national origin. No citizen shall be denied
      membership on any local board or appeal board on account of sex.
      After December 31, 1971, no person shall serve on any local board
      or appeal board who has served on any local board or appeal board
      for a period of more than 20 years. Notwithstanding any other
      provision of this paragraph, an intercounty local board
      consisting of at least one member from each component county or
      corresponding subdivision may, with the approval of the Governor
      or comparable executive official or officials, be established for
      an area not exceeding five counties or political subdivisions
      corresponding thereto within a State or comparable jurisdiction
      when the President determines, after considering the public
      interest involved, that the establishment of such local board
      area will result in a more efficient and economical operation.
      Any such intercounty local board shall have within its area the
      same power and jurisdiction as a local board has in its area. A
      local board may include among its members any citizen otherwise
      qualified under Presidential regulations, provided he is at least
      eighteen years of age. No member of any local board shall be a
      member of the Armed Forces of the United States, but each member
      of any local board shall be a civilian who is a citizen of the
      United States residing in the county or political subdivision
      corresponding thereto in which such local board has jurisdiction,
      and each intercounty local board shall have at least one member
      from each county or political subdivision corresponding thereto
      included within the intercounty local board area. Such local
      boards, or separate panels thereof each consisting of three or
      more members, shall, under rules and regulations prescribed by
      the President, have the power within the respective jurisdictions
      of such local boards to hear and determine, subject to the right
      of appeal to the appeal boards herein authorized, all questions
      or claims with respect to inclusion for, or exemption or
      deferment from, training and service under this title [said
      sections], of all individuals within the jurisdiction of such
      local boards. The decisions of such local board shall be final,
      except where an appeal is authorized and is taken in accordance
      with such rules and regulations as the President may prescribe.
      There shall be not less than one appeal board located within the
      area of each Federal judicial district in the United States and
      within each Territory and possession of the United States, and
      such additional separate panels thereof, as may be prescribed by
      the President. Appeal boards within the Selective Service System
      shall be composed of civilians who are citizens of the United
      States and who are not members of the armed forces. The decision
      of such appeal boards shall be final in cases before them on
      appeal unless modified or changed by the President. The
      President, upon appeal or upon his own motion, shall have power
      to determine all claims or questions with respect to inclusion
      for, or exemption or deferment from training and service under
      this title [said sections], and the determination of the
      President shall be final. No judicial review shall be made of the
      classification or processing of any registrant by local boards,
      appeal boards, or the President, except as a defense to a
      criminal prosecution instituted under section 12 of this title
      [section 462 of this Appendix], after the registrant has
      responded either affirmatively or negatively to an order to
      report for induction or for civilian work in the case of a
      registrant determined to be opposed to participation in war in
      any form: Provided, That such review shall go to the question of
      the jurisdiction herein reserved to local boards, appeal boards,
      and the President only when there is no basis in fact for the
      classification assigned to such registrant. No person who is a
      civilian officer, member, agent, or employee of the Office of
      Selective Service Records or the Selective Service System, or of
      any local board or appeal board or other agency of such Officer
      or system, shall be excepted from registration or deferred or
      exempted from training and service, as provided for in this title
      [said sections], by reason of his status as such civilian
      officer, member, agent, or employee.
        (4) To appoint, and to fix, in accordance with the provisions
      of chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5, United
      States Code, relating to classification and General Schedule pay
      rates, the basic pay of such officers, agents, and employees as
      he may deem necessary to carry out the provisions of this title

      the armed forces or any officer or employee of any department or
      agency of the United States who may be assigned or detailed to
      any office or position to carry out the provisions of this title
      [said sections] (except to offices or positions on local boards
      or appeal boards established or created pursuant to section
      10(b)(3) [subsection (b)(3) of this section]) may serve in and
      perform the functions of such office or position without loss of

      (a) Any member of the Selective Service System or any other
    person charged as herein provided with the duty of carrying out any
    of the provisions of this title [sections 451 to 471a of this
    Appendix], or the rules or regulations made or directions given
    thereunder, who shall knowingly fail or neglect to perform such
    duty, and any person charged with such duty, or having and
    exercising any authority under said title [said sections], rules,
    regulations, or directions who shall knowingly make, or be a party
    to the making, of any false, improper, or incorrect registration,
    classification, physical or mental examination, deferment,
    induction, enrollment, or muster, and any person who shall
    knowingly make, or be a party to the making, of any false statement
    or certificate regarding or bearing upon a classification or in
    support of any request for a particular classification, for service
    under the provisions of this title [said sections], or rules,
    regulations, or directions made pursuant thereto, or who otherwise
    evades or refuses registration or service in the armed forces or
    any of the requirements of this title [said sections], or who
    knowingly counsels, aids, or abets another to refuse or evade
    registration or service in the armed forces or any of the
    requirements of this title [said sections], or of said rules,
    regulations, or directions, or who in any manner shall knowingly
    fail or neglect or refuse to perform any duty required of him under
    or in the execution of this title [said sections], or rules,
    regulations, or directions made pursuant to this title [said
    sections], or any person or persons who shall knowingly hinder or
    interfere or attempt to do so in any way, by force or violence or
    otherwise, with the administration of this title [said sections] or
    the rules or regulations made pursuant thereto, or who conspires to
    commit any one or more of such offenses, shall, upon conviction in
    any district court of the United States of competent jurisdiction,
    be punished by imprisonment for not more than five years or a fine
    of not more than $10,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment, or
    if subject to military or naval law may be tried by court martial,
    and, on conviction, shall suffer such punishment as a court martial
    may direct. No person shall be tried by court martial in any case
    arising under this title [said sections] unless such person has
    been actually inducted for the training and service prescribed
    under this title [said sections] or unless he is subject to trial
    by court martial under laws in force prior to the enactment of this
    title [June 24, 1948].
      (b) Any person (1) who knowingly transfers or delivers to
    another, for the purpose of aiding or abetting the making of any
    false identification or representation, any registration
    certificate, alien's certificate of nonresidence, or any other
    certificate issued pursuant to or prescribed by the provisions of
    this title [sections 451 to 471a of this Appendix], or rules or
    regulations promulgated hereunder; or (2) who, with intent that it
    be used for any purpose of false identification or representation,
    has in his possession any such certificate not duly issued to him;
    or (3) who forges, alters, knowingly destroys, knowingly mutilates,
    or in any manner changes any such certificate or any notation duly
    and validly inscribed thereon; or (4) who, with intent that it be
    used for any purpose of false identification or representation,
    photographs, prints, or in any manner makes or executes any
    engraving, photograph, print, or impression in the likeness of any
    such certificate, or any colorable imitation thereof; or (5) who
    has in his possession any certificate purporting to be a
    certificate issued pursuant to this title [said sections], or rules
    and regulations promulgated hereunder, which he knows to be falsely
    made, reproduced, forged, counterfeited, or altered; or (6) who
    knowingly violates or evades any of the provisions of this title
    [said sections] or rules and regulations promulgated pursuant
    thereto relating to the issuance, transfer, or possession of such
    certificate, shall, upon conviction, be fined not to exceed $10,000
    or be imprisoned for not more than five years, or both. Whenever on
    trial for a violation of this subsection the defendant is shown to
    have or to have had possession of any certificate not duly issued
    to him, such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to
    establish an intent to use such certificate for purposes of false
    identification or representation, unless the defendant explains
    such possession to the satisfaction of the jury.
      (c) The Department of Justice shall proceed as expeditiously as
    possible with a prosecution under this section, or with an appeal,
    upon the request of the Director of Selective Service System or
    shall advise the House of Representatives and the Senate in writing
    the reasons for its failure to do so.
      (d) No person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for
    evading, neglecting, or refusing to perform the duty of registering
    imposed by section 3 of this title [section 453 of this Appendix]
    unless the indictment is found within five years next after the
    last day before such person attains the age of twenty-six, or
    within five years next after the last day before such person does
    perform his duty to register, whichever shall first occur.
      (e) The President may require the Secretary of Health and Human
    Services to furnish to the Director, from records available to the
    Secretary, the following information with respect to individuals
    who are members of any group of individuals required by a
    proclamation of the President under section 3 [section 453 of this
    Appendix] to present themselves for and submit to registration
    under such section: name, date of birth, social security account
    number, and address. Information furnished to the Director by the
    Secretary under this subsection shall be used only for the purpose
    of the enforcement of this Act.
      (f)(1) Except as provided in subsection (g), any person who is
    required under section 3 [section 453 of this Appendix] to present
    himself for and submit to registration under such section and fails
    to do so in accordance with any proclamation issued under such
    section, or in accordance with any rule or regulation issued under
    such section, shall be ineligible for any form of assistance or
    benefit provided under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965
    [20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.].
      (2) In order to receive any grant, loan, or work assistance under
    title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et
    seq. [and 42 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.]), a person who is required under
    section 3 [section 453 of this Appendix] to present himself for and
    submit to registration under such section shall file with the
    institution of higher education which the person intends to attend,
    or is attending, a statement of compliance with section 3 and
    regulations issued thereunder.
      (3) The Secretary of Education, in agreement with the Director,
    shall prescribe methods for verifying such statements of compliance
    filed pursuant to paragraph (2). Such methods may include requiring
    institutions of higher education to provide a list to the Secretary
    of Education or to the Director of persons who have submitted such
    statements of compliance.
      (4) The Secretary of Education, in consultation with the
    Director, shall issue regulations to implement the requirements of
    this subsection. Such regulations shall provide that any person to
    whom the Secretary of Education proposes to deny assistance or
    benefits under title IV [20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. 2751 et
    seq.] for failure to meet the registration requirements of section
    3 [section 453 of this Appendix] and regulations issued thereunder
    shall be given notice of the proposed denial and shall have a
    suitable period (of not less than thirty days) after such notice to
    provide the Secretary with information and materials establishing
    that he has complied with the registration requirement under
    section 3. Such regulations shall also provide that the Secretary
    may afford such person an opportunity for a hearing to establish
    his compliance or for any other purpose.
      (g) A person may not be denied a right, privilege, or benefit
    under Federal law by reason of failure to present himself for and
    submit to registration under section 3 [section 453 of this
    Appendix] if - 
        (1) the requirement for the person to so register has
      terminated or become inapplicable to the person; and
        (2) the person shows by a preponderance of the evidence that
      the failure of the person to register was not a knowing and
      willful failure to register.

    PROC. NO. 4313. PROGRAM FOR RETURN OF VIETNAM ERA DRAFT EVADERS AND
                            MILITARY DESERTERS
      Proc. No. 4313, Sept. 16, 1974, 39 F.R. 33293, 88 Stat. 2504, as
    amended by Proc. No. 4345, Jan. 30, 1975, 40 F.R. 4893, 89 Stat.
    1236; Proc. No. 4353, Feb. 28, 1975, 40 F.R. 8931, 10433, 89 Stat.
    1246, provided:
      The United States withdrew the last of its forces from the
    Republic of Vietnam on March 28, 1973.
      In the period of its involvement in armed hostilities in
    Southeast Asia, the United States suffered great losses. Millions
    served their country, thousands died in combat, thousands more were
    wounded, others are still listed as missing in action.
      Over a year after the last American combatant had left Vietnam,
    the status of thousands of our countrymen - convicted, charged,
    investigated or still sought for violations of the Military
    Selective Service Act [see References in Text note set out under
    section 451 of this Appendix] or of the Uniform Code of Military
    Justice [10 U.S.C. 801 et seq.] - remains unresolved.
      In furtherance of our national commitment to justice and mercy
    these young Americans should have the chance to contribute a share
    to the rebuilding of peace among ourselves and with all nations.
    They should be allowed the opportunity to earn return to their
    country, their communities, and their families, upon their
    agreement to a period of alternate service in the national
    interest, together with an acknowledgment of their allegiance to
    the country and its Constitution.
      Desertion in time of war is a major, serious offense; failure to
    respond to the country's call for duty is also a serious offense.
    Reconciliation among our people does not require that these acts be
    condoned. Yet, reconciliation calls for an act of mercy to bind the
    Nation's wounds and to heal the scars of divisiveness.
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United
    States, pursuant to my powers under Article II, Sections 1, 2 and 3
    of the Constitution, do hereby proclaim a program to commence
    immediately to afford reconciliation to Vietnam era draft evaders
    and military deserters upon the following terms and conditions:
      1. Draft Evaders - An individual who allegedly unlawfully failed
    under the Military Selective Service Act [see References in Text
    note set out under section 451 of this Appendix] or any rule or
    regulation promulgated thereunder, to register or register on time,
    to keep the local board informed of his current address, to report
    for or submit to preinduction or induction examination, to report
    for or submit to induction itself, or to report for or submit to,
    or complete service under section 6(j) of such Act [section 456(j)
    of this Appendix] during the period from August 4, 1964 to March
    28, 1973, inclusive, and who has not been adjudged guilty in a
    trial for such offense, will be relieved of prosecution and
    punishment for such offense if he:
        (i) presents himself to a United States Attorney before March
      31, 1975,
        (ii) executes an agreement acknowledging his allegiance to the
      United States and pledging to fulfill a period of alternate
      service under the auspices of the Director of Selective Service,
      and
        (iii) satisfactorily completes such service.
    The alternate service shall promote the national health, safety, or
    interest. No draft evader will be given the privilege of completing
    a period of alternate service by service in the Armed Forces.
      However, this program will not apply to an individual who is
    precluded from re-entering the United States under 8 U.S.C.
    1182(a)(22) or other law. Additionally, if individuals eligible for
    this program have other criminal charges outstanding, their
    participation in the program may be conditioned upon, or postponed
    until after, final disposition of the other charges has been
    reached in accordance with law.
      The period of service shall be twenty-four months, which may be
    reduced by the Attorney General because of mitigating
    circumstances.
      2. Military Deserters - A member of the armed forces who has been
    administratively classified as a deserter by reason of unauthorized
    absence and whose absence commenced during the period from August
    4, 1964 to March 28, 1973, inclusive, will be relieved of
    prosecution and punishment under Articles 85, 86 and 87 of the
    Uniform Code of Military Justice [10 U.S.C. 885, 886, 887] for such
    absence and for offenses directly related thereto if before March
    31, 1975 he takes an oath of allegiance to the United States and
    executes an agreement with the Secretary of the Military Department
    from which he absented himself or for members of the Coast Guard,
    with the Secretary of Transportation, pledging to fulfill a period
    of alternate service under the auspices of the Director of
    Selective Service. The alternate service shall promote the national
    health, safety, or interest.
      The period of service shall be twenty-four months, which may be
    reduced by the Secretary of the appropriate Military Department, or
    Secretary of Transportation for members of the Coast Guard, because
    of mitigating circumstances.
      However, if a member of the armed forces has additional
    outstanding charges pending against him under the Uniform Code of
    Military Justice [10 U.S.C. 801 et seq.], his eligibility to
    participate in this program may be conditioned upon, or postponed
    until after, final disposition of the additional charges has been
    reached in accordance with law.
      Each member of the armed forces who elects to seek relief through
    this program will receive an undesirable discharge. Thereafter,
    upon satisfactory completion of a period of alternate service
    prescribed by the Military Department or Department of
    Transportation, such individual will be entitled to receive, in
    lieu of his undesirable discharge, a clemency discharge in
    recognition of his fulfillment of the requirements of the program.
    Such clemency discharge shall not bestow entitlement to benefits
    administered by the Veterans Administration.
      Procedures of the Military Departments implementing this
    Proclamation will be in accordance with guidelines established by
    the Secretary of Defense, present Military Department regulations
    notwithstanding.
      3. Presidential Clemency Board - By Executive Order I have this
    date established a Presidential Clemency Board which will review
    the records of individuals within the following categories: (i)
    those who have been convicted of draft evasion offenses as
    described above, (ii) those who have received a punitive or
    undesirable discharge from service in the armed forces for having
    violated Article 85, 86, or 87 of the Uniform Code of Military
    Justice [10 U.S.C. 885, 886, 887] between August 4, 1964 and March
    28, 1973, or are serving sentences of confinement for such
    violations. Where appropriate, the Board may recommend that
    clemency be conditioned upon completion of a period of alternate
    service. However, if any clemency discharge is recommended, such
    discharge shall not bestow entitlement to benefits administered by
    the Veterans Administration.
      4. Alternate Service - In prescribing the length of alternate
    service in individual cases, the Attorney General, the Secretary of
    the appropriate Department, or the Clemency Board shall take into
    account such honorable service as an individual may have rendered
    prior to his absence, penalties already paid under law, and such
    other mitigating factors as may be appropriate to seek equity among
    those who participate in this program.
      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth
    day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-
    four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the
    one hundred and ninety-nineth.
                                                         Gerald R. Ford.

      PROC. NO. 4483. PARDON FOR VIOLATIONS OF ACT, AUGUST 4, 1964 TO
                              MARCH 28, 1973
      Proc. No. 4483, Jan. 21, 1977, 42 F.R. 4391, 91 Stat. 1719,
    provided:
      Acting pursuant to the grant of authority in Article II, Section
    2, of the Constitution of the United States, I, Jimmy Carter,
    President of the United States, do hereby grant a full, complete
    and unconditional pardon to: (1) all persons who may have committed
    any offense between August 4, 1964 and March 28, 1973 in violation
    of the Military Selective Service Act [see References in Text note
    set out under section 451 of this Appendix] or any rule or
    regulation promulgated thereunder; and (2) all persons heretofore
    convicted, irrespective of the date of conviction, of any offense
    committed between August 4, 1964 and March 28, 1973 in violation of
    the Military Selective Service Act, or any rule or regulation
    promulgated thereunder, restoring to them full political, civil and
    other rights.
      This pardon does not apply to the following who are specifically
    excluded therefrom:
        (1) All persons convicted of or who may have committed any
      offense in violation of the Military Selective Service Act, or
      any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, involving force or
      violence; and
        (2) All persons convicted of or who may have committed any
      offense in violation of the Military Selective Service Act, or
      any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, in connection with
      duties or responsibilities arising out of employment as agents,
      officers or employees of the Military Selective Service system.
      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 21st day of

    42731, provided:
      By virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the
    United States by Section 2 of Article II of the Constitution of the
    United States, and in the interest of the internal management of
    the Government, it is ordered as follows:
      Section 1. There is hereby established in the Executive Office of
    the President a board of 9 members, which shall be known as the
    Presidential Clemency Board. The members of the Board shall be
    appointed by the President, who shall also designate its Chairman.
    The President may appoint such additional members to the board as
    he shall from time to time determine to be necessary to carry out
    its functions.
      Sec. 2. The Board, under such regulations as it may prescribe,
    shall examine the cases of persons who apply for Executive clemency
    prior to March 31, 1975, and who (i) have been convicted of
    violating Section 12 or 6(j) of the Military Selective Service Act
    (50 App. U.S.C. Sec. 462) [this section and section 456(j) of this
    Appendix], or of any rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to
    that section, for acts committed between August 4, 1964 and March
    28, 1973, inclusive, or (ii) have received punitive or undesirable
    discharges as a consequence of violations of Articles 85, 86 or 87
    of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (10 U.S.C. Secs. 885, 886,
    887) that occurred between August 4, 1964 and March 28, 1973,
    inclusive, or are serving sentences of confinement for such
    violations. The Board will only consider the cases of Military
    Selective Service Act violators who were convicted of unlawfully
    failing (i) to register or register on time, (ii) to keep the local
    board informed of their current address, (iii) to report for or
    submit to preinduction or induction examination, (iv) to report for
    or submit to induction itself, or (v) to report for or submit to,
    or complete service under Section 6(j) of such Act [section 456(j)
    of this Appendix]. However, the Board will not consider the cases
    of individuals who are precluded from reentering the United States
    under [former] 8 U.S.C. 182(a)(22) or other law.
      Sec. 3. The Board shall report to the President its findings and
    recommendations as to whether Executive clemency should be granted
    or denied in any case. If clemency is recommended, the Board shall
    also recommend the form that such clemency should take, including
    clemency conditioned upon a period of alternate service in the
    national interest. In the case of an individual discharged from the
    armed forces with a punitive or undesirable discharge, the Board
    may recommend to the President that a clemency discharge be
    substituted for a punitive or undesirable discharge. Determination
    of any period of alternate service shall be in accord with the
    Proclamation [Proc. No. 4313, set out above] announcing a program
    for the return of Vietnam era draft evaders and military deserters.
      Sec. 4. The Board shall give priority consideration to those
    applicants who are presently confined and have been convicted only
    of an offense set forth in section 2 of this order, and who have no
    outstanding criminal charges.
      Sec. 5. Each member of the Board, except any member who then
    receives other compensation from the United States, may receive
    compensation for each day he or she is engaged upon the work of the
    Board at not to exceed the daily rate now or hereafter prescribed
    by law for persons and positions in GS-18, as authorized by law (5
    U.S.C. 3109), and may also receive travel expenses, including per
    diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law (5 U.S.C. 5703)
    for persons in the government service employed intermittently.
      Sec. 6. Necessary expenses of the Board may be paid from the
    Unanticipated Personnel Needs Fund of the President or from such
    other funds as may be available.
      Sec. 7. Necessary administrative services and support may be
    provided the Board by the General Services Administration on a
    reimbursable basis.
      Sec. 8. All department and agencies in the Executive branch are
    authorized and directed to cooperate with the Board in its work,
    and to furnish the Board all appropriate information and
    assistance, to the extent permitted by law.
      Sec. 9. The Board shall submit its final recommendations to the
    President not later than September 15, 1975, at which time it shall
    cease to exist.
                                                         Gerald R. Ford.

      (a) Nothing in sections 203, 205, or 207 of title 18 of the
    United States Code, or in the second sentence of subsection (a) of
    section 9 of the Act of August 2, 1939 (53 Stat. 1148), entitled
    "An Act to prevent pernicious political activities", as amended,
    shall be deemed to apply to any person because of his appointment
    under authority of this title [sections 451 to 471a of this
    Appendix] or the regulations made pursuant thereto as an
    uncompensated official of the Selective Service System, or as an
    individual to conduct hearings on appeals of persons claiming

    conscientious objections, or as a member of the National Selective

      (b) All functions performed under this title [sections 451 to
    471a of this Appendix] shall be excluded from the operation of the

    and 701 et seq.] except as to the requirements of section 3 of such
    Act [5 U.S.C. 552]. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, no
    regulation issued under this Act shall become effective until the
    expiration of thirty days following the date on which such
    regulation has been published in the Federal Register. After the
    publication of any regulation and prior to the date on which such

    but no formal hearing shall be required on any such regulation. The
    requirements of this subsection may be waived by the President in
    the case of any regulation if he (1) determines that compliance
    with such requirements would materially impair the national
    defense, and (2) gives public notice to that effect at the time
    such regulation is issued.
      (c) In computing the lump-sum payments made to Air Force reserve
    officers under the provisions of section 2 of the Act of June 16,
    1936, as amended and to reserve officers of the Navy or to their

    service performed from the effective date of this title [June 24,
    1948] to the date on which this title [sections 451 to 471a of this
    Appendix] shall cease to be effective. Each such lumpsum payment
    shall be prorated for a fractional part of a year of active service
    in the case of any reserve officer subject to the provisions of
    either such section, if such reserve officer performs continuous
    active service for one or more years (inclusive of such service
    performed during the period in which this title [said sections] is
    effective) and such active service includes a fractional part of a
    year immediately prior to the effective date of this title [June
    24, 1948], or immediately following the date on which this title
    [said sections] shall cease to be effective, or both.

    pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a), (1) to give such
    order such precedence with respect to all other orders (Government
    or private) theretofore or thereafter placed with such person as

      ordered; or
        (4) to furnish the quantity, kind, and quality of articles or
      materials ordered at such price as shall be negotiated between
      such person and the Government agency concerned; or in the event
      of failure to negotiate a price, to furnish the quantity, kind,
      and quality of articles or materials ordered at such price as he
      may subsequently be determined to be entitled to receive under
      subsection (d);

    plant, mine, or other facility of such person and to operate it,
    through any Government agency, for the production of such articles
    or materials as may be required by the Government.
    (d) Payment of compensation by United States
      Fair and just compensation shall be paid by the United States (1)
    for any articles or materials furnished pursuant to an order placed
    under subsection (a) of this section, or (2) as rental for any
    plant, mine, or other facility of which possession is taken under
    subsection (c).

    materials if it is then producing or furnishing such articles or
    materials or if the President after consultation with and receiving
    advice from the National Security Resources Board determines that
    it can be readily converted to the production or furnishing of such
    articles or materials.
    (h) Rules and regulations governing steel industry; mandatory
      The President is empowered, through the Secretary of Defense, to
    require all producers of steel in the United States to make

    for steel products or steel materials required by the armed forces,
    such percentages of the steel production of such producers, in
    equal proportion deemed necessary for the expeditious execution of
    orders for such products or materials. Compliance with such
    requirement shall be obligatory on all such producers of steel and
    such requirement shall take precedence over all orders and
    contracts theretofore placed with such producers. If any such
    producer of steel or the responsible head or heads thereof refuses
    to comply with such requirement, the President, through the
    Secretary of Defense, is authorized to take immediate possession of
    the plant or plants of such producer and, through the appropriate
    branch, bureau, or department of the armed forces, to insure
    compliance with such requirement. Any such producer of steel or the
    responsible head or heads thereof refusing to comply with such
    requirement shall be deemed guilty of a felony and upon conviction
    thereof shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than three
    years and a fine not exceeding $50,000.

    Sec. 471. Authority of President to order Reserve components to
      active service; release from active duty; retention of unit

-STATUTE-
      Until July 1, 1953, and subject to the limitations imposed by
    section 2 of the Selective Service Act of 1948, as amended [section
    452 of this Appendix], the President shall be authorized to order
    into the active military or naval service of the United States for
    a period of not to exceed twenty-four consecutive months, with or
    without their consent, any or all members and units of any or all
    Reserve components of the Armed Forces of the United States and
    retired personnel of the Regular Armed Forces. Unless he is sooner
    released under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the
    military department concerned, any member of the inactive or
    volunteer reserve who served on active duty for a period of 12
    months or more in any branch of the Armed Forces between the period
    December 7, 1941, and September 2, 1945, inclusive, who is now or
    may hereafter be ordered to active duty pursuant to this section,
    shall upon completion of 17 or more months of active duty since
    June 25, 1950, if he makes application therefor to the Secretary of
    the branch of service in which he is serving, be released from
    active duty and shall not thereafter be ordered to active duty for
    periods in excess of 30 days without his consent except in time of
    war or national emergency hereafter declared by the Congress:
    Provided, That the foregoing shall not apply to any member of the
    inactive or volunteer reserve ordered to active duty whose rating
    or specialty is found by the Secretary of the military department
    concerned to be critical and whose release to inactive duty prior
    to the period for which he was ordered to active duty would impair
    the efficiency of the military department concerned.
      The President may retain the unit organizations and the equipment
    thereof, exclusive of the individual members thereof, in the active
    Federal service for a total period of five consecutive years, and
    upon being relieved by the appropriate Secretary from active
    Federal service, National Guard, or Air National Guard units,
    shall, insofar as practicable, be returned to their National Guard
    or Air National Guard status in their respective States,
    Territories, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, with
    pertinent records, colors, histories, trophies, and other
    historical impedimenta.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 513. Protection of persons secondarily liable

-STATUTE-
    (a) Extension of protection when actions stayed, postponed, or
      suspended
      Whenever pursuant to this Act [sections 501 to 515 and 516 to
    597b of this Appendix] a court stays, postpones, or suspends (1)
    the enforcement of an obligation or liability, (2) the prosecution
    of a suit or proceeding, (3) the entry or enforcement of an order,
    writ, judgment, or decree, or (4) the performance of any other act,
    the court may likewise grant such a stay, postponement, or
    suspension to a surety, guarantor, endorser, accommodation maker,
    comaker, or other person who is or may be primarily or secondarily
    subject to the obligation or liability the performance or
    enforcement of which is stayed, postponed, or suspended.
    (b) Vacation or set-aside of judgments
      When a judgment or decree is vacated or set aside, in whole or in
    part, pursuant to this Act [sections 501 to 515 and 516 to 597b of
    this Appendix], the court may also set aside or vacate, as the case
    may be, the judgment or decree as to a surety, guarantor, endorser,
    accommodation maker, comaker, or other person who is or may be
    primarily or secondarily liable on the contract or liability for
    the enforcement of the judgment or decree.
    (c) Bail bond not to be enforced during period of military service
      A court may not enforce a bail bond during the period of military
    service of the principal on the bond when military service prevents
    the surety from obtaining the attendance of the principal. The
    court may discharge the surety and exonerate the bail, in
    accordance with principles of equity and justice, during or after
    the period of military service of the principal.
    (d) Waiver of rights
      (1) Waivers not precluded
        This Act [sections 501 to 515 and 516 to 597b of this Appendix]
      does not prevent a waiver in writing by a surety, guarantor,
      endorser, accommodation maker, comaker, or other person (whether
      primarily or secondarily liable on an obligation or liability) of
      the protections provided under subsections (a) and (b). Any such
      waiver is effective only if it is executed as an instrument
      separate from the obligation or liability with respect to which
      it applies.
      (2) Waiver invalidated upon entrance to military service
        If a waiver under paragraph (1) is executed by an individual
      who after the execution of the waiver enters military service, or
      by a dependent of an individual who after the execution of the
      waiver enters military service, the waiver is not valid after the
      beginning of the period of such military service unless the
      waiver was executed by such individual or dependent during the
      period specified in section 106 [section 516 of this Appendix].

    TITLE II - GENERAL RELIEF

-HEAD-
    Sec. 521. Protection of servicemembers against default judgments

-STATUTE-
    (a) Applicability of section
      This section applies to any civil action or proceeding, including
    any child custody proceeding, in which the defendant does not make
    an appearance.
    (b) Affidavit requirement
      (1) Plaintiff to file affidavit
        In any action or proceeding covered by this section, the court,
      before entering judgment for the plaintiff, shall require the
      plaintiff to file with the court an affidavit - 
          (A) stating whether or not the defendant is in military
        service and showing necessary facts to support the affidavit;
        or
          (B) if the plaintiff is unable to determine whether or not
        the defendant is in military service, stating that the
        plaintiff is unable to determine whether or not the defendant
        is in military service.
      (2) Appointment of attorney to represent defendant in military
        service
        If in an action covered by this section it appears that the
      defendant is in military service, the court may not enter a
      judgment until after the court appoints an attorney to represent
      the defendant. If an attorney appointed under this section to
      represent a servicemember cannot locate the servicemember,
      actions by the attorney in the case shall not waive any defense
      of the servicemember or otherwise bind the servicemember.
      (3) Defendant's military status not ascertained by affidavit
        If based upon the affidavits filed in such an action, the court
      is unable to determine whether the defendant is in military
      service, the court, before entering judgment, may require the
      plaintiff to file a bond in an amount approved by the court. If
      the defendant is later found to be in military service, the bond
      shall be available to indemnify the defendant against any loss or
      damage the defendant may suffer by reason of any judgment for the
      plaintiff against the defendant, should the judgment be set aside
      in whole or in part. The bond shall remain in effect until
      expiration of the time for appeal and setting aside of a judgment
      under applicable Federal or State law or regulation or under any
      applicable ordinance of a political subdivision of a State. The
      court may issue such orders or enter such judgments as the court
      determines necessary to protect the rights of the defendant under
      this Act [sections 501 to 515 and 516 to 597b of this Appendix].
      (4) Satisfaction of requirement for affidavit
        The requirement for an affidavit under paragraph (1) may be
      satisfied by a statement, declaration, verification, or
      certificate, in writing, subscribed and certified or declared to
      be true under penalty of perjury.
    (c) Penalty for making or using false affidavit
      A person who makes or uses an affidavit permitted under
    subsection (b) (or a statement, declaration, verification, or
    certificate as authorized under subsection (b)(4)) knowing it to be
    false, shall be fined as provided in title 18, United States Code,
    or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.
    (d) Stay of proceedings
      In an action covered by this section in which the defendant is in
    military service, the court shall grant a stay of proceedings for a
    minimum period of 90 days under this subsection upon application of
    counsel, or on the court's own motion, if the court determines that
    - 
        (1) there may be a defense to the action and a defense cannot
      be presented without the presence of the defendant; or
        (2) after due diligence, counsel has been unable to contact the
      defendant or otherwise determine if a meritorious defense exists.
    (e) Inapplicability of section 202 procedures
      A stay of proceedings under subsection (d) shall not be
    controlled by procedures or requirements under section 202 [section
    522 of this Appendix].
    (f) Section 202 protection
      If a servicemember who is a defendant in an action covered by
    this section receives actual notice of the action, the
    servicemember may request a stay of proceeding under section 202
    [section 522 of this Appendix].
    (g) Vacation or setting aside of default judgments
      (1) Authority for court to vacate or set aside judgment
        If a default judgment is entered in an action covered by this
      section against a servicemember during the servicemember's period
      of military service (or within 60 days after termination of or
      release from such military service), the court entering the
      judgment shall, upon application by or on behalf of the
      servicemember, reopen the judgment for the purpose of allowing
      the servicemember to defend the action if it appears that - 
          (A) the servicemember was materially affected by reason of
        that military service in making a defense to the action; and
          (B) the servicemember has a meritorious or legal defense to
        the action or some part of it.
      (2) Time for filing application
        An application under this subsection must be filed not later
      than 90 days after the date of the termination of or release from
      military service.
    (h) Protection of bona fide purchaser
      If a court vacates, sets aside, or reverses a default judgment
    against a servicemember and the vacating, setting aside, or
    reversing is because of a provision of this Act [sections 501 to
    515 and 516 to 597b of this Appendix], that action shall not impair
    a right or title acquired by a bona fide purchaser for value under
    the default judgment.

    Sec. 522. Stay of proceedings when servicemember has notice

-STATUTE-
    (a) Applicability of section
      This section applies to any civil action or proceeding, including
    any child custody proceeding, in which the plaintiff or defendant
    at the time of filing an application under this section - 
        (1) is in military service or is within 90 days after
      termination of or release from military service; and
        (2) has received notice of the action or proceeding.
    (b) Stay of proceedings
      (1) Authority for stay
        At any stage before final judgment in a civil action or
      proceeding in which a servicemember described in subsection (a)
      is a party, the court may on its own motion and shall, upon
      application by the servicemember, stay the action for a period of
      not less than 90 days, if the conditions in paragraph (2) are
      met.
      (2) Conditions for stay
        An application for a stay under paragraph (1) shall include the
      following:
          (A) A letter or other communication setting forth facts
        stating the manner in which current military duty requirements
        materially affect the servicemember's ability to appear and
        stating a date when the servicemember will be available to
        appear.
          (B) A letter or other communication from the servicemember's
        commanding officer stating that the servicemember's current
        military duty prevents appearance and that military leave is
        not authorized for the servicemember at the time of the letter.
    (c) Application not a waiver of defenses
      An application for a stay under this section does not constitute
    an appearance for jurisdictional purposes and does not constitute a
    waiver of any substantive or procedural defense (including a
    defense relating to lack of personal jurisdiction).
    (d) Additional stay
      (1) Application
        A servicemember who is granted a stay of a civil action or
      proceeding under subsection (b) may apply for an additional stay
      based on continuing material affect of military duty on the
      servicemember's ability to appear. Such an application may be
      made by the servicemember at the time of the initial application
      under subsection (b) or when it appears that the servicemember is
      unavailable to prosecute or defend the action. The same
      information required under subsection (b)(2) shall be included in
      an application under this subsection.
      (2) Appointment of counsel when additional stay refused
        If the court refuses to grant an additional stay of proceedings
      under paragraph (1), the court shall appoint counsel to represent
      the servicemember in the action or proceeding.
    (e) Coordination with section 201
      A servicemember who applies for a stay under this section and is
    unsuccessful may not seek the protections afforded by section 201
    [section 521 of this Appendix].
    (f) Inapplicability to section 301
      The protections of this section do not apply to section 301
    [section 531 of this Appendix].

      on which the servicemember is called to military service.
    (c) Creditor protection

    Sec. 535a. Termination of telephone service contracts

-STATUTE-
    (a) Termination by servicemember
      (1) Termination
        A servicemember may terminate a contract described in
      subsection (b) at any time after the date the servicemember
      receives military orders to relocate for a period of not less
      than 90 days to a location that does not support the contract.
      (2) Notice
        In the case that a servicemember terminates a contract as
      described in paragraph (1), the service provider under the
      contract shall provide such servicemember with written or
      electronic notice of the servicemember's rights under such
      paragraph.
      (3) Manner of termination
        Termination of a contract under paragraph (1) shall be made by
      delivery of a written or electronic notice of such termination
      and a copy of the servicemember's military orders to the service
      provider, delivered in accordance with industry standards for
      notification of terminations, together with the date on which the
      service is to be terminated.
    (b) Covered contracts
      A contract described in this subsection is a contract for
    cellular telephone service or telephone exchange service entered
    into by the servicemember before receiving the military orders
    referred to in subsection (a)(1).
    (c) Retention of telephone number
      In the case of a contract terminated under subsection (a) by a
    servicemember whose period of relocation is for a period of three
    years or less, the service provider under the contract shall,
    notwithstanding any other provision of law, allow the servicemember
    to keep the telephone number the servicemember has under the
    contract if the servicemember re-subscribes to the service during
    the 90-day period beginning on the last day of such period of
    relocation.
    (d) Family plans
      In the case of a contract for cellular telephone service entered
    into by any individual in which a servicemember is a designated
    beneficiary of the contract, the individual who entered into the
    contract may terminate the contract - 
        (1) with respect to the servicemember if the servicemember is
      eligible to terminate contracts pursuant to subsection (a); and
        (2) with respect to all of the designated beneficiaries of such
      contract if all such beneficiaries accompany the servicemember
      during the servicemember's period of relocation.
    (e) Other obligations and liabilities
      For any contract terminated under this section, the service
    provider under the contract may not impose an early termination
    charge, but any tax or any other obligation or liability of the
    servicemember that, in accordance with the terms of the contract,
    is due and unpaid or unperformed at the time of termination of the
    contract shall be paid or performed by the servicemember. If the
    servicemember re-subscribes to the service provided under a covered
    contract during the 90-day period beginning on the last day of the
    servicemember's period of relocation, the service provider may not
    impose a charge for reinstating service, other than the usual and
    customary charges for the installation or acquisition of customer
    equipment imposed on any other subscriber.
    (f) Return of advance payments
      Not later than 60 days after the effective date of the
    termination of a contract under this section, the service provider

        Such amount may be collected by the United States, either as an
      offset from any amount due the insured by the United States or as
      otherwise authorized by law.

        Such debt payable to the United States is not dischargeable in
      bankruptcy proceedings.

    Sec. 561. Taxes respecting personal property, money, credits, and
      real property

-STATUTE-
    (a) Application
      This section applies in any case in which a tax or assessment,
    whether general or special (other than a tax on personal income),
    falls due and remains unpaid before or during a period of military
    service with respect to a servicemember's - 
        (1) personal property (including motor vehicles); or
        (2) real property occupied for dwelling, professional,
      business, or agricultural purposes by a servicemember or the
      servicemember's dependents or employees - 
          (A) before the servicemember's entry into military service;
        and
          (B) during the time the tax or assessment remains unpaid.
    (b) Sale of property
      (1) Limitation on sale of property to enforce tax assessment
        Property described in subsection (a) may not be sold to enforce
      the collection of such tax or assessment except by court order
      and upon the determination by the court that military service
      does not materially affect the servicemember's ability to pay the
      unpaid tax or assessment.
      (2) Stay of court proceedings
        A court may stay a proceeding to enforce the collection of such
      tax or assessment, or sale of such property, during a period of
      military service of the servicemember and for a period not more
      than 180 days after the termination of, or release of the
      servicemember from, military service.
    (c) Redemption
      When property described in subsection (a) is sold or forfeited to
    enforce the collection of a tax or assessment, a servicemember
    shall have the right to redeem or commence an action to redeem the
    servicemember's property during the period of military service or
    within 180 days after termination of or release from military
    service. This subsection may not be construed to shorten any period
    provided by the law of a State (including any political subdivision
    of a State) for redemption.
    (d) Interest on tax or assessment
      Whenever a servicemember does not pay a tax or assessment on
    property described in subsection (a) when due, the amount of the
    tax or assessment due and unpaid shall bear interest until paid at
    the rate of 6 percent per year. An additional penalty or interest
    shall not be incurred by reason of nonpayment. A lien for such
    unpaid tax or assessment may include interest under this
    subsection.
    (e) Joint ownership application
      This section applies to all forms of property described in
    subsection (a) owned individually by a servicemember or jointly by
    a servicemember and a dependent or dependents.

    Sec. 571. Residence for tax purposes

-STATUTE-
    (a) Residence or domicile
      (1) In general
        A servicemember shall neither lose nor acquire a residence or
      domicile for purposes of taxation with respect to the person,
      personal property, or income of the servicemember by reason of
      being absent or present in any tax jurisdiction of the United
      States solely in compliance with military orders.
      (2) Spouses
        A spouse of a servicemember shall neither lose nor acquire a
      residence or domicile for purposes of taxation with respect to
      the person, personal property, or income of the spouse by reason
      of being absent or present in any tax jurisdiction of the United
      States solely to be with the servicemember in compliance with the
      servicemember's military orders if the residence or domicile, as
      the case may be, is the same for the servicemember and the
      spouse.
    (b) Military service compensation
      Compensation of a servicemember for military service shall not be
    deemed to be income for services performed or from sources within a
    tax jurisdiction of the United States if the servicemember is not a
    resident or domiciliary of the jurisdiction in which the
    servicemember is serving in compliance with military orders.
    (c) Income of a military spouse
      Income for services performed by the spouse of a servicemember
    shall not be deemed to be income for services performed or from
    sources within a tax jurisdiction of the United States if the
    spouse is not a resident or domiciliary of the jurisdiction in
    which the income is earned because the spouse is in the
    jurisdiction solely to be with the servicemember serving in
    compliance with military orders.
    (d) Personal property
      (1) Relief from personal property taxes
        The personal property of a servicemember or the spouse of a
      servicemember shall not be deemed to be located or present in, or
      to have a situs for taxation in, the tax jurisdiction in which
      the servicemember is serving in compliance with military orders.
      (2) Exception for property within member's domicile or residence
        This subsection applies to personal property or its use within
      any tax jurisdiction other than the servicemember's or the
      spouse's domicile or residence.
      (3) Exception for property used in trade or business
        This section does not prevent taxation by a tax jurisdiction
      with respect to personal property used in or arising from a trade
      or business, if it has jurisdiction.
      (4) Relationship to law of State of domicile
        Eligibility for relief from personal property taxes under this
      subsection is not contingent on whether or not such taxes are
      paid to the State of domicile.
    (e) Increase of tax liability
      A tax jurisdiction may not use the military compensation of a
    nonresident servicemember to increase the tax liability imposed on
    other income earned by the nonresident servicemember or spouse
    subject to tax by the jurisdiction.
    (f) Federal Indian reservations
      An Indian servicemember whose legal residence or domicile is a
    Federal Indian reservation shall be taxed by the laws applicable to
    Federal Indian reservations and not the State where the reservation
    is located.
    (g) Definitions
      For purposes of this section:
      (1) Personal property
        The term "personal property" means intangible and tangible
      property (including motor vehicles).
      (2) Taxation

      fee, or excise is paid by the servicemember in the
      servicemember's State of domicile or residence.
      (3) Tax jurisdiction

    (a) Prima facie evidence
      In any proceeding under this Act [sections 501 to 515 and 516 to
    597b of this Appendix], a certificate signed by the Secretary
    concerned is prima facie evidence as to any of the following facts
    stated in the certificate:
        (1) That a person named is, is not, has been, or has not been
      in military service.
        (2) The time and the place the person entered military service.
        (3) The person's residence at the time the person entered
      military service.
        (4) The rank, branch, and unit of military service of the
      person upon entry.
        (5) The inclusive dates of the person's military service.
        (6) The monthly pay received by the person at the date of the
      certificate's issuance.
        (7) The time and place of the person's termination of or
      release from military service, or the person's death during
      military service.
    (b) Certificates
      The Secretary concerned shall furnish a certificate under
    subsection (a) upon receipt of an application for such a
    certificate. A certificate appearing to be signed by the Secretary
    concerned is prima facie evidence of its contents and of the
    signer's authority to issue it.
    (c) Treatment of servicemembers in missing status
      A servicemember who has been reported missing is presumed to
    continue in service until accounted for. A requirement under this
    Act [sections 501 to 515 and 516 to 597b of this Appendix] that
    begins or ends with the death of a servicemember does not begin or
    end until the servicemember's death is reported to, or determined

      servicemember's military service.
    (b) Tax liability or assessment
      In a case covered by subsection (a), the court may, if the

        accumulated interest due and unpaid at the date of termination
        or release from the applicant's military service or from the

        period at the rate of interest on the unpaid balance prescribed
        in the contract or other instrument evidencing the obligation,
        and subject to other terms as may be equitable.
      (2) Stay of enforcement of other contracts
        (A) In the case of any other obligation, liability, tax, or

        servicemember's military service or any part of such period;
        and
          (ii) subject to payment of the balance of principal and
        accumulated interest due and unpaid at the date of termination
        or release from military service, or the date of application,
        in equal periodic installments during this extended period at
        the rate of interest as may be prescribed for this obligation,
        liability, tax, or assessment, if paid when due, and subject to
        other terms as may be equitable.
    (c) Affect (!1) of stay on fine or penalty

      When a court grants a stay under this section, a fine or penalty
    shall not accrue on the obligation, liability, tax, or assessment
    for the period of compliance with the terms and conditions of the
    stay.

      with respect to any claim that is based on professional conduct
      (including any failure to take any action in a professional
      capacity) of a servicemember that occurs during a period of
      suspension of that servicemember's professional liability
      insurance under this subsection.
      (4) Certain claims considered to arise before suspension
        For the purposes of paragraph (3), a claim based upon the
      failure of a professional to make adequate provision for a
      patient, client, or other person to receive professional services
      or other assistance during the period of the professional's
      active duty service shall be considered to be based on an action
      or failure to take action before the beginning of the period of
      the suspension of professional liability insurance under this
      subsection, except in a case in which professional services were
      provided after the date of the beginning of such period.
    (c) Reinstatement of coverage
      (1) Reinstatement required
        Professional liability insurance coverage suspended in the case
      of any servicemember pursuant to subsection (b) shall be
      reinstated by the insurance carrier on the date on which that
      servicemember transmits to the insurance carrier a written
      request for reinstatement.
      (2) Time and premium for reinstatement
        The request of a servicemember for reinstatement shall be
      effective only if the servicemember transmits the request to the
      insurance carrier within 30 days after the date on which the
      servicemember is released from active duty. The insurance carrier
      shall notify the servicemember of the due date for payment of the
      premium of such insurance. Such premium shall be paid by the
      servicemember within 30 days after receipt of that notice.
      (3) Period of reinstated coverage
        The period for which professional liability insurance coverage
      shall be reinstated for a servicemember under this subsection may
      not be less than the balance of the period for which coverage
      would have continued under the insurance policy if the coverage
      had not been suspended.
    (d) Increase in premium
      (1) Limitation on premium increases
        An insurance carrier may not increase the amount of the premium
      charged for professional liability insurance coverage of any
      servicemember for the minimum period of the reinstatement of such
      coverage required under subsection (c)(3) to an amount greater
      than the amount chargeable for such coverage for such period
      before the suspension.
      (2) Exception
        Paragraph (1) does not prevent an increase in premium to the
      extent of any general increase in the premiums charged by that
      carrier for the same professional liability coverage for persons
      similarly covered by such insurance during the period of the
      suspension.
    (e) Continuation of coverage of unaffected persons
      This section does not - 
        (1) require a suspension of professional liability insurance
      protection for any person who is not a person referred to in
      subsection (a) and who is covered by the same professional
      liability insurance as a person referred to in such subsection;
      or
        (2) relieve any person of the obligation to pay premiums for
      the coverage not required to be suspended.
    (f) Stay of civil or administrative actions
      (1) Stay of actions
        A civil or administrative action for damages on the basis of
      the alleged professional negligence or other professional
      liability of a servicemember whose professional liability
      insurance coverage has been suspended under subsection (b) shall
      be stayed until the end of the period of the suspension if - 
          (A) the action was commenced during the period of the
        suspension;
          (B) the action is based on an act or omission that occurred
        before the date on which the suspension became effective; and
          (C) the suspended professional liability insurance would,
        except for the suspension, on its face cover the alleged
        professional negligence or other professional liability
        negligence or other professional liability of the
        servicemember.
      (2) Date of commencement of action
        Whenever a civil or administrative action for damages is stayed
      under paragraph (1) in the case of any servicemember, the action
      shall have been deemed to have been filed on the date on which
      the professional liability insurance coverage of the
      servicemember is reinstated under subsection (c).
    (g) Effect of suspension upon limitations period
      In the case of a civil or administrative action for which a stay
    could have been granted under subsection (f) by reason of the
    suspension of professional liability insurance coverage of the
    defendant under this section, the period of the suspension of the
    coverage shall be excluded from the computation of any statutory
    period of limitation on the commencement of such action.
    (h) Death during period of suspension
      If a servicemember whose professional liability insurance
    coverage is suspended under subsection (b) dies during the period
    of the suspension - 
        (1) the requirement for the grant or continuance of a stay in
      any civil or administrative action against such servicemember
      under subsection (f)(1) shall terminate on the date of the death
      of such servicemember; and
        (2) the carrier of the professional liability insurance so
      suspended shall be liable for any claim for damages for
      professional negligence or other professional liability of the
      deceased servicemember in the same manner and to the same extent
      as such carrier would be liable if the servicemember had died
      while covered by such insurance but before the claim was filed.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Reinstatement of health insurance
      A servicemember who, by reason of military service as defined in
    section 703(a)(1) [section 593(a)(1) of this Appendix], is entitled
    to the rights and protections of this Act [sections 501 to 515 and
    516 to 597b of this Appendix] shall also be entitled upon
    termination or release from such service to reinstatement of any
    health insurance that - 
        (1) was in effect on the day before such service commenced; and
        (2) was terminated effective on a date during the period of
      such service.
    (b) No exclusion or waiting period
      The reinstatement of health care insurance coverage for the
    health or physical condition of a servicemember described in
    subsection (a), or any other person who is covered by the insurance
    by reason of the coverage of the servicemember, shall not be
    subject to an exclusion or a waiting period, if - 
        (1) the condition arose before or during the period of such
      service;
        (2) an exclusion or a waiting period would not have been
      imposed for the condition during the period of coverage; and
        (3) in a case in which the condition relates to the
      servicemember, the condition has not been determined by the
      Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be a disability incurred or
      aggravated in the line of duty (within the meaning of section 105
      of title 38, United States Code).
    (c) Exceptions
      Subsection (a) does not apply to a servicemember entitled to

        The amount of the premium for health insurance coverage that
      was terminated by a servicemember and required to be reinstated
      under subsection (a) may not be increased, for the balance of the
      period for which coverage would have been continued had the
      coverage not been terminated, to an amount greater than the
      amount chargeable for such coverage before the termination.
      (2) Increases of general applicability not precluded
        Paragraph (1) does not prevent an increase in premium to the
      extent of any general increase in the premiums charged by the
      carrier of the health care insurance for the same health
      insurance coverage for persons similarly covered by such
      insurance during the period between the termination and the
      reinstatement.

      Sections 806 to 810 were omitted as terminated pursuant to
    section 814 of this Appendix.
      Section 806, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, Sec. 1, 56 Stat. 463,
    suspended the provisions of existing law relating to periodic
    computations for the purpose of determining the authorized number
    of commissioned officers in the various grades of the line of the
    Regular Navy and of the Marine Corps, the permanent promotion or
    advancement of all officers of the Navy and Marine Corps, and the
    involuntary retirement or honorable discharge of such officers by
    reason of failure of selection or upon completion of designated
    periods of service. Under section 813 of this Appendix, this
    section also applied to officer personnel of the Coast Guard. This
    section was repealed insofar as it related to the Navy and Marine
    Corps by act Aug. 7, 1947, ch. 512, title IV, Sec. 426(a), 61 Stat.
    880. It was superseded with respect to the Coast Guard by section
    42 of Title 14, Coast Guard.
      Section 807, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, Sec. 2, 56 Stat. 464,
    related to the number of rear admirals entitled to pay and
    allowances of rear admirals of the upper half. It was repealed
    insofar as it related to the Navy and Marine Corps by act Aug. 7,
    1947, ch. 512, title IV, Sec. 426(a), 61 Stat. 880, and superseded
    with respect to the Coast Guard by section 462 of former Title 14,
    Coast Guard, which is covered by section 202 of Title 37, Pay and
    Allowances of the Uniformed Services.
      Section 808, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, Sec. 3, 56 Stat. 464,
    provided for modification of age limits for original appointments
    to commissioned rank in staff corps.
      Section 809, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, Sec. 4, 56 Stat. 464,
    which was an amendment of provisions concerning appointment of
    certain reserve officers to regular Navy or Marine Corps, was a
    permanent provision under section 814 of this Appendix, and was set
    out as sections 737a and 853c-2a of former Title 34, Navy, which
    were repealed by act Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, Sec. 53, 70A Stat.
    641. See sections 2104, 2106, and 6914 of Title 10, Armed Forces.
      Section 810, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, Sec. 5, 56 Stat. 465,
    related to temporarily promoted officers, pay and allowances, and
    date of acceptance of appointment. It was repealed insofar as it
    related to the Navy and Marine Corps by act Aug. 7, 1947, ch. 512,
    title IV, Sec. 426(a), 61 Stat. 880, and reenacted as section 350k
    of former Title 34, Navy, by act May 22, 1950, ch. 193, Sec. 3, 64
    Stat. 187. Although section 810 applied to the Coast Guard under
    section 813 of this Appendix, it was superseded in this respect by
    section 350k of Title 34, which applied to the Coast Guard under
    section 350j of former Title 34. Sections 350j and 350k of former
    Title 34 were repealed by act Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, Sec. 53, 70A
    Stat. 641, and replaced by sections 5597 and 5787 of Title 10,

    section 814 of this Appendix.
      Section 812, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, Sec. 7, 56 Stat. 465,
    amended sections 350 and 350i of former Title 34, Navy. It was
    repealed insofar as it related to the Navy and Marine Corps by act
    Aug. 7, 1947, ch. 512, title IV, Sec. 426(a), 61 Stat. 880. It was
    superseded with respect to the Coast Guard by act June 3, 1948, ch.
    395, 62 Stat. 302.
      Section 813, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, Sec. 8, 56 Stat. 465,
    provided: "The provisions of this Act [sections 806 to 814 of this
    Appendix] except as may be necessary to adapt the said provisions
    to the Coast Guard, shall apply to officer personnel of the Coast
    Guard in like manner and to the same extent and with the same
    relative conditions in all respects as are provided for the officer
    personnel of the Navy and Marine Corps." It appears that section
    808 of this Appendix does not apply to the Coast Guard since it has
    no staff officers and that section 809 does not apply because it
    amends provisions relating only to the Navy and Marine Corps. As
    pointed out in notes under sections 806, 807, 810, and 812, they
    have been superseded with respect to the Coast Guard.
      Section 814, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, Sec. 9, 56 Stat. 465,
    prohibited any reduction of pay by virtue of sections 806 to 814 of
    this Appendix, and provided for termination of sections 806 to 814
    of this Appendix on June 30 of fiscal year following that in which
    World War II ended. See Termination of State of War notes preceding
    section 1, of this Appendix. See note for former section 809 of
    this Appendix for its disposition, such section having been
    excepted from the termination provisions.

    was denied on Mar. 19, 1962, 82 S. Ct. 830.
      The order of Chief Judge Albert B. Maris, set forth in 299 F.2d
    20, provided:
      "The business of this Court having been completed, it is ordered
    that at the expiration of 30 days from this date, if a petition for
    certiorari has not been filed in the Supreme Court in Case No. 676
    [Rosenzweig v. General Services Administration], just decided, the
    acting clerk shall deliver the records and papers of the Court in
    his office to the General Services Administration for permanent
    custody as records of the Government, and shall thereupon inform
    the Chief Justice of the United States that the work of the Court
    has been completed and that the designations of the judges of the
    Court may therefore appropriately be terminated.
      "If a petition for certiorari is filed in Case No. 676 this order
    shall take effect and be carried out at the expiration of 30 days
    after the final disposition of Case No. 676."
      In accordance with the terms of this order, the petition for
    certiorari having been filed, and denied Mar. 19, 1962, the Court
    terminated on Apr. 18, 1962.

    benefits, exemptions, privileges, and liabilities, under law
    applicable to citizens of the United States employed as seamen on
    privately owned and operated American vessels. Such seamen, because
    of the temporary wartime character of their employment by the War
    Shipping Administration, shall not be considered as officers or
    employees of the United States for the purposes of the United
    States Employees Compensation Act, as amended [5 U.S.C. 8101 et
    seq.]; the Civil Service Retirement Act, as amended [5 U.S.C. 8331

    Seventy-seventh Congress) or the Act entitled "An Act to provide
    benefits for the injury, disability, death, or detention of
    employees of contractors with the United States and certain other

    the same manner as such claims would be enforced if the seaman were
    employed on a privately owned and operated American vessel. Any
    claim referred to in clause (2) or (3) hereof shall, if
    administratively disallowed in whole or in part, be enforced
    pursuant to the provisions of the Suits in Admiralty Act [46 U.S.C.
    30901 et seq.], notwithstanding the vessel on which the seaman is
    employed is not a merchant vessel within the meaning of such Act
    [said sections]. Any claim, right, or cause of action of or in
    respect of any such seaman accruing on or after October 1, 1941,
    and prior to the date of enactment of this section [Mar. 24, 1943]
    may be enforced, and upon the election of the seaman or his
    surviving dependent or beneficiary, or his legal representative to
    do so shall be governed, as if this section had been in effect when
    such claim, right, or cause of action accrued, such election to be
    made in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the
    Administrator, War Shipping Administration. Rights of any seaman
    under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], as amended
    by subsection (b)(2) and (3), and claims therefor shall be governed
    solely by the provisions of such Act, so amended. When used in this
    subsection the term "administratively disallowed" means a denial of
    a written claim in accordance with rules or regulations prescribed
    by the Administrator, War Shipping Administration. When used in
    this subsection the terms "War Shipping Administration" and
    "Administrator, War Shipping Administration" shall be deemed to
    include the United States Maritime Commission with respect to the
    period beginning October 1, 1941, and ending February 11, 1942, and
    the term "seaman" shall be deemed to include any seaman employed as
    an employee of the United States through the War Shipping
    Administration on vessels made available to or subchartered to
    other agencies or departments of the United States.

      (b)(1) Omitted [Amendment of section 1426 of the Internal Revenue

    administration, with the approval of the Administrator, make

    Administrator may declare that such death, injury, detention, or

      (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 11 and 14 of this
    Act, as amended [sections 1744 and 1735 note of this Appendix], war-
    built dry-cargo vessels owned by the United States on or after
    June 30, 1950, may be chartered pursuant to this Act [sections 1735
    to 1746 of this Appendix] for bareboat use in any service which, in
    the opinion of the Maritime Administration, is required in the
    public interest and is not adequately served, and for which
    privately owned American flag vessels are not available for charter
    by private operators on reasonable conditions and at reasonable
    rates for use in such service. No charters shall be made by the
    Secretary of Transportation under authority of this subsection
    until the Maritime Administration shall have given due notice to
    all interested parties and shall have afforded such parties an
    opportunity for a public hearing on such charters and shall have
    certified its findings to the Secretary of Transportation. The
    Secretary of Transportation is authorized to include in such
    charters such restrictions and conditions as the Maritime
    Administration determines to be necessary or appropriate to protect
    the public interest in respect of such charters and to protect
    privately owned vessels against competition from vessels chartered
    under this section: Provided, however, That all such charters shall
    contain a provision that they will be reviewed annually by the
    Maritime Administration, with recommendations to the Secretary of
    Transportation, for the purpose of determining whether conditions
    exist justifying continuance of the charters under the provisions
    of this subsection.
      (2) A charter existing on June 30, 1950, with respect to a war-
    built dry-cargo vessel may be extended to October 31, 1950, if
    application is made within ten days after the enactment hereof
    [June 30, 1950] for the charter of such vessel under this
    subsection and if the Secretary of Transportation deems such
    extension is justified in accordance with the provisions of
    subdivision (1) of this subsection: Provided, however, That a new
    voyage under such extended charter shall not be begun after October
    31, 1950, unless it has been determined prior to such date, in
    accordance with the procedure set forth in this subsection, that
    the continued use of the vessel in the service is required. The
    Maritime Administration shall conduct all hearings on applications
    made under this paragraph immediately upon receipt thereof and
    shall promptly certify its findings to the Secretary of
    Transportation, provided that all such certifications shall be made
    not later than October 31, 1950.
    (f) Charter of passenger vessels
      (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 11 and 14 of this
    Act, as amended [sections 1744 and 1735 note of this Appendix], the
    Secretary of Transportation may charter any passenger vessel,
    whether or not war-built, owned by the United States on or after
    June 30, 1950, pursuant to chapter 575 of title 46, and may charter

    determines such use is in the best interest of the Government after
    considering the following factors:
      (1) Availability
        The availability of NDRF or Ready Reserve Force (RRF) resources
      and the impact of such use on NDRF and RRF mission support to the
      defense and homeland security requirements of the Government.
      (2) Interference
        Whether the such (!1) use of vessels will support the mission
      of the Maritime Administration and not significantly interfere
      with NDRF vessel maintenance, repair, safety, readiness, and
      resource availability.

      (3) Safety
        Whether safety precautions will be taken, including
      indemnification of liability when applicable.
      (4) Cost
        Whether any costs incurred by such use will be funded as a
      reimbursable transaction between Federal agencies, as applicable.
      (5) Other matters
        Any other matters the Maritime Administrator considers
      appropriate.

    final action with respect to applications filed under this Act not
    later than one year after the last date on which applications may
    be filed.
      "Sec. 3. [Publicity to payments provisions; notice to claimants].
    The Commission shall give maximum publicity in the Republic of the
    Philippines to the provisions of this Act, and through utilization
    of the records of the former Philippine War Damage Commission shall
    attempt to notify individual claimants of their right to file
    applications for payment under this Act, by mailing notice thereof
    to the last known address of such claimants as shown by such
    records.
      "Sec. 4. [Notice of approval or denial of applications; hearings;
    finality of determinations]. The Commission shall notify all
    applicants of the approval or denial of their applications and, if
    approved, shall notify such applicants of the amount for which such
    applications are approved. Any applicant whose application is
    denied, or is approved for less than the amount of such
    application, shall be entitled, under such regulations as the
    Commission may prescribe, to a hearing before the Commission or its
    representative with respect to such application. Upon such hearing,
    the Commission may affirm, modify, or reverse its former action
    with respect to such application, including a denial or reduction
    in the amount of award theretofore approved. All findings of the
    Commission concerning the persons to whom compensation pursuant to
    this Act is payable, and the amounts thereof, shall be conclusive
    and not be reviewable by any court.
      "Sec. 5. [Payments; exchange rate; medium; extraterritorial
    claimants; purchasers of claims; Educational Programs Fund;
    reversion of funds to United States Treasury]. (a) Each award made
    under this Act shall be certified to the Secretary of the Treasury
    in terms of United States currency on the basis of the rate of
    exchange (that is, P/2 equals $1) which was applied in the
    Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946 [sections 1751 to 1806 of
    this Appendix], for payment out of sums appropriated pursuant to
    section 8 of this Act. Such payments shall be made in accordance
    with such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may
    prescribe. Payments authorized under this Act shall be made in
    United States dollars or in Philippine pesos at the option of the
    Secretary of the Treasury; however, notwithstanding the last
    sentence of the first section of this Act, payment shall not be
    made outside of the Republic of the Philippines to any claimant
    residing outside the Republic of the Philippines unless he
    establishes to the satisfaction of the Commission that since the
    date of the loss or damage on account of which the original award
    was made he has heretofore invested in such manner as furthered the
    rehabilitation or economic development of the Philippines an amount
    not less than the claims approved in his favor after reduction
    under the last proviso of section 102(a) of the Philippine
    Rehabilitation Act of 1946 [section 1752(a) of this Appendix]. Any
    balance of the appropriation made pursuant to section 8 remaining
    after the payments authorized by the first section of this Act have
    been made and after any administrative expenses incurred by the
    Commission in connection with such payments have been paid shall be
    paid into a special fund in the United States Treasury to be used
    for the purpose of furthering educational exchange and other
    educational programs to the mutual advantage of the Republic of the
    Philippines and the United States in such manner as the Presidents
    of those two Republics shall from time to time determine. There
    shall be withheld from the payment authorized by the preceding
    sentence a sum equal to the difference between $73,000,000 (less
    administrative expenses) and the total amount which would have been
    paid to the claimants under the provisions of Public Law 87-616,
    which sum shall revert to the general funds in the United States
    Treasury. The acceptance by any claimant of a payment under this
    Act shall be considered to be in full satisfaction and final
    settlement of all claims of such claimant arising out of awards for
    war damage compensation made by the Philippine War Damage
    Commission. Payment shall not be made under this Act on any claim
    filed under the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946 [sections
    1751 to 1806 of this Appendix] or under this Act which was acquired
    from a predecessor in interest by purchase, except where such
    purchase was in the ordinary course of business in connection with
    the acquisition of all assets of a business firm.
      "(b) Such of the records of the Philippine War Damage Commission
    as the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission may deem necessary for
    carrying out its functions under this Act shall be transferred to
    the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission.
      "Sec. 6. [Remuneration for services to applicants; prohibition
    against certain payments; penalties; forfeitures; recovery of
    payments]. (a) The total remuneration on account of services
    rendered or to be rendered to or on behalf of any applicant in
    connection with any application filed under this Act shall not
    exceed 5 per centum of the amount paid by the Commission on account
    of such application. Any agreement to the contrary shall be
    unlawful and void. Whoever, subject to the jurisdiction of the
    United States, violates this subsection shall be fined not more
    than $5,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.
    Where any payment is made in violation of this subsection, the
    Commission shall take such action as may be appropriate to recover
    the same.
      "(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), no sum
    shall be paid by any claimant directly or indirectly to, or
    received or accepted by, any former commissioner or employee of the
    Philippine War Damage Commission or their assigns, or any person
    employed by or associated with any such former commissioner or
    employee in connection with the preparation, filing, allowance, or
    collection of any claim under this Act, as compensation on account
    of services rendered or as reimbursement on account of expenses
    incurred in connection with any application filed under this Act.
    Whoever, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, makes a
    payment in violation of the provisions of this subsection shall be
    fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year
    or both. Whoever, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,
    receives or accepts a payment in violation of this subsection,
    shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned for not more than
    five years or both. Whoever, subject to the jurisdiction of the
    United States, receives or accepts a payment in violation of this
    subsection, shall forfeit to the Government of the United States a
    sum equal to three times the amount of such payment, and the
    Commission shall take action to recover such sum from the person
    receiving the payment.
      "Sec. 7. [Application of International Claims Settlement Act of
    1949]. For the purposes of carrying out this Act, the following
    provisions of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949
    [section 1621 et seq. of Title 22, Foreign Relations and
    Intercourse] shall, to the extent not inconsistent with this Act,
    be applicable in the administration of this Act: Subsections (c),
    (d), (e), and (i) of section 4 [section 1623 of Title 22];
    subsections (d) and (e) of section 7 [section 1626 of Title 22];
    and subsection (c) of section 7 [section 1626 of Title 22] except
    that with respect to applicants not subject to the jurisdiction of
    the United States, references in such subsection (c) to the
    Comptroller General of the United States shall be deemed to refer
    to the Secretary of the Treasury.
      "Sec. 8. [Appropriations for payment of awards and administrative
    expenses]. There is authorized to be appropriated not more than
    $73,000,000 to make payments on awards certified pursuant to this
    Act, plus such additional sums as may be necessary for the
    administrative expenses of the Commission and of the Secretary of
    the Treasury in carrying out this Act."

    proposed for such curtailment with respect to each class or classes
    of processors or users and the criteria used in the establishment
    of such formulae.

    eradication of insects and rodents, the consumption of less of
    these foods and feeds which are in short supply and more of those
    foods and feeds which are in abundant supply, and other
    conservation practices. The authority herein conferred may be

    this section to any department, agency, or independent
    establishment of the Government, or transferred to any other agency
    requested to assist in carrying out this section. Funds allotted to
    any department, agency, or independent establishment of the
    Government shall be available for obligation and expenditure in
    accordance with the laws governing obligations and expenditures of

    filed at any time within twelve months after such dissolution and
    showing a necessity for the survival of such suit, action, or other
    proceeding to obtain a settlement of the questions involved, allow

    trust, or similar arrangement, is acquired by the United States by
    reason of default by, or failure of performance of, the purchaser,
    or its successor in interest, of any of its obligations, such real
    property shall continue to be subject to special assessments for
    local improvements and to State, county, municipal, or local
    taxation to the same extent according to its value as other real
    property is taxed and the Administrator of General Services is

    performance of its duties, the Commission shall consult and advise
    with the Attorney General in order (1) to secure guidance as to the
    type of disposal program which would best foster the development of

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1941e. Disposal procedure

-STATUTE-
    (a) Invitation of purchase proposals; notice and advertisement;
      period for receipt of proposals; data to accompany proposals
      The Commission shall invite, upon adequate notice and
    advertisement, proposals for the purchase of the Government-owned
    rubber-producing facilities, hereafter referred to as the
    "facilities". The period for the receipt of proposals shall be
    determined and publicly announced by the Commission, and in no
    event shall be less than six months after the first day on which
    proposals may be received pursuant to the advertisement. The
    advertisement shall be in such form, contain such specifications
    and reservations, and be published in such manner as the Commission
    in its discretion determines will best effectuate the purposes of
    this Act [sections 1941 to 1941y of this Appendix]. All data
    concerning such facilities which in the judgment of the Commission
    may be reasonably required for the submission of a bona fide
    proposal shall be furnished by the Commission upon request by any
    prospective purchaser unless the Commission has reason to believe
    that such prospective purchaser has not identified his principal,
    or is not financially responsible, or is a poor security risk.
    (b) Form and contents of proposals
      Proposals shall be in writing, and shall contain, among other
    things - 
        (1) identification of the person in whose behalf the proposal
      is submitted, including the business affiliation of such person;
        (2) the facility or facilities which are proposed to be
      purchased, and the order of preference if more than one facility
      is proposed to be purchased; or the order of preference if
      proposals are submitted on more than one facility, if only one
      facility is proposed to be purchased;
        (3) the arrangements or plans, if any, formal or informal, for
      the supply of feedstock to, and the disposition of the end
      products of, the respective facilities proposed to be purchased;
        (4) the amount proposed to be paid for each of the facilities,
      and, if such amount is not to be paid in cash, then the principal
      terms of the financing arrangement proposed;
        (5) the general terms and conditions which the prospective
      purchaser of a copolymer facility would be willing to accept in
      order to make the end product of such facility available for sale
      to small business enterprises, and the general terms and
      conditions which the prospective purchaser of a butadiene or
      styrene facility would be willing to accept in order to make the
      end product of such facility available for sale to purchasers of
      copolymer facilities; and
        (6) such other information as the Commission in its notice and
      advertisement for proposals shall require be set forth in
      proposals including the prospective purchaser's acceptance of the
      terms, conditions, restrictions and reservations contained in
      subsection (h) of this section, and the interest rate to be
      charged on the purchase-money mortgage referred to in subsection
      (e) of this section.
    (c) Disclosure of contents of proposals
      Should it become necessary to the effective prosecution of the
    disposal program, the Commission may, after the termination of the
    period for the submission of proposals provided for in subsection
    (a) of this section, disclose the contents of the proposals at such
    time, in such manner, and to such extent as it deems appropriate.
    (d) Deposit of cash or Government bonds to accompany proposals
      Proposals shall be accompanied by a deposit of cash or United
    States Government bonds of face amount equal to 2 1/2  per centum
    of the gross amount proposed to be paid but not exceeding $250,000
    for each facility: Provided, however, That the deposit required in
    the case of a proposal for one of a number of facilities on an
    alternative basis shall be the same as would be required if such
    proposal were for only the facility for which the particular
    prospective purchaser proposed to pay the highest amount. Except in
    the case of purchasers, deposits made hereunder shall be refunded
    without interest and not later than upon the termination of the
    period for congressional review as provided in section 9 of this
    Act [section 1941g of this Appendix]. In the case of purchasers,
    deposits made hereunder shall be applied without interest to the
    purchase price: Provided, however, That upon the closing of the
    contract of sale the purchaser shall be required to substitute cash
    equal to the face amount of the Government bonds then held in
    connection with such purchaser's proposal.
    (e) Payment of purchase price; amount and terms of mortgages
      Payment of the purchase price may be made in part by a first lien
    purchase-money mortgage, in an amount not to exceed 75 per centum
    of the purchase price. The terms of any such mortgage obligation,
    to be determined by negotiation, shall provide among other things
    for a maturity of not more than ten years, periodic amortization,
    and a uniform interest rate of not less than 3 per centum per
    annum.
    (f) Negotiation with those submitting proposals
      Promptly after the termination of the period for the receipt of
    proposals, pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, and for such
    period thereafter not less than seven months as may be determined
    and publicly announced by the Commission, it shall negotiate with
    those submitting proposals for the purpose of entering into
    definitive contracts of sale.
    (g) Securing of additional information from those submitting
      proposals
      Nothing contained in this Act [sections 1941 to 1941y of this
    Appendix] shall be construed to prevent the Commission from
    securing such additional information from those submitting
    proposals at any time as the Commission may deem necessary or
    appropriate to fulfill its responsibilities under this Act [said
    sections].
    (h) National security clause in contracts of sale
      All contracts of sale and instruments in execution thereof shall
    contain a national security clause having terms, conditions,
    restrictions and reservations which will assure the prompt
    availability of the rubber-producing facilities, or facilities of
    equivalent capacity, for the production of synthetic rubber and the
    component materials thereof for a period of ten years from the date
    of the contract.
    (i) Effective date of contracts of sale; time for transfer of
      possession of facilities; failure to complete transfer prior to
      termination date
      Subject to the conditions prescribed in section 24 of this Act
    [section 1941v of this Appendix], any contract of sale shall become
    fully effective upon the expiration of the period for congressional
    review provided for in section 9 of this Act [section 1941g of this
    Appendix] unless the Congress within such period has disapproved
    such sale. The transfer of possession of all of the rubber-
    producing facilities to be sold shall be made as promptly as is
    practicable after the effective date, in accordance with the terms
    of the contracts, but in any event within a period terminating
    sixty days after the expiration of the period for congressional
    review as provided in section 9(b) of this Act [section 1941g(b) of
    this Appendix]. The failure to complete transfer of possession
    prior to said termination date shall not give rise to or be the
    basis of rescission of the contract of sale.
    (j) Limitation on Government rubber sales
      Upon termination of the transfer period, as provided in
    subsection (i) of this section, the operating agency last
    designated by the President shall make no further sales of
    synthetic rubber and its component materials except as otherwise
    provided in this Act [sections 1941 to 1941y of this Appendix].
    (k) Offer of Government rubber for sale to purchasers of facilities
      after termination of transfer period
      During the period of one year following the termination of the
    transfer period, the operating agency last designated by the
    President shall offer for sale to the purchasers of the facilities
    the synthetic rubber and its component materials held by it at a
    price determined in accordance with its pricing policy prevailing
    at the close of the transfer period, in amounts prorated in
    accordance with the ratio of the capacity of each such facility
    purchased to the total capacity of all facilities of the same type
    sold. Any synthetic rubber or component materials not purchased by
    an eligible purchaser during periodic intervals, as determined by
    the operating agency, shall be made available to other eligible
    purchasers on a like equitable basis. Any synthetic rubber or
    component materials not sold during such one-year period shall
    thereafter be disposed of in such manner as said agency deems
    advisable.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Upon the termination of the transfer period, the operating
    agency last designated by the President, shall, as promptly as
    possible consistent with sound operating procedures, take out of
    production and place in adequate standby condition the rubber-
    producing facilities which shall not have been sold. At any time
    after the termination of production, such facilities may be
    transferred without reimbursement or transfer of funds to the
    General Services Administration and administered in accordance with
    the provisions of sections 6, 7, and 8 of the National Industrial
    Reserve Act of 1948, as amended (62 Stat. 1227, 50 U.S.C. 456-458)
    [50 U.S.C. 455 to 457], or to such other agency as the President
    may designate for administration in such manner as he may direct.
    In such event (1) no such facility shall thereafter be operated as
    a rubber-producing facility for the account of, or by, the
    Government except pursuant to further Act of Congress; (2) no such
    facility, other than alcohol-butadiene facilities, shall be leased
    for operation as a rubber-producing facility at any time: Provided,
    That nothing contained in this Act [sections 1941 to 1941y of this
    Appendix] shall preclude the leasing of alcohol-butadiene
    facilities for purposes other than the manufacture of alcohol
    butadiene so long as such leases are in accordance with the
    provisions of section 8(a) or section 9(f) of this Act [subsection
    (a) of this section or section 1941g (f) of this Appendix]; and (3)
    no such facility shall be disposed of by sale within a period of
    three years from the termination of the transfer period, and in any
    subsequent lease or sale, the Government agency acting under
    authority of this section shall within a reasonable time and in no
    event less than sixty days prior to the lease or sale, request the
    advice of the Attorney General as to whether the proposed lease or
    sale would tend to create or maintain a situation inconsistent with
    the antitrust laws. The Attorney General shall give his advice
    within forty-five days of the receipt of such request. Upon the
    request of the Attorney General, the Government agency shall
    furnish, or cause to be furnished, such information as it may
    possess which the Attorney General determines to be appropriate or
    necessary to enable him to give the advice called for by this
    section.
      (b) Whenever any transfer to any Government agency is made
    pursuant to this section, all unexpended funds budgeted as provided
    in section 9(e) [section 1941g(e) of this Appendix] for standby and
    maintenance in such condition shall also be transferred.

    that:
      "(a) Notwithstanding any provision of the Rubber Producing
    Facilities Disposal Act of 1953, as amended [sections 1941 to 1941x
    of this Appendix], or of this Act [enacting section 1941y and
    provisions set out as notes under sections 1941r and 1941y of this
    Appendix], the Rubber Producing Facilities Disposal Commission may
    enter into contracts of sale and may from time to time enter into
    leases for all or any part of the catalyst manufacturing equipment
    now situated in Baltimore, Maryland, and generally described in the
    Commission's brochure M-2 dated March 1954.
      "(b) Except as provided in this paragraph, each such lease or
    contract may be made on such terms and conditions, including type
    of use and duration (up to fifteen years) of any lease, as the
    Commission deems advisable in the public interest. Before making
    such sale or lease, the Commission shall secure the advice of the
    Attorney General as to whether the proposed sale or lease would
    tend to create or maintain a situation inconsistent with the
    antitrust laws. Each such lease or contract of sale shall contain a
    national security clause, containing such terms and for such
    duration (ten years or less) as the Commission deems desirable in
    the public interest, and any such lease shall provide for the
    recapture of the equipment thereby leased and the termination of
    the lease, if the President determines that the national interest
    so requires.
      "The price for any part or all of such equipment shall be an
    amount which the Commission determines to be the maximum amount
    obtainable in the public interest, but not less than fair value as
    determined by the Commission.
      "(c) Any of such equipment not sold or leased under subsection
    (a) shall be placed and maintained in adequate standby condition
    pursuant to, and be otherwise subject to, the provisions of section
    8 of the Rubber Producing Facilities Disposal Act of 1953 [this
    section] (other than the provision prohibiting leases).
      "(d) All the powers and authority conferred by this section upon
    the Commission may, after the termination of the existence of the
    Commission, be exercised by such agency of the Government as the
    President may designate for the purpose, and for this purpose such
    successor agency may exercise all the authority conferred in the
    Rubber Producing Facilities Disposal Act of 1953 [sections 1941 to
    1941y of this Appendix] upon the Commission."

      of an adjournment of more than three days to a day certain.
    (d) Restriction on sale or lease of rubber-producing facilities
      No rubber-producing facility shall be sold or leased except in
    accordance with this Act [sections 1941 to 1941y of this Appendix]

        (1) That the disposal program be designed best to afford small-
      business enterprises and users, other than the purchser (!1) of
      a facility, the opportunity to obtain a fair share of the end
      products of the facilities sold and at fair prices;

        (2) That the prospective purchaser has the technical competence
      necessary to operate a rubber-producing facility, except that
      prior experience in operating a rubber-producing facility shall
      not be required as a basis for determining whether a prospective
      purchaser has the technical competence necessary to operate a
      rubber-producing facility;
        (3) That the recommended sales shall provide for the
      development within the United States of a free, competitive,
      synthetic rubber industry, and do not permit any person to
      possess unreasonable control over the manufacture of synthetic
      rubber or its component materials;
        (4) That the prospective purchaser is acting in good faith, and
      actually intends to operate the facility or facilities for the
      purpose of manufacturing synthetic rubber or its component
      materials;
        (5) That full fair value for the facility or facilities will be
      received by the Government, taking into consideration the policy
      set forth in section 2 of this Act [section 1941 of this
      Appendix];
        (6) That disposal of the facility or facilities to the
      purchasers is consistent with national security; and
        (7) That the facilities recommended for sale will in the
      aggregate be capable of annually producing not less than five
      hundred thousand long tons of general-purpose synthetic rubber,
      and not less than forty-three thousand long tons annually of
      butyl rubber.

      (1) As an exercise of the rule-making power of the Senate and the
    house of Representatives, respectively, and as such they shall be
    considered as part of the rules of each House, respectively, but
    applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in

    (b)); and such rules shall supersede other rules only to the extent
    that they are inconsistent therewith; and
      (2) With full recognition of the constitutional right of either
    House to change such rules (so far as relating to the procedure in
    such House) at any time, in the same manner and to the same extent
    as in the case of any other rule of such House.
    (b) Form of resolution
      As used in this section, the term "resolution" means only a
    resolution of either of the two Houses of Congress, the matter
    after the resolving clause of which is as follows: (1) "That the

    committee from further consideration of such resolution, or to
    discharge the committee from further consideration of any other
    resolution with respect to such facility or facilities which has
    been referred to the committee.
      (2) Such motion may be made only by a person favoring the

-STATUTE-
    (a) Receipt of proposal
      Notwithstanding the second sentence of section 7(a) [section
    1941e(a) of this Appendix], the period for receipt of proposals for
    the purchase of the Government-owned rubber-producing facility at

    until the end of the thirty-day period which begins on the date of
    the enactment of this section [Mar. 31, 1955].
    (b) Negotiation period
      If one or more proposals are received for the purchase of Plancor
    Numbered 877 within the time period specified in subsection (a),
    the Commission, notwithstanding the expiration of the period for
    negotiation specified in section 7 (f) [section 1941e(f) of this
    Appendix], shall negotiate with those submitting the proposals for
    a period of not to exceed sixty days for the purpose of entering

    sale.
    (d) Standby condition
      If, upon termination of the transfer period provided for in
    subsection (c), no contract for the sale of Plancor Numbered 877

    proposed lease or sale would tend to create or maintain a situation
    inconsistent with the antitrust laws, enter into leases or
    contracts of sale for all or any number of 448 pressure tank cars
    (ICC Classification ICC-104AW) for which the Commission invited

    Government and the termination of the lease, if the President
    determines that the national interest so requires. The rental or
    price for any such tank car or cars shall be an amount which the
    Commission or such agency determines to be the maximum amount
    obtainable in the public interest, but not less than fair value as
    determined by the Commission. Any of such tank cars not under lease
    or contract of sale to non-Federal lessees or purchasers may be

    Government department or agency upon request, for such use as the
    Commission or such agency deems advisable and subject to national
    security and recapture provisions of the type hereinabove provided

    Commission shall prepare and submit to the Congress a report
    containing with respect to the disposal under this section of
    Plancor Numbered 980, the information described in paragraphs (1)

    Sec. 1981. Attorney General's jurisdiction; uncompensated claims;

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Attorney General shall have jurisdiction to compromise
    and settle and make an award in an amount not to exceed $100,000 as
    hereinafter provided on any claim by a person of Japanese ancestry
    against the United States arising on or after December 7, 1941,
    when such claim is not compensated for by insurance or otherwise,
    for damage to or loss of real or personal property (including
    without limitation as to amount damage to or loss of personal
    property bailed to or in the custody of the Government or any agent
    thereof), that is (except as is otherwise provided by subsections
    1(b)(2) and (1)(b)(3)) [subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this
    section] a reasonable and natural consequence of the evacuation or
    exclusion of such person by the appropriate military commander from
    a military area in Arizona, California, Oregon, or Washington; or
    from the Territory of Alaska, or the Territory of Hawaii, under
    authority of Executive Order Numbered 9066, dated February 19, 1942
    (3 C.F.R. Cum. Supp. 1092), section 67 of the Act of April 30, 1900
    (48 U.S.C. 532), or Executive Order Numbered 9489, dated October
    18, 1944 (3 C.F.R. 1944 Supp. 45).
      (b) As used herein - 
      (1) "Evacuation" shall include voluntary departure from a
    military area prior to but in anticipation of an order of exclusion
    therefrom.
      (2) "Claims by a person of Japanese ancestry" shall include
    claims that were filed by any profit or nonprofit organization,
    corporate or otherwise, the majority of whose stock was owned by,
    or the majority of whose stockholders or members were, on December
    7, 1941, and on the date of the filing of the claim, persons of
    Japanese ancestry actually residing within the continental limits
    of the United States or its Territories: Provided, however, That
    the losses sustained by the particular organization were the result
    (1) of the evacuation and exclusion of its stockholders or members,
    or (2) of the evacuation and exclusion of persons of Japanese
    ancestry upon whom the organization depended for its business or
    support. Such claims shall not be barred by awards or disallowances
    heretofore made.
      (3) "Claim by a person of Japanese ancestry" shall also include
    claims which have been timely filed for such damage or loss as
    heretofore defined incurred by persons of Japanese ancestry
    detained, interned, or paroled, and subsequently released, pursuant
    to Revised Statutes, sections 4067-70, as amended (relating to
    alien enemies) [50 U.S.C. 21 to 24]. Such claims shall also include
    losses due to the exclusion of the families and relatives of such
    persons during their detention or internment. Any such person shall
    be deemed to have been excluded from such military areas and
    territories as of the date he would have been evacuated had he not
    been detained or interned. The claim of or on behalf of such person
    shall not be barred by any award or disallowance heretofore made.

      The purposes of this Act [sections 1989 to 1989d of this
    Appendix] are to - 
        (1) acknowledge the fundamental injustice of the evacuation,
      relocation, and internment of United States citizens and
      permanent resident aliens of Japanese ancestry during World War
      II;
        (2) apologize on behalf of the people of the United States for
      the evacuation, relocation, and internment of such citizens and
      permanent resident aliens;
        (3) provide for a public education fund to finance efforts to
      inform the public about the internment of such individuals so as
      to prevent the recurrence of any similar event;
        (4) make restitution to those individuals of Japanese ancestry
      who were interned;
        (5) make restitution to Aleut residents of the Pribilof Islands
      and the Aleutian Islands west of Unimak Island, in settlement of
      United States obligations in equity and at law, for - 
          (A) injustices suffered and unreasonable hardships endured
        while those Aleut residents were under United States control
        during World War II;
          (B) personal property taken or destroyed by United States
        forces during World War II;
          (C) community property, including community church property,
        taken or destroyed by United States forces during World War II;
        and
          (D) traditional village lands on Attu Island not
        rehabilitated after World War II for Aleut occupation or other
        productive use;

        (6) discourage the occurrence of similar injustices and
      violations of civil liberties in the future; and
        (7) make more credible and sincere any declaration of concern
      by the United States over violations of human rights committed by
      other nations.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1989a. Statement of the Congress

-STATUTE-
    (a) With regard to individuals of Japanese ancestry
      The Congress recognizes that, as described by the Commission on
    Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, a grave injustice
    was done to both citizens and permanent resident aliens of Japanese
    ancestry by the evacuation, relocation, and internment of civilians
    during World War II. As the Commission documents, these actions
    were carried out without adequate security reasons and without any
    acts of espionage or sabotage documented by the Commission, and
    were motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a
    failure of political leadership. The excluded individuals of
    Japanese ancestry suffered enormous damages, both material and
    intangible, and there were incalculable losses in education and job
    training, all of which resulted in significant human suffering for
    which appropriate compensation has not been made. For these
    fundamental violations of the basic civil liberties and
    constitutional rights of these individuals of Japanese ancestry,
    the Congress apologizes on behalf of the Nation.
    (b) With respect to the Aleuts
      The Congress recognizes that, as described by the Commission on
    Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, the Aleut civilian
    residents of the Pribilof Islands and the Aleutian Islands west of
    Unimak Island were relocated during World War II to temporary camps
    in isolated regions of southeast Alaska where they remained, under
    United States control and in the care of the United States, until
    long after any potential danger to their home villages had passed.
    The United States failed to provide reasonable care for the Aleuts,
    and this resulted in widespread illness, disease, and death among
    the residents of the camps; and the United States further failed to
    protect Aleut personal and community property while such property
    was in its possession or under its control. The United States has
    not compensated the Aleuts adequately for the conversion or
    destruction of personal property, and the conversion or destruction
    of community property caused by the United States military
    occupation of Aleut villages during World War II. There is no
    remedy for injustices suffered by the Aleuts during World War II
    except an Act of Congress providing appropriate compensation for
    those losses which are attributable to the conduct of United States
    forces and other officials and employees of the United States.

      The Attorney General is requested to review any case in which an
    individual living on the date of the enactment of this Act [Aug.
    10, 1988] was, while a United States citizen or permanent resident
    alien of Japanese ancestry, convicted of a violation of - 
        (1) Executive Order Numbered 9066, dated February 19, 1942;
        (2) the Act entitled "An Act to provide a penalty for violation
      of restrictions or orders with respect to persons entering,

      States or its agents, representatives, officers, or employees,
      respecting the evacuation, relocation, or internment of
      individuals solely on the basis of Japanese ancestry;

    on account of the refusal by such individual, during the
    evacuation, relocation, and internment period, to accept treatment
    which discriminated against the individual on the basis of the
    individual's Japanese ancestry.
    (b) Recommendations for pardons
      Based upon any review under subsection (a), the Attorney General
    is requested to recommend to the President for pardon consideration
    those convictions which the Attorney General considers appropriate.
    (c) Action by the President
      In consideration of the statement of the Congress set forth in
    section 2(a) [section 1989a(a) of this Appendix], the President is
    requested to offer pardons to any individuals recommended by the
    Attorney General under subsection (b).

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1989b-4. Restitution

-STATUTE-
    (a) Location and payment of eligible individuals
      (1) In general
        Subject to paragraph (7), the Attorney General shall, subject
      to the availability of funds appropriated to the Fund for such
      purpose, pay out of the Fund to each eligible individual the sum
      of $20,000, unless such individual refuses, in the manner
      described in paragraph (5), to accept the payment.
      (2) Location of eligible individuals
        The Attorney General shall identify and locate, without
      requiring any application for payment and using records already
      in the possession of the United States Government, each eligible
      individual. The Attorney General should use funds and resources
      available to the Attorney General, including those described in
      subsection (c), to attempt to complete such identification and
      location within 12 months after the date of the enactment of this
      Act [Aug. 10, 1988]. Any eligible individual may notify the
      Attorney General that such individual is an eligible individual,
      and may provide documentation therefor. The Attorney General
      shall designate an officer or employee to whom such notification
      and documentation may be sent, shall maintain a list of all
      individuals who submit such notification and documentation, and
      shall, subject to the availability of funds appropriated for such
      purpose, encourage, through a public awareness campaign, each
      eligible individual to submit his or her current address to such
      officer or employee. To the extent that resources referred to in
      the second sentence of this paragraph are not sufficient to
      complete the identification and location of all eligible
      individuals, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as
      may be necessary for such purpose. In any case, the
      identification and location of all eligible individuals shall be
      completed within 12 months after the appropriation of funds under
      the preceding sentence. Failure to be identified and located by
      the end of the 12-month period specified in the preceding
      sentence shall not preclude an eligible individual from receiving
      payment under this section.
      (3) Benefit of the doubt
        When, after consideration of all evidence and relevant material
      for determining whether an individual is an eligible individual,
      there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence
      regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of
      eligibility, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such
      issue shall be given to such individual.
      (4) Notice from the Attorney General
        The Attorney General shall, when funds are appropriated to the
      Fund for payments to an eligible individual under this section,
      notify that eligible individual in writing of his or her
      eligibility for payment under this section. Such notice shall
      inform the eligible individual that - 
          (A) acceptance of payment under this section shall be in full
        satisfaction of all claims against the United States arising
        out of acts described in section 108(2)(B) [section 1989b-
        7(2)(B) of this Appendix], and
          (B) each eligible individual who does not refuse, in the
        manner described in paragraph (5), to accept payment under this
        section within 18 months after receiving such written notice
        shall be deemed to have accepted payment for purposes of
        paragraph (6).
      (5) Effect of refusal to accept payment
        If an eligible individual refuses, in a written document filed
      with the Attorney General, to accept any payment under this
      section, the amount of such payment shall remain in the Fund and
      no payment may be made under this section to such individual at
      any time after such refusal.
      (6) Payment in full settlement of claims against the United
        States
        The acceptance of payment by an eligible individual under this
      section shall be in full satisfaction of all claims against the
      United States arising out of acts described in section 108(2)(B)
      [section 1989b-7(2)(B) of this Appendix]. This paragraph shall
      apply to any eligible individual who does not refuse, in the
      manner described in paragraph (5), to accept payment under this
      section within 18 months after receiving the notification from
      the Attorney General referred to in paragraph (4).
      (7) Exclusion of certain individuals
        No payment may be made under this section to any individual
      who, after September 1, 1987, accepts payment pursuant to an
      award of a final judgment or a settlement on a claim against the
      United States for acts described in section 108(2)(B) [section
      1989b-7(2)(B) of this Appendix], or to any surviving spouse,
      child, or parent of such individual to whom paragraph (8)
      applies.
      (8) Payments in the case of deceased persons
        (A) In the case of an eligible individual who is deceased at
      the time of payment under this section, such payment shall be
      made only as follows:
          (i) If the eligible individual is survived by a spouse who is
        living at the time of payment, such payment shall be made to
        such surviving spouse.
          (ii) If there is no surviving spouse described in clause (i),
        such payment shall be made in equal shares to all children of
        the eligible individual who are living at the time of payment.
          (iii) If there is no surviving spouse described in clause (i)
        and if there are no children described in clause (ii), such
        payment shall be made in equal shares to the parents of the
        eligible individual who are living at the time of payment.

      If there is no surviving spouse, children, or parents described
      in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii), the amount of such payment shall
      remain in the Fund, and may be used only for the purposes set
      forth in section 106(b) [section 1989b-5(b) of this Appendix].
        (B) After the death of an eligible individual, this subsection
      and subsections (c) and (f) shall apply to the individual or
      individuals specified in subparagraph (A) to whom payment under
      this section will be made, to the same extent as such subsections
      apply to the eligible individual.
        (C) For purposes of this paragraph - 
          (i) the "spouse" of an eligible individual means a wife or
        husband of an eligible individual who was married to that
        eligible individual for at least 1 year immediately before the
        death of the eligible individual;
          (ii) a "child" of an eligible individual includes a
        recognized natural child, a stepchild who lived with the
        eligible individual in a regular parent-child relationship, and
        an adopted child; and
          (iii) a "parent" of an eligible individual includes fathers
        and mothers through adoption.
    (b) Order of payments
      The Attorney General shall endeavor to make payments under this
    section to eligible individuals in the order of date of birth (with
    the oldest individual on the date of the enactment of this Act
    [Aug. 10, 1988] (or, if applicable, that individual's survivors
    under paragraph (8)) receiving full payment first), until all
    eligible individuals have received payment in full.
    (c) Resources for locating eligible individuals
      In attempting to locate any eligible individual, the Attorney
    General may use any facility or resource of any public or nonprofit
    organization or any other record, document, or information that may
    be made available to the Attorney General.
    (d) Administrative costs not paid from the Fund
      No costs incurred by the Attorney General in carrying out this
    section shall be paid from the Fund or set off against, or
    otherwise deducted from, any payment under this section to any
    eligible individual.
    (e) Termination of duties of Attorney General
      The duties of the Attorney General under this section shall cease
    180 days after the Fund terminates.
    (f) Clarification of treatment of payments under other laws
      Amounts paid to an eligible individual under this section - 
        (1) shall be treated for purposes of the internal revenue laws
      of the United States as damages for human suffering; and
        (2) shall not be included as income or resources for purposes
      of determining eligibility to receive benefits described in
      section 3803(c)(2)(C) of title 31, United States Code (!1) or
      available under any other law administered by the Secretary of
      Veterans Affairs, or for purposes of determining the amount of
      such benefits.

    (g) Liability of United States limited to amount in Fund
      (1) General rule
        An eligible individual may be paid under this section only from
      amounts in the Fund.
      (2) Coordination with other provisions
        Nothing in this title [sections 1989b to 1989b-9 of this
      Appendix] shall authorize the payment to an eligible individual
      by the United States Government of any amount authorized by this
      section from any source other than the Fund.
      (3) Order in which unpaid claims to be paid
        If at any time the Fund has insufficient funds to pay all
      eligible individuals at such time, such eligible individuals
      shall, to the extent permitted under paragraph (1), be paid in
      full in the order specified in subsection (b).
    (h) Judicial review
      (1) Review by the Court of Federal Claims
        A claimant may seek judicial review of a denial of compensation
      under this section solely in the United States Court of Federal
      Claims, which shall review the denial upon the administrative
      record and shall hold unlawful and set aside the denial if it is
      found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or
      otherwise not in accordance with law.
      (2) Applicability
        This subsection shall apply only to any claim filed in court on
      or after the date of the enactment of this subsection [Sept. 27,
      1992].

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1989c-4. Compensation for community losses

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      Subject to the availability of funds appropriated to the Fund,
    the Secretary shall make payments from the Fund, in accordance with
    this section, as restitution for certain Aleut losses sustained in
    World War II.
    (b) Trust
      (1) Establishment
        The Secretary shall, subject to the availability of funds
      appropriated for this purpose, establish a trust for the purposes
      set forth in this section. Such trust shall be established
      pursuant to the laws of the State of Alaska, and shall be
      maintained and operated by not more than seven trustees, as
      designated by the Secretary. Each affected Aleut village may
      submit to the Administrator a list of three prospective trustees.
      The Secretary, after consultation with the Administrator,
      affected Aleut villages, and the Corporation, shall designate not
      more than seven trustees from such lists as submitted.
      (2) Administration of trust
        The trust established under this subsection shall be
      administered in a manner that is consistent with the laws of the
      State of Alaska, and as prescribed by the Secretary, after
      consultation with representatives of eligible Aleuts, the
      residents of affected Aleut villages, and the Administrator.
    (c) (!1) Accounts for benefit of Aleuts

      (1) In general
        The Secretary shall deposit in the trust such sums as may be
      appropriated for the purposes set forth in this subsection. The
      trustees shall maintain and operate 8 independent and separate
      accounts in the trust for purposes of this subsection, as
      follows:
          (A) One account for the independent benefit of the wartime
        Aleut residents of Attu and their descendants.
          (B) Six accounts for the benefit of the 6 surviving affected
        Aleut villages, one each for the independent benefit of Akutan,
        Atka, Nikolski, Saint George, Saint Paul, and Unalaska,
        respectively.
          (C) One account for the independent benefit of those Aleuts
        who, as determined by the Secretary, upon the advice of the
        trustees, are deserving but will not benefit directly from the
        accounts established under subparagraphs (A) and (B).

      The trustees shall credit to the account described in
      subparagraph (C) an amount equal to 5 percent of the principal
      amount deposited by the Secretary in the trust under this
      subsection. Of the remaining principal amount, an amount shall be
      credited to each account described in subparagraphs (A) and (B)
      which bears the same proportion to such remaining principal
      amount as the Aleut civilian population, as of June 1, 1942, of
      the village with respect to which such account is established
      bears to the total civilian Aleut population on such date of all
      affected Aleut villages.
      (2) Uses of accounts
        The trustees may use the principal, accrued interest, and other
      earnings of the accounts maintained under paragraph (1) for - 
          (A) the benefit of elderly, disabled, or seriously ill
        persons on the basis of special need;
          (B) the benefit of students in need of scholarship
        assistance;
          (C) the preservation of Aleut cultural heritage and
        historical records;
          (D) the improvement of community centers in affected Aleut
        villages; and
          (E) other purposes to improve the condition of Aleut life, as
        determined by the trustees.
      (3) Authorization of appropriations
        There are authorized to be appropriated $5,000,000 to the Fund
      to carry out this subsection.
    (d) Compensation for damaged or destroyed church property
      (1) Inventory and assessment of property
        The Administrator shall make an inventory and assessment of
      real and personal church property of affected Aleut villages
      which was damaged or destroyed during World War II. In making
      such inventory and assessment, the Administrator shall consult
      with the trustees of the trust established under subsection (b),
      residents of affected Aleut villages, affected church members and
      leaders, and the clergy of the churches involved. Within 1 year
      after the date of the enactment of this Act [Aug. 10, 1988], the
      Administrator shall submit such inventory and assessment,
      together with an estimate of the present replacement value of
      lost or destroyed furnishings and artifacts, to the Secretary.
      (2) Review by the Secretary; deposit in the trust
        The Secretary shall review the inventory and assessment
      provided under paragraph (1), and shall deposit in the trust
      established under subsection (b) an amount reasonably calculated
      by the Secretary to compensate affected Aleut villages for church
      property lost, damaged, or destroyed during World War II.
      (3) Distribution of compensation
        The trustees shall distribute the amount deposited in the trust
      under paragraph (2) for the benefit of the churches referred to
      in this subsection.
      (4) Authorization of appropriations
        There are authorized to be appropriated to the Fund $4,700,000
      to carry out this subsection.
    (c) (!1) Administrative and legal expenses
      (1) Reimbursement for expenses
        The Secretary shall reimburse the Administrator, not less often
      than annually, for reasonable and necessary administrative and
      legal expenses in carrying out the Administrator's
      responsibilities under this title [sections 1989c to 1989c-8 of
      this Appendix].

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1989c-6. Attu Island restitution program

-STATUTE-
    (a) Purpose of section
      In accordance with section (3)(c) (!1) of the Wilderness Act (78
    Stat. 892; 16 U.S.C. 1132(c)), the public lands on Attu Island,
    Alaska, within the National Wildlife Refuge System have been
    designated as wilderness by section 702(1) of the Alaska National
    Interest Lands Conservation Act (94 Stat. 2417; 16 U.S.C. 1132
    note). In order to make restitution for the loss of traditional
    Aleut lands and village properties on Attu Island, while preserving
    the present designation of Attu Island lands as part of the
    National Wilderness Preservation System, compensation to the Aleut
    people, in lieu of the conveyance of Attu Island, shall be provided
    in accordance with this section.

    (b) Acreage determination
      Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this
    Act [Aug. 10, 1988], the Secretary shall, in accordance with this
    subsection, determine the total acreage of land on Attu Island,
    Alaska, that, at the beginning of World War II, was subject to
    traditional use by the Aleut villagers of that island for
    subsistence and other purposes. In making such acreage
    determination, the Secretary shall establish a base acreage of not
    less than 35,000 acres within that part of eastern Attu Island
    traditionally used by the Aleut people, and shall, from the best
    available information, including information that may be submitted
    by representatives of the Aleut people, identify any such
    additional acreage on Attu Island that was subject to such use. The
    combination of such base acreage and such additional acreage shall
    constitute the acreage determination upon which payment to the
    Corporation under this section is based. The Secretary shall
    promptly notify the Corporation of the results of the acreage
    determination made under this subsection.
    (c) Valuation
      (1) Determination of value
        Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this
      Act [Aug. 10, 1988], the Secretary shall determine the value of
      the Attu Island acreage determined under subsection (b), except
      that - 
          (A) such acreage may not be valued at less than $350 per acre
        nor more than $500 per acre; and
          (B) the total valuation of all such acreage may not exceed
        $15,000,000.
      (2) Factors in making determination
        In determining the value of the acreage under paragraph (1),
      the Secretary shall take into consideration such factors as the
      Secretary considers appropriate, including - 
          (A) fair market value;
          (B) environmental and public interest value; and
          (C) established precedents for valuation of comparable
        wilderness lands in the State of Alaska.
      (3) Notification of determination; appeal
        The Secretary shall promptly notify the Corporation of the
      determination of value made under this subsection, and such
      determination shall constitute the final determination of value
      unless the Corporation, within 30 days after the determination is
      made, appeals the determination to the Secretary. If such appeal
      is made, the Secretary shall, within 30 days after the appeal is
      made, review the determination in light of the appeal, and issue
      a final determination of the value of that acreage determined to
      be subject to traditional use under subsection (b).
    (d) In lieu compensation payment
      (1) Payment
        The Secretary shall pay, subject to the availability of funds
      appropriated for such purpose, to the Corporation, as
      compensation for the Aleuts' loss of lands on Attu Island, the
      full amount of the value of the acreage determined under
      subsection (c), less the value (as determined under subsection
      (c)) of any land conveyed under subsection (e).
      (2) Payment in full settlement of claims against the United
        States
        The payment made under paragraph (1) shall be in full
      satisfaction of any claim against the United States for the loss
      of traditional Aleut lands and village properties on Attu Island.
    (e) Village site conveyance
      The Secretary may convey to the Corporation all right, title, and
    interest of the United States to the surface estate of the
    traditional Aleut village site on Attu Island, Alaska (consisting
    of approximately 10 acres) and to the surface estate of a parcel of
    land consisting of all land outside such village that is within 660
    feet of any point on the boundary of such village. The conveyance
    may be made under the authority contained in section 14(h)(1) of
    the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (Public Law 92-203; 43
    U.S.C. 1613(h)(1)), except that after the enactment of this Act
    [Aug. 10, 1988], no site on Attu Island, Alaska, other than such
    traditional Aleut village site and such parcel of land, may be
    conveyed to the Corporation under such section 14(h)(1).
    (f) Authorization of appropriations
      There are authorized to be appropriated $15,000,000 to the
    Secretary to carry out this section.

    Sec. 2001. Foreign Claims Settlement Commission of the United
      States

-STATUTE-
    (a) Employment of personnel; use of other facilities and services
      The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission of the United States
    (hereinafter referred to as the "Commission") may, in accordance
    with the provisions of the civil-service laws and the
    Classification Act of 1949, as amended [5 U.S.C. 5101 et seq., 5331
    et seq.], appoint and fix the compensation of such officers,
    attorneys, and employees, and may make such expenditures, as may be
    necessary to carry out its functions. Officers and employees of any
    other department or agency of the Government may, with the consent
    of the head of such department or agency, be assigned to assist the
    Commission in carrying out its functions. The Commission may, with
    the consent of the head of any other department or agency of the
    Government, utilize the facilities and services of such department
    or agency in carrying out the functions of the Commission.
    (b) Rules and regulations; delegation of functions; time limit on
      filing of claims
      The Commission may prescribe such rules and regulations as may be
    necessary to enable it to carry out its functions, and may delegate
    functions to any member, officer, or employee of the Commission.
    The Commission shall give public notice of the time when, and the
    limit of time within which, claims may be filed, which notice shall
    be published in the Federal Register. The limit of time within
    which claims may be filed with the Commission shall in no event be
    later than March 31, 1952. The Commission shall take immediate
    action to advise all persons entitled to file claims under the
    provisions of this title [sections 2001 to 2016 of this Appendix]
    administered by the Commission of their rights under such
    provisions, and to assist them in the preparation and filing of
    their claims.
    (c) Subpenas; issuance; contempt; witness fees; administration of
      oaths
      (1) For the purpose of any hearing, examination, or investigation
    under this title [sections 2001 to 2016 of this Appendix], the
    Commission and those employees designated by the Commission shall
    have the power to issue subpenas requiring persons to appear and
    testify or to appear and produce documents, or both, at any
    designated place where such hearing, examination, or investigation
    is being held. The Commission or any employee so designated shall,
    upon application of a claimant, issue to such claimant subpenas
    requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the
    production of documents, or both, required by such claimant in
    hearings upon his claim: Provided, That the claimant making such
    application pay the witness fees and mileage of any witness or
    witnesses subpenaed upon his request. The production of a person's
    documents at any place other than his place of business shall not
    be required, however, in any case in which, prior to the return
    date specified in the subpena with respect thereto, such person
    either has furnished the issuer of the subpena with a copy of such
    documents (certified by such person under oath to be a true and
    correct copy) or has entered into a stipulation with the issuer of
    the subpena as to the information contained in such documents.
      (2) The Commission may, in case of a failure or refusal on the
    part of any person to comply with any such subpena, invoke the aid
    of any United States district court within the jurisdiction of
    which the hearing, examination, or investigation is being
    conducted, or such person resides or transacts business. Such court
    may issue an order requiring such person to appear at the
    designated place of hearing, examination, or investigation, there
    to give or produce testimony or documentary evidence concerning the
    matter in question. Any failure to obey such order of the court
    shall be punishable by such court as a contempt thereof. All
    process in any such case may be served in the judicial district
    wherein such person resides or transacts business or wherever such
    person may be found.
      (3) Witnesses subpenaed under this subsection shall be paid the
    same fees and mileage that are allowed and paid witnesses in United
    States district courts.
      (4) Any member of the Commission, and any employee of the
    Commission authorized by the Commission to do so, may administer
    to, or take from, any person an oath, affirmation, or affidavit
    when such action is necessary or appropriate in the performance of
    the functions or activities of the Commission.

    (b) Payment of detention benefits
      The Commission is authorized to receive, adjudicate according to
    law, and provide for the payment of any claim filed by, or on

    any period of time subsequent to December 6, 1941, during which he
    was held by the Imperial Japanese Government as a prisoner,
    internee, hostage, or in any other capacity, or remained in hiding
    to avoid being captured or interned by such Imperial Japanese
    Government.
    (c) Amount of detention benefits
      The detention benefit allowed to any person under the provisions
    of subsection (b) shall be at the rate of $60 for each calendar

    by section 13 of this title [section 2012 of this Appendix], and

    in the discretion of the Commission, be paid, for the use of the
    claimant, to the natural or legal guardian, committee, conservator,
    or curator of the claimant, or, if there is no such guardian,
    committee, conservator, or curator, then the Commission may, in its
    discretion, make payment to any other person, including the spouse
    of such claimant, whom the Commission may determine is vested with
    the care of the claimant or his estate for the use and benefit of

    with respect to the injury, disability, or death resulting from
    injury of a civilian American citizen occurring while he was held
    by or in hiding from the Imperial Japanese Government, to the same
    extent as if such civilian American citizen were an employee within
    the purview of such Act of December 2, 1942, as amended [42 U.S.C.
    1701 to 1717].
      (2) For the purpose of determining the benefits extended and made

        (B) the provisions of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1701 to 1717], shall

      date of enactment of this section [July 3, 1948]; and
        (D) the monthly compensation in cases involving partial
      disability shall be determined by the percentage the degree of
      partial disability bears to total disability and shall not be
      determined with respect to the extent of loss of wage earning
      capacity.

      (3) The following provisions of such Act of December 2, 1942, as
    amended [42 U.S.C. 1701 to 1717], shall not apply in the case of

    1705].
      (4) Rights or benefits which, under this subsection, are to be
    determined with reference to other provisions of law shall be
    determined with reference to such provisions of law as in force on
    January 3, 1948.
      (5) The money benefit for disability or death shall be paid only
    to the person entitled thereto, or to his legal or natural guardian
    if he has one, and shall not upon death of the person so entitled
    survive for the benefit of his estate or any other person.
      (6) The benefit of a minor or of an incompetent person who has no
    natural or legal guardian may, in the discretion of the Secretary
    of Labor, be paid, in whole or in such part as he may determine for
    and on behalf of such minor or incompetent directly to the person
    or institution caring for, supporting, or having custody of such
    minor or incompetent.
      (7) No person, except a widow or a child, shall be entitled to
    benefits for disability with respect to himself, and to death
    benefits on account of the death of another.
      (8) If a civilian American citizen or his dependent receives or
    has received from the United States any payments on account of the
    same injury or death, or from his employer, in the form of wages,
    or payments in lieu of wages, or in any form of support or
    compensation (including workmen's compensation) in respect to the
    same objects, the benefits under this section shall be diminished
    by the amount of such payments in the following manner: (A)
    Benefits on account of injury or disability shall be reduced by the
    amount of payments to the injured person on account of the same
    injury or disability; and (B) benefits on account of death shall be
    reduced by the amount of payments to the dependents of the deceased
    civilian American citizen on account of the same death.
      (9) This subsection shall take effect as of December 7, 1941, and
    the right of individuals to benefits shall be held to have begun to
    accrue as though this subsection had been in effect as of such
    date.
      (10) No benefits provided by this subsection for injury,
    disability, or death shall accrue to any person who, without regard
    to this subsection, is entitled to or has received benefits for the
    same injury, disability, or death under such Act of December 2,
    1942, as amended [42 U.S.C. 1701 to 1717].

    person to whom benefits have been paid, or are payable, under the
    Federal Employees' Compensation Act [5 U.S.C. 8101 et seq.], or any
    extension thereof, by reason of disability or death of an employee
    of the United States suffered after capture, detention, or other
    restraint by an enemy of the United States, when such disability or
    death is deemed, in the administration of the Federal Employees'
    Compensation Act to have resulted from injury occurring while in
    the performance of duty, under subsection (b) of section 5 of the
    Act entitled "An Act to amend the Act entitled 'An Act to provide
    compensation for employees of the United States suffering injuries
    while in the performance of their duties, and for other purposes',
    as amended", approved July 28, 1945, as amended.

    subsequent to June 25, 1950, during which he was held by any such
    hostile force as a prisoner, internee, hostage, or in any other
    capacity, or remained in hiding to avoid being captured or interned
    by any such hostile force.
      (3) The detention benefit allowed to any person under the
    provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be at the rate
    of $60 for each calendar month during which such person was at
    least eighteen years of age and at the rate of $25 per month for
    each calendar month during which such person was less than eighteen

    shall be certified to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment out
    of funds appropriated pursuant to this subsection, and shall be
    paid by the Secretary of the Treasury to the person entitled

-STATUTE-
    (a) Reimbursement for services furnished members of armed services

    by the personnel of any such Philippine organization, for
    reimbursement of expenditures incurred, or for payment of the fair

      educational, medical, or welfare work
      Any such religious organization or its personnel functioning in

    to replace the hospital's facilities and capacity equal to that
    which existed at the time of the outbreak of the war, irrespective
    of what disposition was made subsequently of the land, buildings,
    and contents.
    (d) Determination of claims
      Claims filed pursuant to subsection (b) shall be determined and
    paid upon the basis of postwar cost of replacement which shall be
    ascertained by the War Claims Commission. In making such
    determinations the Commission shall utilize but not be limited to
    the factual information and evidence contained in the records of
    the Philippine War Damage Commission; the technical advice of

    the necessary investigation, study, and establishment of procedures
    in order to determine the replacement costs of the claims to be
    filed under subsections (b) and (c), using as a basis for beginning

    already filed and are eligible to be paid under the terms of
    subsection (a) of this section.

    Philippines, such money shall be paid upon request of such
    organization to its affiliate in the United States: Provided, That
    all money thus paid to such affiliated religious organization in
    the United States shall be used by such affiliate for the purpose
    of restoring the educational, medical, and welfare facilities
    described in subsections (b) and (c) and located in the
    Philippines.
    (g) Claims of internees and prisoners of war unaffected
      The Commission shall expedite the payments under this section

    and prisoners of war filed before March 31, 1953, pursuant to the
    provisions of sections 5 and 6 of this title [sections 2004 and

    Philippines to members of the Armed Forces of the United States or
    to civilian American citizens shall be compensated from the War
    Claims Fund (A) for expenditures incurred, or for payment of the
    fair value of supplies used by such organization, for the purpose
    of furnishing such relief and (B) for loss and damage sustained as
    a consequence of the war to its schools, colleges, universities,
    scientific observatories, hospitals, dispensaries, orphanages, and
    other property or facilities connected with its educational,
    medical, or welfare work. No payments shall be made to any
    organization under this subsection if such organization has
    received an award under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, and
    no payments shall be made to any organization pursuant to clause
    (B) of this paragraph unless such organization has received an
    award for war damages from the Philippine War Damage Commission
    under the provisions of the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946,
    as amended [sections 1751 to 1806 of this Appendix].
      (2) The Commission is authorized to receive, determine according
    to law, and provide for the payment of claims filed under this

    subsection shall be certified to the Secretary of the Treasury for
    payment out of the War Claims Fund. All payments under this
    subsection shall be made to an organization or individual in the
    United States designated by the claimant, and, in the case of
    claims under clause (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection such
    payments shall be used for the purpose of restoring the
    educational, medical, and welfare facilities described in such
    clause.
      (3) Claims for benefits under this subsection must be filed
    within six months after the date of enactment of this subsection
    [Aug. 6, 1956]. The Commission shall complete its determination
    with respect to each claim filed under this subsection at the
    earliest practicable date, but in no event later than one year
    after the date on which such claim was filed.
      (4) Claims filed pursuant to clause (B) of paragraph (1) of this
    subsection shall be determined and paid upon the basis of postwar
    cost of replacement for the twelve-month period ending October 1,
    1952, as ascertained by the Commission.

    this Appendix] or as may be provided hereafter by the Congress.
    (b) Estimation and certification to Treasury of total amount
      necessary under section 2004(f)
      Before August 1, 1956, the Secretary of Labor shall estimate and

    such amount, and the amount so determined shall be certified to the
    Secretary of the Treasury. Such certification shall be made on or
    before September 1, 1956. The Secretary of the Treasury shall then
    transfer from the War Claims Fund to the general fund of the

      necessary under section 2003(c)

    section 4(c) of this title [section 2003(c) of this Appendix]. If
    the President approves the amount so estimated as reasonably
    accurate, the total amount so estimated and approved shall be
    certified to the Secretary of the Treasury; if the President does
    not so approve, he shall determine such amount, and the amount so
    determined shall be certified to the Secretary of the Treasury.
    Such certification shall be made on or before September 1, 1956.
    The Secretary of the Treasury shall then transfer from the War
    Claims Fund to the general fund of the Treasury a sum equal to the
    total amount certified to him under this subsection.
    (d) Certification to Treasury of total canceled obligations under
      section 2003(b)(1)
      On or before August 1, 1956, the Secretary of State is authorized
    and directed to certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the total
    amount of all obligations canceled pursuant to the provisions of
    section 4(b)(1) of this title [section 2003(b)(1) of this
    Appendix]. The Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer from the
    war claims fund to the general fund of the Treasury an amount equal
    to the total amount so certified.
    (e) Authorization of appropriations for Commission's work
      There are hereby authorized to be appropriated, out of any money
    in the war claims fund, such sums as may be necessary to enable the

      installment shall be paid in an amount equal to $500 plus 66 2/3 
      per centum of the amount of such claim allowed in excess of $500.

      occurring in the Commonwealth of the Philippines shall not be
      allowed except on behalf of nationals of the United States who
      have received no payment, and certify under oath or affirmation

      claim was filed thereunder: Provided further, That such loss,
      destruction, or damage must have occurred, as a direct
      consequence of (1) military operations of war or (2) special
      measures directed against property in such countries or
      territories during the respective periods specified, because of
      the enemy or alleged enemy character of the owner, which property
      was owned, directly or indirectly, by a national of the United
      States at the time of such loss, damage or destruction;
        (b) damage to, or loss or destruction of, ships or ship cargoes
      directly or indirectly owned by a national of the United States
      at the time such damage, loss, or destruction occurred, which was
      a direct consequence of military action by Germany or Japan
      during the period beginning September 1, 1939, and ending
      September 2, 1945; no award shall be made under this subsection
      in favor of any insurer or reinsurer as assignee or otherwise as
      successor in interest to the right of the insured;

      losses of ships directly or indirectly owned by a national of the
      United States at the time of the loss, damage, or destruction of

      which insured losses were a direct consequence of military action
      by Germany or Japan during the period beginning September 1,
      1939, and ending September 2, 1945; such net losses shall be
      determined by deducting from the aggregate of all payments made

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2017l. Payment of awards; priorities; limitations

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Secretary of the Treasury shall pay out of the War Claims
    Fund on account of award certified by the Commission pursuant to
    this title [sections 2017 to 2017p of this Appendix] as follows and
    in the following order of priority:
      (1) Payment in full of awards made pursuant to section 202(d)(1)
    and (2) [section 2017a(d)(1) and (2) of this Appendix], and
    thereafter of any award made pursuant to section 202(a) [section
    2017a(a) of this Appendix] to any claimant (A) certified to the
    Commission by the Small Business Administration as having been, on
    the date of loss, damage, or destruction, a small business concern
    within the meaning now set forth in the Small Business Act, as
    amended [15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.], or (B) determined by the
    Commission to have been, on the date of loss, damage, or
    destruction, a nonprofit organization operated exclusively for the
    promotion of social welfare, religious, charitable, or educational
    purposes.
      (2) Thereafter, payments from time to time on account of the
    other awards made pursuant to section 202 [section 2017a of this
    Appendix] in an amount which shall be the same for each award or in
    the amount of the award, whichever is less. The total payment made
    pursuant to this paragraph on account of any award shall not exceed
    $10,000.
      (3) Thereafter, payments from time to time on account of the
    other awards made to individuals and corporations pursuant to
    section 202 [section 2017a of this Appendix] and not compensated in
    full under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection in an amount
    which shall be the same for each award or in the amount of the
    award, whichever is less. The total payment pursuant to this
    paragraph on account of any award shall not exceed $35,000.
      (4) Thereafter, payments from time to time on account of the
    unpaid balance of each remaining award made pursuant to section 202
    [section 2017a of this Appendix] or recertified pursuant to
    subsection (b) of section 209 [section 2017h of this Appendix]
    which shall bear to such unpaid balance the same proportion as the
    total amount in the War Claims Fund and available for distribution
    at the time such payments are made bears to the aggregate unpaid
    balances of all such awards. No payment made pursuant to this
    paragraph on account of any award shall exceed the unpaid balance
    of such award. Payments heretofore made under section 310 of title
    III of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949, as amended
    [22 U.S.C. 1641i], on awards made against the Government of Hungary
    under section 303(1) of title III of the International Claims
    Settlement Act of 1949, as amended [22 U.S.C. 1641b(1)], and
    recertified under subsection (b) of section 209 [section 2017h(b)
    of this Appendix], shall be considered as payments under this
    paragraph and no payment shall be made on any recertified award
    until the percentage of distribution on awards made under section
    202 [section 2017a of this Appendix] exceeds the corresponding
    percentage of distribution on such recertified award: Provided,
    That no payment made on awards recertified under subsection (b) of
    section 209 [section 2017h(b) of this Appendix] shall exceed 40 per
    centum of the amount of the award recertified.
      (b) Such payments, and applications for such payments, shall be
    made in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary of the
    Treasury shall prescribe.
      (c) For the purpose of making any such payments, other than under
    section 213(a)(1) [subsec. (a)(1) of this section], an "award"
    shall be deemed to mean the aggregate of all awards certified for
    payment in favor of the same claimant.
      (d) If any person to whom any payment is to be made pursuant to
    this title [sections 2017 to 2017p of this Appendix] is deceased or
    is under a legal disability, payment shall be made to his legal
    representative, except that if any payment to be made is not over
    $1,000 and there is no qualified executor or administrator, payment
    may be made to the person or persons found by the Secretary of the
    Treasury to be entitled thereto, without the necessity of
    compliance with the requirements of law with respect to the
    administration of estates.
      (e) Payment on account of any award pursuant to this title
    [sections 2017 to 2017p of this Appendix] shall not, unless such
    payment is for the full amount of the award, extinguish any rights
    against any foreign government for the unpaid balance of the award.
      (f) Payments made under this section on account of any award for
    loss, damage, or destruction occurring in the Commonwealth of the
    Philippines shall not exceed the amount paid on account of awards
    in the same amount under the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946
    [sections 1751 to 1806 of this Appendix].

    DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT OF 1950
    ACT SEPT. 8, 1950, CH. 932, 64 STAT. 798

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2062. Declaration of policy

-STATUTE-
    (a) Findings
      Congress finds that - 
        (1) the security of the United States is dependent on the
      ability of the domestic industrial base to supply materials and
      services for the national defense and to prepare for and respond
      to military conflicts, natural or man-caused disasters, or acts
      of terrorism within the United States;
        (2) to ensure the vitality of the domestic industrial base,
      actions are needed - 
          (A) to promote industrial resources preparedness in the event
        of domestic or foreign threats to the security of the United
        States;
          (B) to support continuing improvements in industrial
        efficiency and responsiveness;
          (C) to provide for the protection and restoration of domestic
        critical infrastructure operations under emergency conditions;
        and
          (D) to respond to actions taken outside of the United States
        that could result in reduced supplies of strategic and critical
        materials, including energy, necessary for national defense and
        the general economic well-being of the United States;

        (3) in order to provide for the national security, the national
      defense preparedness effort of the United States Government
      requires - 
          (A) preparedness programs to respond to both domestic
        emergencies and international threats to national defense;
          (B) measures to improve the domestic industrial base for
        national defense;
          (C) the development of domestic productive capacity to meet -
        
            (i) essential national defense needs that can result from
          emergency conditions; and
            (ii) unique technological requirements; and

          (D) the diversion of certain materials and facilities from
        ordinary use to national defense purposes, when national
        defense needs cannot otherwise be satisfied in a timely
        fashion;

        (4) to meet the requirements referred to in this subsection,
      this Act [sections 2061 to 2170, 2171, and 2172 of this Appendix]
      provides the President with an array of authorities to shape
      national defense preparedness programs and to take appropriate
      steps to maintain and enhance the domestic industrial base;
        (5) in order to ensure national defense preparedness, it is
      necessary and appropriate to assure the availability of domestic
      energy supplies for national defense needs;
        (6) to further assure the adequate maintenance of the domestic
      industrial base, to the maximum extent possible, domestic energy
      supplies should be augmented through reliance on renewable energy
      sources (including solar, geothermal, wind, and biomass sources),
      more efficient energy storage and distribution technologies, and
      energy conservation measures;
        (7) much of the industrial capacity that is relied upon by the
      United States Government for military production and other
      national defense purposes is deeply and directly influenced by - 
          (A) the overall competitiveness of the industrial economy of
        the United States; and
          (B) the ability of industries in the United States, in
        general, to produce internationally competitive products and
        operate profitably while maintaining adequate research and
        development to preserve competitiveness with respect to
        military and civilian production; and

        (8) the inability of industries in the United States,
      especially smaller subcontractors and suppliers, to provide vital
      parts and components and other materials would impair the ability
      to sustain the Armed Forces of the United States in combat for
      longer than a short period.
    (b) Statement of policy
      It is the policy of the United States that - 
        (1) to ensure the adequacy of productive capacity and supply,
      Federal departments and agencies that are responsible for
      national defense acquisition should continuously assess the
      capability of the domestic industrial base to satisfy production
      requirements under both peacetime and emergency conditions,
      specifically evaluating the availability of adequate production
      sources, including subcontractors and suppliers, materials,
      skilled labor, and professional and technical personnel;
        (2) every effort should be made to foster cooperation between
      the defense and commercial sectors for research and development
      and for acquisition of materials, components, and equipment;
        (3) plans and programs to carry out the purposes of this Act
      [sections 2061 to 2170, 2171, and 2172 of this Appendix] should
      be undertaken with due consideration for promoting efficiency and
      competition;
        (4) in providing United States Government financial assistance
      under this Act [sections 2061 to 2170, 2171, and 2172 of this
      Appendix] to correct a domestic industrial base shortfall, the
      President should give consideration to the creation or
      maintenance of production sources that will remain economically
      viable after such assistance has ended;
        (5) authorities under this Act [sections 2061 to 2170, 2171,
      and 2172 of this Appendix] should be used to reduce the
      vulnerability of the United States to terrorist attacks, and to
      minimize the damage and assist in the recovery from terrorist
      attacks that occur in the United States;
        (6) in order to ensure productive capacity in the event of an
      attack on the United States, the United States Government should
      encourage the geographic dispersal of industrial facilities in
      the United States to discourage the concentration of such
      productive facilities within limited geographic areas that are
      vulnerable to attack by an enemy of the United States;
        (7) to ensure that essential national defense requirements are
      met, consideration should be given to stockpiling strategic
      materials, to the extent that such stockpiling is economical and
      feasible; and
        (8) in the construction of any industrial facility owned by the
      United States Government, in the rendition of any financial
      assistance by the United States Government for the construction,
      expansion, or improvement of any industrial facility, and in the
      production of goods and services, under this Act [sections 2061
      to 2170, 2171, and 2172 of this Appendix] or any other provision
      of law, each department and agency of the United States
      Government should apply, under the coordination of the Federal
      Emergency Management Agency, when practicable and consistent with
      existing law and the desirability for maintaining a sound
      economy, the principle of geographic dispersal of such facilities
      in the interest of national defense.

    DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT OF 1950

    TITLE I - PRIORITIES AND ALLOCATIONS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2071. Priority in contracts and orders

-STATUTE-
    (a) Allocation of materials, services, and facilities
      The President is hereby authorized (1) to require that
    performance under contracts or orders (other than contracts of
    employment) which he deems necessary or appropriate to promote the
    national defense shall take priority over performance under any
    other contract or order, and, for the purpose of assuring such
    priority, to require acceptance and performance of such contracts
    or orders in preference to other contracts or orders by any person
    he finds to be capable of their performance, and (2) to allocate
    materials, services, and facilities in such manner, upon such
    conditions, and to such extent as he shall deem necessary or
    appropriate to promote the national defense.
    (b) Critical and strategic materials
      The powers granted in this section shall not be used to control
    the general distribution of any material in the civilian market
    unless the President finds (1) that such material is a scarce and
    critical material essential to the national defense, and (2) that
    the requirements of the national defense for such material cannot
    otherwise be met without creating a significant dislocation of the
    normal distribution of such material in the civilian market to such
    a degree as to create appreciable hardship.
    (c) Domestic energy; materials, equipment, and services
      (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act [sections
    2061 to 2170, 2171, and 2172 of this Appendix], the President may,
    by rule or order, require the allocation of, or the priority
    performance under contracts or orders (other than contracts of
    employment) relating to, materials, equipment, and services in
    order to maximize domestic energy supplies if he makes the findings
    required by paragraph (3) of this subsection.
      (2) The authority granted by this subsection may not be used to
    require priority performance of contracts or orders, or to control
    the distribution of any supplies of materials, services, and
    facilities in the marketplace, unless the President finds that - 
        (A) such materials, services, and facilities are scarce,
      critical, and essential - 
          (i) to maintain or expand exploration, production, refining,
        transportation;
          (ii) to conserve energy supplies; or
          (iii) to construct or maintain energy facilities; and

        (B) maintenance or expansion of exploration, production,
      refining, transportation, or conservation of energy supplies or
      the construction and maintenance of energy facilities cannot
      reasonably be accomplished without exercising the authority
      specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection.

      (3) During any period when the authority conferred by this
    subsection is being exercised, the President shall take such action
    as may be appropriate to assure that such authority is being
    exercised in a manner which assures the coordinated administration
    of such authority with any priorities or allocations established
    under subsection (a) of this section and in effect during the same
    period.
    (d) Rules; consultation among agency heads
      The head of each Federal agency to which the President delegates
    authority under this section shall - 
        (1) not later than 270 days after the date of enactment of the
      Defense Production Act Reauthorization of 2009 [Sept. 30, 2009],
      issue final rules, in accordance with section 553 of title 5,
      United States Code, that establish standards and procedures by
      which the priorities and allocations authority under this section
      is used to promote the national defense, under both emergency and
      nonemergency conditions; and
        (2) as appropriate and to the extent practicable, consult with
      the heads of other Federal agencies to develop a consistent and
      unified Federal priorities and allocations system.

    TITLE III - EXPANSION OF PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY AND SUPPLY

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2091. Presidential authorization for the national defense

-STATUTE-
    (a) Expediting production and deliveries or services
      (1) Authorized activities
        To reduce current or projected shortfalls of industrial
      resources, critical technology items, or essential materials
      needed for national defense purposes, subject to such regulations
      as the President may prescribe, the President may authorize a
      guaranteeing agency to provide guarantees of loans by private
      institutions for the purpose of financing any contractor,
      subcontractor, provider of critical infrastructure, or other
      person in support of production capabilities or supplies that are
      deemed by the guaranteeing agency to be necessary to create,
      maintain, expedite, expand, protect, or restore production and
      deliveries or services essential to the national defense.
      (2) Presidential determinations required
        Except during a period of national emergency declared by
      Congress or the President, a loan guarantee may be entered into
      under this section only if the President determines that - 
          (A) the loan guarantee is for an activity that supports the
        production or supply of an industrial resource, critical
        technology item, or material that is essential for national
        defense purposes;
          (B) without a loan guarantee, credit is not available to the
        loan applicant under reasonable terms or conditions sufficient
        to finance the activity;
          (C) the loan guarantee is the most cost effective, expedient,
        and practical alternative for meeting the needs of the Federal
        Government;
          (D) the prospective earning power of the loan applicant and
        the character and value of the security pledged provide a
        reasonable assurance of repayment of the loan to be guaranteed;
          (E) the loan to be guaranteed bears interest at a rate
        determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be reasonable,
        taking into account the then-current average yield on
        outstanding obligations of the United States with remaining
        periods of maturity comparable to the maturity of the loan;
          (F) the loan agreement for the loan to be guaranteed provides
        that no provision of the loan agreement may be amended or
        waived without the consent of the fiscal agent of the United
        States for the guarantee; and
          (G) the loan applicant has provided or will provide - 
            (i) an assurance of repayment, as determined by the
          President; and
            (ii) security - 
              (I) in the form of a performance bond, insurance,
            collateral, or other means acceptable to the fiscal agent
            of the United States; and
              (II) in an amount equal to not less than 20 percent of
            the amount of the loan.
      (3) Limitations on loans
        Loans under this section may be - 
          (A) made or guaranteed under the authority of this section
        only to the extent that an appropriations Act - 
            (i) provides, in advance, budget authority for the cost of
          such guarantees, as defined in section 502 of the Federal
          Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. 661a); and
            (ii) establishes a limitation on the total loan principal
          that may be guaranteed; and

          (B) made without regard to the limitations of existing law,
        other than section 1341 of title 31, United States Code.
    (b) Fiscal agents of the United States
      (1) In general
        Any Federal agency or any Federal reserve bank, when designated
      by the President, is hereby authorized to act, on behalf of any
      guaranteeing agency, as fiscal agent of the United States in the
      making of such contracts of guarantee and in otherwise carrying
      out the purposes of this section.
      (2) Funds
        All such funds as may be necessary to enable any fiscal agent
      described in paragraph (1) to carry out any guarantee made by it
      on behalf of any guaranteeing agency shall be supplied and
      disbursed by or under authority from such guaranteeing agency.
      (3) Limit on liability
        No fiscal agent described in paragraph (1) shall have any
      responsibility or accountability, except as agent in taking any
      action pursuant to or under authority of this section.
      (4) Reimbursements
        Each fiscal agent described in paragraph (1) shall be
      reimbursed by each guaranteeing agency for all expenses and
      losses incurred by such fiscal agent in acting as agent on behalf
      of such guaranteeing agency, including, notwithstanding any other
      provision of law, attorneys' fees and expenses of litigation.
    (c) Oversight
      (1) In general
        All actions and operations of fiscal agents under authority of
      or pursuant to this section shall be subject to the supervision
      of the President, and to such regulations as the President may
      prescribe.
      (2) Other authority
        The President is authorized to prescribe - 
          (A) either specifically or by maximum limits or otherwise,
        rates of interest, guarantee and commitment fees, and other
        charges which may be made in connection with loans, discounts,
        advances, or commitments guaranteed by the guaranteeing
        agencies through fiscal agents under this section; and
          (B) regulations governing the forms and procedures (which
        shall be uniform to the extent practicable) to be utilized in
        connection with such guarantees.
    (d) Aggregate guarantee amounts
      (1) Industrial resource and critical technology shortfalls
        (A) In general
          If the making of any guarantee or obligation of the Federal
        Government under this title [sections 2091 to 2094 of this
        Appendix] relating to a domestic industrial base shortfall
        would cause the aggregate outstanding amount of all guarantees
        for such shortfall to exceed $50,000,000, any such guarantee
        may be made only - 
            (i) if the President has notified the Committee on Banking,
          Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on
          Financial Services of the House of Representatives in writing
          of the proposed guarantee; and
            (ii) after the 30-day period following the date on which
          notice under clause (i) is provided.
        (B) Waivers authorized
          The requirements of subparagraph (A) may be waived - 
            (i) during a period of national emergency declared by
          Congress or the President; or
            (ii) upon a determination by the President, on a
          nondelegable basis, that a specific guarantee is necessary to
          avert an industrial resource or critical technology item
          shortfall that would severely impair national defense
          capability.
      (2) Other limitations
        The authority conferred by this section shall not be used
      primarily to prevent the financial insolvency or bankruptcy of
      any person, unless - 
          (A) the President certifies that the insolvency or bankruptcy
        would have a direct and substantially adverse effect upon
        national defense production; and
          (B) a copy of the certification under subparagraph (A),
        together with a detailed justification thereof, is transmitted
        to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the
        Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of

          (A) the loan is for an activity that supports the production
        or supply of an industrial resource, critical technology item,
        or material that is essential to the national defense;
          (B) without the loan, United States industry cannot
        reasonably be expected to provide the needed capacity,
        technological processes, or materials in a timely manner;
          (C) the loan is the most cost-effective, expedient, and
        practical alternative method for meeting the need;
          (D) the prospective earning power of the loan applicant and
        the character and value of the security pledged provide a

    (d) Aggregate loan amounts
      (1) In general
        If the making of any loan under this section to correct a
      shortfall would cause the aggregate outstanding amount of all
      obligations of the Federal Government under this title [sections
      2091 to 2094 of this Appendix] relating to such shortfall to
      exceed $50,000,000, such loan may be made only -

      (3) Terms of sales
        No commodity purchased under this subsection shall be sold at
      less than - 
          (A) the established ceiling price for such commodity, except
        that minerals, metals, and materials shall not be sold at less
        than the established ceiling price, or the current domestic
        market price, whichever is lower; or
          (B) if no ceiling price has been established, the higher of -
        
            (i) the current domestic market price for such commodity;
          or
            (ii) the minimum sale price established for agricultural
          commodities owned or controlled by the Commodity Credit
          Corporation, as provided in section 407 of the Agricultural
          Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1427).
      (4) Delivery dates
        No purchase or commitment to purchase any imported agricultural
      commodity shall specify a delivery date which is more than 1 year
      after the date of termination of this section.
      (5) Presidential determinations
        Except as provided in paragraph (7), the President may not
      execute a contract under this subsection unless the President
      determines that - 
          (A) the industrial resource, material, or critical technology
        item is essential to the national defense; and
          (B) without Presidential action under this section, United
        States industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the
        capability for the needed industrial resource, material, or
        critical technology item in a timely manner.
      (6) Notification to Congress of shortfall
        (A) In general
          Except as provided in paragraph (7), the President shall
        provide written notice to the Committee on Banking, Housing,
        and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial
        Services of the House of Representatives of a domestic
        industrial base shortfall prior to taking action under this
        subsection to remedy the shortfall. The notice shall include
        the determinations made by the President under paragraph (5).
        (B) Aggregate amounts
          If the taking of any action under this subsection to correct
        a domestic industrial base shortfall would cause the aggregate
        outstanding amount of all such actions for such shortfall to
        exceed $50,000,000, the action or actions may be taken only
        after the 30-day period following the date on which the
        Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate
        and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of
        Representatives have been notified in writing of the proposed
        action.
      (7) Waivers authorized
        The requirements of paragraphs (1) through (6) may be waived - 
          (A) during a period of national emergency declared by the
        Congress or the President; or
          (B) upon a determination by the President, on a nondelegable
        basis, that action is necessary to avert an industrial resource
        or critical technology item shortfall that would severely
        impair national defense capability.
    (b) Exemption for certain limitations
      Subject to the limitations in subsection (a), purchases and
    commitments to purchase and sales under subsection (a) may be made
    without regard to the limitations of existing law (other than
    section 1341 of title 31, United States Code), for such quantities,
    and on such terms and conditions, including advance payments, and
    for such periods, but not extending beyond a date that is not more
    than 10 years from the date on which such purchase, purchase
    commitment, or sale was initially made, as the President deems
    necessary, except that purchases or commitments to purchase
    involving higher than established ceiling prices (or if no such
    established ceiling prices exist, currently prevailing market
    prices) or anticipated loss on resale shall not be made, unless it
    is determined that supply of the materials could not be effectively
    increased at lower prices or on terms more favorable to the
    Government, or that such purchases are necessary to assure the
    availability to the United States of overseas supplies.
    (c) Presidential findings
      (1) In general
        The President may take the actions described in paragraph (2),
      if the President finds that - 
          (A) under generally fair and equitable ceiling prices, for
        any raw or nonprocessed material, there will result a decrease
        in supplies from high-cost sources of such material, and that
        the continuation of such supplies is necessary to carry out the
        objectives of this title [sections 2091 to 2094 of this
        Appendix]; or
          (B) an increase in cost of transportation is temporary in
        character and threatens to impair maximum production or supply
        in any area at stable prices of any materials.
      (2) Subsidy payments authorized
        Upon a finding under paragraph (1), the President may make
      provision for subsidy payments on any such domestically produced
      material, other than an agricultural commodity, in such amounts
      and in such manner (including purchases of such material and its
      resale at a loss), and on such terms and conditions, as the
      President determines to be necessary to ensure that supplies from
      such high-cost sources are continued, or that maximum production
      or supply in such area at stable prices of such materials is
      maintained, as the case may be.
    (d) Incidental authority
      The procurement power granted to the President by this section
    shall include the power to transport and store and have processed
    and refined any materials procured under this section.
    (e) Installation of equipment in industrial facilities
      (1) Installation authorized
        If the President determines that such action will aid the
      national defense, the President is authorized - 
          (A) to procure and install additional equipment, facilities,
        processes or improvements to plants, factories, and other
        industrial facilities owned by the Federal Government;
          (B) to procure and install equipment owned by the Federal
        Government in plants, factories, and other industrial
        facilities owned by private persons;
          (C) to provide for the modification or expansion of privately
        owned facilities, including the modification or improvement of
        production processes, when taking actions under section 301
        [section 2091 of this Appendix], 302 [section 2092 of this
        Appendix], or this section; and
          (D) to sell or otherwise transfer equipment owned by the
        Federal Government and installed under this subsection to the
        owners of such plants, factories, or other industrial
        facilities.
      (2) Indemnification
        The owner of any plant, factory, or other industrial facility
      that receives equipment owned by the Federal Government under
      this section shall agree - 
          (A) to waive any claim against the United States under
        section 107 or 113 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
        Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9607 and
        9613); and
          (B) to indemnify the United States against any claim
        described in paragraph (1) made by a third party that arises
        out of the presence or use of equipment owned by the Federal
        Government.
    (f) Excess metals, minerals, and materials
      (1) In general
        Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
      metals, minerals, and materials acquired pursuant to this section
      which, in the judgment of the President, are excess to the needs
      of programs under this Act [sections 2061 to 2170, 2171, and 2172
      of this Appendix], shall be transferred to the National Defense
      Stockpile established by the Strategic and Critical Materials
      Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.), when the President deems
      such action to be in the public interest.
      (2) Transfers at no charge
        Transfers made pursuant to this subsection shall be made
      without charge against or reimbursement from funds appropriated
      for the purposes of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock
      Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.), except that costs incident to
      such transfer, other than acquisition costs, shall be paid or
      reimbursed from such funds.
    (g) Substitutes
      When, in the judgement of the President, it will aid the national
    defense, the President may make provision for the development of
    substitutes for strategic and critical materials, critical
    components, critical technology items, and other industrial
    resources.

    contingent liability upon the United States, such liability shall
    be considered an obligation against the Fund.

-MISC2-
                PART I - PURPOSE, POLICY AND IMPLEMENTATION            
      Section 101. Purpose. This order delegates authorities and
    addresses national defense industrial resource policies and
    programs under the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended ("the
    Act"), except for the amendments to Title III of the Act [50 U.S.C.
    App. 2091 et seq.] in the Energy Security Act of 1980 [Pub. L. 96-
    294] and telecommunication authorities under Executive Order No.
    12472 [42 U.S.C. 5195 note].
      Sec. 102. Policy. The United States must have an industrial and
    technology base capable of meeting national defense requirements,
    and capable of contributing to the technological superiority of its
    defense equipment in peacetime and in times of national emergency.
    The domestic industrial and technological base is the foundation
    for national defense preparedness. The authorities provided in the
    Act shall be used to strengthen this base and to ensure it is
    capable of responding to all threats to the national security of
    the United States.
      Sec. 103. General Functions. Federal departments and agencies
    responsible for defense acquisition (or for industrial resources
    needed to support defense acquisition) shall:
      (a) Identify requirements for the full spectrum of national
    security emergencies, including military, industrial, and essential
    civilian demand;
      (b) Assess continually the capability of the domestic industrial
    and technological base to satisfy requirements in peacetime and
    times of national emergency, specifically evaluating the
    availability of adequate industrial resource and production
    sources, including subcontractors and suppliers, materials, skilled
    labor, and professional and technical personnel;
      (c) Be prepared, in the event of a potential threat to the
    security of the United States, to take actions necessary to ensure
    the availability of adequate industrial resources and production
    capability, including services and critical technology for national
    defense requirements;
      (d) Improve the efficiency and responsiveness, to defense
    requirements, of the domestic industrial base; and
      (e) Foster cooperation between the defense and commercial sectors
    for research and development and for acquisition of materials,
    components, and equipment to enhance industrial base efficiency and
    responsiveness.
      Sec. 104. Implementation. (a) The National Security Council is
    the principal forum for consideration and resolution of national
    security resource preparedness policy.
      (b) The Secretary of Homeland Security ("the Secretary") shall:
        (1) Serve as an advisor to the National Security Council on
      issues of national security resource preparedness and on the use
      of the authorities and functions delegated by this order;
        (2) Provide for the central coordination of the plans and
      programs incident to authorities and functions delegated under
      this order, and provide guidance and procedures approved by the
      Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs to the
      Federal departments and agencies under this order;
        (3) Establish procedures, in consultation with Federal
      departments and agencies assigned functions under this order, to
      resolve in a timely and effective manner conflicts and issues
      that may arise in implementing the authorities and functions
      delegated under this order; and
        (4) Report to the President periodically concerning all program
      activities conducted pursuant to this order.
      (c) The head of every Federal department and agency assigned
    functions under this order shall ensure that the performance of
    these functions is consistent with National Security Council policy
    and guidelines.

    and the keeping of such records by, make such inspection of the
    books, records, and other writings, premises or property of, and
    take the sworn testimony of, and administer oaths and affirmations
    to, any person as may be necessary or appropriate, in his
    discretion, to the enforcement or the administration of this Act
    and the regulations or orders issued thereunder. The authority of
    the President under this section includes the authority to obtain
    information in order to perform industry studies assessing the
    capabilities of the United States industrial base to support the
    national defense. The President shall issue regulations insuring
    that the authority of this subsection will be utilized only after
    the scope and purpose of the investigation, inspection, or inquiry
    to be made have been defined by competent authority, and it is
    assured that no adequate and authoritative data are available from
    any Federal or other responsible agency. In case of contumacy by,
    or refusal to obey a subpoena served upon, any person referred to
    in this subsection, the district court of the United States for any
    district in which such person is found or resides or transacts
    business, upon application by the President, shall have
    jurisdiction to issue an order requiring such person to appear and
    give testimony or to appear and produce documents, or both; and any
    failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such
    court as a contempt thereof.
      (b) The production of a person's books, records, or other
    documentary evidence shall not be required at any place other than
    the place where such person usually keeps them, if, prior to the
    return date specified in the regulations, subpoena, or other
    document issued with respect thereto, such person furnishes the
    President with a true copy of such books, records, or other
    documentary evidence (certified by such person under oath to be a
    true and correct copy) or enters into a stipulation with the
    President as to the information contained in such books, records,
    or other documentary evidence. Witnesses shall be paid the same
    fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the
    United States.
      (c) Any person who willfully performs any act prohibited or
    willfully fails to perform any act required by the above provisions
    of this section, or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder,
    shall upon conviction be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned
    for not more than one year or both.
      (d) Information obtained under this section which the President
    deems confidential or with reference to which a request for
    confidential treatment is made by the person furnishing such
    information shall not be published or disclosed unless the
    President determines that the withholding thereof is contrary to
    the interest of the national defense, and any person willfully
    violating this provision shall, upon conviction, be fined not more
    than $10,000, or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.
      (e) Any person subpoenaed under this section shall have the right
    to make a record of his testimony and to be represented by counsel.

    respect to any right, liability, or offense incurred or committed
    prior to the termination date of such title or of such rule,
    regulation, or order. No costs shall be assessed against the United

      section or a plan of action adopted under any such agreement and
      approved in accordance with this section. The defense established

      Commission; content; annual report to Congress and President by

    injure small business, or otherwise promote undue concentration of
    economic power in the course of the administration of this section.
    Such surveys shall include studies of the voluntary agreements and
    plans of action authorized by this section. The Attorney General
    shall (after consultation with the Federal Trade Commission) submit
    to the Congress and the President at least once every year reports
    setting forth the results of such studies of voluntary agreements
    and plans of action.

    any individual designated under subsection (c)(2), where the court
    determines that such transcripts, agreements, items, or other
    records have been improperly withheld from the complainant. In such
    a case the court shall determine the matter de novo, and may
    examine the contents of such transcripts, agreements, items, or
    other records in camera to determine whether such transcripts,
    agreements, items, or other records or any parts thereof shall be
    withheld under any of the exemption or suspension provisions
    referred to in this subsection, and the burden is on the Attorney
    General, the Federal Trade Commission, or such designated
    individual, as the case may be, to sustain its action.
    (n) Exemption from Advisory Committee Act provisions
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Federal Advisory

    an emergency to carry out a voluntary agreement or plan of action
    authorized and approved in accordance with this section. Such
    defense shall not release the party asserting it from any
    obligation under applicable law to mitigate damages to the greatest

        any covered transaction, or pursuant to a unilateral
        notification initiated under subparagraph (D) with respect to
        any covered transaction, the President, acting through the
        Committee -

          Committee.
          (iii) Continuing discussions
            A request for withdrawal under clause (ii) shall not be
          construed to preclude any party to the covered transaction
          from continuing informal discussions with the Committee or
          any member thereof regarding possible resubmission for review
          pursuant to this paragraph.

            remedies or enforcement tools available to address such
            breach.

            security of the United States and that threat has not been
            mitigated during or prior to the review of a covered

            security, and that such impairment to national security has
            not been mitigated by assurances provided or renewed with
            the approval of the Committee, as described in subsection
            (l), during the review period under paragraph (1); or

      Pub. L. 106-113, div. B, Sec. 1000(a)(7) [div. B, title XII,
    subtitle D], Nov. 29, 1999, 113 Stat. 1536, 1501A-500, provided

      "SEC. 1241. SHORT TITLE.
      "This subtitle may be cited as the 'Defense Offsets Disclosure
    Act of 1999'.

      "SEC. 1242. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.
      "(a) Findings. - Congress makes the following findings:
        "(1) A fair business environment is necessary to advance
      international trade, economic stability, and development
      worldwide, is beneficial for American workers and businesses, and
      is in the United States national interest.
        "(2) In some cases, mandated offset requirements can cause
      economic distortions in international defense trade and undermine
      fairness and competitiveness, and may cause particular harm to
      small- and medium-sized businesses.
        "(3) The use of offsets may lead to increasing dependence on
      foreign suppliers for the production of United States weapons
      systems.
        "(4) The offset demands required by some purchasing countries,
      including some close allies of the United States, equal or exceed
      the value of the base contract they are intended to offset,
      mitigating much of the potential economic benefit of the exports.
        "(5) Offset demands often unduly distort the prices of defense
      contracts.
        "(6) In some cases, United States contractors are required to
      provide indirect offsets which can negatively impact nondefense
      industrial sectors.
        "(7) Unilateral efforts by the United States to prohibit
      offsets may be impractical in the current era of globalization
      and would severely hinder the competitiveness of the United
      States defense industry in the global market.
        "(8) The development of global standards to manage and restrict
      demands for offsets would enhance United States efforts to
      mitigate the negative impact of offsets.
      "(b) Declaration of Policy. - It is the policy of the United
    States to monitor the use of offsets in international defense
    trade, to promote fairness in such trade, and to ensure that
    foreign participation in the production of United States weapons
    systems does not harm the economy of the United States.

        "(2) the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the
      Secretary of Commerce, and the United States Trade
      Representative, or their designees, should raise with other
      industrialized nations at every suitable venue the need for
      transparency and reasonable standards to govern the role of
      offsets in international defense trade;
        "(3) the United States Government should enter into discussions
      regarding the establishment of multilateral standards for the use
      of offsets in international defense trade through the appropriate
      multilateral fora, including such organizations as the
      Transatlantic Economic Partnership, the Wassenaar Arrangement,
      the G-8, and the World Trade Organization; and

      subsidies, such as export financing, by various countries to
      support defense trade.

    Sec. 2181. Congressional declaration of policy

-STATUTE-
      It is recognized that the continued dependence on overseas
    sources of supply for strategic or critical minerals and metals
    during periods of threatening world conflict or of political
    instability within those nations controlling the sources of supply
    of such materials gravely endangers the present and future economy
    and security of the United States. It is therefore declared to be
    the policy of the Congress that each department and agency of the
    Federal Government charged with responsibilities concerning the
    discovery, development, production, and acquisition of strategic or
    critical minerals and metals shall undertake to decrease further
    and to eliminate where possible the dependency of the United States
    on overseas sources of supply of each such material.

-EXPCITE-
    TITLE 50, APPENDIX - WAR AND NATIONAL DEFENSE
    EXPORT REGULATION

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2401. Congressional findings

-STATUTE-
      The Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The ability of United States citizens to engage in
      international commerce is a fundamental concern of United States
      policy.
        (2) Exports contribute significantly to the economic well-being
      of the United States and the stability of the world economy by
      increasing employment and production in the United States, and by
      earning foreign exchange, thereby contributing favorably to the
      trade balance. The restriction of exports from the United States
      can have serious adverse effects on the balance of payments and
      on domestic employment, particularly when restrictions applied by
      the United States are more extensive than those imposed by other
      countries.
        (3) It is important for the national interest of the United
      States that both the private sector and the Federal Government
      place a high priority on exports, consistent with the economic,
      security, and foreign policy objectives of the United States.
        (4) The availability of certain materials at home and abroad
      varies so that the quantity and composition of United States
      exports and their distribution among importing countries may
      affect the welfare of the domestic economy and may have an
      important bearing upon fulfillment of the foreign policy of the
      United States.
        (5) Exports of goods or technology without regard to whether
      they make a significant contribution to the military potential of
      individual countries or combinations of countries may adversely
      affect the national security of the United States.
        (6) Uncertainty of export control policy can inhibit the
      efforts of United States business and work to the detriment of
      the overall attempt to improve the trade balance of the United
      States.
        (7) Unreasonable restrictions on access to world supplies can
      cause worldwide political and economic instability, interfere
      with free international trade, and retard the growth and
      development of nations.
        (8) It is important that the administration of export controls
      imposed for national security purposes give special emphasis to
      the need to control exports of technology (and goods which
      contribute significantly to the transfer of such technology)
      which could make a significant contribution to the military
      potential of any country or combination of countries which would
      be detrimental to the national security of the United States.
        (9) Minimization of restrictions on exports of agricultural
      commodities and products is of critical importance to the
      maintenance of a sound agricultural sector, to a positive
      contribution to the balance of payments, to reducing the level of
      Federal expenditures for agricultural support programs, and to
      United States cooperation in efforts to eliminate malnutrition
      and world hunger.
        (10) It is important that the administration of export controls
      imposed for foreign policy purposes give special emphasis to the
      need to control exports of goods and substances hazardous to the
      public health and the environment which are banned or severely
      restricted for use in the United States, and which, if exported,
      could affect the international reputation of the United States as
      a responsible trading partner.
        (11) Availability to controlled countries of goods and
      technology from foreign sources is a fundamental concern of the
      United States and should be eliminated through negotiations and
      other appropriate means whenever possible.
        (12) Excessive dependence of the United States, its allies, or
      countries sharing common strategic objectives with the United
      States, on energy and other critical resources from potential
      adversaries can be harmful to the mutual and individual security
      of all those countries.

      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to
    advance United States foreign policy and protect the national and
    economic security of the United States through strengthened and
    coordinated enforcement of United States export control laws and
    enhanced intelligence exchange in support of such enforcement
    efforts, it is hereby ordered as follows:
      Section 1. Policy. Export controls are critical to achieving our

    departments and agencies must coordinate their efforts to detect,
    prevent, disrupt, investigate, and prosecute violations of U.S.
    export control laws, and must share intelligence and law
    enforcement information related to these efforts to the maximum
    extent possible, consistent with national security and applicable
    law.
      Sec. 2. Establishment. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security
    shall establish, within the Department of Homeland Security for

      (c) The Center shall have a Director, who shall be a full-time
    senior officer or employee of the Department of Homeland Security,
    designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Center shall
    have two Deputy Directors, who shall be full-time senior officers
    or employees of the Department of Commerce and the Department of
    Justice, designated by the Secretary of Commerce and the Attorney
    General, respectively, detailed to the Center and reporting to the
    Director. The Center shall also have an Intelligence Community
    Liaison, who shall be a full-time senior officer or employee of the
    Federal Government, designated by the Director of National
    Intelligence, and detailed or assigned to the Center.
      (d) The Center shall have a full-time staff reporting to the
    Director. To the extent permitted by law, executive departments and
    agencies enumerated in subsection (b) of this section are
    encouraged to detail or assign their employees to the Center
    without reimbursement.
      Sec. 3. Functions. The Center shall:
      (a) serve as the primary forum within the Federal Government for
    executive departments and agencies to coordinate and enhance their
    export control enforcement efforts and identify and resolve
    conflicts that have not been otherwise resolved in criminal and
    administrative investigations and actions involving violations of
    U.S. export control laws;
      (b) serve as a conduit between Federal law enforcement agencies
    and the U.S. Intelligence Community for the exchange of information
    related to potential U.S. export control violations;
      (c) serve as a primary point of contact between enforcement
    authorities and agencies engaged in export licensing;
      (d) coordinate law enforcement public outreach activities related
    to U.S. export controls; and
      (e) establish Government-wide statistical tracking capabilities
    for U.S. criminal and administrative export control enforcement
    activities, to be conducted by the Department of Homeland Security
    with information provided by and shared with all relevant
    departments and agencies participating in the Center.
      Sec. 4. Administration. (a) The Department of Homeland Security
    shall operate and provide funding and administrative support for
    the Center to the extent permitted by law and subject to the
    availability of appropriations.
      (b) The Director of the Center shall convene and preside at the
    Center's meetings, determine its agenda, direct the work of the
    Center, and, as appropriate to particular subject matters, organize
    and coordinate subgroups of the Center's members.
      Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) This order shall be implemented
    consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of
    appropriations.
      (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or
    otherwise affect:
      (i) authority granted by law, regulation, Executive Order, or
    Presidential Directive to an executive department, agency, or head
    thereof; or
      (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
    Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
    proposals.
      (c) Nothing in this order shall be construed to provide exclusive
    or primary investigative authority to any agency. Agencies shall
    continue to investigate criminal and administrative export
    violations consistent with their existing authorities, jointly or
    separately, with coordination through the Center to enhance
    enforcement efforts and minimize potential for conflict.
      (d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
    or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in
    equity by any party against the United States, its departments,
    agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any
    other person.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2402. Congressional declaration of policy

-STATUTE-
      The Congress makes the following declarations:
        (1) It is the policy of the United States to minimize
      uncertainties in export control policy and to encourage trade
      with all countries with which the United States has diplomatic or
      trading relations, except those countries with which such trade
      has been determined by the President to be against the national
      interest.
        (2) It is the policy of the United States to use export
      controls only after full consideration of the impact on the
      economy of the United States and only to the extent necessary - 
          (A) to restrict the export of goods and technology which
        would make a significant contribution to the military potential
        of any other country or combination of countries which would
        prove detrimental to the national security of the United
        States;
          (B) to restrict the export of goods and technology where
        necessary to further significantly the foreign policy of the
        United States or to fulfill its declared international
        obligations; and
          (C) to restrict the export of goods where necessary to
        protect the domestic economy from the excessive drain of scarce
        materials and to reduce the serious inflationary impact of
        foreign demand.

        (3) It is the policy of the United States (A) to apply any
      necessary controls to the maximum extent possible in cooperation
      with all nations, and (B) to encourage observance of a uniform
      export control policy by all nations with which the United States
      has defense treaty commitments or common strategic objectives.
        (4) It is the policy of the United States to use its economic
      resources and trade potential to further the sound growth and
      stability of its economy as well as to further its national
      security and foreign policy objectives.
        (5) It is the policy of the United States - 
          (A) to oppose restrictive trade practices or boycotts
        fostered or imposed by foreign countries against other
        countries friendly to the United States or against any United
        States person;
          (B) to encourage and, in specified cases, require United
        States persons engaged in the export of goods or technology or
        other information to refuse to take actions, including
        furnishing information or entering into or implementing
        agreements, which have the effect of furthering or supporting
        the restrictive trade practices or boycotts fostered or imposed
        by any foreign country against a country friendly to the United
        States or against any United States person; and
          (C) to foster international cooperation and the development
        of international rules and institutions to assure reasonable
        access to world supplies.

        (6) It is the policy of the United States that the desirability
      of subjecting, or continuing to subject, particular goods or
      technology or other information to United States export controls
      should be subjected to review by and consultation with
      representatives of appropriate United States Government agencies
      and private industry.
        (7) It is the policy of the United States to use export
      controls, including license fees, to secure the removal by
      foreign countries of restrictions on access to supplies where
      such restrictions have or may have a serious domestic
      inflationary impact, have caused or may cause a serious domestic
      shortage, or have been imposed for purposes of influencing the
      foreign policy of the United States. In effecting this policy,
      the President shall make reasonable and prompt efforts to secure
      the removal or reduction of such restrictions, policies, or
      actions through international cooperation and agreement before
      imposing export controls. No action taken in fulfillment of the
      policy set forth in this paragraph shall apply to the export of
      medicine or medical supplies.
        (8) It is the policy of the United States to use export
      controls to encourage other countries to take immediate steps to
      prevent the use of their territories or resources to aid,
      encourage, or give sanctuary to those persons involved in
      directing, supporting, or participating in acts of international
      terrorism. To achieve this objective, the President shall make
      reasonable and prompt efforts to secure the removal or reduction
      of such assistance to international terrorists through
      international cooperation and agreement before imposing export
      controls.
        (9) It is the policy of the United States to cooperate with
      other countries with which the United States has defense treaty
      commitments or common strategic objectives in restricting the
      export of goods and technology which would make a significant
      contribution to the military potential of any country or
      combination of countries which would prove detrimental to the
      security of the United States and of those countries with which
      the United States has defense treaty commitments or common
      strategic objectives, and to encourage other friendly countries
      to cooperate in restricting the sale of goods and technology that
      can harm the security of the United States.
        (10) It is the policy of the United States that export trade by
      United States citizens be given a high priority and not be
      controlled except when such controls (A) are necessary to further
      fundamental national security, foreign policy, or short supply
      objectives, (B) will clearly further such objectives, and (C) are
      administered consistent with basic standards of due process.
        (11) It is the policy of the United States to minimize
      restrictions on the export of agricultural commodities and
      products.
        (12) It is the policy of the United States to sustain vigorous
      scientific enterprise. To do so involves sustaining the ability
      of scientists and other scholars freely to communicate research
      findings, in accordance with applicable provisions of law, by
      means of publication, teaching, conferences, and other forms of
      scholarly exchange.
        (13) It is the policy of the United States to control the
      export of goods and substances banned or severely restricted for
      use in the United States in order to foster public health and
      safety and to prevent injury to the foreign policy of the United
      States as well as to the credibility of the United States as a
      responsible trading partner.
        (14) It is the policy of the United States to cooperate with
      countries which are allies of the United States and countries
      which share common strategic objectives with the United States in
      minimizing dependence on imports of energy and other critical
      resources from potential adversaries and in developing
      alternative supplies of such resources in order to minimize
      strategic threats posed by excessive hard currency earnings
      derived from such resource exports by countries with policies
      adverse to the security interests of the United States.

    TITLE 50, APPENDIX - WAR AND NATIONAL DEFENSE
    EXPORT REGULATION

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2403. General provisions

-STATUTE-
    (a) Types of licenses
      Under such conditions as may be imposed by the Secretary which
    are consistent with the provisions of this Act [sections 2401 to
    2420 of this Appendix], the Secretary may require any of the
    following types of export licenses:
        (1) A validated license, authorizing a specific export, issued
      pursuant to an application by the exporter.
        (2) Validated licenses authorizing multiple exports, issued
      pursuant to an application by the exporter, in lieu of an
      individual validated license for each such export, including, but
      not limited to, the following:
          (A) A distribution license, authorizing exports of goods to
        approved distributors or users of the goods in countries other
        than controlled countries, except that the Secretary may
        establish a type of distribution license appropriate for
        consignees in the People's Republic of China. The Secretary
        shall grant the distribution license primarily on the basis of
        the reliability of the applicant and foreign consignees with
        respect to the prevention of diversion of goods to controlled
        countries. The Secretary shall have the responsibility of
        determining, with the assistance of all appropriate agencies,
        the reliability of applicants and their immediate consignees.
        The Secretary's determination shall be based on appropriate
        investigations of each applicant and periodic reviews of
        licensees and their compliance with the terms of licenses
        issued under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix].
        Factors such as the applicant's products or volume of business,
        or the consignees' geographic location, sales distribution
        area, or degree of foreign ownership, which may be relevant
        with respect to individual cases, shall not be determinative in
        creating categories or general criteria for the denial of
        applications or withdrawal of a distribution license.
          (B) A comprehensive operations license, authorizing exports
        and reexports of technology and related goods, including items
        from the list of militarily critical technologies developed
        pursuant to section 5(d) of this Act [section 2404(d) of this
        Appendix] which are included on the control list in accordance
        with that section, from a domestic concern to and among its
        foreign subsidiaries, affiliates, joint venturers, and
        licensees that have long-term, contractually defined relations
        with the exporter, are located in countries other than
        controlled countries (except the People's Republic of China),
        and are approved by the Secretary. The Secretary shall grant
        the license to manufacturing, laboratory, or related operations
        on the basis of approval of the exporter's systems of control,
        including internal proprietary controls, applicable to the
        technology and related goods to be exported rather than
        approval of individual export transactions. The Secretary and
        the Commissioner of Customs, consistent with their authorities
        under section 12(a) of this Act [section 2411(a) of this
        Appendix] and with the assistance of all appropriate agencies,
        shall periodically, but not less frequently than annually,
        perform audits of licensing procedures under this subparagraph
        in order to assure the integrity and effectiveness of those
        procedures.
          (C) A project license, authorizing exports of goods or
        technology for a specified activity.
          (D) A service supply license, authorizing exports of spare or
        replacement parts for goods previously exported.

        (3) A general license, authorizing exports, without application
      by the exporter.
        (4) Such other licenses as may assist in the effective and
      efficient implementation of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of
      this Appendix].
    (b) Control list
      The Secretary shall establish and maintain a list (hereinafter in
    this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] referred to as
    the "control list") stating license requirements (other than for
    general licenses) for exports of goods and technology under this
    Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix].
    (c) Foreign availability
      In accordance with the provisions of this Act [sections 2401 to
    2420 of this Appendix], the President shall not impose export
    controls for foreign policy or national security purposes on the
    export from the United States of goods or technology which he
    determines are available without restriction from sources outside
    the United States in sufficient quantities and comparable in
    quality to those produced in the United States so as to render the
    controls ineffective in achieving their purposes, unless the
    President determines that adequate evidence has been presented to
    him demonstrating that the absence of such controls would prove
    detrimental to the foreign policy or national security of the
    United States. In complying with the provisions of this subsection,
    the President shall give strong emphasis to bilateral or
    multilateral negotiations to eliminate foreign availability. The
    Secretary and the Secretary of Defense shall cooperate in gathering
    information relating to foreign availability, including the
    establishment and maintenance of a jointly operated computer
    system.
    (d) Right of export
      No authority or permission to export may be required under this
    Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix], or under regulations
    issued under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix],
    except to carry out the policies set forth in section 3 of this Act
    [section 2402 of this Appendix].
    (e) Delegation of authority
      The President may delegate the power, authority, and discretion
    conferred upon him by this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this
    Appendix] to such departments, agencies, or officials of the
    Government as he may consider appropriate, except that no authority
    under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] may be
    delegated to, or exercised by, any official of any department or
    agency the head of which is not appointed by the President, by and
    with the advice and consent of the Senate. The President may not
    delegate or transfer his power, authority, and discretion to
    overrule or modify any recommendation or decision made by the
    Secretary, the Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of State
    pursuant to the provisions of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of
    this Appendix].
    (f) Notification of public; consultation with business
      The Secretary shall keep the public fully apprised of changes in
    export control policy and procedures instituted in conformity with
    this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] with a view to
    encouraging trade. The Secretary shall meet regularly with
    representatives of a broad spectrum of enterprises, labor
    organizations, and citizens interested in or affected by export
    controls, in order to obtain their views on United States export
    control policy and the foreign availability of goods and
    technology.
    (g) Fees
      No fee may be charged in connection with the submission or
    processing of an export license application.

    and the laws of the United States of America, including but not
    limited to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50
    U.S.C. 1701 et. seq.) ("the Act"), and in order to take additional

    as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et. seq.) ("the Export
    Administration Act"), and the Regulations. Accordingly, it is

    submitted to the Department of Commerce pursuant to the Act and the
    Regulations or under any renewal of, or successor to, the Export
    Administration Act and the Regulations, with the power of
    successive redelegation, shall continue. The Departments of State,

    export license application submitted to the Department of Commerce
    pursuant to the Act and the Regulations or under any renewal of, or
    successor to, the Export Administration Act and the Regulations.
    The Secretary may refer license applications to other United States
    Government departments or agencies for review as appropriate. In
    the event that a department or agency determines that certain types
    of applications need not be referred to it, such department or
    agency shall notify the Department of Commerce as to the specific
    types of such applications that it does not wish to review. All
    departments or agencies shall promptly respond, on a case-by-case
    basis, to requests from other departments or agencies for
    historical information relating to past license applications.
      Sec. 2. Determinations. (a) All license applications submitted
    under the Act and the Regulations or any renewal of, or successor
    to, the Export Administration Act and the Regulations, shall be
    resolved or referred to the President no later than 90 calendar
    days after registration of the completed license application.
      (b) The following actions related to processing a license
    application submitted under the Act and the Regulations or any
    renewal of, or successor to, the Export Administration Act and the
    Regulations shall not be counted in calculating the time periods
    prescribed in this order:
      (1) Agreement of the Applicant. Delays upon which the Secretary
    and the applicant mutually agree.
      (2) Prelicense Checks. Prelicense checks through government
    channels that may be required to establish the identity and
    reliability of the recipient of items controlled under the Act and
    the Regulations or any renewal of, or successor to, the Export
    Administration Act and the Regulations, provided that:
      (A) the need for such prelicense check is established by the
    Secretary, or by another department or agency if the request for
    prelicense check is made by such department or agency;
      (B) the Secretary requests the prelicense check within 5 days of
    the determination that it is necessary; and
      (C) the Secretary completes the analysis of the result of the
    prelicense check within 5 days.
      (3) Requests for Government-To-Government Assurances. Requests
    for government-to-government assurances of suitable end-use of
    items approved for export under the Act and the Regulations or any
    renewal of, or successor to, the Export Administration Act and the
    Regulations, when failure to obtain such assurances would result in
    rejection of the application, provided that:
      (A) the request for such assurances is sent to the Secretary of
    State within 5 days of the determination that the assurances are
    required;
      (B) the Secretary of State initiates the request of the relevant
    government within 10 days thereafter; and
      (C) the license is issued within 5 days of the Secretary's
    receipt of the requested assurances. Whenever such prelicense
    checks and assurances are not requested within the time periods set
    forth above, they must be accomplished within the time periods
    established by this section.
      (4) Multilateral Reviews. Multilateral review of a license
    application as provided for under the Act and the Regulations or
    any renewal of, or successor to, the Export Administration Act and
    the Regulations, as long as multilateral review is required by the
    relevant multilateral regime.
      (5) Consultations. Consultation with other governments, if such
    consultation is provided for by a relevant multilateral regime or
    bilateral arrangement as a precondition for approving a license.
      Sec. 3. Initial Processing. Within 9 days of registration of any
    license application, the Secretary shall, as appropriate:
      (a) request additional information from the applicant. The time
    required for the applicant to supply the additional information
    shall not be counted in calculating the time periods prescribed in
    this section.
      (b) refer the application and pertinent information to agencies
    or departments as stipulated in section 1 of this order, and
    forward to the agencies any relevant information submitted by the
    applicant that could not be reduced to electronic form.
      (c) assure that the stated classification on the application is
    correct; return the application if a license is not required; and,
    if referral to other departments or agencies is not required, grant
    the application or notify the applicant of the Secretary's
    intention to deny the application.
      Sec. 4. Department or Agency Review. (a) Each reviewing
    department or agency shall specify to the Secretary, within 10 days
    of receipt of a referral as specified in subsection 3(b), any
    information not in the application that would be required to make a
    determination, and the Secretary shall promptly request such
    information from the applicant. If, after receipt of the
    information so specified or other new information, a reviewing
    department or agency concludes that additional information would be
    required to make a determination, it shall promptly specify that
    additional information to the Secretary, and the Secretary shall
    promptly request such information from the applicant. The time that
    may elapse between the date the information is requested by the
    reviewing department or agency and the date the information is
    received by the reviewing department or agency shall not be counted
    in calculating the time periods prescribed in this order. Such
    information specified by reviewing departments or agencies is in
    addition to any information that may be requested by the Department
    of Commerce on its own initiative during the first 9 days after
    registration of an application.
      (b) Within 30 days of receipt of a referral and all required
    information, a department or agency shall provide the Secretary
    with a recommendation either to approve or deny the license
    application. As appropriate, such recommendation may be with the
    benefit of consultation and discussions in interagency groups
    established to provide expertise and coordinate interagency
    consultation. A recommendation that the Secretary deny a license
    shall include a statement of the reasons for such recommendation
    that are consistent with the provisions of the Act and the
    Regulations or any renewal of, or successor to, the Export
    Administration Act and the Regulations and shall cite both the
    statutory and the regulatory bases for the recommendation to deny.
    A department or agency that fails to provide a recommendation
    within 30 days with a statement of reasons and the statutory and
    regulatory bases shall be deemed to have no objection to the
    decision of the Secretary.
      Sec. 5. Interagency Dispute Resolution. (a) Committees. (1)(A)
    Export Administration Review Board. The Export Administration
    Review Board ("the Board"), which was established by Executive
    Order No. 11533 of June 4, 1970 [formerly set out above], and
    continued in Executive Order No. 12002 of July 7, 1977 [set out
    above], is hereby continued. The Board shall have as its members,
    the Secretary, who shall be Chair of the Board, the Secretary of
    State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Energy[.] The
    Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of Central
    Intelligence shall be nonvoting members of the Board. No alternate
    Board members shall be designated, but the acting head or deputy
    head of any member department or agency may serve in lieu of the
    head of the concerned department or agency. The Board may invite
    the heads of other United States Government departments or
    agencies, other than the departments or agencies represented by the
    Board members, to participate in the activities of the Board when
    matters of interest to such departments or agencies are under
    consideration.
      (B) The Secretary may, from time to time, refer to the Board such
    particular export license matters, involving questions of national
    security or other major policy issues, as the Secretary shall
    select. The Secretary shall also refer to the Board any other such
    export license matter, upon the request of any other member of the
    Board or the head of any other United States Government department
    or agency having any interest in such matter. The Board shall
    consider the matters so referred to it, giving due consideration to
    the foreign policy of the United States, the national security, the
    domestic economy, and concerns about the proliferation of
    armaments, weapons of mass destruction, missile delivery systems,
    and advanced conventional weapons and shall make recommendations
    thereon to the Secretary.
      (2) Advisory Committee on Export Policy. An Advisory Committee on
    Export Policy ("ACEP") is established and shall have as its members
    the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration, who
    shall be Chair of the ACEP, and Assistant Secretary-level
    representatives of the Departments of State, Defense, and Energy[.]
    Appropriate representatives of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and of the
    Nonproliferation Center of the Central Intelligence Agency shall be
    nonvoting members of the ACEP. Representatives of the departments
    or agencies shall be the appropriate Assistant Secretary or
    equivalent (or appropriate acting Assistant Secretary or equivalent
    in lieu of the Assistant Secretary or equivalent) of the concerned
    department or agency, or appropriate Deputy Assistant Secretary or
    equivalent (or the appropriate acting Deputy Assistant Secretary or
    equivalent in lieu of the Deputy Assistant Secretary or equivalent)
    of the concerned department or agency. Regardless of the department
    or agency representative's rank, such representative shall speak
    and vote at the ACEP on behalf of the appropriate Assistant
    Secretary or equivalent of such department or agency. The ACEP may
    invite Assistant Secretary-level representatives of other United
    States Government departments or agencies, other than the
    departments and agencies represented by the ACEP members, to
    participate in the activities of the ACEP when matters of interest
    to such departments or agencies are under consideration.
      (3)(A) Operating Committee. An Operating Committee ("OC") of the
    ACEP is established. The Secretary shall appoint its Chair, who
    shall also serve as Executive Secretary of the ACEP. Its other
    members shall be representatives of appropriate agencies in the
    Departments of Commerce, State, Defense, and Energy[.] The
    appropriate representatives of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
    Nonproliferation Center of the Central Intelligence Agency shall be
    nonvoting members of the OC. The OC may invite representatives of
    other United States Government departments or agencies, other than
    the departments and agencies represented by the OC members, to
    participate in the activities of the OC when matters of interest to
    such departments or agencies are under consideration.
      (B) The OC shall review all license applications on which the
    reviewing departments and agencies are not in agreement. The Chair
    of the OC shall consider the recommendations of the reviewing
    departments and agencies and inform them of his or her decision on
    any such matters within 14 days after the deadline for receiving
    department and agency recommendations. However, for license
    applications concerning commercial communication satellites and hot-
    section technologies for the development, production, and overhaul
    of commercial aircraft engines that are transferred from the United
    States Munitions List to the Commerce Control List pursuant to
    regulations issued by the Departments of Commerce and State after
    the date of this order, the Chair of the OC shall inform reviewing
    departments and agencies of the majority vote decision of the OC.
    As described below, any reviewing department or agency may appeal
    the decision of the Chair of the OC, or the majority vote decision
    of the OC in cases concerning the commercial communication
    satellites and hot-section technologies described above, to the
    Chair of the ACEP. In the absence of a timely appeal, the Chair's
    decision (or the majority vote decision in the case of license
    applications concerning the commercial communication satellites and
    hot-section technologies described above) will be final.
      (b) Resolution Procedures. (1) If any department or agency
    disagrees with a licensing determination of the Department of
    Commerce made through the Chair of the OC (or a majority vote
    decision of the OC in the case of license applications concerning
    the commercial communication satellites and the hot-section
    technologies described in section 5(a)(3)(B)), it may appeal the
    matter to the ACEP for resolution. A department or agency must
    appeal a matter within 5 days of such a decision. Appeals must be
    in writing from an official appointed by the President, by and with
    the advice and consent of the Senate, or an officer properly acting
    in such capacity, and must cite both the statutory and the
    regulatory bases for the appeal. The ACEP shall review all
    departments' and agencies' information and recommendations, and the
    Chair of the ACEP shall inform the reviewing departments and
    agencies of the majority vote decision of the ACEP within 11 days
    from the date of receiving notice of the appeal. Within 5 days of
    the majority vote decision, any dissenting department or agency may
    appeal the decision by submitting a letter from the head of the
    department or agency to the Secretary in his or her capacity as the
    Chair of the Board. Such letter shall cite both the statutory and
    the regulatory bases for the appeal. Within the same 5-day period,
    the Secretary may call a meeting on his or her own initiative to
    consider a license application. In the absence of a timely appeal,
    the majority vote decision of the ACEP shall be final.
      (2) The Board shall review all departments' and agencies'
    information and recommendations, and such other export control
    matters as may be appropriate. The Secretary shall inform the
    reviewing departments and agencies of the majority vote of the
    Board within 11 days from the date of receiving notice of appeal.
    Within 5 days of the decision, any department or agency dissenting
    from the majority vote decision of the Board may appeal the
    decision by submitting a letter from the head of the dissenting
    department or agency to the President. In the absence of a timely
    appeal, the majority vote decision of the Board shall be final.
      Sec. 6. Encryption Products. In conducting the license review
    described in section 1 above, with respect to export controls of
    encryption products that are or would be, on November 15, 1996,
    designated as defense articles in Category XIII of the United
    States Munitions List and regulated by the United States Department
    of State pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778 et
    seq., but that subsequently are placed on the Commerce Control List
    in the Export Administration Regulations, the Departments of State,
    Defense, Energy, and Justice shall have the opportunity to review
    any export license application submitted to the Department of
    Commerce. The Department of Justice shall, with respect to such
    encryption products, be a voting member of the Export
    Administration Review Board described in section 5(a)(1) of this
    order and of the Advisory Committee on Export Policy described in
    section 5(a)(2) of this order. The Department of Justice shall be a
    full member of the Operating Committee of the ACEP described in
    section 5(a)(3) of this order, and of any other committees and
    consultation groups reviewing export controls with respect to such
    encryption products.
      Sec. 7. The license review process in this order shall take
    effect beginning with those license applications registered by the
    Secretary 60 days after the date of this order and shall continue
    in effect to the extent not inconsistent with any renewal of the
    Export Administration Act, or with any successor to that Act.
      Sec. 8. Judicial Review. This order is intended only to improve
    the internal management of the executive branch and is not intended
    to, and does not, create any rights to administrative or judicial
    review, or any other right or benefit or trust responsibility,
    substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the
    United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or
    employees, or any other person.

    EX. ORD. NO. 13026. ADMINISTRATION OF EXPORT CONTROLS ON ENCRYPTION
                                 PRODUCTS
      Ex. Ord. No. 13026, Nov. 15, 1996, 61 F.R. 58767, provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, including but not
    limited to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50
    U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), and in order to take additional steps with
    respect to the national emergency described and declared in
    Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994 [listed in a table under
    section 1701 of Title 50, War and National Defense], and continued
    on August 15, 1995, and on August 14, 1996, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON,
    President of the United States of America, have decided that the
    provisions set forth below shall apply to administration of the
    export control system maintained by the Export Administration
    Regulations, 15 CFR Part 730 et seq. ("the EAR"). Accordingly, it
    is hereby ordered as follows:
      Section 1. Treatment of Encryption Products. In order to provide
    for appropriate controls on the export and foreign dissemination of
    encryption products, export controls of encryption products that
    are or would be, on this date, designated as defense articles in
    Category XIII of the United States Munitions List and regulated by
    the United States Department of State pursuant to the Arms Export
    Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq. ("the AECA"), but that
    subsequently are placed on the Commerce Control List in the EAR,
    shall be subject to the following conditions: (a) I have determined
    that the export of encryption products described in this section
    could harm national security and foreign policy interests even
    where comparable products are or appear to be available from
    sources outside the United States, and that facts and questions
    concerning the foreign availability of such encryption products
    cannot be made subject to public disclosure or judicial review
    without revealing or implicating classified information that could
    harm United States national security and foreign policy interests.
    Accordingly, sections 4(c) and 6(h)(2)-(4) of the Export
    Administration Act of 1979 ("the EAA"), 50 U.S.C. App. 2403(c) and
    2405(h)(2)-(4), as amended and as continued in effect by Executive
    Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, and by notices of August 15, 1995,
    and August 14, 1996, all other analogous provisions of the EAA
    relating to foreign availability, and the regulations in the EAR
    relating to such EAA provisions, shall not be applicable with
    respect to export controls on such encryption products.
    Notwithstanding this, the Secretary of Commerce ("Secretary") may,
    in his discretion, consider the foreign availability of comparable
    encryption products in determining whether to issue a license in a
    particular case or to remove controls on particular products, but
    is not required to issue licenses in particular cases or to remove
    controls on particular products based on such consideration;
      (b) [Amended Ex. Ord. No. 12981, set out above;]
      (c) Because the export of encryption software, like the export of
    other encryption products described in this section, must be
    controlled because of such software's functional capacity, rather
    than because of any possible informational value of such software,
    such software shall not be considered or treated as "technology,"
    as that term is defined in section 16 of the EAA (50 U.S.C. App.
    2415) and in the EAR (61 Fed. Reg. 12714, March 25, 1996);
      (d) With respect to encryption products described in this
    section, the Secretary shall take such actions, including the
    promulgation of rules, regulations, and amendments thereto, as may
    be necessary to control the export of assistance (including
    training) to foreign persons in the same manner and to the same
    extent as the export of such assistance is controlled under the
    AECA, as amended by section 151 of Public Law 104-164 [see 22
    U.S.C. 2778(b)(1)(A)];
      (e) Appropriate controls on the export and foreign dissemination
    of encryption products described in this section may include, but
    are not limited to, measures that promote the use of strong
    encryption products and the development of a key recovery
    management infrastructure; and
      (f) Regulation of encryption products described in this section
    shall be subject to such further conditions as the President may
    direct.
      Sec. 2. Effective Date. The provisions described in section 1
    shall take effect as soon as any encryption products described in
    section 1 are placed on the Commerce Control List in the EAR.
      Sec. 3. Judicial Review. This order is intended only to improve
    the internal management of the executive branch and to ensure the
    implementation of appropriate controls on the export and foreign
    dissemination of encryption products. It is not intended to, and
    does not, create any rights to administrative or judicial review,
    or any other right or benefit or trust responsibility, substantive
    or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States,
    its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or
    any other person.
                                                     William J. Clinton.

    EXPORT REGULATION

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2404. National security controls

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authority
      (1) In order to carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(A)
    of this Act [section 2402(2)(A) of this Appendix], the President
    may, in accordance with the provisions of this section, prohibit or
    curtail the export of any goods or technology subject to the
    jurisdiction of the United States or exported by any person subject
    to the jurisdiction of the United States. The authority contained
    in this subsection includes the authority to prohibit or curtail
    the transfer of goods or technology within the United States to
    embassies and affiliates of controlled countries. For purposes of
    the preceding sentence, the term "affiliates" includes both
    governmental entities and commercial entities that are controlled
    in fact by controlled countries. The authority contained in this
    subsection shall be exercised by the Secretary, in consultation
    with the Secretary of Defense, and such other departments and
    agencies as the Secretary considers appropriate, and shall be
    implemented by means of export licenses described in section 4(a)
    of this Act [section 2403(a) of this Appendix].
      (2) Whenever the Secretary makes any revision with respect to any
    goods or technology, or with respect to the countries or
    destinations, affected by export controls imposed under this
    section, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a
    notice of such revision and shall specify in such notice that the
    revision relates to controls imposed under the authority contained
    in this section.
      (3) In issuing regulations to carry out this section, particular
    attention shall be given to the difficulty of devising effective
    safeguards to prevent a country that poses a threat to the security
    of the United States from diverting critical technologies to
    military use, the difficulty of devising effective safeguards to
    protect critical goods, and the need to take effective measures to
    prevent the reexport of critical technologies from other countries
    to countries that pose a threat to the security of the United
    States.
      (4)(A) No authority or permission may be required under this
    section to reexport any goods or technology subject to the
    jurisdiction of the United States to any country which maintains
    export controls on such goods or technology cooperatively with the
    United States pursuant to the agreement of the group known as the
    Coordinating Committee, or pursuant to an agreement described in
    subsection (k) of this section. The Secretary may require any
    person reexporting any goods or technology under this subparagraph
    to notify the Secretary of such reexports.
      (B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Secretary may require
    authority or permission to reexport the following:
        (i) supercomputers;
        (ii) goods or technology for sensitive nuclear uses (as defined
      by the Secretary);
        (iii) devices for surreptitious interception of wire or oral
      communications; and
        (iv) goods or technology intended for such end users as the
      Secretary may specify by regulation.

      (5)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no authority or
    permission may be required under this section to reexport any goods
    or technology subject to the jurisdiction of the United States from
    any country when the goods or technology to be reexported are
    incorporated in another good and - 
        (i) the value of the controlled United States content of that
      other good is 25 percent or less of the total value of the good;
      or
        (ii) the export of the goods or technology to a controlled
      country would require only notification of the participating
      governments of the Coordinating Committee.

    For purposes of this paragraph, the "controlled United States
    content" of a good means those goods or technology subject to the
    jurisdiction of the United States which are incorporated in the
    good, if the export of those goods or technology from the United
    States to a country, at the time that the good is exported to that
    country, would require a validated license.
      (B) The Secretary may by regulation provide that subparagraph (A)
    does not apply to the reexport of a supercomputer which contains
    goods or technology subject to the jurisdiction of the United
    States.
      (6) Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of
    this paragraph [Aug. 23, 1988], the Secretary shall issue
    regulations to carry out paragraphs (4) and (5). Such regulations
    shall define the term "supercomputer" for purposes of those
    paragraphs.
    (b) Policy toward individual countries
      (1) In administering export controls for national security
    purposes under this section, the President shall establish as a
    list of controlled countries those countries set forth in section
    620(f) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2370(f)],
    except that the President may add any country to or remove any
    country from such list of controlled countries if he determines
    that the export of goods or technology to such country would or
    would not (as the case may be) make a significant contribution to
    the military potential of such country or a combination of
    countries which would prove detrimental to the national security of
    the United States. In determining whether a country is added to or
    removed from the list of controlled countries, the President shall
    take into account - 
        (A) the extent to which the country's policies are adverse to
      the national security interests of the United States;
        (B) the country's Communist or non-Communist status;
        (C) the present and potential relationship of the country with
      the United States;
        (D) the present and potential relationships of the country with
      countries friendly or hostile to the United States;
        (E) the country's nuclear weapons capability and the country's
      compliance record with respect to multilateral nuclear weapons
      agreements to which the United States is a party; and
        (F) such other factors as the President considers appropriate.

    Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be interpreted to limit the
    authority of the President provided in this Act [sections 2401 to
    2420 of this Appendix] to prohibit or curtail the export of any
    goods or technology to any country to which exports are controlled
    for national security purposes other than countries on the list of
    controlled countries specified in this paragraph. The President
    shall review not less frequently than every three years in the case
    of controls maintained cooperatively with other nations, and
    annually in the case of all other controls, United States policy
    toward individual countries to determine whether such policy is
    appropriate in light of the factors set forth in this paragraph.
      (2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no authority or
    permission may be required under this section to export goods or
    technology to a country which maintains export controls on such
    goods or technology cooperatively with the United States pursuant
    to the agreement of the group known as the Coordinating Committee
    or pursuant to an agreement described in subsection (k) of this
    section, if the export of such goods or technology to the People's
    Republic of China or a controlled country on the date of the
    enactment of the Export Enhancement Act of 1988 [Aug. 23, 1988]
    would require only notification of the participating governments of
    the Coordinating Committee.
      (B)(i) The Secretary may require a license for the export of
    goods or technology described in subparagraph (A) to such end users
    as the Secretary may specify by regulation.
      (ii) The Secretary may require any person exporting goods or
    technology under this paragraph to notify the Secretary of those
    exports.
      (C) The Secretary shall, within 3 months after the date of the
    enactment of the Export Enhancement Act of 1988 [Aug. 23, 1988],
    determine which countries referred to in subparagraph (A) are
    implementing an effective export control system consistent with
    principles agreed to in the Coordinating Committee, including the
    following:
        (i) national laws providing appropriate civil and criminal
      penalties and statutes of limitations sufficient to deter
      potential violations;
        (ii) a program to evaluate export license applications that
      includes sufficient technical expertise to assess the licensing
      status of exports and ensure the reliability of end-users;
        (iii) an enforcement mechanism that provides authority for
      trained enforcement officers to investigate and prevent illegal
      exports;
        (iv) a system of export control documentation to verify the
      movement of goods and technology; and
        (v) procedures for the coordination and exchange of information
      concerning violations of the agreement of the Coordinating
      Committee.

    The Secretary shall, at least once each year, review the
    determinations made under the preceding sentence with respect to
    all countries referred to in subparagraph (A). The Secretary may,
    as appropriate, add countries to, or remove countries from, the
    list of countries that are implementing an effective export control
    system in accordance with this subparagraph. No authority or
    permission to export may be required for the export of goods or
    technology to a country on such list.
      (3)(A) No authority or permission may be required under this
    section to export to any country, other than a controlled country,
    any goods or technology if the export of the goods or technology to
    controlled countries would require only notification of the
    participating governments of the Coordinating Committee.
      (B) The Secretary may require any person exporting any goods or
    technology under subparagraph (A) to notify the Secretary of those
    exports.
    (c) Control list
      (1) The Secretary shall establish and maintain, as part of the
    control list, a list of all goods and technology subject to export
    controls under this section. Such goods and technology shall be
    clearly identified as being subject to controls under this section.
      (2) The Secretary of Defense and other appropriate departments
    and agencies shall identify goods and technology for inclusion on
    the list referred to in paragraph (1). Those items which the
    Secretary and the Secretary of Defense concur shall be subject to
    export controls under this section shall comprise such list. If the
    Secretary and the Secretary of Defense are unable to concur on such
    items, as determined by the Secretary, the Secretary of Defense
    may, within 20 days after receiving notification of the Secretary's
    determination, refer the matter to the President for resolution.
    The Secretary of Defense shall notify the Secretary of any such
    referral. The President shall, not later than 20 days after such
    referral, notify the Secretary of his determination with respect to
    the inclusion of such items on the list. Failure of the Secretary
    of Defense to notify the President or the Secretary, or failure of
    the President to notify the Secretary, in accordance with this
    paragraph, shall be deemed by the Secretary to constitute
    concurrence in the implementation of the actions proposed by the
    Secretary regarding the inclusion of such items on the list.
      (3) The Secretary shall conduct partial reviews of the list
    established pursuant to this subsection at least once each calendar
    quarter in order to carry out the policy set forth in section
    3(2)(A) of this Act [section 2402(2)(A) of this Appendix] and the
    provisions of this section, and shall promptly make such revisions
    of the list as may be necessary after each such review. Before
    beginning each quarterly review, the Secretary shall publish notice
    of that review in the Federal Register. The Secretary shall provide
    a 30-day period during each review for comment and the submission
    of data, with or without oral presentation, by interested
    Government agencies and other affected or potentially affected
    parties. After consultation with appropriate Government agencies,
    the Secretary shall make a determination of any revisions in the
    list within 30 days after the end of the review period. The
    concurrence or approval of any other department or agency is not
    required before any such revision is made. The Secretary shall
    publish in the Federal Register any revisions in the list, with an
    explanation of the reasons for the revisions. The Secretary shall
    use the data developed from each review in formulating United
    States proposals relating to multilateral export controls in the
    group known as the Coordinating Committee. The Secretary shall
    further assess, as part of each review, the availability from
    sources outside the United States of goods and technology
    comparable to those subject to export controls imposed under this
    section. All goods and technology on the list shall be reviewed at
    least once each year. The provisions of this paragraph apply to
    revisions of the list which consist of removing items from the list
    or making changes in categories of, or other specifications in,
    items on the list.
      (4) The appropriate technical advisory committee appointed under
    subsection (h) of this section shall be consulted by the Secretary
    with respect to changes, pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3), in the
    list established pursuant to this subsection, and such technical
    advisory committee may submit recommendations to the Secretary with
    respect to such changes. The Secretary shall consider the
    recommendations of the technical advisory committee and shall
    inform the committee of the disposition of its recommendations.
      (5)(A) Not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of
    this paragraph [Aug. 23, 1988], the following shall no longer be
    subject to export controls under this section:
        (i) All goods or technology the export of which to controlled
      countries on the date of the enactment of the Export Enhancement
      Act of 1988 [Aug. 23, 1988] would require only notification of
      the participating governments of the Coordinating Committee,
      except for those goods or technology on which the Coordinating
      Committee agrees to maintain such notification requirement.
        (ii) All medical instruments and equipment, subject to the
      provisions of subsection (m) of this section.

      (B) The Secretary shall submit to the Congress annually a report
    setting forth the goods and technology from which export controls
    have been removed under this paragraph.
      (6)(A) Notwithstanding subsection (f) or (h)(6) of this section,
    any export control imposed under this section which is maintained
    unilaterally by the United States shall expire 6 months after the
    date of the enactment of this paragraph [Aug. 23, 1988], or 6
    months after the export control is imposed, whichever date is
    later, except that - 
        (i) any such export controls on those goods or technology for
      which a determination of the Secretary that there is no foreign
      availability has been made under subsection (f) or (h)(6) of this
      section before the end of the applicable 6-month period and is in
      effect may be renewed for periods of not more than 6 months each,
      and
        (ii) any such export controls on those goods or technology with
      respect to which the President, by the end of the applicable 6-
      month period, is actively pursuing negotiations with other
      countries to achieve multilateral export controls on those goods
      or technology may be renewed for 2 periods of not more than 6
      months each.

      (B) Export controls on goods or technology described in clause
    (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) may be renewed only if, before each
    renewal, the President submits to the Congress a report setting
    forth all the controls being renewed and stating the specific
    reasons for such renewal.
      (7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, after
    1 year has elapsed since the last review in the Federal Register on
    any item within a category on the control list the export of which
    to the People's Republic of China would require only notification
    of the members of the group known as the Coordinating Committee, an
    export license applicant may file an allegation with the Secretary
    that such item has not been so reviewed within such 1-year period.
    Within 90 days after receipt of such allegation, the Secretary - 
        (A) shall determine the truth of the allegation;
        (B) shall, if the allegation is confirmed, commence and
      complete the review of the item; and
        (C) shall, pursuant to such review, submit a finding for
      publication in the Federal Register.

    In such finding, the Secretary shall identify those goods or
    technology which shall remain on the control list and those goods
    or technology which shall be removed from the control list. If such
    review and submission for publication are not completed within that
    90-day period, the goods or technology encompassed by such item
    shall immediately be removed from the control list.
    (d) Militarily critical technologies
      (1) The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense,
    shall review and revise the list established pursuant to subsection
    (c), as prescribed in paragraph (3) of such subsection, for the
    purpose of insuring that export controls imposed under this section
    cover and (to the maximum extent consistent with the purposes of
    this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix]) are limited to
    militarily critical goods and technologies and the mechanisms
    through which such goods and technologies may be effectively
    transferred.
      (2) The Secretary of Defense shall bear primary responsibility
    for developing a list of militarily critical technologies. In
    developing such list, primary emphasis shall be given to - 
        (A) arrays of design and manufacturing know-how,
        (B) keystone manufacturing, inspection, and test equipment,
        (C) goods accompanied by sophisticated operation, application,
      or maintenance know-how, and
        (D) keystone equipment which would reveal or give insight into
      the design and manufacture of a United States military system,

    which are not possessed by, or available in fact from sources
    outside the United States to, controlled countries and which, if
    exported, would permit a significant advance in a military system
    of any such country.
      (3) The list referred to in paragraph (2) shall be sufficiently
    specific to guide the determinations of any official exercising
    export licensing responsibilities under this Act [sections 2401 to
    2420 of this Appendix].
      (4) The Secretary and the Secretary of Defense shall integrate
    items on the list of militarily critical technologies into the
    control list in accordance with the requirements of subsection (c)
    of this section. The integration of items on the list of militarily
    critical technologies into the control list shall proceed with all
    deliberate speed. Any disagreement between the Secretary and the
    Secretary of Defense regarding the integration of an item on the
    list of militarily critical technologies into the control list
    shall be resolved by the President. Except in the case of a good or
    technology for which a validated license may be required under
    subsection (f)(4) or (h)(6) of this section, a good or technology
    shall be included on the control list only if the Secretary finds
    that controlled countries do not possess that good or technology,
    or a functionally equivalent good or technology, and the good or
    technology or functionally equivalent good or technology is not
    available in fact to a controlled country from sources outside the
    United States in sufficient quantity and of comparable quality so
    that the requirement of a validated license for the export of such
    good or technology is or would be ineffective in achieving the
    purpose set forth in subsection (a) of this section. The Secretary
    and the Secretary of Defense shall jointly submit a report to the
    Congress, not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of
    the Export Administration Amendments Act of 1985 [July 12, 1985],
    on actions taken to carry out this paragraph. For the purposes of
    this paragraph, assessment of whether a good or technology is
    functionally equivalent shall include consideration of the factors
    described in subsection (f)(3) of this section.
      (5) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a procedure for
    reviewing the goods and technology on the list of militarily
    critical technologies on an ongoing basis for the purpose of
    removing from the list of militarily critical technologies any
    goods or technology that are no longer militarily critical. The
    Secretary of Defense may add to the list of militarily critical
    technologies any good or technology that the Secretary of Defense
    determines is militarily critical, consistent with the provisions
    of paragraph (2) of this subsection. If the Secretary and the
    Secretary of Defense disagree as to whether any change in the list
    of militarily critical technologies by the addition or removal of a
    good or technology should also be made in the control list,
    consistent with the provisions of the fourth sentence of paragraph
    (4) of this subsection, the President shall resolve the
    disagreement.
      (6) The establishment of adequate export controls for militarily
    critical technology and keystone equipment shall be accompanied by
    suitable reductions in the controls on the products of that
    technology and equipment.
      (7) The Secretary of Defense shall, not later than 1 year after
    the date of the enactment of the Export Administration Amendments
    Act of 1985 [July 12, 1985], report to the Congress on efforts by
    the Department of Defense to assess the impact that the transfer of
    goods or technology on the list of militarily critical technologies
    to controlled countries has had or will have on the military
    capabilities of those countries.
    (e) Export licenses
      (1) The Congress finds that the effectiveness and efficiency of
    the process of making export licensing determinations under this
    section is severely hampered by the large volume of validated
    export license applications required to be submitted under this Act
    [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix]. Accordingly, it is the
    intent of Congress in this subsection to encourage the use of the
    multiple validated export licenses described in section 4(a)(2) of
    this Act [section 2403(a)(2) of this Appendix] in lieu of
    individual validated licenses.
      (2) To the maximum extent practicable, consistent with the
    national security of the United States, the Secretary shall require
    a validated license under this section for the export of goods or
    technology only if - 
        (A) the export of such goods or technology is restricted
      pursuant to a multilateral agreement, formal or informal, to
      which the United States is a party and, under the terms of such
      multilateral agreement, such export requires the specific
      approval of the parties to such multilateral agreement;
        (B) with respect to such goods or technology, other nations do
      not possess capabilities comparable to those possessed by the
      United States; or
        (C) the United States is seeking the agreement of other
      suppliers to apply comparable controls to such goods or
      technology and, in the judgment of the Secretary, United States
      export controls on such goods or technology, by means of such
      license, are necessary pending the conclusion of such agreement.

      (3) The Secretary, subject to the provisions of subsection (l) of
    this section, shall not require an individual validated export
    license for replacement parts which are exported to replace on a
    one-for-one basis parts that were in a good that has been lawfully
    exported from the United States.
      (4) The Secretary shall periodically review the procedures with
    respect to the multiple validated export licenses, taking
    appropriate action to increase their utilization by reducing
    qualification requirements or lowering minimum thresholds, to
    combine procedures which overlap, and to eliminate those procedures
    which appear to be of marginal utility.
      (5) The export of goods subject to export controls under this
    section shall be eligible, at the discretion of the Secretary, for
    a distribution license and other licenses authorizing multiple
    exports of goods, in accordance with section 4(a)(2) of this Act
    [section 2403(a)(2) of this Appendix]. The export of technology and
    related goods subject to export controls under this section shall
    be eligible for a comprehensive operations license in accordance
    with section 4(a)(2)(B) of this Act [section 2403(a)(2)(B) of this
    Appendix].
      (6) Any application for a license for the export to the People's
    Republic of China of any good on which export controls are in
    effect under this section, without regard to the technical
    specifications of the good, for the purpose of demonstration or
    exhibition at a trade show shall carry a presumption of approval if
    - 
        (A) the United States exporter retains title to the good during
      the entire period in which the good is in the People's Republic
      of China; and
        (B) the exporter removes the good from the People's Republic of
      China no later than at the conclusion of the trade show.
    (f) Foreign availability
      (1) Foreign availability to controlled countries
        (A) The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of
      Defense and other appropriate Government agencies and with
      appropriate technical advisory committees established pursuant to
      subsection (h) of this section, shall review, on a continuing
      basis, the availability to controlled countries, from sources
      outside the United States, including countries which participate
      with the United States in multilateral export controls, of any
      goods or technology the export of which requires a validated
      license under this section. In any case in which the Secretary
      determines, in accordance with procedures and criteria which the
      Secretary shall by regulation establish, that any such goods or
      technology are available in fact to controlled countries from
      such sources in sufficient quantity and of comparable quality so
      that the requirement of a validated license for the export of
      such goods or technology is or would be ineffective in achieving
      the purpose set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the
      Secretary may not, after the determination is made, require a
      validated license for the export of such goods or technology
      during the period of such foreign availability, unless the
      President determines that the absence of export controls under
      this section on the goods or technology would prove detrimental
      to the national security of the United States. In any case in
      which the President determines under this paragraph that export
      controls under this section must be maintained notwithstanding
      foreign availability, the Secretary shall publish that
      determination, together with a concise statement of its basis and
      the estimated economic impact of the decision.
        (B) The Secretary shall approve any application for a validated
      license which is required under this section for the export of
      any goods or technology to a controlled country and which meets
      all other requirements for such an application, if the Secretary
      determines that such goods or technology will, if the license is
      denied, be available in fact to such country from sources outside
      the United States, including countries which participate with the
      United States in multilateral export controls, in sufficient
      quantity and of comparable quality so that denial of the license
      would be ineffective in achieving the purpose set forth in
      subsection (a) of this section, unless the President determines
      that approving the license application would prove detrimental to
      the national security of the United States. In any case in which
      the Secretary makes a determination of foreign availability under
      this subparagraph with respect to any goods or technology, the
      Secretary shall determine whether a determination of foreign
      availability under subparagraph (A) with respect to such goods or
      technology is warranted.
      (2) Foreign availability to other than controlled countries
        (A) The Secretary shall review, on a continuing basis, the
      availability to countries other than controlled countries, from
      sources outside the United States, of any goods or technology the
      export of which requires a validated license under this section.
      If the Secretary determines, in accordance with procedures which
      the Secretary shall establish, that any goods or technology in
      sufficient quantity and of comparable quality are available in
      fact from sources outside the United States (other than
      availability under license from a country which maintains export
      controls on such goods or technology cooperatively with the
      United States pursuant to the agreement of the group known as the
      Coordinating Committee or pursuant to an agreement described in
      subsection (k) of this section), the Secretary may not, after the
      determination is made and during the period of such foreign
      availability, require a validated license for the export of such
      goods or technology to any country (other than a controlled
      country) to which the country from which the goods or technology
      is available does not place controls on the export of such goods
      or technology. The requirement with respect to a validated
      license in the preceding sentence shall not apply if the
      President determines that the absence of export controls under
      this section on the goods or technology would prove detrimental
      to the national security of the United States. In any case in
      which the President determines under this paragraph that export
      controls under this section must be maintained notwithstanding
      foreign availability, the Secretary shall publish that
      determination, together with a concise statement of its basis and
      the estimated economic impact of the decision.
        (B) The Secretary shall approve any application for a validated
      license which is required under this section for the export of
      any goods or technology to a country (other than a controlled
      country) and which meets all other requirements for such an
      application, if the Secretary determines that such goods or
      technology are available from foreign sources to that country
      under the criteria established in subparagraph (A), unless the
      President determines that approving the license application would
      prove detrimental to the national security of the United States.
      In any case in which the Secretary makes a determination of
      foreign availability under this subparagraph with respect to any
      goods or technology, the Secretary shall determine whether a
      determination of foreign availability under subparagraph (A) with
      respect to such goods or technology is warranted.
      (3) Procedures for making determinations
        (A) The Secretary shall make a foreign availability
      determination under paragraph (1) or (2) on the Secretary's own
      initiative or upon receipt of an allegation from an export
      license applicant that such availability exists. In making any
      such determination, the Secretary shall accept the
      representations of applicants made in writing and supported by
      reasonable evidence, unless such representations are contradicted
      by reliable evidence, including scientific or physical
      examination, expert opinion based upon adequate factual
      information, or intelligence information. In making
      determinations of foreign availability, the Secretary may
      consider such factors as cost, reliability, the availability and
      reliability of spare parts and the cost and quality thereof,
      maintenance programs, durability, quality of end products
      produced by the item proposed for export, and scale of
      production. For purposes of this subparagraph, "evidence" may
      include such items as foreign manufacturers' catalogues,
      brochures, or operations or maintenance manuals, articles from
      reputable trade publications, photographs, and depositions based
      upon eyewitness accounts.
        (B) In a case in which an allegation is received from an export
      license applicant, the Secretary shall, upon receipt of the
      allegation, submit for publication in the Federal Register notice
      of such receipt. Within 4 months after receipt of the allegation,
      the Secretary shall determine whether the foreign availability
      exists, and shall so notify the applicant. If the Secretary has
      determined that the foreign availability exists, the Secretary
      shall, upon making such determination, submit the determination
      for review to other departments and agencies as the Secretary
      considers appropriate. The Secretary's determination of foreign
      availability does not require the concurrence or approval of any
      official, department, or agency to which such a determination is
      submitted. Not later than 1 month after the Secretary makes the
      determination, the Secretary shall respond in writing to the
      applicant and submit for publication in the Federal Register,
      that - 
          (i) the foreign availability does exist and - 
            (I) the requirement of a validated license has been
          removed,
            (II) the President has determined that export controls
          under this section must be maintained notwithstanding the
          foreign availability and the applicable steps are being taken
          under paragraph (4), or
            (III) in the case of a foreign availability determination
          under paragraph (1), the foreign availability determination
          will be submitted to a multilateral review process in
          accordance with the agreement of the Coordinating Committee
          for a period of not more than 4 months beginning on the date
          of the publication; or

          (ii) the foreign availability does not exist.

      In any case in which the submission for publication is not made
      within the time period specified in the preceding sentence, the
      Secretary may not thereafter require a license for the export of
      the goods or technology with respect to which the foreign
      availability allegation was made. In the case of a foreign
      availability determination under paragraph (1) to which clause
      (i)(III) applies, no license for such export may be required
      after the end of the 9-month period beginning on the date on
      which the allegation is received.
      (4) Negotiations to eliminate foreign availability
        (A) In any case in which export controls are maintained under
      this section notwithstanding foreign availability, on account of
      a determination by the President that the absence of the controls
      would prove detrimental to the national security of the United
      States, the President shall actively pursue negotiations with the
      governments of the appropriate foreign countries for the purpose
      of eliminating such availability. No later than the commencement
      of such negotiations, the President shall notify in writing the
      Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate
      and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of
      Representatives that he has begun such negotiations and why he
      believes it is important to national security that export
      controls on the goods or technology involved be maintained.
        (B) If, within 6 months after the President's determination
      that export controls be maintained, the foreign availability has
      not been eliminated, the Secretary may not, after the end of that
      6-month period, require a validated license for the export of the
      goods or technology involved. The President may extend the 6-
      month period described in the preceding sentence for an
      additional period of 12 months if the President certifies to the
      Congress that the negotiations involved are progressing and that
      the absence of the export controls involved would prove
      detrimental to the national security of the United States.
      Whenever the President has reason to believe that goods or
      technology subject to export controls for national security
      purposes by the United States may become available from other
      countries to controlled countries and that such availability can
      be prevented or eliminated by means of negotiations with such
      other countries, the President shall promptly initiate
      negotiations with the governments of such other countries to
      prevent such foreign availability.
        (C) After an agreement is reached with a country pursuant to
      negotiations under this paragraph to eliminate or prevent foreign
      availability of goods or technology, the Secretary may not
      require a validated license for the export of such goods or
      technology to that country.
      (5) Expedited licenses for items available to countries other
        than controlled countries
        (A) In any case in which the Secretary finds that any goods or
      technology from foreign sources is of similar quality to goods or
      technology the export of which requires a validated license under
      this section and is available to a country other than a
      controlled country without effective restrictions, the Secretary
      shall designate such goods or technology as eligible for export
      to such country under this paragraph.
        (B) In the case of goods or technology designated under
      subparagraph (A), then 20 working days after the date of formal
      filing with the Secretary of an individual validated license
      application for the export of those goods or technology to an
      eligible country, a license for the transaction specified in the
      application shall become valid and effective and the goods or
      technology are authorized for export pursuant to such license
      unless the license has been denied by the Secretary on account of
      an inappropriate end user. The Secretary may extend the 20-day
      period provided in the preceding sentence for an additional
      period of 15 days if the Secretary requires additional time to
      consider the application and so notifies the applicant.
        (C) The Secretary may make a foreign availability determination
      under subparagraph (A) on the Secretary's own initiative, upon
      receipt of an allegation from an export license applicant that
      such availability exists, or upon the submission of a
      certification by a technical advisory committee of appropriate
      jurisdiction that such availability exists. Upon receipt of such
      an allegation or certification, the Secretary shall publish
      notice of such allegation or certification in the Federal
      Register and shall make the foreign availability determination
      within 30 days after such receipt and publish the determination
      in the Federal Register. In the case of the failure of the
      Secretary to make and publish such determination within that 30-
      day period, the goods or technology involved shall be deemed to
      be designated as eligible for export to the country or countries
      involved, for purposes of subparagraph (B).
        (D) The provisions of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) do not
      apply with respect to determinations of foreign availability
      under this paragraph.
      (6) Office of Foreign Availability
        The Secretary shall establish in the Department of Commerce an
      Office of Foreign Availability, which shall be under the
      direction of the Under Secretary of Commerce for Export
      Administration. The Office shall be responsible for gathering and
      analyzing all the necessary information in order for the
      Secretary to make determinations of foreign availability under
      this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix]. The Secretary
      shall make available to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the
      House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing,
      and Urban Affairs of the Senate at the end of each 6-month period
      during a fiscal year information on the operations of the Office,
      and on improvements in the Government's ability to assess foreign
      availability, during that 6-month period, including information
      on the training of personnel, the use of computers, and the use
      of Commercial Service Officers of the United States and Foreign
      Commercial Service. Such information shall also include a
      description of representative determinations made under this Act
      [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] during that 6-month
      period that foreign availability did or did not exist (as the
      case may be), together with an explanation of such
      determinations.
      (7) Sharing of information
        Each department or agency of the United States, including any
      intelligence agency, and all contractors with any such department
      or agency, shall, upon the request of the Secretary and
      consistent with the protection of intelligence sources and
      methods, furnish information to the Office of Foreign
      Availability concerning foreign availability of goods and
      technology subject to export controls under this Act [sections
      2401 to 2420 of this Appendix]. Each such department or agency
      shall allow the Office of Foreign Availability access to any
      information from a laboratory or other facility within such
      department or agency.
      (8) Removal of controls on less sophisticated goods or technology
        In any case in which (!1) Secretary may not, pursuant to
      paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) of this subsection or paragraph
      (6) of subsection (h) of this section, require a validated
      license for the export of goods or technology, then the Secretary
      may not require a validated license for the export of any similar
      goods or technology whose function, technological approach,
      performance thresholds, and other attributes that form the basis
      for export controls under this section do not exceed the
      technical parameters of the goods or technology from which the
      validated license requirement is removed under the applicable
      paragraph.

      (9) Notice of all foreign availability assessments
        Whenever the Secretary undertakes a foreign availability
      assessment under this subsection or subsection (h)(6), the
      Secretary shall publish notice of such assessment in the Federal
      Register.
      (10) Availability defined
        For purposes of this subsection and subsections (f) and (h),
      the term "available in fact to controlled countries" includes
      production or availability of any goods or technology in any
      country - 
          (A) from which the goods or technology is not restricted for
        export to any controlled country; or
          (B) in which such export restrictions are determined by the
        Secretary to be ineffective.

      For purposes of subparagraph (B), the mere inclusion of goods or
      technology on a list of goods or technology subject to bilateral
      or multilateral national security export controls shall not alone
      constitute credible evidence that a country provides an effective
      means of controlling the export of such goods or technology to
      controlled countries.
    (g) Indexing
      (1) In order to ensure that requirements for validated licenses
    and other licenses authorizing multiple exports are periodically
    removed as goods or technology subject to such requirements becomes
    obsolete with respect to the national security of the United
    States, regulations issued by the Secretary may, where appropriate,
    provide for annual increases in the performance levels of goods or
    technology subject to any such licensing requirement. The
    regulations issued by the Secretary shall establish as one
    criterion for the removal of goods or technology from such license
    requirements the anticipated needs of the military of controlled
    countries. Any such goods or technology which no longer meets the
    performance levels established by the regulations shall be removed
    from the list established pursuant to subsection (c) of this
    section unless, under such exceptions and under such procedures as
    the Secretary shall prescribe, any other department or agency of
    the United States objects to such removal and the Secretary
    determines, on the basis of such objection, that the goods or
    technology shall not be removed from the list. The Secretary shall
    also consider, where appropriate, removing site visitation
    requirements for goods and technology which are removed from the
    list unless objections described in this subsection are raised.
      (2)(A) In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall
    conduct annual reviews of the performance levels of goods or
    technology - 
        (i) which are eligible for export under a distribution license,
        (ii) below which exports to the People's Republic of China
      require only notification of the governments participating in the
      group known as the Coordinating Committee, and
        (iii) below which no authority or permission to export may be
      required under subsection (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section.

    The Secretary shall make appropriate adjustments to such
    performance levels based on these reviews.
      (B) In any case in which the Secretary receives a request which -
    
        (i) is to revise the qualification requirements or minimum
      thresholds of any goods eligible for export under a distribution
      license, and
        (ii) is made by an exporter of such goods, representatives of
      an industry which produces such goods, or a technical advisory
      committee established under subsection (h) of this section,

    the Secretary, after consulting with other appropriate Government
    agencies and technical advisory committees established under
    subsection (h) of this section, shall determine whether to make
    such revision, or some other appropriate revision, in such
    qualification requirements or minimum thresholds. In making this
    determination, the Secretary shall take into account the
    availability of the goods from sources outside the United States.
    The Secretary shall make a determination on a request made under
    this subparagraph within 90 days after the date on which the
    request is filed. If the Secretary's determination pursuant to such
    a request is to make a revision, such revision shall be implemented
    within 120 days after the date on which the request is filed and
    shall be published in the Federal Register.
    (h) Technical advisory committees
      (1) Upon written request by representatives of a substantial
    segment of any industry which produces any goods or technology
    subject to export controls under this section or being considered
    for such controls because of their significance to the national
    security of the United States, the Secretary shall appoint a
    technical advisory committee for any such goods or technology which
    the Secretary determines are difficult to evaluate because of
    questions concerning technical matters, worldwide availability, and
    actual utilization of production and technology, or licensing
    procedures. Each such committee shall consist of representatives of
    United States industry and Government, including the Departments of
    Commerce, Defense, and State, the intelligence community, and, in
    the discretion of the Secretary, other Government departments and
    agencies. No person serving on any such committee who is a
    representative of industry shall serve on such committee for more
    than four consecutive years.
      (2) Technical advisory committees established under paragraph (1)
    shall advise and assist the Secretary, the Secretary of Defense,
    and any other department, agency, or official of the Government of
    the United States to which the President delegates authority under
    this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix], with respect to
    actions designed to carry out the policy set forth in section
    3(2)(A) of this Act [section 2402(2)(A) of this Appendix]. Such
    committees, where they have expertise in such matters, shall be
    consulted with respect to questions involving (A) technical
    matters, (B) worldwide availability and actual utilization of
    production technology, (C) licensing procedures which affect the
    level of export controls applicable to any goods or technology, (D)
    revisions of the control list (as provided in subsection (c)(4)),
    including proposed revisions of multilateral controls in which the
    United States participates, (E) the issuance of regulations, and
    (F) any other questions relating to actions designed to carry out
    the policy set forth in section 3(2)(A) of this Act [section
    2402(2)(A) of this Appendix]. Nothing in this subsection shall
    prevent the Secretary or the Secretary of Defense from consulting,
    at any time, with any person representing industry or the general
    public, regardless of whether such person is a member of a
    technical advisory committee. Members of the public shall be given
    a reasonable opportunity, pursuant to regulations prescribed by the
    Secretary, to present evidence to such committees.
      (3) Upon request of any member of any such committee, the
    Secretary may, if the Secretary determines it appropriate,
    reimburse such member for travel, subsistence, and other necessary
    expenses incurred by such member in connection with the duties of
    such member.
      (4) Each such committee shall elect a chairman, and shall meet at
    least every three months at the call of the chairman, unless the
    chairman determines, in consultation with the other members of the
    committee, that such a meeting is not necessary to achieve the
    purposes of this subsection. Each such committee shall be
    terminated after a period of 2 years, unless extended by the
    Secretary for additional periods of 2 years. The Secretary shall
    consult each such committee with respect to such termination or
    extension of that committee.
      (5) To facilitate the work of the technical advisory committees,
    the Secretary, in conjunction with other departments and agencies
    participating in the administration of this Act [sections 2401 to
    2420 of this Appendix], shall disclose to each such committee
    adequate information, consistent with national security, pertaining
    to the reasons for the export controls which are in effect or
    contemplated for the goods or technology with respect to which that
    committee furnishes advice.
      (6) Whenever a technical advisory committee certifies to the
    Secretary that goods or technology with respect to which such
    committee was appointed have become available in fact, to
    controlled countries, from sources outside the United States,
    including countries which participate with the United States in
    multilateral export controls, in sufficient quantity and of
    comparable quality so that requiring a validated license for the
    export of such goods or technology would be ineffective in
    achieving the purpose set forth in subsection (a) of this section,
    the technical advisory committee shall submit that certification to
    the Congress at the same time the certification is made to the
    Secretary, together with the documentation for the certification.
    The Secretary shall investigate the foreign availability so
    certified and, not later than 90 days after the certification is
    made, shall submit a report to the technical advisory committee and
    the Congress stating that - 
        (A) the Secretary has removed the requirement of a validated
      license for the export of the goods or technology, on account of
      the foreign availability,
        (B) the Secretary has recommended to the President that
      negotiations be conducted to eliminate the foreign availability,
      or
        (C) the Secretary has determined on the basis of the
      investigation that the foreign availability does not exist.

    To the extent necessary, the report may be submitted on a
    classified basis. In any case in which the Secretary has
    recommended to the President that negotiations be conducted to
    eliminate the foreign availability, the President shall actively
    pursue such negotiations with the governments of the appropriate
    foreign countries. If, within 6 months after the Secretary submits
    such report to the Congress, the foreign availability has not been
    eliminated, the Secretary may not, after the end of that 6-month
    period, require a validated license for the export of the goods or
    technology involved. The President may extend the 6-month period
    described in the preceding sentence for an additional period of 12
    months if the President certifies to the Congress that the
    negotiations involved are progressing and that the absence of the
    export control involved would prove detrimental to the national
    security of the United States. After an agreement is reached with a
    country pursuant to negotiations under this paragraph to eliminate
    foreign availability of goods or technology, the Secretary may not
    require a validated license for the export of such goods or
    technology to that country.
    (i) Multilateral export controls
      Recognizing the ineffectiveness of unilateral controls and the
    importance of uniform enforcement measures to the effectiveness of
    multilateral controls, the President shall enter into negotiations
    with the governments participating in the group known as the
    Coordinating Committee (hereinafter in this subsection referred to
    as the "Committee") with a view toward accomplishing the following
    objectives:
        (1) Enhanced public understanding of the Committee's purpose
      and procedures, including publication of the list of items
      controlled for export by agreement of the Committee, together
      with all notes, understandings, and other aspects of such
      agreement of the Committee, and all changes thereto.
        (2) Periodic meetings of high-level representatives of
      participating governments for the purpose of coordinating export
      control policies and issuing policy guidance to the Committee.
        (3) Strengthened legal basis for each government's export
      control system, including, as appropriate, increased penalties
      and statutes of limitations.
        (4) Harmonization of export control documentation by the
      participating governments to verify the movement of goods and
      technology subject to controls by the Committee.
        (5) Improved procedures for coordination and exchange of
      information concerning violations of the agreement of the
      Committee.
        (6) Procedures for effective implementation of the agreement
      through uniform and consistent interpretations of export controls
      agreed to by the governments participating in the Committee.
        (7) Coordination of national licensing and enforcement efforts
      by governments participating in the Committee, including
      sufficient technical expertise to assess the licensing status of
      exports and to ensure end-use verification.
        (8) More effective procedures for enforcing export controls,
      including adequate training, resources, and authority for
      enforcement officers to investigate and prevent illegal exports.
        (9) Agreement to provide adequate resources to enhance the
      functioning of individual national export control systems and of
      the Committee.
        (10) Improved enforcement and compliance with the agreement
      through elimination of unnecessary export controls and
      maintenance of an effective control list.
        (11) Agreement to enhance cooperation among members of the
      Committee in obtaining the agreement of governments outside the
      Committee to restrict the export of goods and technology on the
      International Control List, to establish an ongoing mechanism in
      the Committee to coordinate planning and implementation of export
      control measures related to such agreements, and to remove items
      from the International Control List if such items continue to be
      available to controlled countries or if the control of the items
      no longer serves the common strategic objectives of the members
      of the Committee.

    For purposes of reviews of the International Control List, the
    President may include as advisors to the United States delegation
    to the Committee representatives of industry who are knowledgeable
    with respect to the items being reviewed.
    (j) Commercial agreements with certain countries
      (1) Any United States firm, enterprise, or other nongovernmental
    entity which enters into an agreement with any agency of the
    government of a controlled country, that calls for the
    encouragement of technical cooperation and that is intended to
    result in the export from the United States to the other party of
    unpublished technical data of United States origin, shall report to
    the Secretary the agreement with such agency in sufficient detail.
      (2) The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not apply to colleges,
    universities, or other educational institutions.
    (k) Negotiations with other countries
      The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of
    Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, and the heads of other
    appropriate departments and agencies, shall be responsible for
    conducting negotiations with other countries, including those
    countries not participating in the group known as the Coordinating
    Committee, regarding their cooperation in restricting the export of
    goods and technology in order to carry out the policy set forth in
    section 3(9) of this Act [section 2402(9) of this Appendix], as
    authorized by subsection (a) of this section, including
    negotiations with respect to which goods and technology should be
    subject to multilaterally agreed export restrictions and what
    conditions should apply for exceptions from those restrictions. In
    cases where such negotiations produce agreements on export
    restrictions comparable in practice to those maintained by the
    Coordinating Committee, the Secretary shall treat exports, whether
    by individual or multiple licenses, to countries party to such
    agreements in the same manner as exports to members of the
    Coordinating Committee are treated, including the same manner as
    exports are treated under subsection (b)(2) of this section and
    section 10(o) of this Act [section 2409(o) of this Appendix].
    (l) Diversion of controlled goods or technology
      (1) Whenever there is reliable evidence, as determined by the
    Secretary, that goods or technology which were exported subject to
    national security controls under this section to a controlled
    country have been diverted to an unauthorized use or consignee in
    violation of the conditions of an export license, the Secretary for
    as long as that diversion continues - 
        (A) shall deny all further exports, to or by the party or
      parties responsible for that diversion or who conspired in that
      diversion, of any goods or technology subject to national
      security controls under this section, regardless of whether such
      goods or technology are available from sources outside the United
      States; and
        (B) may take such additional actions under this Act [sections
      2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] with respect to the party or
      parties referred to in subparagraph (A) as the Secretary
      determines are appropriate in the circumstances to deter the
      further unauthorized use of the previously exported goods or
      technology.

      (2) As used in this subsection, the term "unauthorized use" means
    the use of United States goods or technology in the design,
    production, or maintenance of any item on the United States
    Munitions List, or the military use of any item on the
    International Control List of the Coordinating Committee.
    (m) Goods containing controlled parts and components
      Export controls may not be imposed under this section, or under
    any other provision of law, on a good solely on the basis that the
    good contains parts or components subject to export controls under
    this section if such parts or components - 
        (1) are essential to the functioning of the good,
        (2) are customarily included in sales of the good in countries
      other than controlled countries, and
        (3) comprise 25 percent or less of the total value of the good,

    unless the good itself, if exported, would by virtue of the
    functional characteristics of the good as a whole make a
    significant contribution to the military potential of a controlled
    country which would prove detrimental to the national security of
    the United States.
    (n) Security measures
      The Secretary and the Commissioner of Customs, consistent with
    their authorities under section 12(a) of this Act [section 2411(a)
    of this Appendix], and in consultation with the Director of the
    Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall provide advice and technical
    assistance to persons engaged in the manufacture or handling of
    goods or technology subject to export controls under this section
    to develop security systems to prevent violations or evasions of
    those export controls.
    (o) Recordkeeping
      The Secretary, the Secretary of Defense, and any other department
    or agency consulted in connection with a license application under
    this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] or a revision of
    a list of goods or technology subject to export controls under this
    Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix], shall make and keep
    records of their respective advice, recommendations, or decisions
    in connection with any such license application or revision,
    including the factual and analytical basis of the advice,
    recommendations, or decisions.
    (p) National Security Control Office
      To assist in carrying out the policy and other authorities and
    responsibilities of the Secretary of Defense under this section,
    there is established in the Department of Defense a National
    Security Control Office under the direction of the Under Secretary
    of Defense for Policy. The Secretary of Defense may delegate to
    that office such of those authorities and responsibilities,
    together with such ancillary functions, as the Secretary of Defense
    considers appropriate.
    (q) Exclusion for agricultural commodities
      This section does not authorize export controls on agricultural
    commodities, including fats, oils, and animal hides and skins.

      NATIONAL SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF UNITED STATES EXPORT CONTROL
                                  POLICY
      Pub. L. 104-106, div. A, title XIII, Sec. 1322, Feb. 10, 1996,
    110 Stat. 478, provided that:
      "(a) Findings. - Congress makes the following findings:
        "(1) Export controls remain an important element of the
      national security policy of the United States.
        "(2) It is in the national security interest that United States
      export control policy be effective in preventing the transfer, to
      potential adversaries or combatants of the United States, of
      technology that threatens the national security or defense of the
      United States.
        "(3) It is in the national security interest that the United
      States monitor aggressively the export of militarily critical
      technology in order to prevent its diversion to potential
      adversaries or combatants of the United States.
        "(4) The Department of Defense relies increasingly on
      commercial and dual-use technologies, products, and processes to
      support United States military capabilities and economic
      strength.
        "(5) The maintenance of the military advantage of the United
      States depends on effective export controls on dual-use items and
      technologies that are critical to the military capabilities of
      the Armed Forces.
      "(b) Sense of Congress. - It is the sense of Congress that - 
        "(1) the Secretary of Defense should evaluate license
      applications for the export of militarily critical commodities
      the export of which is controlled for national security reasons
      if those commodities are to be exported to certain countries of
      concern;
        "(2) the Secretary of Defense should identify the dual-use
      items and technologies that are critical to the military
      capabilities of the Armed Forces, including the military use made
      of such items and technologies;
        "(3) upon identification by the Secretary of Defense of the
      dual-use items and technologies referred to in paragraph (2), the
      President should ensure effective export controls or use
      unilateral export controls on dual-use items and technologies
      that are critical to the military capabilities of the Armed
      Forces (regardless of the availability of such items or
      technologies overseas) with respect to the countries that - 
          "(A) pose a threat to the national security interests of the
        United States; and
          "(B) are not members in good standing of bilateral or
        multilateral agreements to which the United States is a party
        on the use of such items and technologies; and
        "(4) the President, upon recommendation of the Secretary of
      Defense, should ensure effective controls on the re-export by
      other countries of dual-use items and technologies that are
      critical to the military capabilities of the Armed Forces.
      "(c) Annual Report. - (1) Not later than December 1 of each year
    through 1999, the President shall submit to the committees
    specified in paragraph (4) a report on the effect of the export
    control policy of the United States on the national security
    interests of the United States.

          "(i) the categories of items that the United States currently
        prohibits for export to the country;
          "(ii) the categories of items that may be exported from the
        United States with an individual license, and in such cases,
        any licensing conditions normally required and the policy
        grounds used for approvals and denials; and
          "(iii) the categories of items that may be exported under a
        general license designated 'G-DEST'.
        "(C) For each category of items listed under subparagraph (B) -
      
          "(i) a statement whether a prohibition, control, or licensing
        requirement on a category of items is imposed pursuant to an
        international multilateral agreement or is unilateral;
          "(ii) a statement whether a prohibition, control, or
        licensing requirement on a category of items is imposed by the
        other members of an international agreement or is unilateral;
          "(iii) when the answer under either clause (i) or clause (ii)
        is unilateral, a statement concerning the efforts being made to
        ensure that the prohibition, control, or licensing requirement
        is made multilateral; and

-EXPCITE-
    TITLE 50, APPENDIX - WAR AND NATIONAL DEFENSE
    EXPORT REGULATION

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2405. Foreign policy controls

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authority
      (1) In order to carry out the policy set forth in paragraph
    (2)(B), (7), (8), or (13) of section 3 of this Act [section
    2402(2)(B), (7), (8), or (13) of this Appendix], the President may
    prohibit or curtail the exportation of any goods, technology, or
    other information subject to the jurisdiction of the United States
    or exported by any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United
    States, to the extent necessary to further significantly the
    foreign policy of the United States or to fulfill its declared
    international obligations. The authority granted by this subsection
    shall be exercised by the Secretary, in consultation with the
    Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of
    Agriculture, the Secretary of the Treasury, the United States Trade
    Representative, and such other departments and agencies as the
    Secretary considers appropriate, and shall be implemented by means
    of export licenses issued by the Secretary.
      (2) Any export control imposed under this section shall apply to
    any transaction or activity undertaken with the intent to evade
    that export control, even if that export control would not
    otherwise apply to that transaction or activity.
      (3) Export controls maintained for foreign policy purposes shall
    expire on December 31, 1979, or one year after imposition,
    whichever is later, unless extended by the President in accordance
    with subsections (b) and (f). Any such extension and any subsequent
    extension shall not be for a period of more than one year.
      (4) Whenever the Secretary denies any export license under this
    subsection, the Secretary shall specify in the notice to the
    applicant of the denial of such license that the license was denied
    under the authority contained in this subsection, and the reasons
    for such denial, with reference to the criteria set forth in
    subsection (b) of this section. The Secretary shall also include in
    such notice what, if any, modifications in or restrictions on the
    goods or technology for which the license was sought would allow
    such export to be compatible with controls implemented under this
    section, or the Secretary shall indicate in such notice which
    officers and employees of the Department of Commerce who are
    familiar with the application will be made reasonably available to
    the applicant for consultation with regard to such modifications or
    restrictions, if appropriate.
      (5) In accordance with the provisions of section 10 of this Act
    [section 2409 of this Appendix], the Secretary of State shall have
    the right to review any export license application under this
    section which the Secretary of State requests to review.
      (6) Before imposing, expanding, or extending export controls
    under this section on exports to a country which can use goods,
    technology, or information available from foreign sources and so
    incur little or no economic costs as a result of the controls, the
    President should, through diplomatic means, employ alternatives to
    export controls which offer opportunities of distinguishing the
    United States from, and expressing the displeasure of the United
    States with, the specific actions of that country in response to
    which the controls are proposed. Such alternatives include private
    discussions with foreign leaders, public statements in situations
    where private diplomacy is unavailable or not effective, withdrawal
    of ambassadors, and reduction of the size of the diplomatic staff
    that the country involved is permitted to have in the United
    States.
    (b) Criteria
      (1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the President
    may impose, extend, or expand export controls under this section
    only if the President determines that - 
        (A) such controls are likely to achieve the intended foreign
      policy purpose, in light of other factors, including the
      availability from other countries of the goods or technology
      proposed for such controls, and that foreign policy purpose
      cannot be achieved through negotiations or other alternative
      means;
        (B) the proposed controls are compatible with the foreign
      policy objectives of the United States and with overall United
      States policy toward the country to which exports are to be
      subject to the proposed controls;
        (C) the reaction of other countries to the imposition,
      extension, or expansion of such export controls by the United
      States is not likely to render the controls ineffective in
      achieving the intended foreign policy purpose or to be
      counterproductive to United States foreign policy interests;
        (D) the effect of the proposed controls on the export
      performance of the United States, the competitive position of the
      United States in the international economy, the international
      reputation of the United States as a supplier of goods and
      technology, or on the economic well-being of individual United
      States companies and their employees and communities does not
      exceed the benefit to United States foreign policy objectives;
      and
        (E) the United States has the ability to enforce the proposed
      controls effectively.

      (2) With respect to those export controls in effect under this
    section on the date of the enactment of the Export Administration
    Amendments Act of 1985 [July 12, 1985], the President, in
    determining whether to extend those controls, as required by
    subsection (a)(3) of this section, shall consider the criteria set
    forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection and shall consider the
    foreign policy consequences of modifying the export controls.
    (c) Consultation with industry
      The Secretary in every possible instance shall consult with and
    seek advice from affected United States industries and appropriate
    advisory committees established under section 135 of the Trade Act
    of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2155] before imposing any export control under
    this section. Such consultation and advice shall be with respect to
    the criteria set forth in subsection (b)(1) and such other matters
    as the Secretary considers appropriate.
    (d) Consultation with other countries
      When imposing export controls under this section, the President
    shall, at the earliest appropriate opportunity, consult with the
    countries with which the United States maintains export controls
    cooperatively, and with such other countries as the President
    considers appropriate, with respect to the criteria set forth in
    subsection (b)(1) and such other matters as the President considers
    appropriate.
    (e) Alternative means
      Before resorting to the imposition of export controls under this
    section, the President shall determine that reasonable efforts have
    been made to achieve the purposes of the controls through
    negotiations or other alternative means.
    (f) Consultation with Congress
      (1) The President may impose or expand export controls under this
    section, or extend such controls as required by subsection (a)(3)
    of this section, only after consultation with the Congress,
    including the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of
    Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban
    Affairs of the Senate.
      (2) The President may not impose, expand, or extend export
    controls under this section until the President has submitted to
    the Congress a report - 
        (A) specifying the purpose of the controls;
        (B) specifying the determinations of the President (or, in the
      case of those export controls described in subsection (b)(2), the
      considerations of the President) with respect to each of the
      criteria set forth in subsection (b)(1), the bases for such
      determinations (or considerations), and any possible adverse
      foreign policy consequences of the controls;
        (C) describing the nature, the subjects, and the results of, or
      the plans for, the consultation with industry pursuant to
      subsection (c) and with other countries pursuant to subsection
      (d);
        (D) specifying the nature and results of any alternative means
      attempted under subsection (e), or the reasons for imposing,
      expanding, or extending the controls without attempting any such
      alternative means; and
        (E) describing the availability from other countries of goods
      or technology comparable to the goods or technology subject to
      the proposed export controls, and describing the nature and
      results of the efforts made pursuant to subsection (h) to secure
      the cooperation of foreign governments in controlling the foreign
      availability of such comparable goods or technology.

    Such report shall also indicate how such controls will further
    significantly the foreign policy of the United States or will
    further its declared international obligations.
      (3) To the extent necessary to further the effectiveness of the
    export controls, portions of a report required by paragraph (2) may
    be submitted to the Congress on a classified basis, and shall be
    subject to the provisions of section 12(c) of this Act [section
    2411(c) of this Appendix].
      (4) In the case of export controls under this section which
    prohibit or curtail the export of any agricultural commodity, a
    report submitted pursuant to paragraph (2) shall be deemed to be
    the report required by section 7(g)(3)(A) of this Act [section
    2406(g)(3)(A) of this Appendix].
      (5) In addition to any written report required under this
    section, the Secretary, not less frequently than annually, shall
    present in oral testimony before the Committee on Banking, Housing,
    and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign
    Affairs of the House of Representatives a report on policies and
    actions taken by the Government to carry out the provisions of this
    section.
    (g) Exclusion for medicine and medical supplies and for certain
      food exports
      This section does not authorize export controls on medicine or
    medical supplies. This section also does not authorize export
    controls on donations of goods (including, but not limited to,
    food, educational materials, seeds and hand tools, medicines and
    medical supplies, water resources equipment, clothing and shelter
    materials, and basic household supplies) that are intended to meet
    basic human needs. Before export controls on food are imposed,
    expanded, or extended under this section, the Secretary shall
    notify the Secretary of State in the case of export controls
    applicable with respect to any developed country and shall notify
    the Administrator of the Agency for International Development in
    the case of export controls applicable with respect to any
    developing country. The Secretary of State with respect to
    developed countries, and the Administrator with respect to
    developing countries, shall determine whether the proposed export
    controls on food would cause measurable malnutrition and shall
    inform the Secretary of that determination. If the Secretary is
    informed that the proposed export controls on food would cause
    measurable malnutrition, then those controls may not be imposed,
    expanded, or extended, as the case may be, unless the President
    determines that those controls are necessary to protect the
    national security interests of the United States, or unless the
    President determines that arrangements are insufficient to ensure
    that the food will reach those most in need. Each such
    determination by the Secretary of State or the Administrator of the
    Agency for International Development, and any such determination by
    the President, shall be reported to the Congress, together with a
    statement of the reasons for that determination. It is the intent
    of Congress that the President not impose export controls under
    this section on any goods or technology if he determines that the
    principal effect of the export of such goods or technology would be
    to help meet basic human needs. This subsection shall not be
    construed to prohibit the President from imposing restrictions on
    the export of medicine or medical supplies or of food under the
    International Emergency Economic Powers Act [50 U.S.C 1701 et
    seq.]. This subsection shall not apply to any export control on
    medicine, medical supplies, or food, except for donations, which is
    in effect on the date of the enactment of the Export Administration
    Amendments Act of 1985 [July 12, 1985]. Notwithstanding the
    preceding provisions of this subsection, the President may impose
    export controls under this section on medicine, medical supplies,
    food, and donations of goods in order to carry out the policy set
    forth in paragraph (13) of section 3 of this Act [section 2402(13)
    of this Appendix].
    (h) Foreign availability
      (1) In applying export controls under this section, the President
    shall take all feasible steps to initiate and conclude negotiations
    with appropriate foreign governments for the purpose of securing
    the cooperation of such foreign governments in controlling the
    export to countries and consignees to which the United States
    export controls apply of any goods or technology comparable to
    goods or technology controlled under this section.
      (2) Before extending any export control pursuant to subsection
    (a)(3) of this section, the President shall evaluate the results of
    his actions under paragraph (1) of this subsection and shall
    include the results of that evaluation in his report to the
    Congress pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.
      (3) If, within 6 months after the date on which export controls
    under this section are imposed or expanded, or within 6 months
    after the date of the enactment of the Export Administration
    Amendments Act of 1985 [July 12, 1985] in the case of export
    controls in effect on such date of enactment, the President's
    efforts under paragraph (1) are not successful in securing the
    cooperation of foreign governments described in paragraph (1) with
    respect to those export controls, the Secretary shall thereafter
    take into account the foreign availability of the goods or
    technology subject to the export controls. If the Secretary
    affirmatively determines that a good or technology subject to the
    export controls is available in sufficient quantity and comparable
    quality from sources outside the United States to countries subject
    to the export controls so that denial of an export license would be
    ineffective in achieving the purposes of the controls, then the
    Secretary shall, during the period of such foreign availability,
    approve any license application which is required for the export of
    the good or technology and which meets all requirements for such a
    license. The Secretary shall remove the good or technology from the
    list established pursuant to subsection (l) of this section if the
    Secretary determines that such action is appropriate.
      (4) In making a determination of foreign availability under
    paragraph (3) of this subsection, the Secretary shall follow the
    procedures set forth in section 5(f)(3) of this Act [section
    2404(f)(3) of this Appendix].
    (i) International obligations
      The provisions of subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (g), and (h)
    shall not apply in any case in which the President exercises the
    authority contained in this section to impose export controls, or
    to approve or deny export license applications, in order to fulfill
    obligations of the United States pursuant to treaties to which the
    United States is a party or pursuant to other international
    agreements.
    (j) Countries supporting international terrorism
      (1) A validated license shall be required for the export of goods
    or technology to a country if the Secretary of State has made the
    following determinations:
        (A) The government of such country has repeatedly provided
      support for acts of international terrorism.
        (B) The export of such goods or technology could make a
      significant contribution to the military potential of such
      country, including its military logistics capability, or could
      enhance the ability of such country to support acts of
      international terrorism.

      (2) The Secretary and the Secretary of State shall notify the
    Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and
    the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the
    Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate at least 30 days
    before issuing any validated license required by paragraph (1).
      (3) Each determination of the Secretary of State under paragraph
    (1)(A), including each determination in effect on the date of the
    enactment of the Antiterrorism and Arms Export Amendments Act of
    1989 [Dec. 12, 1989], shall be published in the Federal Register.
      (4) A determination made by the Secretary of State under
    paragraph (1)(A) may not be rescinded unless the President submits
    to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chairman of
    the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the
    chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate - 
        (A) before the proposed rescission would take effect, a report
      certifying that - 
          (i) there has been a fundamental change in the leadership and
        policies of the government of the country concerned;
          (ii) that government is not supporting acts of international
        terrorism; and
          (iii) that government has provided assurances that it will
        not support acts of international terrorism in the future; or

      (B) at least 45 days before the proposed rescission would take
    effect, a report justifying the rescission and certifying that - 
        (i) the government concerned has not provided any support for
      international terrorism during the preceding 6-month period; and
        (ii) the government concerned has provided assurances that it
      will not support acts of international terrorism in the future.

      (5)(A) As used in paragraph (1), the term "repeatedly provided
    support for acts of international terrorism" shall include the
    recurring use of any part of the territory of the country as a
    sanctuary for terrorists or terrorist organizations.
      (B) In this paragraph - 
        (i) the term "territory of a country" means the land, waters,
      and airspace of the country; and
        (ii) the term "sanctuary" means an area in the territory of a
      country - 
          (I) that is used by a terrorist or terrorist organization - 
            (aa) to carry out terrorist activities, including training,
          financing, and recruitment; or
            (bb) as a transit point; and

          (II) the government of which expressly consents to, or with
        knowledge, allows, tolerates, or disregards such use of its
        territory.

      offered, including a brief description of the capabilities of any
      article for which a license to export is sought;
        (B) the reasons why the foreign country or international
      organization to which the export or transfer is proposed to be
      made needs the goods or services which are the subject of such
      export or transfer and a description of the manner in which such
      country or organization intends to use such articles, services,
      or design and construction services;
        (C) the reasons why the proposed export or transfer is in the
      national interest of the United States;
        (D) an analysis of the impact of the proposed export or
      transfer on the military capabilities of the foreign country or
      international organization to which such export or transfer would
      be made;
        (E) an analysis of the manner in which the proposed export
      would affect the relative military strengths of countries in the
      region to which the goods or services which are the subject of
      such export would be delivered and whether other countries in the
      region have comparable kinds and amounts of articles, services,
      or design and construction services; and
        (F) an analysis of the impact of the proposed export or
      transfer on the United States relations with the countries in the
      region to which the goods or services which are the subject of
      such export would be delivered.
    (k) Negotiations with other countries
      (1) Countries participating in certain agreements
        The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary, the
      Secretary of Defense, and the heads of other appropriate
      departments and agencies, shall be responsible for conducting
      negotiations with those countries participating in the groups
      known as the Coordinating Committee, the Missile Technology
      Control Regime, the Australia Group, and the Nuclear Suppliers'
      Group, regarding their cooperation in restricting the export of
      goods and technology in order to carry out - 
          (A) the policy set forth in section 3(2)(B) of this Act
        [section 2402(2)(B) of this Appendix], and
          (B) United States policy opposing the proliferation of
        chemical, biological, nuclear, and other weapons and their
        delivery systems, and effectively restricting the export of
        dual use components of such weapons and their delivery systems,
        in accordance with this subsection and subsections (a) and (l).

      Such negotiations shall cover, among other issues, which goods
      and technology should be subject to multilaterally agreed export
      restrictions, and the implementation of the restrictions
      consistent with the principles identified in section 5(b)(2)(C)
      of this Act [section 2404(b)(2)(C) of this Appendix].
      (2) Other countries
        The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary, the
      Secretary of Defense, and the heads of other appropriate
      departments and agencies, shall be responsible for conducting
      negotiations with countries and groups of countries not referred
      to in paragraph (1) regarding their cooperation in restricting
      the export of goods and technology consistent with purposes set
      forth in paragraph (1). In cases where such negotiations produce
      agreements on export restrictions that the Secretary, in
      consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of
      Defense, determines to be consistent with the principles
      identified in section 5(b)(2)(C) of this Act [section
      2404(b)(2)(C) of this Appendix], the Secretary may treat exports,
      whether by individual or multiple licenses, to countries party to
      such agreements in the same manner as exports are treated to
      countries that are MTCR adherents.
      (3) Review of determinations
        The Secretary shall annually review any determination under
      paragraph (2) with respect to a country. For each such country
      which the Secretary determines is not meeting the requirements of
      an effective export control system in accordance with section
      5(b)(2)(C) [section 2404(b)(2)(C) of this Appendix], the
      Secretary shall restrict or eliminate any preferential licensing
      treatment for exports to that country provided under this
      subsection.
    (l) Missile technology
      (1) Determination of controlled items
        The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the
      Secretary of Defense, and the heads of other appropriate
      departments and agencies - 
          (A) shall establish and maintain, as part of the control list
        established under this section, a list of all dual use goods
        and technology on the MTCR Annex; and
          (B) may include, as part of the control list established
        under this section, goods and technology that would provide a
        direct and immediate impact on the development of missile
        delivery systems and are not included in the MTCR Annex but
        which the United States is proposing to the other MTCR
        adherents to have included in the MTCR Annex.
      (2) Requirement of individual validated licenses
        The Secretary shall require an individual validated license for
      - 
          (A) any export of goods or technology on the list established
        under paragraph (1) to any country; and
          (B) any export of goods or technology that the exporter knows
        is destined for a project or facility for the design,
        development, or manufacture of a missile in a country that is
        not an MTCR adherent.
      (3) Policy of denial of licenses
        (A) Licenses under paragraph (2) should in general be denied if
      the ultimate consignee of the goods or technology is a facility
      in a country that is not an adherent to the Missile Technology
      Control Regime and the facility is designed to develop or build
      missiles.
        (B) Licenses under paragraph (2) shall be denied if the
      ultimate consignee of the goods or technology is a facility in a
      country the government of which has been determined under
      subsection (j) to have repeatedly provided support for acts of
      international terrorism.
      (4) Consultation with other departments
        (A) A determination of the Secretary to approve an export
      license under paragraph (2) for the export of goods or technology
      to a country of concern regarding missile proliferation may be
      made only after consultation with the Secretary of Defense and
      the Secretary of State for a period of 20 days. The countries of
      concern referred to in the preceding sentence shall be maintained
      on a classified list by the Secretary of State, in consultation
      with the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense.
        (B) Should the Secretary of Defense disagree with the
      determination of the Secretary to approve an export license to
      which subparagraph (A) applies, the Secretary of Defense shall so
      notify the Secretary within the 20 days provided for consultation
      on the determination. The Secretary of Defense shall at the same
      time submit the matter to the President for resolution of the
      dispute. The Secretary shall also submit the Secretary's
      recommendation to the President on the license application.
        (C) The President shall approve or disapprove the export
      license application within 20 days after receiving the submission
      of the Secretary of Defense under subparagraph (B).
        (D) Should the Secretary of Defense fail to notify the
      Secretary within the time period prescribed in subparagraph (B),
      the Secretary may approve the license application without
      awaiting the notification by the Secretary of Defense. Should the
      President fail to notify the Secretary of his decision on the
      export license application within the time period prescribed in
      subparagraph (C), the Secretary may approve the license
      application without awaiting the President's decision on the
      license application.
        (E) Within 10 days after an export license is issued under this
      subsection, the Secretary shall provide to the Secretary of
      Defense and the Secretary of State the license application and
      accompanying documents issued to the applicant, to the extent
      that the relevant Secretary indicates the need to receive such
      application and documents.
      (5) Information sharing
        The Secretary shall establish a procedure for information
      sharing with appropriate officials of the intelligence community,
      as determined by the Director of Central Intelligence, and other
      appropriate Government agencies, that will ensure effective
      monitoring of transfers of MTCR equipment or technology and other
      missile technology.
    (m) Chemical and biological weapons
      (1) Establishment of list
        The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the
      Secretary of Defense, and the heads of other appropriate
      departments and agencies, shall establish and maintain, as part
      of the list maintained under this section, a list of goods and
      technology that would directly and substantially assist a foreign
      government or group in acquiring the capability to develop,
      produce, stockpile, or deliver chemical or biological weapons,
      the licensing of which would be effective in barring acquisition
      or enhancement of such capability.
      (2) Requirement for validated licenses
        The Secretary shall require a validated license for any export
      of goods or technology on the list established under paragraph
      (1) to any country of concern.
      (3) Countries of concern
        For purposes of paragraph (2), the term "country of concern"
      means any country other than - 
          (A) a country with whose government the United States has
        entered into a bilateral or multilateral arrangement for the
        control of goods or technology on the list established under
        paragraph (1); and
          (B) such other countries as the Secretary of State, in
        consultation with the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense,
        shall designate consistent with the purposes of the Chemical
        and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of
        1991 [22 U.S.C. 5601 et seq.].
    (n) Crime control instruments
      (1) Crime control and detection instruments and equipment shall
    be approved for export by the Secretary only pursuant to a
    validated export license. Notwithstanding any other provision of
    this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] - 
        (A) any determination of the Secretary of what goods or
      technology shall be included on the list established pursuant to
      subsection (l) (!1) of this section as a result of the export
      restrictions imposed by this subsection shall be made with the
      concurrence of the Secretary of State, and

        (B) any determination of the Secretary to approve or deny an
      export license application to export crime control or detection
      instruments or equipment shall be made in concurrence with the
      recommendations of the Secretary of State submitted to the
      Secretary with respect to the application pursuant to section
      10(e) of this Act [section 2409(e) of this Appendix],

    except that, if the Secretary does not agree with the Secretary of
    State with respect to any determination under subparagraph (A) or
    (B), the matter shall be referred to the President for resolution.
      (2) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply with
    respect to exports to countries which are members of the North
    Atlantic Treaty Organization or to Japan, Australia, or New
    Zealand, or to such other countries as the President shall
    designate consistent with the purposes of this subsection and
    section 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C.
    2304].
    (o) Control list
      The Secretary shall establish and maintain, as part of the
    control list, a list of any goods or technology subject to export
    controls under this section, and the countries to which such
    controls apply. The Secretary shall clearly identify on the control
    list which goods or technology, and which countries or
    destinations, are subject to which types of controls under this
    section. Such list shall consist of goods and technology identified
    by the Secretary of State, with the concurrence of the Secretary.
    If the Secretary and the Secretary of State are unable to agree on
    the list, the matter shall be referred to the President. Such list
    shall be reviewed not less frequently than every three years in the
    case of controls maintained cooperatively with other countries, and
    annually in the case of all other controls, for the purpose of
    making such revisions as are necessary in order to carry out this
    section. During the course of such review, an assessment shall be
    made periodically of the availability from sources outside the
    United States, or any of its territories or possessions, of goods
    and technology comparable to those controlled for export from the
    United States under this section.
    (p) Effect on existing contracts and licenses
      The President may not, under this section, prohibit or curtail
    the export or reexport of goods, technology, or other information -
    
        (1) in performance of a contract or agreement entered into
      before the date on which the President reports to the Congress,
      pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, his intention to
      impose controls on the export or reexport of such goods,
      technology, or other information, or
        (2) under a validated license or other authorization issued
      under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix],

    unless and until the President determines and certifies to the
    Congress that - 
        (A) a breach of the peace poses a serious and direct threat to
      the strategic interest of the United States,
        (B) the prohibition or curtailment of such contracts,
      agreements, licenses, or authorizations will be instrumental in
      remedying the situation posing the direct threat, and
        (C) the export controls will continue only so long as the
      direct threat persists.
    (q) Extension of certain controls
      Those export controls imposed under this section with respect to
    South Africa which were in effect on February 28, 1982, and ceased
    to be effective on March 1, 1982, September 15, 1982, or January
    20, 1983, shall become effective on the date of the enactment of
    this subsection [July 12, 1985], and shall remain in effect until 1
    year after such date of enactment. At the end of that 1-year
    period, any of those controls made effective by this subsection may
    be extended by the President in accordance with subsections (b) and
    (f) of this section.
    (r) Expanded authority to impose controls
      (1) In any case in which the President determines that it is
    necessary to impose controls under this section without any
    limitation contained in subsection (c), (d), (e), (g), (h), or (m)
    (!2) of this section, the President may impose those controls only
    if the President submits that determination to the Congress,
    together with a report pursuant to subsection (f) of this section
    with respect to the proposed controls, and only if a law is enacted
    authorizing the imposition of those controls. If a joint resolution
    authorizing the imposition of those controls is introduced in
    either House of Congress within 30 days after the Congress receives
    the determination and report of the President, that joint
    resolution shall be referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing,
    and Urban Affairs of the Senate and to the appropriate committee of
    the House of Representatives. If either such committee has not
    reported the joint resolution at the end of 30 days after its
    referral, the committee shall be discharged from further
    consideration of the joint resolution.

      (2) For purposes of this subsection, the term "joint resolution"
    means a joint resolution the matter after the resolving clause of
    which is as follows: "That the Congress, having received on        
        a determination of the President under section 6(o)(1) (!2) of
    the Export Administration Act of 1979 with respect to the export
    controls which are set forth in the report submitted to the
    Congress with that determination, authorizes the President to
    impose those export controls.", with the date of the receipt of the
    determination and report inserted in the blank.
      (3) In the computation of the periods of 30 days referred to in
    paragraph (1), there shall be excluded the days on which either
    House of Congress is not in session because of an adjournment of
    more than 3 days to a day certain or because of an adjournment of
    the Congress sine die.
    (s) Spare parts
      (1) At the same time as the President imposes or expands export
    controls under this section, the President shall determine whether
    such export controls will apply to replacement parts for parts in
    goods subject to such export controls.
      (2) With respect to export controls imposed under this section
    before the date of the enactment of this subsection [Aug. 23,
    1988], an individual validated export license shall not be required
    for replacement parts which are exported to replace on a one-for-
    one basis parts that were in a good that was lawfully exported
    from the United States, unless the President determines that such a
    license should be required for such parts.

-EXPCITE-
    TITLE 50, APPENDIX - WAR AND NATIONAL DEFENSE
    EXPORT REGULATION

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2406. Short supply controls

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authority
      (1) In order to carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(C)
    of this Act [section 2402(2)(C) of this Appendix], the President
    may prohibit or curtail the export of any goods subject to the
    jurisdiction of the United States or exported by any person subject
    to the jurisdiction of the United States. In curtailing exports to
    carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(C) of this Act
    [section 2402(2)(C) of this Appendix], the President shall allocate
    a portion of export licenses on the basis of factors other than a
    prior history of exportation. Such factors shall include the extent
    to which a country engages in equitable trade practices with
    respect to United States goods and treats the United States
    equitably in times of short supply.
      (2) Upon imposing quantitative restrictions on exports of any
    goods to carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(C) of this
    Act [section 2402(2)(C) of this Appendix], the Secretary shall
    include in a notice published in the Federal Register with respect
    to such restrictions an invitation to all interested parties to
    submit written comments within 15 days from the date of publication
    on the impact of such restrictions and the method of licensing used
    to implement them.
      (3) In imposing export controls under this section, the
    President's authority shall include, but not be limited to, the
    imposition of export license fees.
    (b) Monitoring
      (1) In order to carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(C)
    of this Act [section 2402(2)(C) of this Appendix], the Secretary
    shall monitor exports, and contracts for exports, of any good
    (other than a commodity which is subject to the reporting
    requirements of section 812 (!1) of the Agricultural Act of 1970 [7
    U.S.C. 612c-3]) when the volume of such exports in relation to
    domestic supply contributes, or may contribute, to an increase in
    domestic prices or a domestic shortage, and such price increase or
    shortage has, or may have, a serious adverse impact on the economy
    or any sector thereof. Any such monitoring shall commence at a time
    adequate to assure that the monitoring will result in a data base
    sufficient to enable policies to be developed, in accordance with
    section 3(2)(C) of this Act [section 2402(2)(C) of this Appendix],
    to mitigate a short supply situation or serious inflationary price
    rise or, if export controls are needed, to permit imposition of
    such controls in a timely manner. Information which the Secretary
    requires to be furnished in effecting such monitoring shall be
    confidential, except as provided in paragraph (2) of this
    subsection.

      (2) The results of such monitoring shall, to the extent
    practicable, be aggregated and included in weekly reports setting
    forth, with respect to each item monitored, actual and anticipated
    exports, the destination by country, and the domestic and worldwide
    price, supply, and demand. Such reports may be made monthly if the
    Secretary determines that there is insufficient information to
    justify weekly reports.
      (3) The Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Energy to
    determine whether monitoring or export controls under this section
    are warranted with respect to exports of facilities, machinery, or
    equipment normally and principally used, or intended to be used, in
    the production, conversion, or transportation of fuels and energy
    (except nuclear energy), including, but not limited to, drilling
    rigs, platforms, and equipment; petroleum refineries, natural gas
    processing, liquefaction, and gasification plants; facilities for
    production of synthetic natural gas or synthetic crude oil; oil and
    gas pipelines, pumping stations, and associated equipment; and
    vessels for transporting oil, gas, coal, and other fuels.
    (c) Petitions for monitoring or controls
      (1)(A) Any entity, including a trade association, firm, or
    certified or recognized union or group of workers, that is
    representative of an industry or a substantial segment of an
    industry that processes metallic materials capable of being
    recycled may transmit a written petition to the Secretary
    requesting the monitoring of exports or the imposition of export
    controls, or both, with respect to any such material, in order to
    carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(C) of this Act
    [section 2402(2)(C) of this Appendix].
      (B) Each petition shall be in such form as the Secretary shall
    prescribe and shall contain information in support of the action
    requested. The petition shall include any information reasonably
    available to the petitioner indicating that each of the criteria
    set forth in paragraph (3)(A) of this subsection is satisfied.
      (2) Within 15 days after receipt of any petition described in
    paragraph (1), the Secretary shall publish a notice in the Federal
    Register. The notice shall - 
        (A) include the name of the material that is the subject of the
      petition,
        (B) include the Schedule B number of the material as set forth
      in the Statistical Classification of Domestic and Foreign
      Commodities Exported from the United States,
        (C) indicate whether the petitioner is requesting that controls
      or monitoring, or both, be imposed with respect to the
      exportation of such material, and
        (D) provide that interested persons shall have a period of 30
      days beginning on the date of publication of such notice to
      submit to the Secretary written data, views or arguments, with or
      without opportunity for oral presentation, with respect to the
      matter involved.

    At the request of the petitioner or any other entity described in
    paragraph (1)(A) with respect to the material that is the subject
    of the petition, or at the request of any entity representative of
    producers or exporters of such material, the Secretary shall
    conduct public hearings with respect to the subject of the
    petition, in which case the 30-day period may be extended to 45
    days.
      (3)(A) Within 45 days after the end of the 30- or 45-day period
    described in paragraph (2), as the case may be, the Secretary shall
    determine whether to impose monitoring or controls, or both, on the
    export of the material that is the subject of the petition, in
    order to carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(C) of this
    Act [section 2402(2)(C) of this Appendix]. In making such
    determination, the Secretary shall determine whether - 
        (i) there has been a significant increase, in relation to a
      specific period of time, in exports of such material in relation
      to domestic supply and demand;
        (ii) there has been a significant increase in the domestic
      price of such material or a domestic shortage of such material
      relative to demand;
        (iii) exports of such material are as important as any other
      cause of a domestic price increase or shortage relative to demand
      found under clause (ii);
        (iv) a domestic price increase or shortage relative to demand
      found under clause (ii) has significantly adversely affected or
      may significantly adversely affect the national economy or any
      sector thereof, including a domestic industry; and
        (v) monitoring or controls, or both, are necessary in order to
      carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(C) of this Act
      [section 2402(2)(C) of this Appendix].

      (B) The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a
    detailed statement of the reasons for the Secretary's determination
    pursuant to subparagraph (A) of whether to impose monitoring or
    controls, or both, including the findings of fact in support of
    that determination.
      (4) Within 15 days after making a determination under paragraph
    (3) to impose monitoring or controls on the export of a material,
    the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register proposed
    regulations with respect to such monitoring or controls. Within 30
    days after the publication of such proposed regulations, and after
    considering any public comments on the proposed regulations, the
    Secretary shall publish and implement final regulations with
    respect to such monitoring or controls.
      (5) For purposes of publishing notices in the Federal Register
    and scheduling public hearings pursuant to this subsection, the
    Secretary may consolidate petitions, and responses to such
    petitions, which involve the same or related materials.
      (6) If a petition with respect to a particular material or group
    of materials has been considered in accordance with all the
    procedures prescribed in this subsection, the Secretary may
    determine, in the absence of significantly changed circumstances,
    that any other petition with respect to the same material or group
    of materials which is filed within 6 months after the consideration
    of the prior petition has been completed does not merit complete
    consideration under this subsection.
      (7) The procedures and time limits set forth in this subsection
    with respect to a petition filed under this subsection shall take
    precedence over any review undertaken at the initiative of the
    Secretary with respect to the same subject as that of the petition.
      (8) The Secretary may impose monitoring or controls, on a
    temporary basis, on the export of a metallic material after a
    petition is filed under paragraph (1)(A) with respect to that
    material but before the Secretary makes a determination under
    paragraph (3) with respect to that material only if - 
        (A) the failure to take such temporary action would result in
      irreparable harm to the entity filing the petition, or to the
      national economy or segment thereof, including a domestic
      industry, and
        (B) the Secretary considers such action to be necessary to
      carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(C) of this Act
      [section 2402(2)(C) of this Appendix].

      (9) The authority under this subsection shall not be construed to
    affect the authority of the Secretary under any other provision of
    this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix], except that if
    the Secretary determines, on the Secretary's own initiative, to
    impose monitoring or controls, or both, on the export of metallic
    materials capable of being recycled, under the authority of this
    section, the Secretary shall publish the reasons for such action in
    accordance with paragraph (3)(A) and (B) of this subsection.
      (10) Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed to
    preclude submission on a confidential basis to the Secretary of
    information relevant to a decision to impose or remove monitoring
    or controls under the authority of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420
    of this Appendix], or to preclude consideration of such information
    by the Secretary in reaching decisions required under this
    subsection. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed
    to affect the applicability of section 552(b) of title 5, United
    States Code.
    (d) Domestically produced crude oil
      (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act [sections
    2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] and notwithstanding subsection (u)
    of section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (30 U.S.C. 185),
    no domestically produced crude oil transported by pipeline over
    right-of-way granted pursuant to section 203 of the Trans-Alaska
    Pipeline Authorization Act (43 U.S.C. 1652) (except any such crude
    oil which (A) is exported to an adjacent foreign country to be
    refined and consumed therein in exchange for the same quantity of
    crude oil being exported from that country to the United States;
    such exchange must result through convenience or increased
    efficiency of transportation in lower prices for consumers of
    petroleum products in the United States as described in paragraph
    (2)(A)(ii) of this subsection, (B) is temporarily exported for
    convenience or increased efficiency of transportation across parts
    of an adjacent foreign country and reenters the United States, or
    (C) is transported to Canada, to be consumed therein, in amounts
    not to exceed an annual average of 50,000 barrels per day, in
    addition to exports under subparagraphs (A) and (B), except that
    any ocean transportation of such oil shall be by vessels documented
    under section 12106 (!1) of title 46, United States Code) may be
    exported from the United States, or any of its territories and
    possessions, subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection.
      (2) Crude oil subject to the prohibition contained in paragraph
    (1) may be exported only if - 
        (A) the President so recommends to the Congress after making
      and publishing express findings that exports of such crude oil,
      including exchanges - 
          (i) will not diminish the total quantity or quality of
        petroleum refined within, stored within, or legally committed
        to be transported to and sold within the United States;
          (ii) will, within 3 months following the initiation of such
        exports or exchanges, result in (I) acquisition costs to the
        refiners which purchase the imported crude oil being lower than
        the acquisition costs such refiners would have to pay for the
        domestically produced oil in the absence of such an export or
        exchange, and (II) not less than 75 percent of such savings in
        costs being reflected in wholesale and retail prices of
        products refined from such imported crude oil;
          (iii) will be made only pursuant to contracts which may be
        terminated if the crude oil supplies of the United States are
        interrupted, threatened, or diminished;
          (iv) are clearly necessary to protect the national interest;
        and
          (v) are in accordance with the provisions of this Act
        [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix]; and

        (B) the President includes such findings in his recommendation
      to the Congress and the Congress, within 60 days after receiving
      that recommendation, agrees to a joint resolution which approves
      such exports on the basis of those findings, and which is
      thereafter enacted into law.

      (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or any
    other provision of law, including subsection (u) of section 28 of
    the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 [30 U.S.C. 185(u)], the President
    may export oil to any country pursuant to a bilateral international
    oil supply agreement entered into by the United States with such
    nation before June 25, 1979, or to any country pursuant to the
    International Emergency Oil Sharing Plan of the International
    Energy Agency.
    (e) Refined petroleum products
      (1) In any case in which the President determines that it is
    necessary to impose export controls on refined petroleum products
    in order to carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(C) of
    this Act [section 2402(2)(C) of this Appendix], the President shall
    notify the Congress of that determination. The President shall also
    notify the Congress if and when he determines that such export
    controls are no longer necessary. During any period in which a
    determination that such export controls are necessary is in effect,
    no refined petroleum product may be exported except pursuant to an
    export license specifically authorizing such export. Not later than
    5 days after an application for a license to export any refined
    petroleum product or residual fuel oil is received, the Secretary
    shall notify the Congress of such application, together with the
    name of the exporter, the destination of the proposed export, and
    the amount and price of the proposed export. Such notification
    shall be made to the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs
    of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Committee
    on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.
      (2) The Secretary may not grant such license during the 30-day
    period beginning on the date on which notification to the Congress
    under paragraph (1) is received, unless the President certifies in
    writing to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the
    President pro tempore of the Senate that the proposed export is
    vital to the national interest and that a delay in issuing the
    license would adversely affect that interest.
      (3) This subsection shall not apply to (A) any export license
    application for exports to a country with respect to which
    historical export quotas established by the Secretary on the basis
    of past trading relationships apply, or (B) any license application
    for exports to a country if exports under the license would not
    result in more than 250,000 barrels of refined petroleum products
    being exported from the United States to such country in any fiscal
    year.
      (4) For purposes of this subsection, "refined petroleum product"
    means gasoline, kerosene, distillates, propane or butane gas,
    diesel fuel, and residual fuel oil refined within the United States
    or entered for consumption within the United States.
      (5) The Secretary may extend any time period prescribed in
    section 10 of this Act [section 2409 of this Appendix] to the
    extent necessary to take into account delays in action by the
    Secretary on a license application on account of the provisions of
    this subsection.
    (f) Certain petroleum products
      Petroleum products refined in United States Foreign Trade Zones,
    or in the United States Territory of Guam, from foreign crude oil
    shall be excluded from any quantitative restrictions imposed under
    this section except that, if the Secretary finds that a product is
    in short supply, the Secretary may issue such regulations as may be
    necessary to limit exports.
    (g) Agricultural commodities
      (1) The authority conferred by this section shall not be
    exercised with respect to any agricultural commodity, including
    fats and oils or animal hides or skins, without the approval of the
    Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary of Agriculture shall not
    approve the exercise of such authority with respect to any such
    commodity during any period for which the supply of such commodity
    is determined by the Secretary of Agriculture to be in excess of
    the requirements of the domestic economy except to the extent the
    President determines that such exercise of authority is required to
    carry out the policies set forth in subparagraph (A) or (B) of
    paragraph (2) of section 3 of this Act [section 2402(2)(A) or (B)
    of this Appendix]. The Secretary of Agriculture shall, by
    exercising the authorities which the Secretary of Agriculture has
    under other applicable provisions of law, collect data with respect
    to export sales of animal hides and skins.
      (2) Upon approval of the Secretary, in consultation with the
    Secretary of Agriculture, agricultural commodities purchased by or
    for use in a foreign country may remain in the United States for
    export at a later date free from any quantitative limitations on
    export which may be imposed to carry out the policy set forth in
    section 3(2)(C) of this Act [section 2402(2)(C) of this Appendix]
    subsequent to such approval. The Secretary may not grant such
    approval unless the Secretary receives adequate assurance and, in
    conjunction with the Secretary of Agriculture, finds (A) that such
    commodities will eventually be exported, (B) that neither the sale
    nor export thereof will result in an excessive drain of scarce
    materials and have a serious domestic inflationary impact, (C) that
    storage of such commodities in the United States will not unduly
    limit the space available for storage of domestically owned
    commodities, and (D) that the purpose of such storage is to
    establish a reserve of such commodities for later use, not
    including resale to or use by another country. The Secretary may
    issue such regulations as may be necessary to implement this
    paragraph.
      (3)(A) If the President imposes export controls on any
    agricultural commodity in order to carry out the policy set forth
    in paragraph (2)(B), (2)(C), (7), or (8) of section 3 of this Act
    [section 2402(2)(B), (2)(C), (7), or (8) of this Appendix], the
    President shall immediately transmit a report on such action to the
    Congress, setting forth the reasons for the controls in detail and
    specifying the period of time, which may not exceed 1 year, that
    the controls are proposed to be in effect. If the Congress, within
    60 days after the date of its receipt of the report, adopts a joint
    resolution pursuant to paragraph (4) approving the imposition of
    the export controls, then such controls shall remain in effect for
    the period specified in the report, or until terminated by the
    President, whichever occurs first. If the Congress, within 60 days
    after the date of its receipt of such report, fails to adopt a
    joint resolution approving such controls, then such controls shall
    cease to be effective upon the expiration of that 60-day period.
      (B) The provisions of subparagraph (A) and paragraph (4) shall
    not apply to export controls - 
        (i) which are extended under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of
      this Appendix] if the controls, when imposed, were approved by
      the Congress under subparagraph (A) and paragraph (4); or
        (ii) which are imposed with respect to a country as part of the
      prohibition or curtailment of all exports to that country.

      (4)(A) For purposes of this paragraph, the term "joint
    resolution" means only a joint resolution the matter after the
    resolving clause of which is as follows: "That, pursuant to section
    7(g)(3) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, the President may
    impose export controls as specified in the report submitted to the
    Congress on           .", with the blank space being filled with
    the appropriate date.
      (B) On the day on which a report is submitted to the House of
    Representatives and the Senate under paragraph (3), a joint
    resolution with respect to the export controls specified in such
    report shall be introduced (by request) in the House by the
    chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for himself and the
    ranking minority member of the Committee, or by Members of the
    House designated by the chairman and ranking minority member; and
    shall be introduced (by request) in the Senate by the majority
    leader of the Senate, for himself and the minority leader of the
    Senate, or by Members of the Senate designated by the majority
    leader and minority leader of the Senate. If either House is not in
    session on the day on which such a report is submitted, the joint
    resolution shall be introduced in that House, as provided in the
    preceding sentence, on the first day thereafter on which that House
    is in session.
      (C) All joint resolutions introduced in the House of
    Representatives shall be referred to the appropriate committee and
    all joint resolutions introduced in the Senate shall be referred to
    the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.
      (D) If the committee of either House to which a joint resolution
    has been referred has not reported the joint resolution at the end
    of 30 days after its referral, the committee shall be discharged
    from further consideration of the joint resolution or of any other
    joint resolution introduced with respect to the same matter.
      (E) A joint resolution under this paragraph shall be considered
    in the Senate in accordance with the provisions of section
    601(b)(4) of the International Security Assistance and Arms Export
    Control Act of 1976. For the purpose of expediting the
    consideration and passage of joint resolutions reported or
    discharged pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, it shall
    be in order for the Committee on Rules of the House of
    Representatives to present for consideration a resolution of the
    House of Representatives providing procedures for the immediate
    consideration of a joint resolution under this paragraph which may
    be similar, if applicable, to the procedures set forth in section
    601(b)(4) of the International Security Assistance and Arms Export
    Control Act of 1976.
      (F) In the case of a joint resolution described in subparagraph
    (A), if, before the passage by one House of a joint resolution of
    that House, that House receives a resolution with respect to the
    same matter from the other House, then - 
        (i) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if no
      joint resolution had been received from the other House; but
        (ii) the vote on final passage shall be on the joint resolution
      of the other House.

      (5) In the computation of the period of 60 days referred to in
    paragraph (3) and the period of 30 days referred to in subparagraph
    (D) of paragraph (4), there shall be excluded the days on which
    either House of Congress is not in session because of an
    adjournment of more than 3 days to a day certain or because of an
    adjournment of the Congress sine die.
    (h) Barter agreements
      (1) The exportation pursuant to a barter agreement of any goods
    which may lawfully be exported from the United States, for any
    goods which may lawfully be imported into the United States, may be
    exempted, in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection, from
    any quantitative limitation on exports (other than any reporting
    requirement) imposed to carry out the policy set forth in section
    3(2)(C) of this Act [section 2402(2)(C) of this Appendix].
      (2) The Secretary shall grant an exemption under paragraph (1) if
    the Secretary finds, after consultation with the appropriate
    department or agency of the United States, that - 
        (A) for the period during which the barter agreement is to be
      performed - 
          (i) the average annual quantity of the goods to be exported
        pursuant to the barter agreement will not be required to
        satisfy the average amount of such goods estimated to be
        required annually by the domestic economy and will be surplus
        thereto; and
          (ii) the average annual quantity of the goods to be imported
        will be less than the average amount of such goods estimated to
        be required annually to supplement domestic production; and

        (B) the parties to such barter agreement have demonstrated
      adequately that they intend, and have the capacity, to perform
      such barter agreement.

      (3) For purposes of this subsection, the term "barter agreement"
    means any agreement which is made for the exchange, without
    monetary consideration, of any goods produced in the United States
    for any goods produced outside of the United States.
      (4) This subsection shall apply only with respect to barter
    agreements entered into after the effective date of this Act
    [September 30, 1979].
    (i) Unprocessed red cedar
      (1) The Secretary shall require a validated license, under the
    authority contained in subsection (a) of this section, for the
    export of unprocessed western red cedar (Thuja plicata) logs,
    harvested from State or Federal lands. The Secretary shall impose
    quantitative restrictions upon the export of unprocessed western
    red cedar logs during the 3-year period beginning on the effective
    date of this Act [September 30, 1979] as follows:
        (A) Not more than thirty million board feet scribner of such
      logs may be exported during the first year of such 3-year period.
        (B) Not more than fifteen million board feet scribner of such
      logs may be exported during the second year of such period.
        (C) Not more than five million board feet scribner of such logs
      may be exported during the third year of such period.

    After the end of such 3-year period, no unprocessed western red
    cedar logs harvested from State or Federal lands may be exported
    from the United States.
      (2) To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary shall
    utilize the multiple validated export licenses described in section
    4(a)(2) of this Act [section 2403(a)(2) of this Appendix] in lieu
    of validated licenses for exports under this subsection.
      (3) The Secretary shall allocate export licenses to exporters
    pursuant to this subsection on the basis of a prior history of
    exportation by such exporters and such other factors as the
    Secretary considers necessary and appropriate to minimize any
    hardship to the producers of western red cedar and to further the
    foreign policy of the United States.
      (4) Unprocessed western red cedar logs shall not be considered to
    be an agricultural commodity for purposes of subsection (g) of this
    section.
      (5) As used in this subsection, the term "unprocessed western red
    cedar" means red cedar timber which has not been processed into - 
        (A) lumber of American Lumber Standards Grades of Number 3
      dimension or better, or Pacific Lumber Inspection Bureau Export R-
      List Grades of Number 3 common or better;
        (B) chips, pulp, and pulp products;
        (C) veneer and plywood;
        (D) poles, posts, or pilings cut or treated with preservative
      for use as such and not intended to be further processed; or
        (E) shakes and shingles.
    (j) Effect of controls on existing contracts
      The export restrictions contained in subsection (i) of this
    section and any export controls imposed under this section shall
    not affect any contract to harvest unprocessed western red cedar
    from State lands which was entered into before October 1, 1979, and
    the performance of which would make the red cedar available for
    export. Any export controls imposed under this section on any
    agricultural commodity (including fats, oils, and animal hides and
    skins) or on any forest product or fishery product, shall not
    affect any contract to export entered into before the date on which
    such controls are imposed. For purposes of this subsection, the
    term "contract to export" includes, but is not limited to, an
    export sales agreement and an agreement to invest in an enterprise
    which involves the export of goods or technology.
    (k) Oil exports for use by United States military facilities
      For purposes of subsection (d) of this section, and for purposes
    of any export controls imposed under this Act [sections 2401 to
    2420 of this Appendix], shipments of crude oil, refined petroleum
    products, or partially refined petroleum products from the United
    States for use by the Department of Defense or United States-
    supported installations or facilities shall not be considered to
    be exports.

    in relation to a specific period of time, in exports of such
    material in relation to domestic supply and demand, and whether
    exports of such material are as important as any other cause of the
    domestic price increase or shortage relative to demand, to allow
    the Secretary to impose monitoring, controls, or both, on a
    temporary basis after a petition is filed if the Secretary
    considers such action to be necessary to carry out the policy set
    forth in section 3(2)(C) of the Act, but before the Secretary makes
    a determination under par. (3) only if failure to take such
    temporary action would result in irreparable harm to the entity
    filing the petition, or to the national economy or segment thereof,
    including a domestic industry, requires that if the Secretary
    determines, on his initiative, to monitor, control, or both, the
    export of such material, the Secretary shall publish the reasons
    for such determination in accordance with par. (3)(A) and (B),
    requires that exports of material be as important as any other
    cause of the increased domestic prices or shortage, and sets a
    standard under which exports need not be the sole or principal
    cause of the price rise or domestic shortage in order for exports
    of the material to be controlled or monitored.

    setting forth the reasons therefor in detail. If the Congress,
    within 30 days after the date of its receipt of such report, adopts
    a concurrent resolution disapproving such prohibition or
    curtailment, then such prohibition or curtailment shall cease to be
    effective with the adoption of such resolution. In the computation
    of such 30-day period, there shall be excluded the days on which
    either House is not in session because of an adjournment of more

    issue regulations prohibiting any United States person, with
    respect to his activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of
    the United States, from taking or knowingly agreeing to take any of
    the following actions with intent to comply with, further, or
    support any boycott fostered or imposed by a foreign country

        (B) Refusing, or requiring any other person to refuse, to
      employ or otherwise discriminating against any United States

      investment, or supply) with or in the boycotted country, with any
      business concern organized under the laws of the boycotted
      country, with any national or resident of the boycotted country,

      prescribed by the boycotting country or the recipient of the
      shipment;
        (B) complying or agreeing to comply with import and shipping
      document requirements with respect to the country of origin, the
      name of the carrier and route of shipment, the name of the
      supplier of the shipment or the name of the provider of other
      services, except that no information knowingly furnished or
      conveyed in response to such requirements may be stated in
      negative, blacklisting, or similar exclusionary terms, other than

      requirements protecting against war risks and confiscation;
        (C) complying or agreeing to comply in the normal course of
      business with the unilateral and specific selection by a
      boycotting country, or national or resident thereof, of carriers,

      country or agreement by such person to comply with the laws of
      that country with respect to his activities exclusively therein,
      and such regulations may contain exceptions for such resident
      complying with the laws or regulations of that foreign country
      governing imports into such country of trademarked, trade named,
      or similarly specifically identifiable products, or components of
      products for his own use, including the performance of
      contractual services within that country, as may be defined by
      such regulations.

      (3) Regulations issued pursuant to paragraphs (2)(C) and (2)(F)
    shall not provide exceptions from paragraphs (1)(B) and (1)(C).
      (4) Nothing in this subsection may be construed to supersede or
    limit the operation of the antitrust or civil rights laws of the
    United States.
      (5) This section shall apply to any transaction or activity
    undertaken, by or through a United States person or any other
    person, with intent to evade the provisions of this section as
    implemented by the regulations issued pursuant to this subsection,
    and such regulations shall expressly provide that the exceptions
    set forth in paragraph (2) shall not permit activities or
    agreements (expressed or implied by a course of conduct, including
    a pattern of responses) otherwise prohibited, which are not within
    the intent of such exceptions.
    (b) Foreign policy controls
      (1) In addition to the regulations issued pursuant to subsection
    (a) of this section, regulations issued under section 6 of this Act
    [section 2405 of this Appendix] shall implement the policies set
    forth in section 3(5) [section 2402(5) of this Appendix].
      (2) Such regulations shall require that any United States person
    receiving a request for the furnishing of information, the entering
    into or implementing of agreements, or the taking of any other
    action referred to in section 3(5) [section 2402(5) of this
    Appendix] shall report that fact to the Secretary, together with
    such other information concerning such request as the Secretary may
    require for such action as the Secretary considers appropriate for
    carrying out the policies of that section. Such person shall also
    report to the Secretary whether such person intends to comply and
    whether such person has complied with such request. Any report
    filed pursuant to this paragraph shall be made available promptly
    for public inspection and copying, except that information
    regarding the quantity, description, and value of any goods or
    technology to which such report relates may be kept confidential if
    the Secretary determines that disclosure thereof would place the
    United States person involved at a competitive disadvantage. The
    Secretary shall periodically transmit summaries of the information
    contained in such reports to the Secretary of State for such action
    as the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary,
    considers appropriate for carrying out the policies set forth in

    governmental subdivision thereof, which law, rule, or regulation
    pertains to participation in, compliance with, implementation of,
    or the furnishing of information regarding restrictive trade
    practices or boycotts fostered or imposed by foreign countries
    against other countries.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2408. Procedures for hardship relief from export controls

-STATUTE-
    (a) Filing of petitions
      Any person who, in such person's domestic manufacturing process
    or other domestic business operation, utilizes a product produced
    abroad in whole or in part from a good historically obtained from
    the United States but which has been made subject to export
    controls, or any person who historically has exported such a good,
    may transmit a petition of hardship to the Secretary requesting an
    exemption from such controls in order to alleviate any unique
    hardship resulting from the imposition of such controls. A petition
    under this section shall be in such form as the Secretary shall
    prescribe and shall contain information demonstrating the need for
    the relief requested.
    (b) Decision of Secretary
      Not later than 30 days after receipt of any petition under
    subsection (a), the Secretary shall transmit a written decision to
    the petitioner granting or denying the requested relief. Such
    decision shall contain a statement setting forth the Secretary's
    basis for the grant or denial. Any exemption granted may be subject
    to such conditions as the Secretary considers appropriate.
    (c) Factors to be considered
      For purposes of this section, the Secretary's decision with
    respect to the grant or denial of relief from unique hardship
    resulting directly or indirectly from the imposition of export
    controls shall reflect the Secretary's consideration of factors
    such as the following:
        (1) Whether denial would cause a unique hardship to the
      petitioner which can be alleviated only by granting an exception
      to the applicable regulations. In determining whether relief
      shall be granted, the Secretary shall take into account - 
          (A) ownership of material for which there is no practicable
        domestic market by virtue of the location or nature of the
        material;
          (B) potential serious financial loss to the applicant if not
        granted an exception;
          (C) inability to obtain, except through import, an item
        essential for domestic use which is produced abroad from the
        good under control;
          (D) the extent to which denial would conflict, to the
        particular detriment of the applicant, with other national
        policies including those reflected in any international
        agreement to which the United States is a party;
          (E) possible adverse effects on the economy (including
        unemployment) in any locality or region of the United States;
        and
          (F) other relevant factors, including the applicant's lack of
        an exporting history during any base period that may be
        established with respect to export quotas for the particular
        good.

        (2) The effect a finding in favor of the applicant would have
      on attainment of the basic objectives of the short supply control
      program.

    In all cases, the desire to sell at higher prices and thereby
    obtain greater profits shall not be considered as evidence of a
    unique hardship, nor will circumstances where the hardship is due
    to imprudent acts or failure to act on the part of the petitioner.

    EXPORT REGULATION

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2409. Procedures for processing export license applications;
      other inquiries

-STATUTE-
    (a) Primary responsibility of Secretary
      (1) All export license applications required under this Act
    [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] shall be submitted by the
    applicant to the Secretary. All determinations with respect to any
    such application shall be made by the Secretary, subject to the
    procedures provided in this section.
      (2) It is the intent of the Congress that a determination with
    respect to any export license application be made to the maximum
    extent possible by the Secretary without referral of such
    application to any other department or agency of the Government.
      (3) To the extent necessary, the Secretary shall seek information
    and recommendations from the Government departments and agencies
    concerned with aspects of United States domestic and foreign
    policies and operations having an important bearing on exports.
    Such departments and agencies shall cooperate fully in rendering
    such information and recommendations.
    (b) Initial screening
      Within 10 days after the date on which any export license
    application is submitted pursuant to subsection (a)(1), the
    Secretary shall - 
        (1) send the applicant an acknowledgment of the receipt of the
      application and the date of the receipt;
        (2) submit to the applicant a written description of the
      procedures required by this section, the responsibilities of the
      Secretary and of other departments and agencies with respect to
      the application, and the rights of the applicant;
        (3) return the application without action if the application is
      improperly completed or if additional information is required,
      with sufficient information to permit the application to be
      properly resubmitted, in which case if such application is
      resubmitted, it shall be treated as a new application for the
      purpose of calculating the time periods prescribed in this
      section;
        (4) determine whether it is necessary to refer the application
      to any other department or agency and, if such referral is
      determined to be necessary, inform the applicant of any such
      department or agency to which the application will be referred;
      and
        (5) determine whether it is necessary to submit the application
      to a multilateral review process, pursuant to a multilateral
      agreement, formal or informal, to which the United States is a
      party and, if so, inform the applicant of this requirement.
    (c) Action on certain applications
      Except as provided in subsection (o), in each case in which the
    Secretary determines that it is not necessary to refer an
    application to any other department or agency for its information
    and recommendations, a license shall be formally issued or denied
    within 60 days after a properly completed application has been
    submitted pursuant to this section.
    (d) Referral to other departments and agencies
      Except in the case of exports described in subsection (o), in
    each case in which the Secretary determines that it is necessary to
    refer an application to any other department or agency for its
    information and recommendations, the Secretary shall, within 20
    days after the submission of a properly completed application - 
        (1) refer the application, together with all necessary analysis
      and recommendations of the Department of Commerce, concurrently
      to all such departments or agencies; and
        (2) if the applicant so requests, provide the applicant with an
      opportunity to review for accuracy any documentation to be
      referred to any such department or agency with respect to such
      application for the purpose of describing the export in question
      in order to determine whether such documentation accurately
      describes the proposed export.

    Notwithstanding the 10-day period set forth in subsection (b), in
    the case of exports described in subsection (o), in each case in
    which the Secretary determines that it is necessary to refer an
    application to any other department or agency for its information
    and recommendations, the Secretary shall, immediately upon receipt
    of the properly completed application, refer the application to
    such department or agency for its review. Such review shall be
    concurrent with that of the Department of Commerce.
    (e) Action by other departments and agencies
      (1) Any department or agency to which an application is referred
    pursuant to subsection (d) shall submit to the Secretary the
    information or recommendations requested with respect to the
    application. The information or recommendations shall be submitted
    within 20 days after the department or agency receives the
    application or, in the case of exports described in subsection (o),
    before the expiration of the time periods permitted by that
    subsection. Except as provided in paragraph (2), any such
    department or agency which does not submit its recommendations
    within the time period prescribed in the preceding sentence shall
    be deemed by the Secretary to have no objection to the approval of
    such application.
      (2)(A) Except in the case of exports described in subsection (o),
    if the head of any such department or agency notifies the Secretary
    before the expiration of the time period provided in paragraph (1)
    for submission of its recommendations that more time is required
    for review by such department or agency, such department or agency
    shall have an additional 20-day period to submit its
    recommendations to the Secretary. If such department or agency does
    not submit its recommendations within the time period prescribed by
    the preceding sentence, it shall be deemed by the Secretary to have
    no objection to the approval of such application.
      (B) In the case of exports described in subsection (o), if the
    head of any such department or agency notifies the Secretary,
    before the expiration of the 15-day period provided in subsection
    (o)(1), that more time is required for review by such department or
    agency, the Secretary shall notify the applicant, pursuant to
    subsection (o)(1)(C), that additional time is required to consider
    the application, and such department or agency shall have
    additional time to consider the application within the limits
    permitted by subsection (o)(2). If such department or agency does
    not submit its recommendations within the time periods permitted
    under subsection (o), it shall be deemed by the Secretary to have
    no objection to the approval of such application.
    (f) Action by Secretary
      (1) Within 60 days after receipt of the recommendations of other
    departments and agencies with respect to a license application, as
    provided in subsection (e), the Secretary shall formally issue or
    deny the license. In deciding whether to issue or deny a license,
    the Secretary shall take into account any recommendation of a
    department or agency with respect to the application in question.
    In cases where the Secretary receives conflicting recommendations,
    the Secretary shall, within the 60-day period provided for in this
    subsection, take such action as may be necessary to resolve such
    conflicting recommendations. The provisions of this paragraph shall
    not apply in the case of exports described in subsection (o).
      (2) In cases where the Secretary receives questions or negative
    considerations or recommendations from any other department or
    agency with respect to an application, the Secretary shall, to the
    maximum extent consistent with the national security and foreign
    policy of the United States, inform the applicant in writing of the
    specific questions raised and any such negative considerations or
    recommendations. Before a final determination with respect to the
    application is made, the applicant shall be entitled - 
        (A) to respond in writing to such questions, considerations, or
      recommendations within 30 days after receipt of such information
      from the Secretary; and
        (B) upon the filing of a written request with the Secretary
      within 15 days after the receipt of such information, to respond
      in person to the department or agency raising such questions,
      considerations, or recommendations.

    The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply in the case of
    exports described in subsection (o).
      (3) In cases where the Secretary has determined that an
    application should be denied, the applicant shall be informed in
    writing, within 5 days after such determination is made, of - 
        (A) the determination,
        (B) the statutory basis for the proposed denial,
        (C) the policies set forth in section 3 of this Act [section
      2402 of this Appendix] which would be furthered by the proposed
      denial,
        (D) what if any modifications in or restrictions on the goods
      or technology for which the license was sought would allow such
      export to be compatible with export controls imposed under this
      Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix],
        (E) which officers and employees of the Department of Commerce
      who are familiar with the application will be made reasonably
      available to the applicant for considerations with regard to such
      modifications or restrictions, if appropriate,
        (F) to the extent consistent with the national security and
      foreign policy of the United States, the specific considerations
      which led to the determination to deny the application, and
        (G) the availability of appeal procedures.

    The Secretary shall allow the applicant at least 30 days to respond
    to the Secretary's determination before the license application is
    denied. In the event decisions on license applications are deferred
    inconsistent with the provisions of this section, the applicant
    shall be so informed in writing within 5 days after such deferral.
      (4) If the Secretary determines that a particular application or
    set of applications is of exceptional importance and complexity,
    and that additional time is required for negotiations to modify the
    application or applications, the Secretary may extend any time
    period prescribed in this section. The Secretary shall notify the
    Congress and the applicant of such extension and the reasons
    therefor. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply in the
    case of exports described in subsection (o).
    (g) Special procedures for Secretary of Defense
      (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the
    Secretary of Defense is authorized to review any proposed export of
    any goods or technology to any country to which exports are
    controlled for national security purposes and, whenever the
    Secretary of Defense determines that the export of such goods or
    technology will make a significant contribution, which would prove
    detrimental to the national security of the United States, to the
    military potential of any such country, to recommend to the
    President that such export be disapproved.
      (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of
    Defense shall determine, in consultation with the Secretary, and
    confirm in writing the types and categories of transactions which
    should be reviewed by the Secretary of Defense in order to make a
    determination referred to in paragraph (1). Whenever a license or
    other authority is requested for the export to any country to which
    exports are controlled for national security purposes of goods or
    technology within any such type or category, the Secretary shall
    notify the Secretary of Defense of such request, and the Secretary
    may not issue any license or other authority pursuant to such
    request before the expiration of the period within which the
    President may disapprove such export. The Secretary of Defense
    shall carefully consider any notification submitted by the
    Secretary pursuant to this paragraph and, not later than 20 days
    after notification of the request, shall - 
        (A) recommend to the President and the Secretary that he
      disapprove any request for the export of the goods or technology
      involved to the particular country if the Secretary of Defense
      determines that the export of such goods or technology will make
      a significant contribution, which would prove detrimental to the
      national security of the United States, to the military potential
      of such country or any other country;
        (B) notify the Secretary that he would recommend approval
      subject to specified conditions; or
        (C) recommend to the Secretary that the export of goods or
      technology be approved.

    Whenever the Secretary of Defense makes a recommendation to the
    President pursuant to paragraph (2)(A), the Secretary shall also
    submit his recommendation to the President on the request to export
    if the Secretary differs with the Secretary of Defense. If the
    President notifies the Secretary, within 20 days after receiving a
    recommendation from the Secretary of Defense, that he disapproves
    such export, no license or other authority may be issued for the
    export of such goods or technology to such country. If the
    Secretary of Defense fails to make a recommendation or notification
    under this paragraph within the 20-day period specified in the
    third sentence, or if the President, within 20 days after receiving
    a recommendation from the Secretary of Defense with respect to an
    export, fails to notify the Secretary that he approves or
    disapproves the export, the Secretary shall approve or deny the
    request for a license or other authority to export without such
    recommendation or notification.
      (3) The Secretary shall approve or disapprove a license
    application, and issue or deny a license, in accordance with the
    provisions of this subsection, and, to the extent applicable, in
    accordance with the time periods and procedures otherwise set forth
    in this section.
    (h) Multilateral controls
      In any case in which an application, which has been finally
    approved under subsection (c), (f), or (g) of this section, is
    required to be submitted to a multilateral review process, pursuant
    to a multilateral agreement, formal or informal, to which the
    United States is a party, the license shall not be issued as
    prescribed in such subsections, but the Secretary shall notify the
    applicant of the approval of the application (and the date of such
    approval) by the Secretary subject to such multilateral review. The
    license shall be issued upon approval of the application under such
    multilateral review. If such multilateral review has not resulted
    in a determination with respect to the application within 40 days
    after such date, the Secretary's approval of the license shall be
    final and the license shall be issued, unless the Secretary
    determines that issuance of the license would prove detrimental to
    the national security of the United States. At the time at which
    the Secretary makes such a determination, the Secretary shall
    notify the applicant of the determination and shall notify the
    Congress of the determination, the reasons for the determination,
    the reasons for which the multilateral review could not be
    concluded within such 40-day period, and the actions planned or
    being taken by the United States Government to secure conclusion of
    the multilateral review. At the end of every 40-day period after
    such notification to Congress, the Secretary shall advise the
    applicant and the Congress of the status of the application, and
    shall report to the Congress in detail on the reasons for the
    further delay and any further actions being taken by the United
    States Government to secure conclusion of the multilateral review.
    In addition, at the time at which the Secretary issues or denies
    the license upon conclusion of the multilateral review, the
    Secretary shall notify the Congress of such issuance or denial and
    of the total time required for the multilateral review.
    (i) Records
      The Secretary and any department or agency to which any
    application is referred under this section shall keep accurate
    records with respect to all applications considered by the
    Secretary or by any such department or agency, including, in the
    case of the Secretary, any dissenting recommendations received from
    any such department or agency.
    (j) Appeal and court action
      (1) The Secretary shall establish appropriate procedures for any
    applicant to appeal to the Secretary the denial of an export
    license application of the applicant.
      (2) In any case in which any action prescribed in this section is
    not taken on a license application within the time periods
    established by this section (except in the case of a time period
    extended under subsection (f)(4) of which the applicant is
    notified), the applicant may file a petition with the Secretary
    requesting compliance with the requirements of this section. When
    such petition is filed, the Secretary shall take immediate steps to
    correct the situation giving rise to the petition and shall
    immediately notify the applicant of such steps.
      (3) If, within 20 days after a petition is filed under paragraph
    (2), the processing of the application has not been brought into
    conformity with the requirements of this section, or the
    application has been brought into conformity with such requirements
    but the Secretary has not so notified the applicant, the applicant
    may bring an action in an appropriate United States district court
    for a restraining order, a temporary or permanent injunction, or
    other appropriate relief, to require compliance with the
    requirements of this section. The United States district courts
    shall have jurisdiction to provide such relief, as appropriate.
    (k) Changes in requirements for applications
      Except as provided in subsection (b)(3) of this section, in any
    case in which, after a license application is submitted, the
    Secretary changes the requirements for such a license application,
    the Secretary may request appropriate additional information of the
    applicant, but the Secretary may not return the application to the
    applicant without action because it fails to meet the changed
    requirements.
    (l) Other inquiries
      (1) In any case in which the Secretary receives a written request
    asking for the proper classification of a good or technology on the
    control list, the Secretary shall, within 10 working days after
    receipt of the request, inform the person making the request of the
    proper classification.
      (2) In any case in which the Secretary receives a written request
    for information about the applicability of export license
    requirements under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this
    Appendix] to a proposed export transaction or series of
    transactions, the Secretary shall, within 30 days after receipt of
    the request, reply with that information to the person making the
    request.
    (m) Small business assistance
      Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this
    subsection [July 12, 1985], the Secretary shall develop and
    transmit to the Congress a plan to assist small businesses in the
    export licensing application process under this Act [sections 2401
    to 2420 of this Appendix]. The plan shall include, among other
    things, arrangements for counseling small businesses on filing
    applications and identifying goods or technology on the control
    list, proposals for seminars and conferences to educate small
    businesses on export controls and licensing procedures, and the
    preparation of informational brochures. The Secretary shall, not
    later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of the Export
    Enhancement Act of 1988 [Aug. 23, 1988], report to the Congress on
    steps taken to implement the plan developed under this subsection
    to assist small businesses in the export licensing application
    process.
    (n) Reports on license applications
      (1) Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of
    this subsection [July 12, 1985], and not later than the end of each
    3-month period thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to the
    Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and to
    the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate

      preceding 3-month period and which required a period longer than
      the period permitted under subsection (c), (f)(1), or (h) of this
      section, as the case may be, before notification of a decision to
      approve or deny the application was sent to the applicant; and
        (B) in a separate section, all applications which have been in
      process for a period longer than the period permitted under

      be, and upon which final action has not been taken.

      (2) With regard to each application, each listing shall identify -

        (B) the value of the goods or technology to which the
      application relates;

      of the last day of the 3-month period to which the report
      relates, or the date on which notification of approval or denial
      of the application was sent to the applicant.

      referred;
        (B) the date or dates of such referral; and
        (C) the date or dates on which recommendations were received

    Secretary of an individual validated license application for the
    export of goods or technology to a country that maintains export
    controls on such goods or technology pursuant to the agreement of
    the governments participating in the group known as the
    Coordinating Committee, a license for the transaction specified in
    the application shall become valid and effective and the goods or
    technology are authorized for export pursuant to such license

    necessary to the establishment of liability. Except as provided in

    TITLE 50, APPENDIX - WAR AND NATIONAL DEFENSE
    EXPORT REGULATION

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2410a. Multilateral export control violations

-STATUTE-
    (a) Determination by the President
      The President, subject to subsection (c), shall apply sanctions
    under subsection (b) for a period of not less than 2 years and not
    more than 5 years, if the President determines that - 
        (1) a foreign person has violated any regulation issued by a
      country to control exports for national security purposes
      pursuant to the agreement of the group known as the Coordinating
      Committee, and
        (2) such violation has resulted in substantial enhancement of
      Soviet and East bloc capabilities in submarine or antisubmarine
      warfare, ballistic or antiballistic missile technology, strategic
      aircraft, command, control, communications and intelligence, or
      other critical technologies as determined by the President, on
      the advice of the National Security Council, to represent a
      serious adverse impact on the strategic balance of forces.

    The President shall notify the Congress of each action taken under
    this section. This section, except subsections (h) and (j), applies
    only to violations that occur after the date of the enactment of
    the Export Enhancement Act of 1988 [Aug. 23, 1988].
    (b) Sanctions
      The sanctions referred to in subsection (a) shall apply to the
    foreign person committing the violation, as well as to any parent,
    affiliate, subsidiary, and successor entity of the foreign person,
    and, except as provided in subsection (c), are as follows:
        (1) a prohibition on contracting with, and procurement of
      products and services from, a sanctioned person, by any
      department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States
      Government, and
        (2) a prohibition on importation into the United States of all
      products produced by a sanctioned person.
    (c) Exceptions
      The President shall not apply sanctions under this section - 
        (1) in the case of procurement of defense articles or defense
      services - 
          (A) under existing contracts or subcontracts, including the
        exercise of options for production quantities to satisfy United
        States operational military requirements;
          (B) if the President determines that the foreign person or
        other entity to which the sanctions would otherwise be applied
        is a sole source supplier of essential defense articles or
        services and no alternative supplier can be identified; or
          (C) if the President determines that such articles or
        services are essential to the national security under defense
        coproduction agreements; or

        (2) to - 
          (A) products or services provided under contracts or other
        binding agreements (as such terms are defined by the President
        in regulations) entered into before the date on which the
        President notifies the Congress of the intention to impose the
        sanctions;
          (B) spare parts;
          (C) component parts, but not finished products, essential to
        United States products or production;
          (D) routine servicing and maintenance of products; or
          (E) information and technology.
    (d) Exclusion
      The President shall not apply sanctions under this section to a
    parent, affiliate, subsidiary, and successor entity of a foreign
    person if the President determines that - 
        (1) the parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or successor entity (as
      the case may be) has not knowingly violated the export control
      regulation violated by the foreign person, and
        (2) the government of the country with jurisdiction over the
      parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or successor entity had in effect,
      at the time of the violation by the foreign person, an effective
      export control system consistent with principles agreed to in the
      Coordinating Committee, including the following:
          (A) national laws providing appropriate civil and criminal
        penalties and statutes of limitations sufficient to deter
        potential violations;
          (B) a program to evaluate export license applications that
        includes sufficient technical expertise to assess the licensing
        status of exports and ensure the reliability of end-users;
          (C) an enforcement mechanism that provides authority for
        trained enforcement officers to investigate and prevent illegal
        exports;
          (D) a system of export control documentation to verify the
        movement of goods and technology; and
          (E) procedures for the coordination and exchange of
        information concerning violations of the agreement of the
        Coordinating Committee.
    (e) Definitions
      For purposes of this section - 
        (1) the term "component part" means any article which is not
      usable for its intended functions without being imbedded in or
      integrated into any other product and which, if used in
      production of a finished product, would be substantially
      transformed in that process;
        (2) the term "finished product" means any article which is
      usable for its intended functions without being imbedded or
      integrated into any other product, but in no case shall such term
      be deemed to include an article produced by a person other than a
      sanctioned person that contains parts or components of the
      sanctioned person if the parts or components have been
      substantially transformed during production of the finished
      product; and
        (3) the term "sanctioned person" means a foreign person, and
      any parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or successor entity of the
      foreign person, upon whom sanctions have been imposed under this
      section.
    (f) Subsequent modifications of sanctions
      The President may, after consultation with the Congress, limit
    the scope of sanctions applied to a parent, affiliate, subsidiary,
    or successor entity of the foreign person determined to have
    committed the violation on account of which the sanctions were
    imposed if the President determines that - 
        (1) the parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or successor entity (as
      the case may be) has not, on the basis of available evidence,
      itself violated the export control regulation involved, either
      directly or through a course of conduct;
        (2) the government with jurisdiction over the parent,
      affiliate, subsidiary, or successor entity has improved its
      export control system as measured by the criteria set forth in
      subsection (d)(2);
        (3) the parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or successor entity, has
      instituted improvements in internal controls sufficient to detect
      and prevent violations of the export control regime implemented
      under paragraph (2); and
        (4) the impact of the sanctions imposed on the parent,
      affiliate, subsidiary, or successor entity is proportionate to
      the increased defense expenditures imposed on the United States.

    Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the President may not limit
    the scope of the sanction referred to in subsection (b)(1) with
    respect to the parent of the foreign person determined to have
    committed the violation, until that sanction has been in effect for
    at least 2 years.
    (g) Reports to Congress
      The President shall include in the annual report submitted under
    section 14 [section 2413 of this Appendix], a report on the status
    of any sanctions imposed under this section, including any
    exceptions, exclusions, or modifications of sanctions that have
    been applied under subsection (c), (d), or (f).
    (h) Discretionary imposition of sanctions
      If the President determines that a foreign person has violated a
    regulation issued by a country to control exports for national
    security purposes pursuant to the agreement of the group known as
    the Coordinating Committee, but in a case in which subsection
    (a)(2) may not apply, the President may apply the sanctions
    referred to in subsection (b) against that foreign person for a
    period of not more than 5 years.
    (i) Compensation for diversion of militarily critical technologies
      to controlled countries
      (1) In cases in which sanctions have been applied against a
    foreign person under subsection (a), the President shall initiate
    discussions with the foreign person and the government with
    jurisdiction over that foreign person regarding compensation on the
    part of the foreign person in an amount proportionate to the costs
    of research and development and procurement of new defensive
    systems by the United States and the allies of the United States to
    counteract the effect of the technological advance achieved by the
    Soviet Union as a result of the violation by that foreign person.
      (2) The President shall, at the time that discussions are
    initiated under paragraph (1), report to the Congress that such
    discussions are being undertaken, and shall report to the Congress
    the outcome of those discussions.
    (j) Other actions by the President
      Upon making a determination under subsection (a) or (h), the
    President shall - 
        (1) initiate consultations with the foreign government with
      jurisdiction over the foreign person who committed the violation
      involved, in order to seek prompt remedial action by that
      government;
        (2) initiate discussions with the governments participating in
      the Coordinating Committee regarding the violation and means to
      ensure that similar violations do not occur; and
        (3) consult with and report to the Congress on the nature of
      the violation and the actions the President proposes to take, or
      has taken, to rectify the situation.
    (k) Damages for certain violations
      (1) In any case in which the President makes a determination
    under subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense shall determine the
    costs of restoring the military preparedness of the United States
    on account of the violation involved. The Secretary of Defense
    shall notify the Attorney General of his determination, and the
    Attorney General may bring an action for damages, in any
    appropriate district court of the United States, to recover such
    costs against the person who committed the violation, any person
    that is owned or controlled by the person who committed the
    violation, and any person who owns and controls the person who
    committed the violation.
      (3) (!1) The total amount awarded in any case brought under
    paragraph (2) (!1) shall be determined by the court in light of the
    facts and circumstances, but shall not exceed the amount of the net
    loss to the national security of the United States. An action under
    this subsection shall be commenced not later than 3 years after the
    violation occurs, or one year after the violation is discovered,
    whichever is later.

    (l) Definition
      For purposes of this section, the term "foreign person" means any
    person other than a United States person.

          (i) If the item involved in the export, transfer, or trade is
        within category II of the MTCR Annex, then the President shall
        deny, for a period of 2 years, licenses for the transfer to
        such foreign person of missile equipment or technology the
        export of which is controlled under this Act [sections 2401 to
        2420 of this Appendix].
          (ii) If the item involved in the export, transfer, or trade
        is within category I of the MTCR Annex, then the President
        shall deny, for a period of not less than 2 years, licenses for
        the transfer to such foreign person of items the export of
        which is controlled under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of
        this Appendix].
          (iii) If, in addition to actions taken under clauses (i) and
        (ii), the President determines that the export, transfer, or
        trade has substantially contributed to the design, development,
        or production of missiles in a country that is not an MTCR
        adherent, then the President shall prohibit, for a period of
        not less than 2 years, the importation into the United States
        of products produced by that foreign person.
      (2) Inapplicability with respect to MTCR adherents
        Paragraph (1) does not apply with respect to - 
          (A) any export, transfer, or trading activity that is
        authorized by the laws of an MTCR adherent, if such
        authorization is not obtained by misrepresentation or fraud; or
          (B) any export, transfer, or trade of an item to an end user
        in a country that is an MTCR adherent.
      (3) Effect of enforcement actions by MTCR adherents
        Sanctions set forth in paragraph (1) may not be imposed under
      this subsection on a person with respect to acts described in
      such paragraph or, if such sanctions are in effect against a
      person on account of such acts, such sanctions shall be
      terminated, if an MTCR adherent is taking judicial or other
      enforcement action against that person with respect to such acts,
      or that person has been found by the government of an MTCR
      adherent to be innocent of wrongdoing with respect to such acts.
      (4) Advisory opinions
        The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State and
      the Secretary of Defense, may, upon the request of any person,
      issue an advisory opinion to that person as to whether a proposed
      activity by that person would subject that person to sanctions
      under this subsection. Any person who relies in good faith on
      such an advisory opinion which states that the proposed activity
      would not subject a person to such sanctions, and any person who
      thereafter engages in such activity, may not be made subject to
      such sanctions on account of such activity.
      (5) Waiver and report to Congress
        (A) In any case other than one in which an advisory opinion has
      been issued under paragraph (4) stating that a proposed activity
      would not subject a person to sanctions under this subsection,
      the President may waive the application of paragraph (1) to a
      foreign person if the President determines that such waiver is
      essential to the national security of the United States.
        (B) In the event that the President decides to apply the waiver
      described in subparagraph (A), the President shall so notify the
      Congress not less than 20 working days before issuing the waiver.
      Such notification shall include a report fully articulating the
      rationale and circumstances which led the President to apply the
      waiver.
      (6) Additional waiver
        The President may waive the imposition of sanctions under
      paragraph (1) on a person with respect to a product or service if
      the President certifies to the Congress that - 
          (A) the product or service is essential to the national
        security of the United States; and
          (B) such person is a sole source supplier of the product or
        service, the product or service is not available from any
        alternative reliable supplier, and the need for the product or
        service cannot be met in a timely manner by improved
        manufacturing processes or technological developments.
      (7) Exceptions
        The President shall not apply the sanction under this

          requirements essential to the national security of the United
          States;
            (ii) if the President determines that the person to which
          the sanctions would be applied is a sole source supplier of
          the defense articles and services, that the defense articles
          or services are essential to the national security of the
          United States, and that alternative sources are not readily
          or reasonably available; or
            (iii) if the President determines that such articles or
          services are essential to the national security of the United
          States under defense coproduction agreements or NATO Programs
          of Cooperation;

          (B) to products or services provided under contracts entered

    [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix]:
        (i) Stop, search, and examine a vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or
      person on which or whom such officer has reasonable cause to
      suspect there are any goods or technology that has been, is
      being, or is about to be exported from the United States in
      violation of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix].
        (ii) Search any package or container in which such officer has
      reasonable cause to suspect there are any goods or technology
      that has been, is being, or is about to be exported from the
      United States in violation of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of
      this Appendix].
        (iii) Detain (after search) or seize and secure for trial any
      goods or technology on or about such vehicle, vessel, aircraft,
      or person, or in such package or container, if such officer has
      probable cause to believe the goods or technology has been, is
      being, or is about to be exported from the United States in
      violation of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix].
        (iv) Make arrests without warrant for any violation of this Act
      [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] committed in his or her

      such a violation.

    The arrest authority conferred by clause (iv) of this subparagraph
    is in addition to any arrest authority under other laws. The
    Customs Service may not detain for more than 20 days any shipment
    of goods or technology eligible for export under a general license
    under section 4(a)(3) [section 2403(a)(3) of this Appendix]. In a
    case in which such detention is on account of a disagreement
    between the Secretary and the head of any other department or
    agency with export license authority under other provisions of law
    concerning the export license requirements for such goods or
    technology, such disagreement shall be resolved within that 20-day
    period. At the end of that 20-day period, the Customs Service shall
    either release the goods or technology, or seize the goods or
    technology as authorized by other provisions of law.
      (3)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the

    2420 of this Appendix], the Secretary is authorized to search,
    detain (after search), and seize goods or technology at those
    places within the United States other than those ports specified in
    paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection. The search, detention (after
    search), or seizure of goods or technology at those ports and
    places specified in paragraph (2)(A) may be conducted by officers
    or employees of the Department of Commerce designated by the
    Secretary with the concurrence of the Commissioner of Customs or a
    person designated by the Commissioner.
      (B) The Secretary may designate any employee of the Office of
    Export Enforcement of the Department of Commerce to do the
    following in carrying out enforcement authority under this Act
    [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix]:
        (i) Execute any warrant or other process issued by a court or
      officer of competent jurisdiction with respect to the enforcement
      of the provisions of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this
      Appendix].
        (ii) Make arrests without warrant for any violation of this Act
      [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] committed in his or her
      presence or view, or if the officer or employee has probable
      cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or
      is committing such a violation.
        (iii) Carry firearms in carrying out any activity described in
      clause (i) or (ii).

      (4) The authorities first conferred by the Export Administration
    Amendments Act of 1985 under paragraph (3) shall be exercised
    pursuant to guidelines approved by the Attorney General. Such
    guidelines shall be issued not later than 120 days after the date
    of the enactment of the Export Administration Amendments Act of
    1985 [July 12, 1985].
      (5) All cases involving violations of this Act [sections 2401 to
    2420 of this Appendix] shall be referred to the Secretary for
    purposes of determining civil penalties and administrative
    sanctions under section 11(c) of this Act [section 2410(c) of this
    Appendix], or to the Attorney General for criminal action in
    accordance with this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix].
      (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the United States
    Customs Service may expend in the enforcement of export controls
    under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] not more
    than $12,000,000 in the fiscal year 1985 and not more than
    $14,000,000 in the fiscal year 1986.
      (7) Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of the
    Export Administration Amendments Act of 1985 [July 12, 1985], the
    Secretary, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury,

    of the Treasury, may publish procedures for the sharing of
    information in accordance with subsection (c)(3) of this section,
    and procedures for the submission to the appropriate departments
    and agencies by private persons of information relating to the
    enforcement of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix].
      (8) For purposes of this section, a reference to the enforcement
    of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] or to a
    violation of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix]
    includes a reference to the enforcement or a violation of any
    regulation, order, or license issued under this Act [sections 2401
    to 2420 of this Appendix].
    (b) Immunity
      No person shall be excused from complying with any requirements
    under this section because of his privilege against self-
    incrimination, but the immunity provisions of section 6002 of
    title 18, United States Code, shall apply with respect to any
    individual who specifically claims such privilege.
    (c) Confidentiality
      (1) Except as otherwise provided by the third sentence of section
    8(b)(2) [section 2407(b)(2) of this Appendix] and by section
    11(c)(2)(C) of this Act [section 2410(c)(2)(C) of this Appendix],
    information obtained under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this
    Appendix] on or before June 30, 1980, which is deemed confidential,
    including Shippers' Export Declarations, or with reference to which
    a request for confidential treatment is made by the person
    furnishing such information, shall be exempt from disclosure under
    section 552 of title 5, United States Code, and such information
    shall not be published or disclosed unless the Secretary determines
    that the withholding thereof is contrary to the national interest.
    Information obtained under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this
    Appendix] after June 30, 1980, may be withheld only to the extent
    permitted by statute, except that information obtained for the
    purpose of consideration of, or concerning, license applications
    under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] shall be
    withheld from public disclosure unless the release of such
    information is determined by the Secretary to be in the national
    interest. Enactment of this subsection shall not affect any
    judicial proceeding commenced under section 552 of title 5, United
    States Code, to obtain access to boycott reports submitted prior to
    October 31, 1976, which was pending on May 15, 1979; but such
    proceeding shall be continued as if this Act [sections 2401 to 2420
    of this Appendix] had not been enacted.
      (2) Nothing in this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix]
    shall be construed as authorizing the withholding of information
    from the Congress or from the Government Accountability Office. All
    information obtained at any time under this Act [sections 2401 to
    2420 of this Appendix] or previous Acts regarding the control of
    exports, including any report or license application required under
    this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix], shall be made
    available to any committee or subcommittee of Congress of
    appropriate jurisdiction upon request of the chairman or ranking
    minority member of such committee or subcommittee. No such
    committee or subcommittee, or member thereof, shall disclose any
    information obtained under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this
    Appendix] or previous Acts regarding the control of exports which
    is submitted on a confidential basis unless the full committee
    determines that the withholding of that information is contrary to
    the national interest. Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this
    subsection, information referred to in the second sentence of this
    paragraph shall, consistent with the protection of intelligence,
    counterintelligence, and law enforcement sources, methods, and
    activities, as determined by the agency that originally obtained
    the information, and consistent with the provisions of section 313
    of the Budget and Accounting Act 1921 [31 U.S.C. 716], be made
    available only by that agency, upon request, to the Comptroller
    General of the United States or to any officer or employee of the
    Government Accountability Office who is authorized by the
    Comptroller General to have access to such information. No officer
    or employee of the Government Accountability Office shall disclose,
    except to the Congress in accordance with this paragraph, any such
    information which is submitted on a confidential basis and from
    which any individual can be identified.
      (3) Any department or agency which obtains information which is
    relevant to the enforcement of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of
    this Appendix], including information pertaining to any
    investigation, shall furnish such information to each department or
    agency with enforcement responsibilities under this Act [sections
    2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] to the extent consistent with the
    protection of intelligence, counterintelligence, and law
    enforcement sources, methods, and activities. The provisions of
    this paragraph shall not apply to information subject to the
    restrictions set forth in section 9 of title 13, United States
    Code; and return information, as defined in subsection (b) of
    section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C.
    6103(b)], may be disclosed only as authorized by such section. The
    Secretary and the Commissioner of Customs, upon request, shall
    exchange any licensing and enforcement information with each other
    which is necessary to facilitate enforcement efforts and effective
    license decisions. The Secretary, the Attorney General, and the
    Commissioner of Customs shall consult on a continuing basis with
    one another and with the heads of other departments and agencies
    which obtain information subject to this paragraph, in order to
    facilitate the exchange of such information.
    (d) Reporting requirements
      In the administration of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this
    Appendix], reporting requirements shall be so designed as to reduce
    the cost of reporting, recordkeeping, and export documentation
    required under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] to
    the extent feasible consistent with effective enforcement and
    compilation of useful trade statistics. Reporting, recordkeeping,
    and export documentation requirements shall be periodically
    reviewed and revised in the light of developments in the field of
    information technology.
    (e) Simplification of regulations
      The Secretary, in consultation with appropriate United States
    Government departments and agencies and with appropriate technical
    advisory committees established under section 5(h) [section 2404(h)
    of this Appendix], shall review the regulations issued under this
    Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] and the commodity
    control list in order to determine how compliance with the
    provisions of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] can
    be facilitated by simplifying such regulations, by simplifying or
    clarifying such list, or by any other means.

      It is the intent of the Congress that, to the extent practicable,
    all regulations imposing controls on exports under this Act
    [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] be issued in proposed form
    with meaningful opportunity for public comment before taking
    effect. In cases where a regulation imposing controls under this
    Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] is issued with
    immediate effect, it is the intent of the Congress that meaningful
    opportunity for public comment also be provided and that the

    under section 11 of this Act [section 2410 of this Appendix], the
    charged party is entitled to receive a formal complaint specifying
    the charges and, at his or her request, to contest the charges in a
    hearing before an administrative law judge. Subject to the
    provisions of this subsection, any such hearing shall be conducted

    Code. With the approval of the administrative law judge, the
    Government may present evidence in camera in the presence of the
    charged party or his or her representative. After the hearing, the
    administrative law judge shall make findings of fact and
    conclusions of law in a written decision, which shall be referred
    to the Secretary. The Secretary shall, in a written order, affirm,
    modify, or vacate the decision of the administrative law judge
    within 30 days after receiving the decision. The order of the
    Secretary shall be final and is not subject to judicial review,
    except as provided in paragraph (3).
      (2) The proceedings described in paragraph (1) shall be concluded
    within a period of 1 year after the complaint is submitted, unless
    the administrative law judge extends such period for good cause
    shown.
      (3) The order of the Secretary under paragraph (1) shall be
    final, except that the charged party may, within 15 days after the
    order is issued, appeal the order in the United States Court of
    Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which shall have
    jurisdiction of the appeal. The court may, while the appeal is
    pending, stay the order of the Secretary. The court may review only
    those issues necessary to determine liability for the civil penalty
    or other sanction involved. In an appeal filed under this
    paragraph, the court shall set aside any finding of fact for which
    the court finds there is not substantial evidence on the record and
    any conclusion of law which the court finds to be arbitrary,
    capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance
    with law.
      (4) An administrative law judge referred to in this subsection
    shall be appointed by the Secretary from among those considered
    qualified for selection and appointment under section 3105 of title
    5, United States Code. Any person who, for at least 2 of the 10
    years immediately preceding the date of the enactment of the Export
    Administration Amendments Act of 1985 [July 12, 1985], has served
    as a hearing commissioner of the Department of Commerce shall be
    included among those considered as qualified for selection and
    appointment to such position.
    (d) Imposition of temporary denial orders
      (1) In any case in which it is necessary, in the public interest,
    to prevent an imminent violation of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420
    of this Appendix] or any regulation, order, or license issued under
    this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix], the Secretary
    may, without a hearing, issue an order temporarily denying United
    States export privileges (hereinafter in this subsection referred
    to as a "temporary denial order") to a person. A temporary denial
    order may be effective no longer than 180 days unless renewed in
    writing by the Secretary for additional 180-day periods in order to
    prevent such an imminent violation, except that a temporary denial
    order may be renewed only after notice and an opportunity for a
    hearing is provided.
      (2) A temporary denial order shall define the imminent violation
    and state why the temporary denial order was granted without a
    hearing. The person or persons subject to the issuance or renewal
    of a temporary denial order may file an appeal of the issuance or
    renewal of the temporary denial order with an administrative law
    judge who shall, within 10 working days after the appeal is filed,
    recommend that the temporary denial order be affirmed, modified, or
    vacated. Parties may submit briefs and other material to the judge.
    The recommendation of the administrative law judge shall be
    submitted to the Secretary who shall either accept, reject, or
    modify the recommendation by written order within 5 working days
    after receiving the recommendation. The written order of the
    Secretary under the preceding sentence shall be final and is not
    subject to judicial review, except as provided in paragraph (3).
    The temporary denial order shall be affirmed only if it is
    reasonable to believe that the order is required in the public
    interest to prevent an imminent violation of this Act [sections
    2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] or any regulation, order, or license
    issued under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix]. All
    materials submitted to the administrative law judge and the
    Secretary shall constitute the administrative record for purposes
    of review by the courts.
      (3) An order of the Secretary affirming, in whole or in part, the
    issuance of a temporary denial order may, within 15 days after the
    order is issued, be appealed by a person subject to the order to
    the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
    Circuit, which shall have jurisdiction of the appeal. The court may
    review only those issues necessary to determine whether the
    standard for issuing the temporary denial order has been met. The
    court shall vacate the Secretary's order if the court finds that
    the Secretary's order is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of
    discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.
    (e) Appeals from license denials
      A determination of the Secretary, under section 10(f) of this Act
    [section 2409(f) of this Appendix], to deny a license may be
    appealed by the applicant to an administrative law judge who shall
    have the authority to conduct proceedings to determine only whether
    the item sought to be exported is in fact on the control list. Such
    proceedings shall be conducted within 90 days after the appeal is
    filed. Any determination by an administrative law judge under this
    subsection and all materials filed before such judge in the
    proceedings shall be reviewed by the Secretary, who shall either
    affirm or vacate the determination in a written decision within 30
    days after receiving the determination. The Secretary's written
    decision shall be final and is not subject to judicial review.
    Subject to the limitations provided in section 12(c) of this Act
    [section 2411(c) of this Appendix], the Secretary's decision shall
    be published in the Federal Register.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Under Secretary of Commerce
      The President shall appoint, by and with the advice and consent
    of the Senate, an Under Secretary of Commerce for Export
    Administration who shall carry out all functions of the Secretary
    under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] and such
    other statutes that relate to national security which were
    delegated to the office of the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for
    Trade Administration before the date of the enactment of the Export
    Administration Amendments Act of 1985 [July 12, 1985], and such
    other functions under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this
    Appendix] which were delegated to such office before such date of
    enactment, as the Secretary may delegate. The President shall
    appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, two
    Assistant Secretaries of Commerce to assist the Under Secretary in
    carrying out such functions.
    (b) Issuance of regulations
      The President and the Secretary may issue such regulations as are
    necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act [sections 2401 to
    2420 of this Appendix]. Any such regulations issued to carry out
    the provisions of section 5(a), 6(a), 7(a), or 8(b) [section
    2404(a), 2405(a), 2406(a), or 2407(b) of this Appendix] may apply
    to the financing, transporting, or other servicing of exports and
    the participation therein by any person. Any such regulations the
    purpose of which is to carry out the provisions of section 5
    [section 2404 of this Appendix], or of section 4(a) [section
    2403(a) of this Appendix] for the purpose of administering the
    provisions of section 5 [section 2404 of this Appendix], may be
    issued only after the regulations are submitted for review to the
    Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, such other
    departments and agencies as the Secretary considers appropriate,
    and the appropriate technical advisory committee. The preceding
    sentence does not require the concurrence or approval of any
    official, department, or agency to which such regulations are
    submitted.
    (c) Amendments to regulations
      If the Secretary proposes to amend regulations issued under this
    Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix], the Secretary shall
    report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of
    the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of
    Representatives on the intent and rationale of such amendments.
    Such report shall evaluate the cost and burden to United States
    exporters of the proposed amendments in relation to any enhancement
    of licensing objectives. The Secretary shall consult with the
    technical advisory committees authorized under section 5(h) of this
    Act [section 2404(h) of this Appendix] in formulating or amending
    regulations issued under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this
    Appendix]. The procedures defined by regulations in effect on
    January 1, 1984, with respect to sections 4 and 5 of this Act
    [sections 2403 and 2404 of this Appendix], shall remain in effect
    unless the Secretary determines, on the basis of substantial and
    reliable evidence, that specific change is necessary to enhance the
    prevention of diversions of exports which would prove detrimental
    to the national security of the United States or to reduce the
    licensing and paperwork burden on exporters and their distributors.
