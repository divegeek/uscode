-MISC1-
                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   
      Based on acts Mar. 3, 1899, ch. 419, Sec. 31, 30 Stat. 1021; Mar.
    6, 1902, ch. 139, Sec. 6, 32 Stat. 52.
      Section is new to the United States Code, but is in accordance
    with current practice. Act Mar. 3, 1899, ch. 419, 30 Stat. 1014,
    which established the "Census Office" on a temporary basis,
    provided in section 31 thereof (30 Stat. 1021) for a seal for that
    office. The office was made permanent by act Mar. 6, 1902, ch. 139,
    32 Stat. 51, and section 6 of that act (32 Stat. 52) continued in
    full force and effect "for the taking of the Thirteenth and
    subsequent censuses" all provisions of the act of Mar. 3, 1899, not
    inconsistent with the provisions of such 1902 act. Therefore, since
    the 1902 act contained no provisions with respect to a seal,
    section 31 of the 1899 act, providing for the seal, remained in
    force as it was not inconsistent. Section 33 of act July 2, 1909,
    ch. 2, 36 Stat. 10, which act (36 Stat. 1) related to the
    Thirteenth and subsequent decennial censuses, repealed the said act
    of Mar. 3, 1899, specifically, and all "other" laws and parts of
    laws inconsistent with the provisions of the 1909 act. These
    repealing provisions are somewhat ambiguous, but it was probably
    the intent of Congress, as it was the intent thereof at the time of
    enactment of the act of Mar. 6, 1902, referred to above, to
    continue in effect all provisions of the act of Mar. 3, 1899, that
    were not inconsistent with the act of July 2, 1909. The 1909 act
    contained no provisions with respect to the seal, and it
    accordingly follows that the provisions of section 31 of the act of
    Mar. 3, 1899, with respect thereto, continued in force. This is
    also the interpretation of the Bureau of the Census, which has
    continued to use a seal through the years in connection with
    "certificates and attestations".
      In any event, this new section merely confirms past and present
    practice, and restores, if it does not preserve, statutory
    authority for possession and use of the seal which is a very
    necessary part of the operations of the Bureau. Further, the
    section should serve to forestall future differences of
    interpretation. In the past, some States have refused to recognize
    the seal of the Census Bureau on the ground that it was not
    authorized by law. In all probability, this position was taken, not
    as the result of a search of the Statutes at Large, which would
    have been a difficult project, but because provisions relating to
    the seal were not set out in the United States Code where they
    would have been readily accessible.
      The language of this section follows substantially the language
    of section 31 of the act of Mar. 3, 1899, referred to above, but
    has been reworded because of jurisdictional and other changes since
    that time. The "Census Office" was transferred from the Department
    of the Interior to the Department of Commerce and Labor by act Feb.
    14, 1903, ch. 552, Sec. 4, 32 Stat. 826. Act Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 141,
    Sec. 1, 37 Stat. 736, changed the name of the latter to the
    Department of Commerce, and created, as a separate department, the
    Department of Labor. It transferred a number of bureaus and
    agencies from the Department of Commerce to the Department of
    Labor, but these transfers did not affect the Bureau of the Census,
    which has remained under the jurisdiction of the Department of
    Commerce. 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, Secs. 1, 2, eff. May 24,
    1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263, transferred all functions of all
    officers, employees, bureaus, and agencies of the Department of
    Commerce to the Secretary of Commerce, and vested power in him to
    delegate them or any of his other functions to any of such
    officers, employees, bureaus, and agencies. Therefore, in this
    section, "Secretary", and "Secretary or such officer or employee of
    the Bureau as he designates", were substituted, respectively, for
    two references to the Director of the Census, to conform with such
    Plan.

                                AMENDMENTS                            
      1976 - Pub. L. 94-521 substituted "affixed to all documents
    authenticated by the Bureau" for "affixed to all certificates and
    attestations that may be required from the Bureau".
      1957 - Pub. L. 85-207 provided for judicial recognition of the
    seal.

    591 of title 5, U. S. C., 1952 ed., Executive Departments and
    Government Officers and Employees [now set out in the Appendix to
    Title 5, Government Organization and Employees]. That plan
    transferred all functions (with a few exceptions not applicable to
    the Census Bureau) of all agencies, officers and employees of the
    Department of Commerce to the Secretary of Commerce, and vested
    power in him to delegate the functions so transferred, or any of
    his other functions, to such agencies, officers or employees within
    the Department as he designates.
      See, also, section 253 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which
    provided for delegation of functions in connection with the
    quinquennial censuses of governments, and authorized the Secretary
    to promulgate rules and regulations with respect to such censuses.
    That section has been omitted from this revised title, as the
    provision thereof for delegation of functions is covered by this
    section, and the provision thereof which related to rules and
    regulations is covered by section 22 of title 1, U.S.C., 1952 ed.,
    General Provisions.
      Because of the transfer effected by 1950 Reorganization Plan No.
    5, referred to above, sections of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which
    prescribed functions of the Bureau of the Census, the Census
    Office, or the Director of the Census, have, in this revised title,
    been changed to refer to the Secretary.

    businesses, and governments, and with that part of subsection (b)
    of section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which made such
    section 215 applicable to the decennial censuses of housing (see
    subchapters I, II, and III of chapter 5 of this title). As
    originally enacted in 1929, such section 215 had related only to
    the decennial censuses of population, agriculture, etc., the
    provisions for which are continued in subchapter II of chapter 5 of

      The provisions, as revised in this section, relate, not only to
    the censuses referred to above, but also, to all other

    Congressional intent.

      (a) The Secretary may establish, at rates of compensation to be
    fixed by him without regard to the Classification Act of 1949, as
    many temporary positions as may be necessary to meet the
    requirements of the work provided for by law. Bureau employees who
    are transferred to any such temporary positions shall not lose
    their permanent civil service status by reason of the transfer. The
    Secretary may make appointments to such temporary positions in
    conformity with the civil service laws and rules.
      (b) In addition to employees of the Department of Commerce,
    employees of other departments and independent offices of the
    Government may, with the consent of the head of the respective
    department or office, be employed and compensated for field work in
    connection with the work provided for by law without regard to
    section 301 of the Dual Compensation Act.
      (c) The Secretary may utilize temporary staff, including
    employees of Federal, State, or local agencies or
    instrumentalities, and employees of private organizations to assist
    the Bureau in performing the work authorized by this title, but
    only if such temporary staff is sworn to observe the limitations
    imposed by section 9 of this title.

    1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., The Public Health and Welfare

    1106(a), 63 Stat. 972; July 16, 1952, ch. 912, 66 Stat. 736).
      Section consolidates parts of sections 203 and 216 of title 13,
    U.S.C., 1952 ed., with that part of subsection (b) of section 1442
    of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which made such sections 203 and 216
    applicable to the censuses of housing.
      Section 122 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which related to
    quinquennial censuses of manufacturers, the mineral industries,
    transportation, and other businesses (see subchapter I of chapter 5
    of this revised title), and section 252 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952
    ed., which related to quinquennial censuses of governments (see
    subchapter III of chapter 5 of this title), made section 203 of
    such title applicable to those censuses. However, since the
    particular provisions of such section 203 that have been carried
    into this revised section apparently related, as supplemented by
    section 1442(b) of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., to the decennial
    censuses provided for in sections 201 et seq. of such title, and in
    such section 1442 of title 42 (see subchapter II of chapter 5 of
    this revised title), and apparently could have no relevancy to the
    quinquennial censuses referred to above, this revised section
    relates only to such decennial censuses.
      In subsection (a), "Departmental Service" was substituted for
    "District of Columbia", since the Bureau of the Census now has its
    headquarters in Maryland, and not in the District of Columbia.
      In this section, a reference to the Bureau of the Census was
    changed to a reference to the Department of Commerce, and
    references to the Director of the Census were changed in all but
    one case to references to the Secretary (of Commerce) to conform
    with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, Secs. 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950,
    15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263. See Revision Note to section 4 of this
    title. The provision of section 203 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed.,
    that appointments under the particular provisions thereof that have
    been carried into subsection (a) of this revised section should be
    made upon the recommendation of the Director of the Census, have
    been omitted from such subsection (a) for the same reason. Further,
    words "or to whatever other officer is designated by the Secretary
    to take the census provided for in sections 141 and 142 of this
    title" were inserted after "Director of the Census" in par. (1) of
    subsection (a), to conform with such 1950 Reorganization Plan.
      The first paragraph of section 203 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed.,
    which provided for the employment of two assistant directors for
    each decennial census period, was omitted as obsolete and
    superseded, in view of section 122 of such title, which made such
    section 203 applicable to the quinquennial censuses of manufactures
    and other businesses, and to surveys (see subchapter IV of chapter
    5 of this title), thus rendering such first paragraph ineffective
    and meaningless. See also section 121(b) of title 13, U.S.C., 1952
    ed.
      The third proviso in the second paragraph of section 203 of title
    13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., giving preference in appointments to disabled
    war veterans, their widows, and, under certain circumstances, to
    their wives, was omitted as superseded and covered by the Veterans'
    Preference Act of 1944 (chapter 17 of title 5, U.S.C., 1952 ed.,
    Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees).
      Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.
      Remainder of section 203 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., is
    incorporated in this subchapter, and for remainder of section 216
    thereof, and of section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed. (which
    has been transferred in its entirety to this revised title), see

    Sec. 24. Special employment provisions

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Secretary may utilize the services of nontemporary
    employees of the Bureau (by assignment, promotion, appointment,
    detail, or otherwise) in temporary positions established for any
    census, for not to exceed the period during which appropriations
    are available for that census. Whenever the Secretary determines
    that the services of an employee which have been utilized under
    this section are no longer required in such a temporary position,
    he may, without regard to the provisions of any other law, return
    the employee to a continuing position, with rank and compensation
    not less than that which he held in his last permanent position in
    the Bureau: Provided, That no employee shall, by reason of his
    service in a temporary position under this subsection, lose the
    protection of any law or regulation with respect to his separation,
    suspension, furlough, or reduction in rank or compensation below
    the level held in his last permanent position in the Bureau.
    Service by a nontemporary employee in a temporary position under
    this subsection shall be creditable for step-increases (both
    periodic and longevity) under title VII of the Classification Act
    of 1949, as amended, as though it were a continuation of service in
    his last permanent position.
      (b) As used in this title with respect to appointments or
    positions, "temporary" shall be construed to mean not in excess of
    one year, or not in excess of the specific period during which
    appropriations are available for the conduct of a particular
    census, whichever is longer. No employee of the Bureau who holds
    only a temporary appointment within the meaning of this section
    shall be considered as other than strictly temporary for purposes
    of any other provision of law relating to separations, suspensions,
    or reductions in rank or compensation.
      (c) The enlisted men and officers of the uniformed services may
    be appointed and compensated for service in temporary enumerator
    positions for the enumeration of personnel of the uniformed
    services.
      (d) The Secretary may fix compensation on a piece-price basis
    without limitation as to the amount earned per diem, and payments
    may be made to enumerators for the use of private automobiles on
    official business without regard to section 4 of the Travel Expense
    Act of 1949, as amended (5 U.S.C. 837), but at rates not in excess
    of the rates provided by that Act.
      (e) The Secretary may authorize the expenditure of necessary sums
    for travel expenses of persons selected for appointment for
    attendance at training courses held by the Department of Commerce
    with respect to any of the work provided for by law.
      (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of law prohibiting the
    expenditure of public money for telephone service, the Secretary,
    under such regulations as he shall prescribe, may authorize
    reimbursement for tolls or charges for telephone service from
    private residences or private apartments to the extent such charges
    are determined by the Secretary to have been incurred to facilitate
    the collection of information in connection with the censuses and
    surveys authorized by this title.

      Section consolidates those provisions of sections 111, 122, 203
    and 252 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which related to appointment
    of special personnel for census work, collection of statistics,
    etc., and the use of permanent employees for such purpose, with
    that part of subsection (b) of section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C.,
    1952 ed., which made such section 203 applicable to housing
    censuses (subchapter II of chapter 5 of this title).
      The provisions have been reworded to make it clear that they
    relate to all collections of statistics, censuses, etc., provided
    for in this title.
      References to the Director of the Census have been changed to
    references to the Secretary (of Commerce) to conform with 1950
    Reorganization Plan No. 5, Secs. 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R.
    3174, 64 Stat. 1263. See Revision Note to section 4 of this title.
      Words "except that such special agents shall be appointed in
    accordance with the civil service laws" were omitted as obsolete
    and unnecessary in view of the Classification Act of 1949 (see 5
    U.S.C., 1952 ed., ch. 21).
      The provisions of section 203 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed.,
    relating to per diem rates of compensation for special agents, to
    authority to detail permanent employees and special agents to act
    as supervisors or enumerators, and to duties thereof, were omitted
    as obsolete and superseded by the Classification Act of 1949.
      The provision of section 203 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., that
    the Director of the Census might delegate to the supervisors the
    authority to appoint enumerators, was omitted because all functions
    of the Director and other officers and employees of the Department
    of Commerce and its bureaus and agencies were transferred to the

    4, 64 Stat. 785).
      Section consolidates part of section 111 of title 13, U.S.C.,
    1952 ed., with section 113 of such title which also related to
    statistics with respect to crime and to the "defective, dependent,
    and delinquent classes".
      "Secretary", meaning the Secretary of Commerce, was substituted
    for "Director of the Census" to conform with Reorganization Plan
    No. 5, Secs. 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263.
    See Revision Note to section 4 of this title.
      The provisions of section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed.,
    authorizing statistics relating to transportation by water, and
    express business, to mines, mining, quarries, and minerals, to
    savings banks and other savings institutions, mortgage, loan, and
    investment companies, and similar institutions, and to street
    railways, electric light and power, telephone, and telegraph
    business, were omitted as superseded and covered by sections 121-
    123 of such title (enacted in 1948), which are set out elsewhere
    in this title. See Distribution Table.
      Section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., also authorized the
    decennial collection of statistics relating to the fishing industry
    "in cooperation with the Fish and Wildlife Service". In the basic
    statutory provision (see amendment by act June 7, 1906, ch. 3048,
    34 Stat. 218, "Fish and Wildlife Service" read "Bureau of
    Fisheries" and it was changed, by the codifiers, in such section
    111 to the former designation because of 1940 Reorganization Plan
    No. III, Sec. 3, 5 F.R. 2107, 54 Stat. 1232, which consolidated the
    Bureau of Fisheries and the Bureau of Biological Survey into one
    agency to be known as the "Fish and Wildlife Service". However, at
    the time of the enactment of the 1906 act, referred to above, both
    the Bureau of the Fisheries, and the Census Bureau (then referred
    to as the "Census Office"), were in the Department of Commerce. The
    Bureau of Fisheries was transferred to the Department of the
    Interior by 1939 Reorganization Plan No. II, Sec. 4(e), 4 F.R.
    2731, 53 Stat. 1431, and it is within that department that the Fish
    and Wildlife Service now functions. Therefore, such provision in
    section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., has been omitted from
    this revised title as obsolete. In any event section 121 of title
    13, U.S.C., 1952 ed. (subchapter I of chapter 5 of this revised
    title) is broad enough to authorize such collection.
      The provisions of section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed.,
    which authorized statistics relating to religion, and the
    provisions thereof which related to the designation of reports, are
    set out as separate sections in this subchapter; and the provisions
    thereof which related to the preparation of schedules, and which
    authorized the appointment of special agents, are set out in
    chapter 1 of this title. See Distribution Table.
      The proviso in section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which
    prohibited the collection of statistics relating to religious or
    church membership when the disclosure of such information was
    prohibited by religious or church doctrine, teaching or discipline,
    has been incorporated in chapter 7 of this title. See Distribution
    Table.

      Section was taken from that part of section 111 of title 13,
    U.S.C., 1952 ed., which related to designation of reports prepared
    under that section. For remainder of such section 111, see this
    subchapter, and Distribution Table.
      Section 111 of title 13, U.S.C. 1952 ed., provided that the
    reports prepared under the provisions of that section should be
    designated as "Special Reports of the Census Office". In this
    revised section it is provided that such reports shall be
    designated as " 'Special Reports' followed by the name of whatever
    bureau or agency of the Department of Commerce is designated by the
    Secretary to collect and compile such statistics". This change
    conforms with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, Secs. 1, 2, eff. May
    24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263, which transferred the
    functions of all agencies, bureaus, officers, and employees of the
    Department of Commerce to the Secretary, and vested power in him to
    delegate any of such transferred functions, or any of his other
    functions, to any of such agencies, bureaus, officers, or
    employees. See section 4 of this title.
      Changes were made in phraseology.
      Section 7 of the act of Mar. 6, 1902, ch. 139, 32 Stat. 52, cited
    above, from which section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., was
    derived, contained additional provisions (which were not classified
    to the United States Code) relating to the duty of the Director of
    the Census to publish the Official Register of the United States,
    and to the transmission to him of the data to be included therein.
    Such provisions have been omitted as they were superseded by act
    Mar. 3, 1925, ch. 421, Sec. 2(a)(b), 43 Stat. 1105, which was
    formerly classified to section 3 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., and
    which, in turn, was repealed by section 5 of act Aug. 28, 1935, ch.

    Such sections 1 and 2, as amended, are classified to section 654 of

    13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., that such determination should be made by the
    Director with the approval of the Secretary, to conform with 1950
    Reorganization Plan No. 5, Secs. 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R.
    3174, 64 Stat. 1263, which transferred all functions of all

    may delegate any of such transferred functions, as well as any
    other of his functions, to any of such officers, employees,
    agencies and bureaus. See, also, section 4 of this title.

    the year "1949" as the year for commencement of the quinquennial
    censuses was changed to the year "1954", since the former
    designation is obsolete, and the provision of such section that the
    census of manufacturers should not be taken in 1949 was omitted as
    obsolete.
      Changes were made in phraseology.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 141. Population and other census information

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Secretary shall, in the year 1980 and every 10 years
    thereafter, take a decennial census of population as of the first
    day of April of such year, which date shall be known as the
    "decennial census date", in such form and content as he may
    determine, including the use of sampling procedures and special
    surveys. In connection with any such census, the Secretary is
    authorized to obtain such other census information as necessary.
      (b) The tabulation of total population by States under subsection
    (a) of this section as required for the apportionment of
    Representatives in Congress among the several States shall be
    completed within 9 months after the census date and reported by the
    Secretary to the President of the United States.
      (c) The officers or public bodies having initial responsibility
    for the legislative apportionment or districting of each State may,
    not later than 3 years before the decennial census date, submit to
    the Secretary a plan identifying the geographic areas for which
    specific tabulations of population are desired. Each such plan
    shall be developed in accordance with criteria established by the
    Secretary, which he shall furnish to such officers or public bodies
    not later than April 1 of the fourth year preceding the decennial
    census date. Such criteria shall include requirements which assure
    that such plan shall be developed in a nonpartisan manner. Should
    the Secretary find that a plan submitted by such officers or public
    bodies does not meet the criteria established by him, he shall
    consult to the extent necessary with such officers or public bodies
    in order to achieve the alterations in such plan that he deems
    necessary to bring it into accord with such criteria. Any issues
    with respect to such plan remaining unresolved after such
    consultation shall be resolved by the Secretary, and in all cases
    he shall have final authority for determining the geographic format
    of such plan. Tabulations of population for the areas identified in
    any plan approved by the Secretary shall be completed by him as
    expeditiously as possible after the decennial census date and
    reported to the Governor of the State involved and to the officers
    or public bodies having responsibility for legislative
    apportionment or districting of such State, except that such
    tabulations of population of each State requesting a tabulation
    plan, and basic tabulations of population of each other State,
    shall, in any event, be completed, reported, and transmitted to
    each respective State within one year after the decennial census
    date.
      (d) Without regard to subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this
    section, the Secretary, in the year 1985 and every 10 years
    thereafter, shall conduct a mid-decade census of population in such
    form and content as he may determine, including the use of sampling
    procedures and special surveys, taking into account the extent to
    which information to be obtained from such census will serve in
    lieu of information collected annually or less frequently in
    surveys or other statistical studies. The census shall be taken as
    of the first day of April of each such year, which date shall be
    known as the "mid-decade census date".
      (e)(1) If - 
        (A) in the administration of any program established by or
      under Federal law which provides benefits to State or local
      governments or to other recipients, eligibility for or the amount
      of such benefits would (without regard to this paragraph) be
      determined by taking into account data obtained in the most
      recent decennial census, and
        (B) comparable data is obtained in a mid-decade census
      conducted after such decennial census,

    then in the determination of such eligibility or amount of benefits
    the most recent data available from either the mid-decade or
    decennial census shall be used.
      (2) Information obtained in any mid-decade census shall not be
    used for apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the
    several States, nor shall such information be used in prescribing
    congressional districts.
      (f) With respect to each decennial and mid-decade census
    conducted under subsection (a) or (d) of this section, the
    Secretary shall submit to the committees of Congress having
    legislative jurisdiction over the census - 
        (1) not later than 3 years before the appropriate census date,
      a report containing the Secretary's determination of the subjects
      proposed to be included, and the types of information to be
      compiled, in such census;
        (2) not later than 2 years before the appropriate census date,
      a report containing the Secretary's determination of the
      questions proposed to be included in such census; and
        (3) after submission of a report under paragraph (1) or (2) of
      this subsection and before the appropriate census date, if the
      Secretary finds new circumstances exist which necessitate that
      the subjects, types of information, or questions contained in
      reports so submitted be modified, a report containing the
      Secretary's determination of the subjects, types of information,
      or questions as proposed to be modified.

      (g) As used in this section, "census of population" means a
    census of population, housing, and matters relating to population
    and housing.

                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   
      Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., Sec. 201 (June 18, 1929, ch.
    28, Sec. 1, 46 Stat. 21; May 17, 1932, ch. 190, 47 Stat. 158).
      References to the Secretary, meaning the Secretary of Commerce,
    were substituted for references to the Director of the Census, to
    conform with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, Secs. 1, 2, eff. May
    24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263. See Revision Note to section
    4 of this title.
      The provision for taking the censuses in "1930 and every ten
    years thereafter" was changed to "1960 and every ten years
    thereafter" since the censuses for the years 1930, 1940 and 1950
    have been completed.
      The requirement that decennial censuses of "distribution" and
    "mines" should also be taken was omitted as superseded by section
    121 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed. (enacted in 1948), the provisions
    of which were carried into subchapter I of this chapter.
      Section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., the Public Health and
    Welfare (which section has been transferred in its entirety to this
    revised title), made all provisions of chapter 4 of title 13,
    U.S.C., 1952 ed., applicable to the housing censuses provided for
    in such section. However, section 201 of such title 13 (which
    section was a part of such chapter 4), which, as indicated above,
    has been carried into this revised section, could not, except,
    possibly, for the provisions thereof relating to the territorial
    scope of the censuses and to the census duties of the governors of
    Guam, Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and the Canal Zone, have any
    relevancy to such housing censuses, and such section 1442 of title
    42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., contained its own provisions relating to
    territorial scope of the housing censuses. Therefore the provisions
    of this revised section have not been made so applicable.
      Changes were made in phraseology.

                                AMENDMENTS                            
      1976 - Pub. L. 94-521 substituted "Population and other census
    information" for "Population, unemployment, and housing" in section
    catchline, without reference to amendment of catchline by Pub. L.
    94-171.
      Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 94-521 substituted "1980" for "1960" and
    "decennial census of population" for "census of population,
    unemployment, and housing (including utilities and equipment)",
    inserted "of such year" after "April", substituted "which date
    shall be known as the decennial census date" for "which shall be
    known as the census date", and inserted provisions authorizing the
    Secretary to take the decennial census in whatever form and content
    he determines, using sampling procedures and special surveys, and
    authorizing him to obtain other such census information as is
    necessary, in connection with the decennial census.
      Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 94-521 inserted "under subsection (a) of
    this section" after "population by States", inserted "in Congress
    among the several States" after "Representatives", and substituted
    "9 months after the census date" for "eight months of the census
    date".
      Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 94-521 substituted "the decennial census
    date" for "the census date" wherever appearing.
      Subsecs. (d) to (g). Pub. L. 94-521 added subsecs. (d) to (g).
      1975 - Pub. L. 94-171, Sec. 2(a), inserted "; tabulation for
    legislative apportionment" in section catchline.
      Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 94-171, Sec. 1, added subsec. (c).
      1957 - Pub. L. 85-207 substituted "Population, unemployment, and
    housing" for "Population, agriculture, irrigation, drainage, and
    unemployment; territory excluded" in section catchline; inserted in
    text housing census provisions, struck out census coverage of
    agriculture, irrigation, and drainage and geographical provisions,
    and designated existing provisions as so amended as subsec. (a);
    and added subsec. (b). Census of agriculture, irrigation, and
    drainage and the geographical provisions are covered by sections
    142 and 191 of this title.

                     EFFECTIVE DATE OF 1976 AMENDMENT                 
      Amendment by Pub. L. 94-521 effective Oct. 17, 1976, see section
    17 of Pub. L. 94-521, set out as a note under section 1 of this
    title.

      STATISTICAL SAMPLING OR ADJUSTMENT IN DECENNIAL ENUMERATION OF
                                POPULATION
      Pub. L. 105-119, title II, Sec. 209, Nov. 26, 1997, 111 Stat.
    2480, provided that:
      "(a) Congress finds that - 
        "(1) it is the constitutional duty of the Congress to ensure
      that the decennial enumeration of the population is conducted in
      a manner consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United
      States;
        "(2) the sole constitutional purpose of the decennial
      enumeration of the population is the apportionment of
      Representatives in Congress among the several States;
        "(3) section 2 of the 14th article of amendment to the
      Constitution clearly states that Representatives are to be
      'apportioned among the several States according to their
      respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each
      State';
        "(4) article I, section 2, clause 3 of the Constitution clearly
      requires an 'actual Enumeration' of the population, and section
      195 of title 13, United States Code, clearly provides 'Except for
      the determination of population for purposes of apportionment of
      Representatives in Congress among the several States, the
      Secretary shall, if he considers it feasible, authorize the use
      of the statistical method known as "sampling" in carrying out the
      provisions of this title.';
        "(5) the decennial enumeration of the population is one of the
      most critical constitutional functions our Federal Government
      performs;
        "(6) it is essential that the decennial enumeration of the
      population be as accurate as possible, consistent with the
      Constitution and laws of the United States;
        "(7) the use of statistical sampling or statistical adjustment
      in conjunction with an actual enumeration to carry out the census
      with respect to any segment of the population poses the risk of
      an inaccurate, invalid, and unconstitutional census;
        "(8) the decennial enumeration of the population is a complex
      and vast undertaking, and if such enumeration is conducted in a
      manner that does not comply with the requirements of the
      Constitution or laws of the United States, it would be
      impracticable for the States to obtain, and the courts of the
      United States to provide, meaningful relief after such
      enumeration has been conducted; and
        "(9) Congress is committed to providing the level of funding
      that is required to perform the entire range of constitutional
      census activities, with a particular emphasis on accurately
      enumerating all individuals who have historically been
      undercounted, and toward this end, Congress expects - 
          "(A) aggressive and innovative promotion and outreach
        campaigns in hard-to-count communities;
          "(B) the hiring of enumerators from within those communities;
          "(C) continued cooperation with local government on address
        list development; and
          "(D) maximized census employment opportunities for
        individuals seeking to make the transition from welfare to
        work.
      "(b) Any person aggrieved by the use of any statistical method in
    violation of the Constitution or any provision of law (other than
    this Act [see Tables for classification]), in connection with the
    2000 or any later decennial census, to determine the population for
    purposes of the apportionment or redistricting of Members in
    Congress, may in a civil action obtain declaratory, injunctive, and
    any other appropriate relief against the use of such method.
      "(c) For purposes of this section - 
        "(1) the use of any statistical method as part of a dress
      rehearsal or other simulation of a census in preparation for the
      use of such method, in a decennial census, to determine the
      population for purposes of the apportionment or redistricting of
      Members in Congress shall be considered the use of such method in
      connection with that census; and
        "(2) the report ordered by title VIII of Public Law 105-18 [111
      Stat. 217] and the Census 2000 Operational Plan shall be deemed
      to constitute final agency action regarding the use of
      statistical methods in the 2000 decennial census, thus making the
      question of their use in such census sufficiently concrete and
      final to now be reviewable in a judicial proceeding.
      "(d) For purposes of this section, an aggrieved person (described
    in subsection (b)) includes - 
        "(1) any resident of a State whose congressional representation
      or district could be changed as a result of the use of a
      statistical method challenged in the civil action;
        "(2) any Representative or Senator in Congress; and
        "(3) either House of Congress.
      "(e)(1) Any action brought under this section shall be heard and
    determined by a district court of three judges in accordance with
    section 2284 of title 28, United States Code. The chief judge of
    the United States court of appeals for each circuit shall, to the
    extent practicable and consistent with the avoidance of unnecessary
    delay, consolidate, for all purposes, in one district court within
    that circuit, all actions pending in that circuit under this
    section. Any party to an action under this section shall be
    precluded from seeking any consolidation of that action other than
    is provided in this paragraph. In selecting the district court in
    which to consolidate such actions, the chief judge shall consider
    the convenience of the parties and witnesses and efficient conduct
    of such actions. Any final order or injunction of a United States
    district court that is issued pursuant to an action brought under
    this section shall be reviewable by appeal directly to the Supreme
    Court of the United States. Any such appeal shall be taken by a
    notice of appeal filed within 10 days after such order is entered;
    and the jurisdictional statement shall be filed within 30 days
    after such order is entered. No stay of an order issued pursuant to
    an action brought under this section may be issued by a single
    Justice of the Supreme Court.
      "(2) It shall be the duty of a United States district court
    hearing an action brought under this section and the Supreme Court
    of the United States to advance on the docket and to expedite to
    the greatest possible extent the disposition of any such matter.
      "(f) Any agency or entity within the executive branch having
    authority with respect to the carrying out of a decennial census
    may in a civil action obtain a declaratory judgment respecting
    whether or not the use of a statistical method, in connection with
    such census, to determine the population for the purposes of the
    apportionment or redistricting of Members in Congress is forbidden
    by the Constitution and laws of the United States.
      "(g) The Speaker of the House of Representatives or the Speaker's
    designee or designees may commence or join in a civil action, for
    and on behalf of the House of Representatives, under any applicable
    law, to prevent the use of any statistical method, in connection
    with the decennial census, to determine the population for purposes
    of the apportionment or redistricting of Members in Congress. It
    shall be the duty of the Office of the General Counsel of the House
    of Representatives to represent the House in such civil action,
    according to the directions of the Speaker. The Office of the
    General Counsel of the House of Representatives may employ the
    services of outside counsel and other experts for this purpose.
      "(h) For purposes of this section and section 210 [set out below]
    - 
        "(1) the term 'statistical method' means an activity related to
      the design, planning, testing, or implementation of the use of
      representative sampling, or any other statistical procedure,
      including statistical adjustment, to add or subtract counts to or
      from the enumeration of the population as a result of statistical
      inference; and
        "(2) the term 'census' or 'decennial census' means a decennial
      enumeration of the population.
      "(i) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize the use
    of any statistical method, in connection with a decennial census,
    for the apportionment or redistricting of Members in Congress.
      "(j) Sufficient funds appropriated under this Act or under any
    other Act for purposes of the 2000 decennial census shall be used
    by the Bureau of the Census to plan, test, and become prepared to
    implement a 2000 decennial census, without using statistical
    methods, which shall result in the percentage of the total
    population actually enumerated being as close to 100 percent as
    possible. In both the 2000 decennial census, and any dress
    rehearsal or other simulation made in preparation for the 2000
    decennial census, the number of persons enumerated without using
    statistical methods must be publicly available for all levels of
    census geography which are being released by the Bureau of the
    Census for: (1) all data releases before January 1, 2001; (2) the
    data contained in the 2000 decennial census Public Law 94-171
    [amending this section] data file released for use in
    redistricting; (3) the Summary Tabulation File One (STF-1) for the
    2000 decennial census; and (4) the official populations of the

-STATUTE-
      (a) During the intervals between each census of population
    required under section 141 of this title, the Secretary, to the
    extent feasible, shall annually produce and publish for each State,
    county, and local unit of general purpose government which has a
    population of fifty thousand or more, current data on total
    population and population characteristics and, to the extent
    feasible, shall biennially produce and publish for other local
    units of general purpose government current data on total
    population. Such data shall be produced and published for each
    State, county, and other local unit of general purpose government
    for which data is compiled in the most recent census of population
    taken under section 141 of this title. Such data may be produced by
    means of sampling or other methods, which the Secretary determines
    will produce current, comprehensive, and reliable data.
      (b) If the Secretary is unable to produce and publish current
    data during any fiscal year on total population for any county and
    local unit of general purpose government as required by this
    section, a report shall be submitted by the Secretary to the
    President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of
    Representatives not later than 90 days before the commencement of
    the following fiscal year, enumerating each government excluded and
    giving the reasons for such exclusion.

      Section consolidates section 207 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed.,
    which was a part of chapter 4 of such title relating to the
    censuses of population, agriculture, irrigation, etc. (subchapter
    II of chapter 5 of this revised title), with those parts of
    sections 122 and 252 of such title which made such section 207
    applicable to the censuses of manufactures, the mineral industries,
    and other businesses, and governments (subchapters I and III of
    chapter 5 of this revised title), and with that part of subsection
    (b) of section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952, ed., which made such
    section 207 applicable to the censuses of housing (subchapter II of
    chapter 5 of this revised title). For remainder of sections 122 and
    252 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., and of section 1442 of title 42,
    U.S.C., 1952 ed. (which section has been transferred in its
    entirety to this revised title), see Distribution Table.
      This section, as revised, relates to appointments of all officers
    and employees referred to in subchapter II of chapter 1 of this
    title, which was the probable original legislative intent.
      Reference in section 207 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., to the
    offense, herein described, as a felony, and words in such section,
    "and upon conviction thereof," were omitted from this revised
    section, the former, as covered by section 1 of title 18, U.S.C.,
    1952 ed., Crimes and Criminal Procedure, classifying offenses, and
    the latter, as surplusage.
      The reference "Department of Commerce or bureau or agency
    thereof" was inserted in recognition of 1950 Reorganization Plan
    No. 5, Secs. 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263
    (see Revision Note to section 4 of this title). However, the
    qualifying words, "referred to in subchapter II of chapter 1 of
    this title," limits the provisions to appointment or employment of
    persons in connection with the statistics and censuses provided for
    in this title.

    such title which made such section 209 applicable to the
    quinquennial censuses of manufactures, the mineral industries, and
    other businesses (see subchapter I of chapter 5 of this revised

    providing that it should "be the duty" of all persons over eighteen

    provisions, as herein revised, define offenses and prescribe
    penalties for committing them, and are deemed sufficient for the
    purpose of enforcement. However, some of the language used in the
    omitted provisions was necessarily included in the description of
    the offense.
      The designation of the first offense, herein described, as a
    "misdemeanor", was omitted as covered by section 1 of title 18,
    U.S.C., 1952 ed., Crimes and Criminal Procedure, classifying
    crimes; and words "upon conviction thereof" were omitted as
    surplusage.
      References to the Secretary (of Commerce) and to any "authorized
    officer or employee of the Department of Commerce or bureau or
    agency thereof", etc., were substituted for references to the
    Director of the Census and to any "supervisor, enumerator, or

      Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., Secs. 122, 209 (June 18,
    1929, ch. 28, Sec. 9, 46 Stat. 23; June 19, 1948, ch. 502, Sec. 2,
    62 Stat. 479).
      Section consolidates the second paragraph of section 209 of title
    13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which was a part of chapter 4 of that title
    relating to censuses of population, agriculture, etc., with that
    part of section 122 of such title which made such section 209
    applicable to the interim surveys provided for by section 121(b) of
    such title (see subchapter IV of chapter 5 of this revised title).
    For remainder of such sections 122 and 209, see Distribution Table.
      Section 122 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., made section 209 of
    such title applicable to the quinquennial censuses of manufactures,
    the mineral industries, and other businesses provided for by
    section 121(a) thereof (subchapter I of chapter 5 of this revised
    title), and applicable, with certain qualifications and exceptions,
    to the interim surveys, which section 121(b) thereof provided for,
    not only with respect to those censuses but also the censuses
    provided for in "other Acts" (chapter 5 of this title). However,
    the particular provisions of such section 209 that have been
    carried into this revised section related only to population
    enumerations, and this section has accordingly been restricted to
    the population censuses authorized under subchapter II of chapter 5
    of this title, and to the interim surveys authorized under
    subchapter IV of such chapter only in so far as they relate to
    population enumerations. The exceptions and qualifications with
    respect to the application of this section to such interim surveys
    are set out elsewhere in this subchapter.
      Reference to "any officer or employee" was substituted for "any
    supervisor, supervisor's clerk, enumerator, interpreter, special
    agent, or other officer or employee", as the latter enumeration of
    the types of employees is unnecessary and redundant; and
    "Department of Commerce or bureau or agency thereof" was
    substituted for "Census Office", to conform with 1950
    Reorganization Plan No. 5, Secs. 1, 2, effective May 24, 1950, 15
    F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263. See Revision Note to section 4 of this
    title.
      Subsection (b) of section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., The
    Public Health and Welfare (which section has been transferred in
    its entirety to this revised title), made section 209 of title 13,
    U.S.C., 1952 ed., applicable to the censuses of housing (subchapter
    II of chapter 5 of this revised title). However, the particular
    provisions of such section 209 that have been carried into this
    revised section, could not, by their terms, be relevant to housing
    censuses, hence no reference is made in this section to such
    censuses.
      Words in section 209 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., "either as to
    the number of persons resident in any district or community, or in
    any other respect", were omitted from the revised section as
    unnecessary and superfluous.
      Reference to the offense described as a "misdemeanor" was omitted
    as covered by section 1 of title 18, U.S.C., Crimes and Criminal
    Procedure, classifying offenses; and words "and upon conviction
    thereof" were omitted as surplusage.
      Changes were made in phraseology.

-STATUTE-
      Whoever, being the owner, proprietor, manager, superintendent, or
    agent of any hotel, apartment house, boarding or lodging house,
    tenement, or other building, refuses or willfully neglects, when
    requested by the Secretary or by any other officer or employee of
    the Department of Commerce or bureau or agency thereof, acting
    under the instructions of the Secretary, to furnish the names of
    the occupants of such premises, or to give free ingress thereto and
    egress therefrom to any duly accredited representative of such
    Department or bureau or agency thereof, so as to permit the
    collection of statistics with respect to any census provided for in
    subchapters I and II of chapter 5 of this title, or any survey
    authorized by subchapter IV or V of such chapter insofar as such
    survey relates to any of the subjects for which censuses are
    provided by such subchapters I and II, including, when relevant to
    the census or survey being taken or made, the proper and correct
    enumeration of all persons having their usual place of abode in
    such premises, shall be fined not more than $500.

      Section consolidates the third paragraph of section 209 of title
    13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which was a part of chapter 4 of that title
    relating to censuses of population, agriculture, etc. (subchapter
    II of chapter 5 of this revised title), with that part of section
    122 of such title which made such section 209 applicable to the
    quinquennial censuses of manufactures, the mineral industries, and
    other businesses provided for by section 121(a) of such title
    (subchapter I of chapter 5 of this revised title) and, with certain
    qualifications and exceptions, applicable to the interim surveys
    provided for by section 121(b) of such title (subchapter IV of
    chapter 5 of this revised title), and with that part of subsection
    (b) of section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which made such
    section 209 applicable to the decennial censuses of housing
    (subchapter II of chapter 5 of this revised title). For remainder
    of sections 122 and 209 of this revised title, and of section 1442
    of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed. (which section has been transferred
    in its entirety to this revised title), see Distribution Table.
      Section 122 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., made section 209 of
    such title applicable to the interim surveys (provided for by
    section 121(b) thereof) not only with respect to the censuses of
    manufacturers, the mineral industries, and other businesses
    provided for by section 121(a) thereof, but also with respect to
    the censuses provided for by "other Acts" (chapter 5 of this
    title). However, section 252 of that title, which was a part of a
    chapter thereof relating to the quinquennial censuses of
    governments (subchapter III of chapter 5 of this revised title), in
    making certain sections of chapter 4 thereof applicable to such
    censuses, did not specify such section 209. Therefore, this revised
    section is not made so applicable, either to the censuses of
    governments provided for in subchapter III of chapter 5 of this
    title, or to surveys provided for in subchapter IV thereof in so
    far as such surveys relate to governments.
      The language of section 209 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed.,
    providing that it should "be the duty" of every owner, proprietor,
    etc., to furnish the described information or assistance was
    omitted as unnecessary and redundant. The provisions, as herein
    revised, define an offense and prescribe a penalty for committing
    it, and are deemed sufficient for the purpose of enforcement.
    However, some of the language used in the omitted provisions was
    necessarily included in the description of the offense.
      References to the Secretary (of Commerce) and to "any other
    officer or employee of the Department of Commerce or bureau or
    agency thereof" were substituted for references to the Director of
    the Census and the Census Office, to conform with 1950
    Reorganization Plan No. 5, Secs. 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R.
    3174, 64 Stat. 1263. See Revision Note to section 4 of this title.
      The enumeration of the different types of employees, in section
    209 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., "supervisor, enumerator,", etc.,
    was omitted as unnecessary and covered by the reference in this
    revised section to "officer or employee".
      Reference in section 209 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., to the
    described offense as a "misdemeanor" was omitted as covered by
    section 1 of title 18, U.S.C., 1952 ed., Crimes and Criminal
    Procedure, classifying offenses, and words in such section "and
    upon conviction thereof" were omitted as surplusage.
      Changes were made in phraseology.
      The qualifications and exceptions contained in that part of
    section 122 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which made section 209
    of such title applicable to the surveys provided for in section
    121(b) thereof (subchapter IV of chapter 5 of this revised title),
    are set out elsewhere in this subchapter.

    assistant to the person in charge, of any company, business,

    his company, business, institution, establishment, religious body,

    custody, contained on any census or other schedule or questionnaire
    prepared and submitted to him under the authority of this title,
    shall be fined not more than $500; and if he willfully gives a

      Section consolidates parts of sections 74 and 84 of title 13,
    U.S.C., 1952 ed., relating to cotton statistics and statistics on
    oilseeds, nuts and kernels, fats, oils and greases (subchapters I
    and II of chapter 3 of this revised title), all of section 210 of
    such title, which section was a part of chapter 4 thereof relating
    to the decennial censuses of population, agriculture, etc.
    (subchapter II of chapter 5, of this revised title), with that part
    of section 122 of such title which made such section 210 applicable
    to the quinquennial censuses of manufactures, the mineral
    industries, and other businesses provided for in section 121(a) of
    such title (subchapter I of chapter 5 of this revised title), and,
    with certain qualifications and exceptions, applicable to the
    interim surveys provided for by section 121(b) of such title
    (subchapter IV of chapter 5 of this revised title), and that part
    of subsection (b) of section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed.,
    which made such section 210 applicable to the decennial censuses of
    housing (subchapter II of chapter 5 of this revised title). For
    remainder of sections 74, 84 and 122 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed.,
    and of section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed. (which section
    has been transferred in its entirety to this revised title), see
    Distribution Table.
      Section 210 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., by its own terms was
    applicable to the collection of miscellaneous statistics provided
    for by section 111 of such title (subchapter III of chapter 3 of
    this revised title), except that such section 111 placed certain
    restrictions upon the collection of statistics on religion. These
    restrictions, along with those of section 122 of such title with
    respect to the making of surveys, and along with provisions
    excepting this section from application to the censuses of
    governments provided for by section 251 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952
    ed. (subchapter III of chapter 5 of this revised title), are set
    out as another section in this revised title. Subject to those
    exceptions and restrictions, this section applies to all
    collections and censuses provided for in this title, in so far as
    it is relevant.
      Sections 74, 84 and 210 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., described
    the same type of offenses, but the penal provisions varied. Section
    74 prescribed maximum fine of $1,000 and maximum imprisonment of
    one year, for refusal to answer or giving a false answer; section
    84 prescribed maximum fine of $1,000 for refusal to answer or
    giving false answer, with no imprisonment; and section 210
    prescribed maximum fine of $500 and maximum imprisonment of sixty
    days for refusal to answer, and maximum fine of $10,000 and maximum
    imprisonment of one year for giving a false answer. In addition,
    such section 74 prescribed a minimum fine of $300 for refusal to
    answer or giving a false answer. This revised section adopts the
    penalties of such section 210, which was the latest enactment on
    the subject, and which might have been regarded as having
    superseded the penal provisions of such sections 74 and 84.
    According to its own terms, its penal provisions were applicable
    not only to the censuses of population, agriculture, etc., provided
    for in chapter 4 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., but also to any
    schedules prepared under the act of March 6, 1902 (sections 1-6,
    77, 101, 111, and 112 of such title), or under acts amendatory
    thereof "or supplemental thereto." This reference did not cover
    sections 74 and 84 specifically, but such sections, enacted in 1924
    and 1916, respectively, could probably be regarded as having been
    "supplemental" to the 1902 act. In any event, this revised section
    establishes uniform penalties for refusal to answer, or giving a
    false answer in the circumstances stated. Further, the prescribed
    penalties are the maximum, and any lesser penalty can be imposed if
    the facts of the case warrant it.
      Reference to the "Secretary [of Commerce] or other authorized
    officer or employee of the Department of Commerce or bureau or
    agency thereof" was substituted for references to the Director of
    the Census and employees of the Bureau of the Census, to conform
    with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, Secs. 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950,
    15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263. See Revision Note to section 4 of this
    title.
      References to the offenses as being in each case a "misdemeanor"
    were omitted as covered by section 1 of title 18, U.S.C., 1952 ed.,
    Crimes and Criminal Procedure, classifying crimes; and words "upon
    conviction thereof" and "at the discretion of the court" were
    omitted as surplusage.
      The provision permitting the requests to be made by registered
    mail, by telegraph, by visiting representative, or by one or more
    of these methods, was contained in sections 74 and 84 of title 13,
    U.S.C., 1952 ed., but not in section 210 of such title. It is
    retained in this section as probably a desirable provision to apply
    generally.
      Provisions in sections 74, 84 and 210 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952
    ed., that it "shall be the duty" of the persons referred to, to
    answer correctly, etc., were omitted as unnecessary and redundant.
    This section defines offenses and prescribes penalties for
    committing them, and are deemed sufficient for the purpose of
    enforcement. However, some of the language used in the omitted
    provisions was necessarily included in the description of the
    offenses.
      Changes were made in phraseology.

                                AMENDMENTS                            
      1976 - Pub. L. 94-521 struck out provision enumerating methods by
    which the Department of Commerce may transmit a request to answer
    census questions under this section, substituted "schedule or
    questionnaire" for "schedule", struck out provision authorizing a
    sixty day maximum prison term for neglecting or refusing to answer
    census questions submitted under this section and a similar
    provision authorizing a one year maximum prison term for willfully
    giving a false answer to any such questions.

-STATUTE-
      (a) In connection with any survey conducted by the Secretary or
    other authorized officer or employee of the Department of Commerce
    or bureau or agency thereof pursuant to subchapter IV of chapter 5
    of this title, the provisions of sections 221, 222, 223 and 224 of
    this title shall apply - 
        (1) with respect to the answering of questions and furnishing
      of information, only to such inquiries as are within the scope of
      the schedules and questionnaires and of the type and character
      heretofore used in connection with the taking of complete

      agency thereof with the approval of the Secretary, that the
      information called for is needed to aid or permit the efficient
      performance of essential governmental functions or services, or
      has significant application to the needs of the public, business,
      or industry and is not publicly available from nongovernmental or
      other governmental sources;
        (3) in the case of any new survey, only after public notice,
      given by the Secretary or other authorized officer or employee of

      (d) Where the doctrine, teaching, or discipline of any religious

      Section consolidates parts of sections 111 and 122 of title 13,
    U.S.C., 1952 ed., with changes in phraseology necessary to effect
    consolidation and to preserve the intent, scope and meaning of the
    parts of such sections so consolidated. For remainder of such
    sections 111 and 122, see Distribution Table.
      Subsections (a) and (b) of this revised section are from section
    122 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., and in subsection (a) references
    to the Secretary (of Commerce) and to "other authorized officer or
    employee of the Department of Commerce or bureau or agency thereof"
    were substituted for references to the Director of the Census to
    conform with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, Secs. 1, 2, eff. May
    24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263. See Revision Note to section
    4 of this title.
      Subsection (c) is partly new (but preserves existing law), and
    partly from section 122 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed. Section 252
    of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which related to the censuses of
    governments provided by section 251 thereof (see subchapter III of
    chapter 5 of this title), made certain sections in chapter 4 of
    that title relating to censuses of population, agriculture, etc.,
    applicable to such censuses of governments. However, it did not
    list sections 209 and 210 of such title among the sections made so
    applicable, probably because they would hardly be relevant and
    capable of application to such censuses. Subsection (c) makes it
    clear that sections 221-224 of this revised title, into which were
    carried the provisions of such sections 209 and 210, and which
    speak in general terms, are not applicable to the censuses and
    surveys of governments.
      Subsection (d) is from section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed.
    Words in this subsection, "a refusal, in such circumstances, to
    furnish such information shall not be an offense under this
    chapter", read "such information shall not be required". It was
    felt that such exception in such section 111 was actually more in
    the nature of an exception to the penal provisions, and it has been
    so treated in this revised title. The collection of statistics on
    religion are provided for in section 102 of this title.

      Section consolidates part of section 74 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952
    ed., which section related to the collection of cotton statistics,
    with part of section 84 of such title, which section related to the
    collection of statistics on oilseeds, nuts and kernels, fats, oils
    and greases. For remainder of such sections 74 and 84, see
    Distribution Table.
      Section 74 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., authorized the making
    of requests for information by registered mail, and provided that,
    if so made, the registry receipt should be "accepted as evidence of
    such demand". Section 84 thereof authorized the making of requests
    by registered mail, or "by telegraph", and provided that, if so
    made, the "return" receipt therefor should be "prima facie evidence
    of an official request". The authorizations contained in such
    sections have been carried into section 224 of this title, and the
    evidentiary provisions thereof have been carried into this section,
    and they apply to investigations other than those to which such
    sections 74 and 84 related. See Revision Note to section 224 of
    this title.
      In this revised section, the language of section 84 of title 13,
    U.S.C., 1952 ed., was largely followed as probably being the more
    desirable, but "or other written receipt thereof" was inserted
    since there is no return receipt with respect to a telegram, and
    words "in any prosecution under such section" were inserted for the
    purpose of completeness.
      Further, words "Secretary or other authorized officer or employee
    of the Department of Commerce or bureau or agency thereof" were
    substituted for references to the Director of the Census, to
    conform with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, Secs. 1, 2, eff. May
    24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263. See Revision Note to section

    Sec. 301. Collection and publication

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Secretary is authorized to collect information from all
    persons exporting from, or importing into, the United States and
    the noncontiguous areas over which the United States exercises
    sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control, and from all persons engaged
    in trade between the United States and such noncontiguous areas and
    between those areas, or from the owners, or operators of carriers
    engaged in such foreign commerce or trade, and shall compile and
    publish such information pertaining to exports, imports, trade, and
    transportation relating thereto, as he deems necessary or
    appropriate to enable him to foster, promote, develop, and further
    the commerce, domestic and foreign, of the United States and for
    other lawful purposes.
      (b) The Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Ways and Means
    of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the
    Senate, on quarterly and cumulative bases, statistics on United
    States imports for consumption and United States exports by country
    and by product. Statistics on United States imports shall be
    submitted in accordance with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the
    United States Annotated for Statistical Reporting Purposes and
    general statistical note 1 thereof, in detail as follows:
        (1) net quantity;
        (2) United States customs value;
        (3) purchase price or its equivalent;
        (4) equivalent of arm's length value;
        (5) aggregate cost from port of exportation to United States
      port of entry;
        (6) a United States port of entry value comprised of (5) plus
      (4), if applicable, or, if not applicable, (5) plus (3); and
        (7) for transactions where (3) and (4) are equal, the total
      value of such transactions.

    The data for paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6) shall be
    reported separately for nonrelated and related party transactions,
    and shall also be reported as a total of all transactions.
      (c) In submitting any information under subsection (b) with
    respect to exports, the Secretary shall state separately from the
    total value of all exports - 
        (1)(A) the value of agricultural commodities exported under the
      Food for Peace Act, as amended; and
        (B) the total amount of all export subsidies paid to exporters
      by the United States under such Act for the exportation of such
      commodities; and
        (2) the value of goods exported under the Foreign Assistance
      Act of 1961.

      (d) To assist the Secretary to carry out the provisions of
    subsections (b) and (c) - 
        (1) the Secretary of Agriculture shall furnish information to
      the Secretary concerning the value of agricultural commodities
      exported under provisions of the Food for Peace Act, as amended,
      and the total amounts of all export subsidies paid to exporters
      by the United States under such Act for the exportation of such
      commodities; and
        (2) the Secretary of State shall furnish information to the
      Secretary concerning the value of goods exported under the
      provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended.

      (e) There shall be reported, on monthly and cumulative bases, for
    each heading or subheading in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the
    United States Annotated for Statistical Reporting Purposes, the
    United States port of entry value (as determined under subsection
    (b)(6)). There shall be reported, on monthly and cumulative bases,
    the balance of international trade for the United States reflecting
    (1) the aggregate value of all United States imports as reported in
    accordance with the first sentence of this subsection, and (2) the
    aggregate value of all United States exports. The information
    required to be reported under this subsection shall be reported in
    a form that is adjusted for economic inflation or deflation (on a
    constant dollar basis consistent with the reporting of the National
    Income and Product Accounts), and in a form that is not so
    adjusted.
      (f) On or before January 1, 1981, and as often thereafter as may
    be necessary to reflect significant changes in rates, there shall
    be reported for each heading or subheading in the Harmonized Tariff
    Schedule of the United States Annotated for Statistical Reporting
    Purposes, the ad valorem or ad valorem equivalent rate of duty
    which would have been required to be imposed on dutiable imports
    under that heading or subheading, if the United States customs
    values of such imports were based on the United States port of
    entry value (as reported in accordance with the first sentence of
    subsection (e)) in order to collect the same amount of duties on
    imports under that heading or subheading as are currently
    collected.
      (g) Shippers' Export Declarations (or any successor document),
    wherever located, shall be exempt from public disclosure unless the
    Secretary determines that such exemption would be contrary to the
    national interest.
      (h) The Secretary is authorized to require by regulation the
    filing of Shippers' Export Declarations under this chapter through
    an automated and electronic system for the filing of export
    information established by the Department of the Treasury.

    the Secretary of the Treasury under any rule, regulation, or order
    issued pursuant to this chapter may be filed after the departure of
    such carrier from the port or place of exportation or
    transportation, whether such departing carrier is destined directly
    to a foreign port or place or to a noncontiguous area, or proceeds

    a bond in an approved form in a penal sum of $10,000 is filed with
    the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of Commerce may, by a

      section or section 304 shall be deposited into the general fund
      of the Treasury and credited as miscellaneous receipts.
