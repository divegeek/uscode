      These rules are drawn under the authority of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2072,
    as amended by the Act of November 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 1323 (1 U.S.
    Code Cong. & Ad. News, p. 1546 (1966)) (Rules of Civil Procedure);
    28 U.S.C. Sec. 2075 (Bankruptcy Rules); and 18 U.S.C. Secs. 3771
    (Procedure to and including verdict) and 3772 (Procedure after
    verdict). Those statutes combine to give to the Supreme Court power
    to make rules of practice and procedure for all cases within the
    jurisdiction of the courts of appeals. By the terms of the
    statutes, after the rules have taken effect all laws in conflict
    with them are of no further force or effect. Practice and procedure
    in the eleven courts of appeals are now regulated by rules
    promulgated by each court under the authority of 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    2071. Rule 47 expressly authorizes the courts of appeals to make
    rules of practice not inconsistent with these rules.
      As indicated by the titles under which they are found, the
    following rules are of special application: Rules 3 through 12
    apply to appeals from judgments and orders of the district courts;
    Rules 13 and 14 apply to appeals from decisions of the Tax Court
    (Rule 13 establishes an appeal as the mode of review of decisions
    of the Tax Court in place of the present petition for review);
    Rules 15 through 20 apply to proceedings for review or enforcement
    of orders of administrative agencies, boards, commissions and
    officers. Rules 22 through 24 regulate habeas corpus proceedings
    and appeals in forma pauperis. All other rules apply to all
    proceedings in the courts of appeals.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1979 AMENDMENT       
      The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure were designed as an
    integrated set of rules to be followed in appeals to the courts of
    appeals, covering all steps in the appellate process, whether they
    take place in the district court or in the court of appeals, and
    with their adoption Rules 72-76 of the F.R.C.P. were abrogated. In
    some instances, however, the F.R.A.P. provide that a motion or
    application for relief may, or must, be made in the district court.
    See Rules 4(a), 10(b), and 24. The proposed amendment would make it
    clear that when this is so the motion or application is to be made
    in the form and manner prescribed by the F.R.C.P. or F.R.Cr.P. and
    local rules relating to the form and presentation of motions and is
    not governed by Rule 27 of the F.R.A.P. See Rule 7(b) of the
    F.R.C.P. and Rule 47 of the F.R.Cr.P.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1989 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (c). A new subdivision is added to the rule. The text
    of new subdivision (c) has been moved from Rule 48 to Rule 1 to
    allow the addition of new rules at the end of the existing set of
    appellate rules without burying the title provision among other
    rules. In a similar fashion the Bankruptcy Rules combine the
    provisions governing the scope of the rules and the title in the
    first rule.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only. The
    Advisory Committee recommends deleting the language in subdivision
    (a) that describes the different types of proceedings that may be
    brought in a court of appeals. The Advisory Committee believes that
    the language is unnecessary and that its omission does not work any
    substantive change.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (b). Two recent enactments make it likely that, in
    the future, one or more of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure
    ("FRAP") will extend or limit the jurisdiction of the courts of
    appeals. In 1990, Congress amended the Rules Enabling Act to give
    the Supreme Court authority to use the federal rules of practice
    and procedure to define when a ruling of a district court is final
    for purposes of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291. See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2072(c). In
    1992, Congress amended 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292 to give the Supreme
    Court authority to use the federal rules of practice and procedure
    to provide for appeals of interlocutory decisions that are not
    already authorized by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292. See 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    1292(e). Both Sec. 1291 and Sec. 1292 are unquestionably
    jurisdictional statutes, and thus, as soon as FRAP is amended to
    define finality for purposes of the former or to authorize
    interlocutory appeals not provided for by the latter, FRAP will
    "extend or limit the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals," and
    subdivision (b) will become obsolete. For that reason, subdivision
    (b) has been abrogated.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.

-STATUTE-
      On its own or a party's motion, a court of appeals may - to

    provision of these rules in a particular case and order proceedings
    as it directs, except as otherwise provided in Rule 26(b).

      The primary purpose of this rule is to make clear the power of
    the courts of appeals to expedite the determination of cases of
    pressing concern to the public or to the litigants by prescribing a
    time schedule other than that provided by the rules. The rule also
    contains a general authorization to the courts to relieve litigants
    of the consequences of default where manifest injustice would
    otherwise result. Rule 26(b) prohibits a court of appeals from
    extending the time for taking appeal or seeking review.

    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
    TITLE II. APPEAL FROM A JUDGMENT OR ORDER OF A DISTRICT COURT

-HEAD-
    Rule 3. Appeal as of Right - How Taken

-STATUTE-
      (a) Filing the Notice of Appeal.
        (1) An appeal permitted by law as of right from a district
      court to a court of appeals may be taken only by filing a notice
      of appeal with the district clerk within the time allowed by Rule
      4. At the time of filing, the appellant must furnish the clerk
      with enough copies of the notice to enable the clerk to comply
      with Rule 3(d).
        (2) An appellant's failure to take any step other than the
      timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the validity
      of the appeal, but is ground only for the court of appeals to act
      as it considers appropriate, including dismissing the appeal.
        (3) An appeal from a judgment by a magistrate judge in a civil
      case is taken in the same way as an appeal from any other
      district court judgment.
        (4) An appeal by permission under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(b) or an
      appeal in a bankruptcy case may be taken only in the manner
      prescribed by Rules 5 and 6, respectively.

      (b) Joint or Consolidated Appeals.
        (1) When two or more parties are entitled to appeal from a
      district-court judgment or order, and their interests make
      joinder practicable, they may file a joint notice of appeal. They
      may then proceed on appeal as a single appellant.
        (2) When the parties have filed separate timely notices of
      appeal, the appeals may be joined or consolidated by the court of
      appeals.

      (c) Contents of the Notice of Appeal.
        (1) The notice of appeal must:
          (A) specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming
        each one in the caption or body of the notice, but an attorney
        representing more than one party may describe those parties
        with such terms as "all plaintiffs," "the defendants," "the
        plaintiffs A, B, et al.," or "all defendants except X";
          (B) designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being
        appealed; and
          (C) name the court to which the appeal is taken.

        (2) A pro se notice of appeal is considered filed on behalf of
      the signer and the signer's spouse and minor children (if they
      are parties), unless the notice clearly indicates otherwise.
        (3) In a class action, whether or not the class has been
      certified, the notice of appeal is sufficient if it names one
      person qualified to bring the appeal as representative of the
      class.
        (4) An appeal must not be dismissed for informality of form or
      title of the notice of appeal, or for failure to name a party
      whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice.
        (5) Form 1 in the Appendix of Forms is a suggested form of a
      notice of appeal.

      (d) Serving the Notice of Appeal.
        (1) The district clerk must serve notice of the filing of a
      notice of appeal by mailing a copy to each party's counsel of
      record - excluding the appellant's - or, if a party is proceeding
      pro se, to the party's last known address. When a defendant in a
      criminal case appeals, the clerk must also serve a copy of the
      notice of appeal on the defendant, either by personal service or
      by mail addressed to the defendant. The clerk must promptly send
      a copy of the notice of appeal and of the docket entries - and
      any later docket entries - to the clerk of the court of appeals
      named in the notice. The district clerk must note, on each copy,
      the date when the notice of appeal was filed.
        (2) If an inmate confined in an institution files a notice of
      appeal in the manner provided by Rule 4(c), the district clerk
      must also note the date when the clerk docketed the notice.
        (3) The district clerk's failure to serve notice does not
      affect the validity of the appeal. The clerk must note on the
      docket the names of the parties to whom the clerk mails copies,
      with the date of mailing. Service is sufficient despite the death
      of a party or the party's counsel.

      (e) Payment of Fees. Upon filing a notice of appeal, the
    appellant must pay the district clerk all required fees. The
    district clerk receives the appellate docket fee on behalf of the
    court of appeals.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      General Note. Rule 3 and Rule 4 combine to require that a notice
    of appeal be filed with the clerk of the district court within the
    time prescribed for taking an appeal. Because the timely filing of
    a notice of appeal is "mandatory and jurisdictional," United States
    v. Robinson, 361 U.S. 220, 224, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960),
    compliance with the provisions of those rules is of the utmost
    importance. But the proposed rules merely restate, in modified
    form, provisions now found in the civil and criminal rules (FRCP
    5(e), 73; FRCrP 37), and decisions under the present rules which
    dispense with literal compliance in cases in which it cannot fairly
    be exacted should control interpretation of these rules.
    Illustrative decisions are: Fallen v. United States, 378 U.S. 139,
    84 S.Ct. 1689, 12 L.Ed.2d 760 (1964) (notice of appeal by a
    prisoner, in the form of a letter delivered, well within the time
    fixed for appeal, to prison authorities for mailing to the clerk of
    the district court held timely filed notwithstanding that it was
    received by the clerk after expiration of the time for appeal; the
    appellant "did all he could" to effect timely filing); Richey v.
    Wilkins, 335 F.2d 1 (2d Cir. 1964) (notice filed in the court of
    appeals by a prisoner without assistance of counsel held
    sufficient); Halfen v. United States, 324 F.2d 52 (10th Cir. 1963)
    (notice mailed to district judge in time to have been received by
    him in normal course held sufficient); Riffle v. United States, 299
    F.2d 802 (5th Cir. 1962) (letter of prisoner to judge of court of
    appeals held sufficient). Earlier cases evidencing "a liberal view
    of papers filed by indigent and incarcerated defendants" are listed
    in Coppedge v. United States, 369 U.S. 438, 442, n. 5, 82 S.Ct.
    917, 8 L.Ed.2d 21 (1962).
      Subdivision (a). The substance of this subdivision is derived
    from FRCP 73(a) and FRCrP 37(a)(1). The proposed rule follows those
    rules in requiring nothing other than the filing of a notice of
    appeal in the district court for the perfection of the appeal. The
    petition for allowance (except for appeals governed by Rules 5 and
    6), citations, assignments of error, summons and severance - all
    specifically abolished by earlier modern rules - are assumed to be
    sufficiently obsolete as no longer to require pointed abolition.
      Subdivision (b). The first sentence is derived from FRCP 74. The
    second sentence is added to encourage consolidation of appeals
    whenever feasible.
      Subdivision (c). This subdivision is identical with corresponding
    provisions in FRCP 73(b) and FRCrP 37(a)(1).
      Subdivision (d). This subdivision is derived from FRCP 73(b) and
    FRCrP 37(a)(1). The duty of the clerk to forward a copy of the
    notice of appeal and of the docket entries to the court of appeals
    in a criminal case extended to habeas corpus and 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    2255 proceedings.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1979 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (c). The proposed amendment would add the last
    sentence. Because of the fact that the timely filing of the notice
    of appeal has been characterized as jurisdictional (See, e.g.,
    Brainerd v. Beal (C.A. 7th, 1974) 498 F.2d 901, in which the filing
    of a notice of appeal one day late was fatal), it is important that
    the right to appeal not be lost by mistakes of mere form. In a
    number of decided cases it has been held that so long as the
    function of notice is met by the filing of a paper indicating an
    intention to appeal, the substance of the rule has been complied
    with. See, e.g., Cobb v. Lewis (C.A. 5th, 1974) 488 F.2d 41; Holley
    v. Capps (C.A. 5th, 1972) 468 F.2d 1366. The proposed amendment
    would give recognition to this practice.
      When a notice of appeal is filed, the clerk should ascertain
    whether any judgment designated therein has been entered in
    compliance with Rules 58 and 79(a) of the F.R.C.P. See Note to Rule
    4(a)(6), infra.
      Subdivision (d). The proposed amendment would extend to civil
    cases the present provision applicable to criminal cases, habeas
    corpus cases, and proceedings under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255, requiring
    the clerk of the district court to transmit to the clerk of the
    court of appeals a copy of the notice of appeal and of the docket
    entries, which should include reference to compliance with the
    requirements for payment of fees. See Note to (e), infra.
      This requirement is the initial step in proposed changes in the
    rules to place in the court of appeals an increased practical
    control over the early steps in the appeal.
      Subdivision (e). Proposed new Rule 3(e) represents the second
    step in shifting to the court of appeals the control of the early
    stages of an appeal. See Note to Rule 3(d) above. Under the present
    rules the payment of the fee prescribed by 28 U.S.C. 1917 is not
    covered. Under the statute, however, this fee is paid to the clerk
    of the district court at the time the notice of appeal is filed.
    Under present Rule 12, the "docket fee" fixed by the Judicial
    Conference of the United States under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1913 must be
    paid to the clerk of the court of appeals within the time fixed for
    transmission of the record, ". . . and the clerk shall thereupon
    enter the appeal upon the docket."
      Under the proposed new Rule 3(e) both fees would be paid to the
    clerk of the district court at the time the notice of appeal is
    filed, the clerk of the district court receiving the docket fee on
    behalf of the court of appeals.
      In view of the provision in Rule 3(a) that "[f]ailure of an
    appellant to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice
    of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground
    only for such action as the court of appeals deems appropriate,
    which may include dismissal of the appeal," the case law indicates
    that the failure to prepay the statutory filing fee does not
    constitute a jurisdictional defect. See Parissi v. Telechron, 349
    U.S. 46 (1955); Gould v. Members of N. J. Division of Water Policy
    & Supply, 555 F.2d 340 (3d Cir. 1977). Similarly, under present
    Rule 12, failure to pay the docket fee within the time prescribed
    may be excused by the court of appeals. See, e. g., Walker v.
    Mathews, 546 F.2d 814 (9th Cir. 1976). Proposed new Rule 3(e)
    adopts the view of these cases, requiring that both fees be paid at
    the time the notice of appeal is filed, but subject to the
    provisions of Rule 26(b) preserving the authority of the court of
    appeals to permit late payment.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1986 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments to Rule 3(d) are technical. No substantive change
    is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1989 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Note to subdivision (c). The amendment is intended to reduce the
    amount of satellite litigation spawned by the Supreme Court's
    decision in Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U.S. 312 (1988).
    In Torres the Supreme Court held that the language in Rule 3(c)
    requiring a notice of appeal to "specify the party or parties
    taking the appeal" is a jurisdictional requirement and that naming
    the first named party and adding "et al.," without any further
    specificity is insufficient to identify the appellants. Since the
    Torres decision, there has been a great deal of litigation
    regarding whether a notice of appeal that contains some indication
    of the appellants' identities but does not name the appellants is
    sufficiently specific.
      The amendment states a general rule that specifying the parties
    should be done by naming them. Naming an appellant in an otherwise
    timely and proper notice of appeal ensures that the appellant has
    perfected an appeal. However, in order to prevent the loss of a
    right to appeal through inadvertent omission of a party's name or
    continued use of such terms as "et al.," which are sufficient in
    all district court filings after the complaint, the amendment
    allows an attorney representing more than one party the flexibility
    to indicate which parties are appealing without naming them
    individually. The test established by the rule for determining
    whether such designations are sufficient is whether it is
    objectively clear that a party intended to appeal. A notice of
    appeal filed by a party proceeding pro se is filed on behalf of the
    party signing the notice and the signer's spouse and minor
    children, if they are parties, unless the notice clearly indicates
    a contrary intent.
      In class actions, naming each member of a class as an appellant
    may be extraordinarily burdensome or even impossible. In class
    actions if class certification has been denied, named plaintiffs
    may appeal the order denying the class certification on their own
    behalf and on behalf of putative class members, United States
    Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388 (1980); or if the named
    plaintiffs choose not to appeal the order denying the class
    certification, putative class members may appeal, United Airlines,
    Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U.S. 385 (1977). If no class has been
    certified, naming each of the putative class members as an
    appellant would often be impossible. Therefore the amendment
    provides that in class actions, whether or not the class has been
    certified, it is sufficient for the notice to name one person
    qualified to bring the appeal as a representative of the class.
      Finally, the rule makes it clear that dismissal of an appeal
    should not occur when it is otherwise clear from the notice that
    the party intended to appeal. If a court determines it is
    objectively clear that a party intended to appeal, there are
    neither administrative concerns nor fairness concerns that should
    prevent the appeal from going forward.
      Note to subdivision (d). The amendment requires the district
    court clerk to send to the clerk of the court of appeals a copy of
    every docket entry in a case after the filing of a notice of
    appeal. This amendment accompanies the amendment to Rule 4(a)(4),
    which provides that when one of the posttrial motions enumerated in
    Rule 4(a)(4) is filed, a notice of appeal filed before the
    disposition of the motion becomes effective upon disposition of the
    motion. The court of appeals needs to be advised that the filing of
    a posttrial motion has suspended a notice of appeal. The court of
    appeals also needs to know when the district court has ruled on the
    motion. Sending copies of all docket entries after the filing of a
    notice of appeal should provide the courts of appeals with the
    necessary information.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The amendment requires a party filing a notice
    of appeal to provide the court with sufficient copies of the notice
    for service on all other parties.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are generally intended to be stylistic only;
    in this rule, however, substantive changes are made in subdivisions
    (a), (b), and (d).
      Subdivision (a). The provision in paragraph (a)(3) is transferred
    from former Rule 3.1(b). The Federal Courts Improvement Act of
    1996, Pub. L. No. 104-317, repealed paragraphs (4) and (5) of 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 636(c). That statutory change made the continued
    separate existence of Rule 3.1 unnecessary. New paragraph (a)(3) of
    this rule simply makes it clear that an appeal from a judgment by a
    magistrate judge is taken in identical fashion to any other appeal
    from a district-court judgment.
      Subdivision (b). A joint appeal is authorized only when two or
    more persons may appeal from a single judgment or order. A joint
    appeal is treated as a single appeal and the joint appellants file
    a single brief. Under existing Rule 3(b) parties decide whether to
    join their appeals. They may do so by filing a joint notice of
    appeal or by joining their appeals after filing separate notices of
    appeal.
      In consolidated appeals the separate appeals do not merge into
    one. The parties do not proceed as a single appellant. Under
    existing Rule 3(b) it is unclear whether appeals may be
    consolidated without court order if the parties stipulate to
    consolidation. The language resolves that ambiguity by requiring
    court action.
      The language also requires court action to join appeals after
    separate notices of appeal have been filed.
      Subdivision (d). Paragraph (d)(2) has been amended to require
    that when an inmate files a notice of appeal by depositing the
    notice in the institution's internal mail system, the clerk must
    note the docketing date - rather than the receipt date - on the
    notice of appeal before serving copies of it. This change conforms
    to a change in Rule 4(c). Rule 4(c) is amended to provide that when
    an inmate files the first notice of appeal in a civil case by
    depositing the notice in an institution's internal mail system, the
    time for filing a cross-appeal runs from the date the district
    court dockets the inmate's notice of appeal. Existing Rule 4(c)
    says that in such a case the time for filing a cross-appeal runs
    from the date the district court receives the inmate's notice of
    appeal. A court may "receive" a paper when its mail is delivered to
    it even if the mail is not processed for a day or two, making the
    date of receipt uncertain. "Docketing" is an easily identified
    event. The change is made to eliminate the uncertainty.

-MISC1-
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-317,
    repealed paragraphs (4) and (5) of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(c). That
    statutory change means that when parties consent to trial before a
    magistrate judge, appeal lies directly, and as a matter of right,
    to the court of appeals under Sec. 636(c)(3). The parties may not
    choose to appeal first to a district judge and thereafter seek
    discretionary review in the court of appeals.
      As a result of the statutory amendments, subdivision (a) of Rule
    3.1 is no longer necessary. Since Rule 3.1 existed primarily
    because of the provisions in subdivision (a), subdivision (b) has
    been moved to Rule 3(a)(3) and Rule 3.1 has been abrogated.

-EXPCITE-
    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
    TITLE II. APPEAL FROM A JUDGMENT OR ORDER OF A DISTRICT COURT

-HEAD-
    Rule 4. Appeal as of Right - When Taken

-STATUTE-
      (a) Appeal in a Civil Case.
        (1) Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal.
          (A) In a civil case, except as provided in Rules 4(a)(1)(B),
        4(a)(4), and 4(c), the notice of appeal required by Rule 3 must
        be filed with the district clerk within 30 days after the
        judgment or order appealed from is entered.
          (B) When the United States or its officer or agency is a
        party, the notice of appeal may be filed by any party within 60
        days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.
          (C) An appeal from an order granting or denying an
        application for a writ of error coram nobis is an appeal in a
        civil case for purposes of Rule 4(a).

        (2) Filing Before Entry of Judgment. A notice of appeal filed
      after the court announces a decision or order - but before the
      entry of the judgment or order - is treated as filed on the date
      of and after the entry.
        (3) Multiple Appeals. If one party timely files a notice of
      appeal, any other party may file a notice of appeal within 14
      days after the date when the first notice was filed, or within
      the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period
      ends later.
        (4) Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal.
          (A) If a party timely files in the district court any of the
        following motions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
        the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the entry
        of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion:
            (i) for judgment under Rule 50(b);
            (ii) to amend or make additional factual findings under
          Rule 52(b), whether or not granting the motion would alter
          the judgment;
            (iii) for attorney's fees under Rule 54 if the district
          court extends the time to appeal under Rule 58;
            (iv) to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59;
            (v) for a new trial under Rule 59; or
            (vi) for relief under Rule 60 if the motion is filed no
          later than 28 days after the judgment is entered.

          (B)(i) If a party files a notice of appeal after the court
        announces or enters a judgment - but before it disposes of any
        motion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A) - the notice becomes effective
        to appeal a judgment or order, in whole or in part, when the
        order disposing of the last such remaining motion is entered.
          (ii) A party intending to challenge an order disposing of any
        motion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A), or a judgment's alteration or
        amendment upon such a motion, must file a notice of appeal, or
        an amended notice of appeal - in compliance with Rule 3(c) -
        within the time prescribed by this Rule measured from the entry
        of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.

        (5) Motion for Extension of Time.
          (A) The district court may extend the time to file a notice
        of appeal if:
            (i) a party so moves no later than 30 days after the time
          prescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires; and
            (ii) regardless of whether its motion is filed before or
          during the 30 days after the time prescribed by this Rule
          4(a) expires, that party shows excusable neglect or good
          cause.

          (B) A motion filed before the expiration of the time
        prescribed in Rule 4(a)(1) or (3) may be ex parte unless the
        court requires otherwise. If the motion is filed after the
        expiration of the prescribed time, notice must be given to the
        other parties in accordance with local rules.
          (C) No extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) may exceed 30 days
        after the prescribed time or 14 days after the date when the
        order granting the motion is entered, whichever is later.

        (6) Reopening the Time to File an Appeal. The district court
      may reopen the time to file an appeal for a period of 14 days
      after the date when its order to reopen is entered, but only if
      all the following conditions are satisfied:
          (A) the court finds that the moving party did not receive
        notice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry
        of the judgment or order sought to be appealed within 21 days
        after entry;
          (B) the motion is filed within 180 days after the judgment or
        order is entered or within 14 days after the moving party
        receives notice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d) of
        the entry, whichever is earlier; and
          (C) the court finds that no party would be prejudiced.

        (7) Entry Defined.
          (A) A judgment or order is entered for purposes of this Rule
        4(a):
            (i) if Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58(a)(1) does not
          require a separate document, when the judgment or order is
          entered in the civil docket under Federal Rule of Civil
          Procedure 79(a); or
            (ii) if Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58(a)(1) requires a
          separate document, when the judgment or order is entered in
          the civil docket under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 79(a)
          and when the earlier of these events occurs:
              -- the judgment or order is set forth on a separate
            document, or
              -- 150 days have run from entry of the judgment or order
            in the civil docket under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
            79(a).

          (B) A failure to set forth a judgment or order on a separate
        document when required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
        58(a)(1) does not affect the validity of an appeal from that
        judgment or order.

      (b) Appeal in a Criminal Case.
        (1) Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal.
          (A) In a criminal case, a defendant's notice of appeal must
        be filed in the district court within 14 days after the later
        of:
            (i) the entry of either the judgment or the order being
          appealed; or
            (ii) the filing of the government's notice of appeal.

          (B) When the government is entitled to appeal, its notice of
        appeal must be filed in the district court within 30 days after
        the later of:
            (i) the entry of the judgment or order being appealed; or
            (ii) the filing of a notice of appeal by any defendant.

        (2) Filing Before Entry of Judgment. A notice of appeal filed
      after the court announces a decision, sentence, or order - but
      before the entry of the judgment or order - is treated as filed
      on the date of and after the entry.
        (3) Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal.
          (A) If a defendant timely makes any of the following motions
        under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the notice of
        appeal from a judgment of conviction must be filed within 14
        days after the entry of the order disposing of the last such
        remaining motion, or within 14 days after the entry of the
        judgment of conviction, whichever period ends later. This
        provision applies to a timely motion:
            (i) for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29;
            (ii) for a new trial under Rule 33, but if based on newly
          discovered evidence, only if the motion is made no later than
          14 days after the entry of the judgment; or
            (iii) for arrest of judgment under Rule 34.

          (B) A notice of appeal filed after the court announces a
        decision, sentence, or order - but before it disposes of any of
        the motions referred to in Rule 4(b)(3)(A) - becomes effective
        upon the later of the following:
            (i) the entry of the order disposing of the last such
          remaining motion; or
            (ii) the entry of the judgment of conviction.

          (C) A valid notice of appeal is effective - without amendment
        - to appeal from an order disposing of any of the motions
        referred to in Rule 4(b)(3)(A).

        (4) Motion for Extension of Time. Upon a finding of excusable
      neglect or good cause, the district court may - before or after
      the time has expired, with or without motion and notice - extend
      the time to file a notice of appeal for a period not to exceed 30
      days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by this
      Rule 4(b).
        (5) Jurisdiction. The filing of a notice of appeal under this
      Rule 4(b) does not divest a district court of jurisdiction to
      correct a sentence under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure
      35(a), nor does the filing of a motion under 35(a) affect the
      validity of a notice of appeal filed before entry of the order
      disposing of the motion. The filing of a motion under Federal
      Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a) does not suspend the time for
      filing a notice of appeal from a judgment of conviction.
        (6) Entry Defined. A judgment or order is entered for purposes
      of this Rule 4(b) when it is entered on the criminal docket.

      (c) Appeal by an Inmate Confined in an Institution.
        (1) If an inmate confined in an institution files a notice of
      appeal in either a civil or a criminal case, the notice is timely
      if it is deposited in the institution's internal mail system on
      or before the last day for filing. If an institution has a system
      designed for legal mail, the inmate must use that system to
      receive the benefit of this rule. Timely filing may be shown by a
      declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1746 or by a
      notarized statement, either of which must set forth the date of
      deposit and state that first-class postage has been prepaid.
        (2) If an inmate files the first notice of appeal in a civil
      case under this Rule 4(c), the 14-day period provided in Rule
      4(a)(3) for another party to file a notice of appeal runs from
      the date when the district court dockets the first notice.
        (3) When a defendant in a criminal case files a notice of
      appeal under this Rule 4(c), the 30-day period for the government
      to file its notice of appeal runs from the entry of the judgment
      or order appealed from or from the district court's docketing of
      the defendant's notice of appeal, whichever is later.

      (d) Mistaken Filing in the Court of Appeals. If a notice of
    appeal in either a civil or a criminal case is mistakenly filed in
    the court of appeals, the clerk of that court must note on the
    notice the date when it was received and send it to the district
    clerk. The notice is then considered filed in the district court on
    the date so noted.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      Subdivision (a). This subdivision is derived from FRCP 73(a)
    without any change of substance. The requirement that a request for
    an extension of time for filing the notice of appeal made after
    expiration of the time be made by motion and on notice codifies the
    result reached under the present provisions of FRCP 73(a) and 6(b).
    North Umberland Mining Co. v. Standard Accident Ins. Co., 193 F.2d
    951 (9th Cir., 1952); Cohen v. Plateau Natural Gas Co., 303 F.2d
    273 (10th Cir., 1962); Plant Economy, Inc. v. Mirror Insulation
    Co., 308 F.2d 275 (3d Cir., 1962).
      Since this subdivision governs appeals in all civil cases, it
    supersedes the provisions of section 25 of the Bankruptcy Act (11
    U.S.C. Sec. 48). Except in cases to which the United States or an
    officer or agency thereof is a party, the change is a minor one,
    since a successful litigant in a bankruptcy proceeding may, under
    section 25, oblige an aggrieved party to appeal within 30 days
    after entry of judgment - the time fixed by this subdivision in
    cases involving private parties only - by serving him with notice
    of entry on the day thereof, and by the terms of section 25 an
    aggrieved party must in any event appeal within 40 days after entry
    of judgment. No reason appears why the time for appeal in
    bankruptcy should not be the same as that in civil cases generally.
    Furthermore, section 25 is a potential trap for the uninitiated.
    The time for appeal which it provides is not applicable to all
    appeals which may fairly be termed appeals in bankruptcy. Section
    25 governs only those cases referred to in section 24 as
    "proceedings in bankruptcy" and "controversies arising in
    proceedings in bankruptcy." Lowenstein v. Reikes, 54 F.2d 481 (2d
    Cir., 1931), cert. den., 285 U.S. 539, 52 S.Ct. 311, 76 L.Ed. 932
    (1932). The distinction between such cases and other cases which
    arise out of bankruptcy is often difficult to determine. See 2
    Moore's Collier on Bankruptcy &#182; 24.12 through &#182; 24.36
    (1962). As a result it is not always clear whether an appeal is
    governed by section 25 or by FRCP 73(a), which is applicable to
    such appeals in bankruptcy as are not governed by section 25.
      In view of the unification of the civil and admiralty procedure
    accomplished by the amendments of the Federal Rules of Civil
    Procedure effective July 1, 1966, this subdivision governs appeals
    in those civil actions which involve admiralty or maritime claims
    and which prior to that date were known as suits in admiralty.
      The only other change possibly effected by this subdivision is in
    the time for appeal from a decision of a district court on a
    petition for impeachment of an award of a board of arbitration
    under the Act of May 20, 1926, c. 347, Sec. 9 (44 Stat. 585), 45
    U.S.C. Sec. 159. The act provides that a notice of appeal from such
    a decision shall be filed within 10 days of the decision. This
    singular provision was apparently repealed by the enactment in 1948
    of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2107, which fixed 30 days from the date of entry
    of judgment as the time for appeal in all actions of a civil nature
    except actions in admiralty or bankruptcy matters or those in which
    the United States is a party. But it was not expressly repealed,
    and its status is in doubt. See 7 Moore's Federal Practice &#182;
    73.09[2] (1966). The doubt should be resolved, and no reason
    appears why appeals in such cases should not be taken within the
    time provided for civil cases generally.
      Subdivision (b). This subdivision is derived from FRCrP 37(a)(2)
    without change of substance.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1979 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a)(1). The words "(including a civil action which
    involves an admiralty or maritime claim and a proceeding in
    bankruptcy or a controversy arising therein)," which appear in the
    present rule are struck out as unnecessary and perhaps misleading
    in suggesting that there may be other categories that are not
    either civil or criminal within the meaning of Rule 4(a) and (b).
      The phrases "within 30 days of such entry" and "within 60 days of
    such entry" have been changed to read "after" instead of "or." The
    change is for clarity only, since the word "of" in the present rule
    appears to be used to mean "after." Since the proposed amended rule
    deals directly with the premature filing of a notice of appeal, it
    was thought useful to emphasize the fact that except as provided,
    the period during which a notice of appeal may be filed is the 30
    days, or 60 days as the case may be, following the entry of the
    judgment or order appealed from. See Notes to Rule 4(a)(2) and (4),
    below.
      Subdivision (a)(2). The proposed amendment to Rule 4(a)(2) would
    extend to civil cases the provisions of Rule 4(b), dealing with
    criminal cases, designed to avoid the loss of the right to appeal
    by filing the notice of appeal prematurely. Despite the absence of
    such a provision in Rule 4(a) the courts of appeals quite generally
    have held premature appeals effective. See, e. g., Matter of Grand
    Jury Empanelled Jan. 21, 1975, 541 F.2d 373 (3d Cir. 1976); Hodge
    v. Hodge, 507 F.2d 87 (3d Cir. 1976); Song Jook Suh v. Rosenberg,
    437 F.2d 1098 (9th Cir. 1971); Ruby v. Secretary of the Navy, 365
    F.2d 385 (9th Cir. 1966); Firchau v. Diamond Nat'l Corp., 345 F.2d
    469 (9th Cir. 1965).
      The proposed amended rule would recognize this practice but make
    an exception in cases in which a post trial motion has destroyed
    the finality of the judgment. See Note to Rule 4(a)(4) below.
      Subdivision (a)(4). The proposed amendment would make it clear
    that after the filing of the specified post trial motions, a notice
    of appeal should await disposition of the motion. Since the
    proposed amendments to Rules 3, 10, and 12 contemplate that
    immediately upon the filing of the notice of appeal the fees will
    be paid and the case docketed in the court of appeals, and the
    steps toward its disposition set in motion, it would be undesirable
    to proceed with the appeal while the district court has before it a
    motion the granting of which would vacate or alter the judgment
    appealed from. See, e. g., Kieth v. Newcourt, 530 F.2d 826 (8th
    Cir. 1976). Under the present rule, since docketing may not take
    place until the record is transmitted, premature filing is much
    less likely to involve waste effort. See, e. g., Stokes v. Peyton's
    Inc., 508 F.2d 1287 (5th Cir. 1975). Further, since a notice of
    appeal filed before the disposition of a post trial motion, even if
    it were treated as valid for purposes of jurisdiction, would not
    embrace objections to the denial of the motion, it is obviously
    preferable to postpone the notice of appeal until after the motion
    is disposed of.
      The present rule, since it provides for the "termination" of the
    "running" of the appeal time, is ambiguous in its application to a
    notice of appeal filed prior to a post trial motion filed within
    the 10 day limit. The amendment would make it clear that in such
    circumstances the appellant should not proceed with the appeal
    during pendency of the motion but should file a new notice of
    appeal after the motion is disposed of.
      Subdivision (a)(5). Under the present rule it is provided that
    upon a showing of excusable neglect the district court at any time
    may extend the time for the filing of a notice of appeal for a
    period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the time
    otherwise prescribed by the rule, but that if the application is
    made after the original time has run, the order may be made only on
    motion with such notice as the court deems appropriate.
      A literal reading of this provision would require that the
    extension be ordered and the notice of appeal filed within the 30
    day period, but despite the surface clarity of the rule, it has
    produced considerable confusion. See the discussion by Judge
    Friendly in In re Orbitek, 520 F.2d 358 (2d Cir. 1975). The
    proposed amendment would make it clear that a motion to extend the
    time must be filed no later than 30 days after the expiration of
    the original appeal time, and that if the motion is timely filed
    the district court may act upon the motion at a later date, and may
    extend the time not in excess of 10 days measured from the date on
    which the order granting the motion is entered.
      Under the present rule there is a possible implication that prior
    to the time the initial appeal time has run, the district court may
    extend the time on the basis of an informal application. The
    amendment would require that the application must be made by
    motion, though the motion may be made ex parte. After the
    expiration of the initial time a motion for the extension of the
    time must be made in compliance with the F.R.C.P. and local rules
    of the district court. See Note to proposed amended Rule 1, supra.
    And see Rules 6(d), 7(b) of the F.R.C.P.
      The proposed amended rule expands to some extent the standard for
    the grant of an extension of time. The present rule requires a
    "showing of excusable neglect." While this was an appropriate
    standard in cases in which the motion is made after the time for
    filing the notice of appeal has run, and remains so, it has never
    fit exactly the situation in which the appellant seeks an extension
    before the expiration of the initial time. In such a case "good
    cause," which is the standard that is applied in the granting of
    other extensions of time under Rule 26(b) seems to be more
    appropriate.
      Subdivision (a)(6). The proposed amendment would call attention
    to the requirement of Rule 58 of the F.R.C.P. that the judgment
    constitute a separate document. See United States v. Indrelunas,
    411 U.S. 216 (1973). When a notice of appeal is filed, the clerk
    should ascertain whether any judgment designated therein has been
    entered in compliance with Rules 58 and 79(a) and if not, so advise
    all parties and the district judge. While the requirement of Rule
    48 is not jurisdictional (see Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis, 431 U.S.
    928 (1977)), compliance is important since the time for the filing
    of a notice of appeal by other parties is measured by the time at
    which the judgment is properly entered.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment provides a limited opportunity for relief in
    circumstances where the notice of entry of a judgment or order,
    required to be mailed by the clerk of the district court pursuant
    to Rule 77(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is either
    not received by a party or is received so late as to impair the
    opportunity to file a timely notice of appeal. The amendment adds a
    new subdivision (6) allowing a district court to reopen for a brief
    period the time for appeal upon a finding that notice of entry of a
    judgment or order was not received from the clerk or a party within
    21 days of its entry and that no party would be prejudiced. By
    "prejudice" the Committee means some adverse consequence other than
    the cost of having to oppose the appeal and encounter the risk of
    reversal, consequences that are present in every appeal. Prejudice
    might arise, for example, if the appellee had taken some action in
    reliance on the expiration of the normal time period for filing a
    notice of appeal.
      Reopening may be ordered only upon a motion filed within 180 days
    of the entry of a judgment or order or within 7 days of receipt of
    notice of such entry, whichever is earlier. This provision
    establishes an outer time limit of 180 days for a party who fails
    to receive timely notice of entry of a judgment to seek additional
    time to appeal and enables any winning party to shorten the 180-day
    period by sending (and establishing proof of receipt of) its own
    notice of entry of a judgment, as authorized by Fed. R. Civ. P.
    77(d). Winning parties are encouraged to send their own notice in
    order to lessen the chance that a judge will accept a claim of non-
    receipt in the face of evidence that notices were sent by both the
    clerk and the winning party. Receipt of a winning party's notice
    will shorten only the time for reopening the time for appeal under
    this subdivision, leaving the normal time periods for appeal
    unaffected.
      If the motion is granted, the district court may reopen the time
    for filing a notice of appeal only for a period of 14 days from the
    date of entry of the order reopening the time for appeal.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Note to Paragraph (a)(1). The amendment is intended to alert
    readers to the fact that paragraph (a)(4) extends the time for
    filing an appeal when certain posttrial motions are filed. The
    Committee hopes that awareness of the provisions of paragraph
    (a)(4) will prevent the filing of a notice of appeal when a
    posttrial tolling motion is pending.
      Note to Paragraph (a)(2). The amendment treats a notice of appeal
    filed after the announcement of a decision or order, but before its
    formal entry, as if the notice had been filed after entry. The
    amendment deletes the language that made paragraph (a)(2)
    inapplicable to a notice of appeal filed after announcement of the
    disposition of a posttrial motion enumerated in paragraph (a)(4)
    but before the entry of the order, see Acosta v. Louisiana Dep't of
    Health & Human Resources, 478 U.S. 251 (1986) (per curiam); Alerte
    v. McGinnis, 898 F.2d 69 (7th Cir. 1990). Because the amendment of
    paragraph (a)(4) recognizes all notices of appeal filed after
    announcement or entry of judgment - even those that are filed while
    the posttrial motions enumerated in paragraph (a)(4) are pending -
    the amendment of this paragraph is consistent with the amendment of
    paragraph (a)(4).
      Note to Paragraph (a)(3). The amendment is technical in nature;
    no substantive change is intended.
      Note to Paragraph (a)(4). The 1979 amendment of this paragraph
    created a trap for an unsuspecting litigant who files a notice of
    appeal before a posttrial motion, or while a posttrial motion is
    pending. The 1979 amendment requires a party to file a new notice
    of appeal after the motion's disposition. Unless a new notice is
    filed, the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to hear the appeal.
    Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.S. 56 (1982). Many
    litigants, especially pro se litigants, fail to file the second
    notice of appeal, and several courts have expressed dissatisfaction
    with the rule. See, e.g., Averhart v. Arrendondo, 773 F.2d 919 (7th
    Cir. 1985); Harcon Barge Co. v. D & G Boat Rentals, Inc., 746 F.2d
    278 (5th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 930 (1986).
      The amendment provides that a notice of appeal filed before the
    disposition of a specified posttrial motion will become effective
    upon disposition of the motion. A notice filed before the filing of
    one of the specified motions or after the filing of a motion but
    before disposition of the motion is, in effect, suspended until the
    motion is disposed of, whereupon, the previously filed notice
    effectively places jurisdiction in the court of appeals.
      Because a notice of appeal will ripen into an effective appeal
    upon disposition of a posttrial motion, in some instances there
    will be an appeal from a judgment that has been altered
    substantially because the motion was granted in whole or in part.
    Many such appeals will be dismissed for want of prosecution when
    the appellant fails to meet the briefing schedule. But, the
    appellee may also move to strike the appeal. When responding to
    such a motion, the appellant would have an opportunity to state
    that, even though some relief sought in a posttrial motion was
    granted, the appellant still plans to pursue the appeal. Because
    the appellant's response would provide the appellee with sufficient
    notice of the appellant's intentions, the Committee does not
    believe that an additional notice of appeal is needed.
      The amendment provides that a notice of appeal filed before the
    disposition of a posttrial tolling motion is sufficient to bring
    the underlying case, as well as any orders specified in the
    original notice, to the court of appeals. If the judgment is
    altered upon disposition of a posttrial motion, however, and if a
    party wishes to appeal from the disposition of the motion, the
    party must amend the notice to so indicate. When a party files an
    amended notice, no additional fees are required because the notice
    is an amendment of the original and not a new notice of appeal.
      Paragraph (a)(4) is also amended to include, among motions that
    extend the time for filing a notice of appeal, a Rule 60 motion
    that is served within 10 days after entry of judgment. This
    eliminates the difficulty of determining whether a posttrial motion
    made within 10 days after entry of a judgment is a Rule 59(e)
    motion, which tolls the time for filing an appeal, or a Rule 60
    motion, which historically has not tolled the time. The amendment
    comports with the practice in several circuits of treating all
    motions to alter or amend judgments that are made within 10 days
    after entry of judgment as Rule 59(e) motions for purposes of Rule
    4(a)(4). See, e.g., Finch v. City of Vernon, 845 F.2d 256 (11th
    Cir. 1988); Rados v. Celotex Corp., 809 F.2d 170 (2d Cir. 1986);
    Skagerberg v. Oklahoma, 797 F.2d 881 (10th Cir. 1986). To conform
    to a recent Supreme Court decision, however - Budinich v. Becton
    Dickinson and Co., 486 U.S. 196 (1988) - the amendment excludes
    motions for attorney's fees from the class of motions that extend
    the filing time unless a district court, acting under Rule 58,
    enters an order extending the time for appeal. This amendment is to
    be read in conjunction with the amendment of Fed. R. Civ. P. 58.
      Note to subdivision (b). The amendment grammatically restructures
    the portion of this subdivision that lists the types of motions
    that toll the time for filing an appeal. This restructuring is
    intended to make the rule easier to read. No substantive change is
    intended other than to add a motion for judgment of acquittal under
    Criminal Rule 29 to the list of tolling motions. Such a motion is
    the equivalent of a Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) motion for judgment
    notwithstanding the verdict, which tolls the running of time for an
    appeal in a civil case.
      The proposed amendment also eliminates an ambiguity from the
    third sentence of this subdivision. Prior to this amendment, the
    third sentence provided that if one of the specified motions was
    filed, the time for filing an appeal would run from the entry of an
    order denying the motion. That sentence, like the parallel
    provision in Rule 4(a)(4), was intended to toll the running of time
    for appeal if one of the posttrial motions is timely filed. In a
    criminal case, however, the time for filing the motions runs not
    from entry of judgment (as it does in civil cases), but from the
    verdict or finding of guilt. Thus, in a criminal case, a posttrial
    motion may be disposed of more than 10 days before sentence is
    imposed, i.e. before the entry of judgment. United States v.
    Hashagen, 816 F.2d 899, 902 n.5 (3d Cir. 1987). To make it clear
    that a notice of appeal need not be filed before entry of judgment,
    the amendment states that an appeal may be taken within 10 days
    after the entry of an order disposing of the motion, or within 10
    days after the entry of judgment, whichever is later. The amendment
    also changes the language in the third sentence providing that an
    appeal may be taken within 10 days after the entry of an order
    denying the motion; the amendment says instead that an appeal may
    be taken within 10 days after the entry of an order disposing of
    the last such motion outstanding. (Emphasis added) The change
    recognizes that there may be multiple posttrial motions filed and
    that, although one or more motions may be granted in whole or in
    part, a defendant may still wish to pursue an appeal.
      The amendment also states that a notice of appeal filed before
    the disposition of any of the posttrial tolling motions becomes
    effective upon disposition of the motions. In most circuits this
    language simply restates the current practice. See United States v.
    Cortes, 895 F.2d 1245 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 939
    (1990). Two circuits, however, have questioned that practice in
    light of the language of the rule, see United States v. Gargano,
    826 F.2d 610 (7th Cir. 1987), and United States v. Jones, 669 F.2d
    559 (8th Cir. 1982), and the Committee wishes to clarify the rule.
    The amendment is consistent with the proposed amendment of Rule
    4(a)(4).
      Subdivision (b) is further amended in light of new Fed. R. Crim.
    P. 35(c), which authorizes a sentencing court to correct any
    arithmetical, technical, or other clear errors in sentencing within
    7 days after imposing the sentence. The Committee believes that a
    sentencing court should be able to act under Criminal Rule 35(c)
    even if a notice of appeal has already been filed; and that a
    notice of appeal should not be affected by the filing of a Rule
    35(c) motion or by correction of a sentence under Rule 35(c).
      Note to subdivision (c). In Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266 (1988),
    the Supreme Court held that a pro se prisoner's notice of appeal is
    "filed" at the moment of delivery to prison authorities for
    forwarding to the district court. The amendment reflects that
    decision. The language of the amendment is similar to that in
    Supreme Court Rule 29.2.
      Permitting an inmate to file a notice of appeal by depositing it
    in an institutional mail system requires adjustment of the rules
    governing the filing of cross-appeals. In a civil case, the time
    for filing a cross-appeal ordinarily runs from the date when the
    first notice of appeal is filed. If an inmate's notice of appeal is
    filed by depositing it in an institution's mail system, it is
    possible that the notice of appeal will not arrive in the district
    court until several days after the "filing" date and perhaps even
    after the time for filing a cross-appeal has expired. To avoid that
    problem, subdivision (c) provides that in a civil case when an
    institutionalized person files a notice of appeal by depositing it
    in the institution's mail system, the time for filing a cross-
    appeal runs from the district court's receipt of the notice. The
    amendment makes a parallel change regarding the time for the
    government to appeal in a criminal case.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1995 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). Fed. R. Civ. P. 50, 52, and 59 were previously
    inconsistent with respect to whether certain postjudgment motions
    had to be filed or merely served no later than 10 days after entry
    of judgment. As a consequence Rule 4(a)(4) spoke of making or
    serving such motions rather than filing them. Civil Rules 50, 52,
    and 59, are being revised to require filing before the end of the
    10-day period. As a consequence, this rule is being amended to
    provide that "filing" must occur within the 10 day period in order
    to affect the finality of the judgment and extend the period for
    filing a notice of appeal.
      The Civil Rules require the filing of postjudgment motions "no
    later than 10 days after entry of judgment" - rather than "within"
    10 days - to include postjudgment motions that are filed before
    actual entry of the judgment by the clerk. This rule is amended,
    therefore, to use the same terminology.
      The rule is further amended to clarify the fact that a party who
    wants to obtain review of an alteration or amendment of a judgment
    must file a notice of appeal or amend a previously filed notice to
    indicate intent to appeal from the altered judgment.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only; in this
    rule, however, substantive changes are made in paragraphs (a)(6)
    and (b)(4), and in subdivision (c).
      Subdivision (a), paragraph (1). Although the Advisory Committee
    does not intend to make any substantive changes in this paragraph,
    cross-references to Rules 4(a)(1)(B) and 4(c) have been added to
    subparagraph (a)(1)(A).
      Subdivision (a), paragraph (4). Item (vi) in subparagraph (A) of
    Rule 4(a)(4) provides that filing a motion for relief under Fed. R.
    Civ. P. 60 will extend the time for filing a notice of appeal if
    the Rule 60 motion is filed no later than 10 days after judgment is
    entered. Again, the Advisory Committee does not intend to make any
    substantive change in this paragraph. But because Fed. R. Civ. P.
    6(a) and Fed. R. App. P. 26(a) have different methods for computing
    time, one might be uncertain whether the 10-day period referred to
    in Rule 4(a)(4) is computed using Civil Rule 6(a) or Appellate Rule
    26(a). Because the Rule 60 motion is filed in the district court,
    and because Fed. R. App. P. 1(a)(2) says that when the appellate
    rules provide for filing a motion in the district court, "the
    procedure must comply with the practice of the district court," the
    rule provides that the 10-day period is computed using Fed. R. Civ.
    P. 6(a).
      Subdivision (a), paragraph (6). Paragraph (6) permits a district
    court to reopen the time for appeal if a party has not received
    notice of the entry of judgment and no party would be prejudiced by
    the reopening. Before reopening the time for appeal, the existing
    rule requires the district court to find that the moving party was
    entitled to notice of the entry of judgment and did not receive it
    "from the clerk or any party within 21 days of its entry." The
    Advisory Committee makes a substantive change. The finding must be
    that the movant did not receive notice "from the district court or
    any party within 21 days after entry." This change broadens the
    type of notice that can preclude reopening the time for appeal. The
    existing rule provides that only notice from a party or from the
    clerk bars reopening. The new language precludes reopening if the
    movant has received notice from "the court."
      Subdivision (b). Two substantive changes are made in what will be
    paragraph (b)(4). The current rule permits an extension of time to
    file a notice of appeal if there is a "showing of excusable
    neglect." First, the rule is amended to permit a court to extend
    the time for "good cause" as well as for excusable neglect. Rule
    4(a) permits extensions for both reasons in civil cases and the
    Advisory Committee believes that "good cause" should be sufficient
    in criminal cases as well. The amendment does not limit extensions
    for good cause to instances in which the motion for extension of
    time is filed before the original time has expired. The rule gives
    the district court discretion to grant extensions for good cause
    whenever the court believes it appropriate to do so provided that
    the extended period does not exceed 30 days after the expiration of
    the time otherwise prescribed by Rule 4(b). Second, paragraph
    (b)(4) is amended to require only a "finding" of excusable neglect
    or good cause and not a "showing" of them. Because the rule
    authorizes the court to provide an extension without a motion, a
    "showing" is obviously not required; a "finding" is sufficient.
      Subdivision (c). Substantive amendments are made in this
    subdivision. The current rule provides that if an inmate confined
    in an institution files a notice of appeal by depositing it in the
    institution's internal mail system, the notice is timely filed if
    deposited on or before the last day for filing. Some institutions
    have special internal mail systems for handling legal mail; such
    systems often record the date of deposit of mail by an inmate, the
    date of delivery of mail to an inmate, etc. The Advisory Committee
    amends the rule to require an inmate to use the system designed for
    legal mail, if there is one, in order to receive the benefit of
    this subdivision.
      When an inmate uses the filing method authorized by subdivision
    (c), the current rule provides that the time for other parties to
    appeal begins to run from the date the district court "receives"
    the inmate's notice of appeal. The rule is amended so that the time
    for other parties begins to run when the district court "dockets"
    the inmate's appeal. A court may "receive" a paper when its mail is
    delivered to it even if the mail is not processed for a day or two,
    making the date of receipt uncertain. "Docketing" is an easily
    identified event. The change eliminates uncertainty. Paragraph
    (c)(3) is further amended to make it clear that the time for the
    government to file its appeal runs from the later of the entry of
    the judgment or order appealed from or the district court's
    docketing of a defendant's notice filed under this paragraph (c).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a)(1)(C). The federal courts of appeals have reached
    conflicting conclusions about whether an appeal from an order
    granting or denying an application for a writ of error coram nobis
    is governed by the time limitations of Rule 4(a) (which apply in
    civil cases) or by the time limitations of Rule 4(b) (which apply
    in criminal cases). Compare United States v. Craig, 907 F.2d 653,
    655-57, amended 919 F.2d 57 (7th Cir. 1990); United States v.
    Cooper, 876 F.2d 1192, 1193-94 (5th Cir. 1989); and United States
    v. Keogh, 391 F.2d 138, 140 (2d Cir. 1968) (applying the time
    limitations of Rule 4(a)); with Yasui v. United States, 772 F.2d
    1496, 1498-99 (9th Cir. 1985); and United States v. Mills, 430 F.2d
    526, 527-28 (8th Cir. 1970) (applying the time limitations of Rule
    4(b)). A new part (C) has been added to Rule 4(a)(1) to resolve
    this conflict by providing that the time limitations of Rule 4(a)
    will apply.
      Subsequent to the enactment of Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) and 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 2255, the Supreme Court has recognized the continued
    availability of a writ of error coram nobis in at least one narrow
    circumstance. In 1954, the Court permitted a litigant who had been
    convicted of a crime, served his full sentence, and been released
    from prison, but who was continuing to suffer a legal disability on
    account of the conviction, to seek a writ of error coram nobis to
    set aside the conviction. United States v. Morgan, 346 U.S. 502
    (1954). As the Court recognized, in the Morgan situation an
    application for a writ of error coram nobis "is of the same general
    character as [a motion] under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255." Id. at 506 n.4.
    Thus, it seems appropriate that the time limitations of Rule 4(a),
    which apply when a district court grants or denies relief under 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 2255, should also apply when a district court grants or
    denies a writ of error coram nobis. In addition, the strong public
    interest in the speedy resolution of criminal appeals that is
    reflected in the shortened deadlines of Rule 4(b) is not present in
    the Morgan situation, as the party seeking the writ of error coram
    nobis has already served his or her full sentence.
      Notwithstanding Morgan, it is not clear whether the Supreme Court
    continues to believe that the writ of error coram nobis is
    available in federal court. In civil cases, the writ has been
    expressly abolished by Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). In criminal cases,
    the Supreme Court has recently stated that it has become "
    'difficult to conceive of a situation' " in which the writ " 'would
    be necessary or appropriate.' " Carlisle v. United States, 517 U.S.
    416, 429 (1996) (quoting United States v. Smith, 331 U.S. 469, 475
    n.4 (1947)). The amendment to Rule 4(a)(1) is not intended to
    express any view on this issue; rather, it is merely meant to
    specify time limitations for appeals.
      Rule 4(a)(1)(C) applies only to motions that are in substance,
    and not merely in form, applications for writs of error coram
    nobis. Litigants may bring and label as applications for a writ of
    error coram nobis what are in reality motions for a new trial under
    Fed. R. Crim. P. 33 or motions for correction or reduction of a
    sentence under Fed. R. Crim. P. 35. In such cases, the time
    limitations of Rule 4(b), and not those of Rule 4(a), should be
    enforced.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.
      Subdivision (a)(4)(A)(vi). Rule 4(a)(4)(A)(vi) has been amended
    to remove a parenthetical that directed that the 10-day deadline be
    "computed using Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(a)." That
    parenthetical has become superfluous because Rule 26(a)(2) has been
    amended to require that all deadlines under 11 days be calculated
    as they are under Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a).
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.
      Subdivision (a)(5)(A)(ii). Rule 4(a)(5)(A) permits the district
    court to extend the time to file a notice of appeal if two
    conditions are met. First, the party seeking the extension must
    file its motion no later than 30 days after the expiration of the
    time originally prescribed by Rule 4(a). Second, the party seeking
    the extension must show either excusable neglect or good cause. The
    text of Rule 4(a)(5)(A) does not distinguish between motions filed
    prior to the expiration of the original deadline and those filed
    after the expiration of the original deadline. Regardless of
    whether the motion is filed before or during the 30 days after the
    original deadline expires, the district court may grant an
    extension if a party shows either excusable neglect or good cause.
      Despite the text of Rule 4(a)(5)(A), most of the courts of
    appeals have held that the good cause standard applies only to
    motions brought prior to the expiration of the original deadline
    and that the excusable neglect standard applies only to motions
    brought during the 30 days following the expiration of the original
    deadline. See Pontarelli v. Stone, 930 F.2d 104, 109-10 (1st Cir.
    1991) (collecting cases from the Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh,
    Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits). These courts have relied
    heavily upon the Advisory Committee Note to the 1979 amendment to
    Rule 4(a)(5). But the Advisory Committee Note refers to a draft of
    the 1979 amendment that was ultimately rejected. The rejected draft
    directed that the good cause standard apply only to motions filed
    prior to the expiration of the original deadline. Rule 4(a)(5), as
    actually amended, did not. See 16A Charles Alan Wright, et al.,
    Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 3950.3, at 148-49 (2d ed.
    1996).
      The failure of the courts of appeals to apply Rule 4(a)(5)(A) as
    written has also created tension between that rule and Rule
    4(b)(4). As amended in 1998, Rule 4(b)(4) permits the district
    court to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal in a
    criminal case for an additional 30 days upon a finding of excusable
    neglect or good cause. Both Rule 4(b)(4) and the Advisory Committee
    Note to the 1998 amendment make it clear that an extension can be
    granted for either excusable neglect or good cause, regardless of
    whether a motion for an extension is filed before or during the 30
    days following the expiration of the original deadline.
      Rule 4(a)(5)(A)(ii) has been amended to correct this
    misunderstanding and to bring the rule in harmony in this respect
    with Rule 4(b)(4). A motion for an extension filed prior to the
    expiration of the original deadline may be granted if the movant
    shows either excusable neglect or good cause. Likewise, a motion
    for an extension filed during the 30 days following the expiration
    of the original deadline may be granted if the movant shows either
    excusable neglect or good cause.
      The good cause and excusable neglect standards have "different
    domains." Lorenzen v. Employees Retirement Plan, 896 F.2d 228, 232
    (7th Cir. 1990). They are not interchangeable, and one is not
    inclusive of the other. The excusable neglect standard applies in
    situations in which there is fault; in such situations, the need
    for an extension is usually occasioned by something within the
    control of the movant. The good cause standard applies in
    situations in which there is no fault - excusable or otherwise. In
    such situations, the need for an extension is usually occasioned by
    something that is not within the control of the movant.
      Thus, the good cause standard can apply to motions brought during
    the 30 days following the expiration of the original deadline. If,
    for example, the Postal Service fails to deliver a notice of
    appeal, a movant might have good cause to seek a post-expiration
    extension. It may be unfair to make such a movant prove that its
    "neglect" was excusable, given that the movant may not have been
    neglectful at all. Similarly, the excusable neglect standard can
    apply to motions brought prior to the expiration of the original
    deadline. For example, a movant may bring a pre-expiration motion
    for an extension of time when an error committed by the movant
    makes it unlikely that the movant will be able to meet the original
    deadline.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment. The stylistic changes to the
    Committee Note suggested by Judge Newman were adopted. In addition,
    two paragraphs were added at the end of the Committee Note to
    clarify the difference between the good cause and excusable neglect
    standards.
      Subdivision (a)(7). Several circuit splits have arisen out of
    uncertainties about how Rule 4(a)(7)'s definition of when a
    judgment or order is "entered" interacts with the requirement in
    Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 that, to be "effective," a judgment must be set
    forth on a separate document. Rule 4(a)(7) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 58
    have been amended to resolve those splits.
       1. The first circuit split addressed by the amendments to Rule
    4(a)(7) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 concerns the extent to which orders
    that dispose of post-judgment motions must be set forth on separate
    documents. Under Rule 4(a)(4)(A), the filing of certain post-
    judgment motions tolls the time to appeal the underlying judgment
    until the "entry" of the order disposing of the last such remaining
    motion. Courts have disagreed about whether such an order must be
    set forth on a separate document before it is treated as "entered."
    This disagreement reflects a broader dispute among courts about
    whether Rule 4(a)(7) independently imposes a separate document
    requirement (a requirement that is distinct from the separate
    document requirement that is imposed by the Federal Rules of Civil
    Procedure ("FRCP")) or whether Rule 4(a)(7) instead incorporates
    the separate document requirement as it exists in the FRCP. Further
    complicating the matter, courts in the former "camp" disagree among
    themselves about the scope of the separate document requirement
    that they interpret Rule 4(a)(7) as imposing, and courts in the
    latter "camp" disagree among themselves about the scope of the
    separate document requirement imposed by the FRCP.
      Rule 4(a)(7) has been amended to make clear that it simply
    incorporates the separate document requirement as it exists in Fed.
    R. Civ. P. 58. If Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 does not require that a
    judgment or order be set forth on a separate document, then neither
    does Rule 4(a)(7); the judgment or order will be deemed entered for
    purposes of Rule 4(a) when it is entered in the civil docket. If
    Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 requires that a judgment or order be set forth
    on a separate document, then so does Rule 4(a)(7); the judgment or
    order will not be deemed entered for purposes of Rule 4(a) until it
    is so set forth and entered in the civil docket (with one important
    exception, described below).
      In conjunction with the amendment to Rule 4(a)(7), Fed. R. Civ.
    P. 58 has been amended to provide that orders disposing of the post-
    judgment motions listed in new Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(a)(1) (which
    post-judgment motions include, but are not limited to, the post-
    judgment motions that can toll the time to appeal under Rule
    4(a)(4)(A)) do not have to be set forth on separate documents. See
    Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(a)(1). Thus, such orders are entered for
    purposes of Rule 4(a) when they are entered in the civil docket
    pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 79(a). See Rule 4(a)(7)(A)(1).
       2. The second circuit split addressed by the amendments to Rule
    4(a)(7) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 concerns the following question:
    When a judgment or order is required to be set forth on a separate
    document under Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 but is not, does the time to
    appeal the judgment or order - or the time to bring post-judgment
    motions, such as a motion for a new trial under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 -
     ever begin to run? According to every circuit except the First
    Circuit, the answer is "no." The First Circuit alone holds that
    parties will be deemed to have waived their right to have a
    judgment or order entered on a separate document three months after
    the judgment or order is entered in the civil docket. See Fiore v.
    Washington County Community Mental Health Ctr., 960 F.2d 229, 236
    (1st Cir. 1992) (en banc). Other circuits have rejected this cap as
    contrary to the relevant rules. See, e.g., United States v. Haynes,
    158 F.3d 1327, 1331 (D.C. Cir. 1998); Hammack v. Baroid Corp., 142
    F.3d 266, 269-70 (5th Cir. 1998); Rubin v. Schottenstein, Zox &
    Dunn, 110 F.3d 1247, 1253 n.4 (6th Cir. 1997), vacated on other
    grounds, 143 F.3d 263 (6th Cir. 1998) (en banc). However, no court
    has questioned the wisdom of imposing such a cap as a matter of
    policy.
      Both Rule 4(a)(7)(A) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 have been amended to
    impose such a cap. Under the amendments, a judgment or order is
    generally treated as entered when it is entered in the civil docket
    pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 79(a). There is one exception: When
    Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(a)(1) requires the judgment or order to be set
    forth on a separate document, that judgment or order is not treated
    as entered until it is set forth on a separate document (in
    addition to being entered in the civil docket) or until the
    expiration of 150 days after its entry in the civil docket,
    whichever occurs first. This cap will ensure that parties will not
    be given forever to appeal (or to bring a post-judgment motion)
    when a court fails to set forth a judgment or order on a separate
    document in violation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(a)(1).
       3. The third circuit split - this split addressed only by the
    amendment to Rule 4(a)(7) - concerns whether the appellant may
    waive the separate document requirement over the objection of the
    appellee. In Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis, 435 U.S. 381, 387 (1978)
    (per curiam), the Supreme Court held that the "parties to an appeal
    may waive the separate-judgment requirement of Rule 58."
    Specifically, the Supreme Court held that when a district court
    enters an order and "clearly evidence[s] its intent that the . . .
    order . . . represent[s] the final decision in the case," the order
    is a "final decision" for purposes of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291, even if
    the order has not been set forth on a separate document for
    purposes of Fed. R. Civ. P. 58. Id. Thus, the parties can choose to
    appeal without waiting for the order to be set forth on a separate
    document.
      Courts have disagreed about whether the consent of all parties is
    necessary to waive the separate document requirement. Some circuits
    permit appellees to object to attempted Mallis waivers and to force
    appellants to return to the trial court, request that judgment be
    set forth on a separate document, and appeal a second time. See,
    e.g., Selletti v. Carey, 173 F.3d 104, 109-10 (2d Cir. 1999);
    Williams v. Borg, 139 F.3d 737, 739-40 (9th Cir. 1998); Silver Star
    Enters., Inc. v. M/V Saramacca, 19 F.3d 1008, 1013 (5th Cir. 1994).
    Other courts disagree and permit Mallis waivers even if the
    appellee objects. See, e.g., Haynes, 158 F.3d at 1331; Miller v.
    Artistic Cleaners, 153 F.3d 781, 783-84 (7th Cir. 1998); Alvord-
    Polk, Inc. v. F. Schumacher & Co., 37 F.3d 996, 1006 n.8 (3d Cir.
    1994).
      New Rule 4(a)(7)(B) is intended both to codify the Supreme
    Court's holding in Mallis and to make clear that the decision
    whether to waive the requirement that the judgment or order be set
    forth on a separate document is the appellant's alone. It is, after
    all, the appellant who needs a clear signal as to when the time to
    file a notice of appeal has begun to run. If the appellant chooses
    to bring an appeal without waiting for the judgment or order to be
    set forth on a separate document, then there is no reason why the
    appellee should be able to object. All that would result from
    honoring the appellee's objection would be delay.
       4. The final circuit split addressed by the amendment to Rule
    4(a)(7) concerns the question whether an appellant who chooses to
    waive the separate document requirement must appeal within 30 days
    (60 days if the government is a party) from the entry in the civil
    docket of the judgment or order that should have been set forth on
    a separate document but was not. In Townsend v. Lucas, 745 F.2d 933
    (5th Cir. 1984), the district court dismissed a 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2254
    action on May 6, 1983, but failed to set forth the judgment on a
    separate document. The plaintiff appealed on January 10, 1984. The
    Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal, reasoning that, if the
    plaintiff waived the separate document requirement, then his appeal
    would be from the May 6 order, and if his appeal was from the May 6
    order, then it was untimely under Rule 4(a)(1). The Fifth Circuit
    stressed that the plaintiff could return to the district court,
    move that the judgment be set forth on a separate document, and
    appeal from that judgment within 30 days. Id. at 934. Several other
    cases have embraced the Townsend approach. See, e.g., Armstrong v.
    Ahitow, 36 F.3d 574, 575 (7th Cir. 1994) (per curiam); Hughes v.
    Halifax County Sch. Bd., 823 F.2d 832, 835-36 (4th Cir. 1987);
    Harris v. McCarthy, 790 F.2d 753, 756 n.1 (9th Cir. 1986).
      Those cases are in the distinct minority. There are numerous
    cases in which courts have heard appeals that were not filed within
    30 days (60 days if the government was a party) from the judgment
    or order that should have been set forth on a separate document but
    was not. See, e.g., Haynes, 158 F.3d at 1330-31; Clough v. Rush,
    959 F.2d 182, 186 (10th Cir. 1992); McCalden v. California Library
    Ass'n, 955 F.2d 1214, 1218-19 (9th Cir. 1990). In the view of these
    courts, the remand in Townsend was "precisely the purposeless
    spinning of wheels abjured by the Court in the [Mallis] case." 15B
    Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure Sec.
    3915, at 259 n.8 (3d ed. 1992).
      The Committee agrees with the majority of courts that have
    rejected the Townsend approach. In drafting new Rule 4(a)(7)(B),
    the Committee has been careful to avoid phrases such as "otherwise
    timely appeal" that might imply an endorsement of Townsend.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of proposed Rule 4(a)(7)(B) or to the third or fourth
    numbered sections of the Committee Note, except that, in several
    places, references to a judgment being "entered" on a separate
    document were changed to references to a judgment being "set forth"
    on a separate document. This was to maintain stylistic consistency.
    The appellate rules and the civil rules consistently refer to
    "entering" judgments on the civil docket and to "setting forth"
    judgments on separate documents.
      Two major changes were made to the text of proposed Rule
    4(a)(7)(A) - one substantive and one stylistic. The substantive
    change was to increase the "cap" from 60 days to 150 days. The
    Appellate Rules Committee and the Civil Rules Committee had to
    balance two concerns that are implicated whenever a court fails to
    enter its final decision on a separate document. On the one hand,
    potential appellants need a clear signal that the time to appeal
    has begun to run, so that they do not unknowingly forfeit their
    rights. On the other hand, the time to appeal cannot be allowed to
    run forever. A party who receives no notice whatsoever of a
    judgment has only 180 days to move to reopen the time to appeal
    from that judgment. See Rule 4(a)(6)(A). It hardly seems fair to
    give a party who does receive notice of a judgment an unlimited
    amount of time to appeal, merely because that judgment was not set
    forth on a separate piece of paper. Potential appellees and the
    judicial system need some limit on the time within which appeals
    can be brought.
      The 150-day cap properly balances these two concerns. When an
    order is not set forth on a separate document, what signals
    litigants that the order is final and appealable is a lack of
    further activity from the court. A 60-day period of inactivity is
    not sufficiently rare to signal to litigants that the court has
    entered its last order. By contrast, 150 days of inactivity is much
    less common and thus more clearly signals to litigants that the
    court is done with their case.
      The major stylistic change to Rule 4(a)(7) requires some
    explanation. In the published draft, proposed Rule 4(a)(7)(A)
    provided that "[a] judgment or order is entered for purposes of
    this Rule 4(a) when it is entered for purposes of Rule 58(b) of the
    Federal Rules of Civil Procedure." In other words, Rule 4(a)(7)(A)
    told readers to look to FRCP 58(b) to ascertain when a judgment is
    entered for purposes of starting the running of time to appeal.
    Sending appellate lawyers to the civil rules to discover when time
    began to run for purposes of the appellate rules was itself
    somewhat awkward, but it was made more confusing by the fact that,
    when readers went to proposed FRCP 58(b), they found this
    introductory clause: "Judgment is entered for purposes of Rules 50,
    52, 54(d)(2)(B), 59, 60, and 62 when . . ."
      This introductory clause was confusing for both appellate lawyers
    and trial lawyers. It was confusing for appellate lawyers because
    Rule 4(a)(7) informed them that FRCP 58(b) would tell them when the
    time begins to run for purposes of the appellate rules, but when
    they got to FRCP 58(b) they found a rule that, by its terms,
    dictated only when the time begins to run for purposes of certain
    civil rules. The introductory clause was confusing for trial
    lawyers because FRCP 58(b) described when judgment is entered for
    some purposes under the civil rules, but then was completely silent
    about when judgment is entered for other purposes.
      To avoid this confusion, the Civil Rules Committee, on the
    recommendation of the Appellate Rules Committee, changed the
    introductory clause in FRCP 58(b) to read simply: "Judgment is
    entered for purposes of these Rules when . . . ." In addition, Rule
    4(a)(7)(A) was redrafted [A redraft of Rule 4(a)(7) was faxed to
    members of the Appellate Rules Committee two weeks after our
    meeting in New Orleans. The Committee consented to the redraft
    without objection.] so that the triggering events for the running
    of the time to appeal (entry in the civil docket, and being set
    forth on a separate document or passage of 150 days) were
    incorporated directly into Rule 4(a)(7), rather than indirectly
    through a reference to FRCP 58(b). This eliminates the need for
    appellate lawyers to examine Rule 58(b) and any chance that Rule
    58(b)'s introductory clause (even as modified) might confuse them.
      We do not believe that republication of Rule 4(a)(7) or FRCP 58
    is necessary. In substance, rewritten Rule 4(a)(7)(A) and FRCP
    58(b) operate identically to the published versions, except that
    the 60-day cap has been replaced with a 150-day cap - a change that
    was suggested by some of the commentators and that makes the cap
    more forgiving.
      Subdivision (b)(5). Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a)
    permits a district court, acting within 7 days after the imposition
    of sentence, to correct an erroneous sentence in a criminal case.
    Some courts have held that the filing of a motion for correction of
    a sentence suspends the time for filing a notice of appeal from the
    judgment of conviction. See, e.g., United States v. Carmouche, 138
    F.3d 1014, 1016 (5th Cir. 1998) (per curiam); United States v.
    Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 869 (1st Cir. 1993). Those courts establish
    conflicting timetables for appealing a judgment of conviction after
    the filing of a motion to correct a sentence. In the First Circuit,
    the time to appeal is suspended only for the period provided by
    Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a) for the district court to correct a
    sentence; the time to appeal begins to run again once 7 days have
    passed after sentencing, even if the motion is still pending. By
    contrast, in the Fifth Circuit, the time to appeal does not begin
    to run again until the district court actually issues an order
    disposing of the motion.
      Rule 4(b)(5) has been amended to eliminate the inconsistency
    concerning the effect of a motion to correct a sentence on the time
    for filing a notice of appeal. The amended rule makes clear that
    the time to appeal continues to run, even if a motion to correct a
    sentence is filed. The amendment is consistent with Rule
    4(b)(3)(A), which lists the motions that toll the time to appeal,
    and notably omits any mention of a Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a) motion.
    The amendment also should promote certainty and minimize the
    likelihood of confusion concerning the time to appeal a judgment of
    conviction.
      If a district court corrects a sentence pursuant to Fed. R. Crim.
    P. 35(a), the time for filing a notice of appeal of the corrected
    sentence under Rule 4(b)(1) would begin to run when the court
    enters a new judgment reflecting the corrected sentence.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The reference to
    Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(c) was changed to Rule 35(a)
    to reflect the pending amendment of Rule 35. The proposed amendment
    to Criminal Rule 35, if approved, will take effect at the same time
    that the proposed amendment to Appellate Rule 4 will take effect,
    if approved.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 4(a)(6) has permitted a district court to reopen the time to
    appeal a judgment or order upon finding that four conditions were
    satisfied. First, the district court had to find that the appellant
    did not receive notice of the entry of the judgment or order from
    the district court or any party within 21 days after the judgment
    or order was entered. Second, the district court had to find that
    the appellant moved to reopen the time to appeal within 7 days
    after the appellant received notice of the entry of the judgment or
    order. Third, the district court had to find that the appellant
    moved to reopen the time to appeal within 180 days after the
    judgment or order was entered. Finally, the district court had to
    find that no party would be prejudiced by the reopening of the time
    to appeal.
      Rule 4(a)(6) has been amended to specify more clearly what type
    of "notice" of the entry of a judgment or order precludes a party
    from later moving to reopen the time to appeal. In addition, Rule
    4(a)(6) has been amended to address confusion about what type of
    "notice" triggers the 7-day period to bring a motion to reopen.
    Finally, Rule 4(a)(6) has been reorganized to set forth more
    logically the conditions that must be met before a district court
    may reopen the time to appeal.
      Subdivision (a)(6)(A). Former subdivision (a)(6)(B) has been
    redesignated as subdivision (a)(6)(A), and one substantive change
    has been made. As amended, the subdivision will preclude a party
    from moving to reopen the time to appeal a judgment or order only
    if the party receives (within 21 days) formal notice of the entry
    of that judgment or order under Civil Rule 77(d). No other type of
    notice will preclude a party.
      The reasons for this change take some explanation. Prior to 1998,
    former subdivision (a)(6)(B) permitted a district court to reopen
    the time to appeal if it found "that a party entitled to notice of
    the entry of a judgment or order did not receive such notice from
    the clerk or any party within 21 days of its entry." The rule was
    clear that the "notice" to which it referred was the notice
    required under Civil Rule 77(d), which must be served by the clerk
    pursuant to Civil Rule 5(b) and may also be served by a party
    pursuant to that same rule. In other words, prior to 1998, former
    subdivision (a)(6)(B) was clear that, if a party did not receive
    formal notice of the entry of a judgment or order under Civil Rule
    77(d), that party could later move to reopen the time to appeal
    (assuming that the other requirements of subdivision (a)(6) were
    met).
      In 1998, former subdivision (a)(6)(B) was amended to change the
    description of the type of notice that would preclude a party from
    moving to reopen. As a result of the amendment, former subdivision
    (a)(6)(B) no longer referred to the failure of the moving party to
    receive "such notice" - that is, the notice required by Civil Rule
    77(d) - but instead referred to the failure of the moving party to
    receive "the notice." And former subdivision (a)(6)(B) no longer
    referred to the failure of the moving party to receive notice from
    "the clerk or any party," both of whom are explicitly mentioned in
    Civil Rule 77(d). Rather, former subdivision (a)(6)(B) referred to
    the failure of the moving party to receive notice from "the
    district court or any party."
      The 1998 amendment meant, then, that the type of notice that
    precluded a party from moving to reopen the time to appeal was no
    longer limited to Civil Rule 77(d) notice. Under the 1998
    amendment, some type of notice, in addition to Civil Rule 77(d)
    notice, precluded a party. But the text of the amended rule did not
    make clear what type of notice qualified. This was an invitation
    for litigation, confusion, and possible circuit splits.
      To avoid such problems, former subdivision (a)(6)(B) - new
    subdivision (a)(6)(A) - has been amended to restore its pre-1998
    simplicity. Under new subdivision (a)(6)(A), if the court finds
    that the moving party was not notified under Civil Rule 77(d) of
    the entry of the judgment or order that the party seeks to appeal
    within 21 days after that judgment or order was entered, then the
    court is authorized to reopen the time to appeal (if all of the
    other requirements of subdivision (a)(6) are met). Because Civil
    Rule 77(d) requires that notice of the entry of a Judgment or order
    be formally served under Civil Rule 5(b), any notice that is not so
    served will not operate to preclude the reopening of the time to
    appeal under new subdivision (a)(6)(A).
      Subdivision (a)(6)(B). Former subdivision (a)(6)(A) required a
    party to move to reopen the time to appeal "within 7 days after the
    moving party receives notice of the entry [of the judgment or order
    sought to be appealed]." Former subdivision (a)(6)(A) has been
    redesignated as subdivision (a)(6)(B), and one important
    substantive change has been made: The subdivision now makes clear
    that only formal notice of the entry of a judgment or order under
    Civil Rule 77(d) will trigger the 7-day period to move to reopen
    the time to appeal.
      The circuits have been split over what type of "notice" is
    sufficient to trigger the 7-day period. The majority of circuits
    that addressed the question held that only written notice was
    sufficient, although nothing in the text of the rule suggested such
    a limitation. See, e.g., Bass v. United States Dep't of Agric., 211
    F.3d 959, 963 (5th Cir. 2000). By contrast, the Ninth Circuit held
    that while former subdivision (a)(6)(A) did not require written
    notice, "the quality of the communication [had to] rise to the
    functional equivalent of written notice." Nguyen v. Southwest
    Leasing & Rental, Inc., 282 F.3d 1061, 1066 (9th Cir. 2002). Other
    circuits suggested in dicta that former subdivision (a)(6)(A)
    required only "actual notice," which, presumably, could have
    included oral notice that was not "the functional equivalent of
    written notice." See, e.g., Lowry v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 211
    F.3d 457, 464 (8th Cir. 2000). And still other circuits read into
    former subdivision (a)(6)(A) restrictions that appeared only in
    former subdivision (a)(6)(B) (such as the requirement that notice
    be received "from the district court or any party," see Benavides
    v. Bureau of Prisons, 79 F.3d 1211, 1214 (D.C. Cir. 1996)) or that
    appeared in neither former subdivision (a)(6)(A) nor former
    subdivision (a)(6)(B) (such as the requirement that notice be
    served in the manner prescribed by Civil Rule 5, see Ryan v. First
    Unum Life Ins. Co., 174 F.3d 302, 304-05 (2d Cir. 1999)).
      Former subdivision (a)(6)(A) - new subdivision (a)(6)(B) - has
    been amended to resolve this circuit split by providing that only
    formal notice of the entry of a judgment or order under Civil Rule
    77(d) will trigger the 7-day period. Using Civil Rule 77(d) notice
    as the trigger has two advantages: First, because Civil Rule 77(d)
    is clear and familiar, circuit splits are unlikely to develop over
    its meaning. Second, because Civil Rule 77(d) notice must be served
    under Civil Rule 5(b), establishing whether and when such notice
    was provided should generally not be difficult.
      Using Civil Rule 77(d) notice to trigger the 7-day period will
    not unduly delay appellate proceedings. Rule 4(a)(6) applies to
    only a small number of cases - cases in which a party was not
    notified of a judgment or order by either the clerk or another
    party within 21 days after entry. Even with respect to those cases,
    an appeal cannot be brought more than 180 days after entry, no
    matter what the circumstances. In addition, Civil Rule 77(d)
    permits parties to serve notice of the entry of a judgment or
    order. The winning party can prevent Rule 4(a)(6) from even coming
    into play simply by serving notice of entry within 21 days. Failing
    that, the winning party can always trigger the 7-day deadline to
    move to reopen by serving belated notice.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No change was made
    to the text of subdivision (A) - regarding the type of notice that
    precludes a party from later moving to reopen the time to appeal -
    and only minor stylistic changes were made to the Committee Note to
    subdivision (A).
      A substantial change was made to subdivision (B) - regarding the
    type of notice that triggers the 7-day deadline for moving to
    reopen the time to appeal. Under the published version of
    subdivision (B), the 7-day deadline would have been triggered when
    "the moving party receives or observes written notice of the entry
    from any source." The Committee was attempting to implement an
    "eyes/ears" distinction: The 7-day period was triggered when a
    party learned of the entry of a judgment or order by reading about
    it (whether on a piece of paper or a computer screen), but was not
    triggered when a party merely heard about it.
      Above all else, subdivision (B) should be clear and easy to
    apply; it should neither risk opening another circuit split over
    its meaning nor create the need for a lot of factfinding by
    district courts. After considering the public comments - and, in
    particular, the comments of two committees of the California bar -
    the Committee decided that subdivision (B) could do better on both
    counts. The published standard - "receives or observes written
    notice of the entry from any source" - was awkward and, despite the
    guidance of the Committee Note, was likely to give courts problems.
    Even if the standard had proved to be sufficiently clear, district
    courts would still have been left to make factual findings about
    whether a particular attorney or party "received" or "observed"
    notice that was written or electronic.
      The Committee concluded that the solution suggested by the
    California bar - using Civil Rule 77(d) notice to trigger the 7-day
    period - made a lot of sense. The standard is clear; no one doubts
    what it means to be served with notice of the entry of judgment
    under Civil Rule 77(d). The standard is also unlikely to give rise
    to many factual disputes. Civil Rule 77(d) notice must be formally
    served under Civil Rule 5(b), so establishing the presence or
    absence of such notice should be relatively easy. And, for the
    reasons described in the Committee Note, using Civil Rule 77(d) as
    the trigger will not unduly delay appellate proceedings.
      For these reasons, the Committee amended subdivision (B) so that
    the 7-day deadline will be triggered only by notice of the entry of
    a judgment or order that is served under Civil Rule 77(d).
    (Corresponding changes were made to the Committee Note.) The
    Committee does not believe that the amendment needs to be published
    again for comment, as the issue of what type of notice should
    trigger the 7-day deadline has already been addressed by
    commentators, the revised version of subdivision (B) is far more
    forgiving than the published version, and it is highly unlikely
    that the revised version will be found ambiguous in any respect.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a)(4)(B)(ii). Subdivision (a)(4)(B)(ii) is amended
    to address problems that stemmed from the adoption - during the
    1998 restyling project - of language referring to "a judgment
    altered or amended upon" a post-trial motion.
      Prior to the restyling, subdivision (a)(4) instructed that
    "[a]ppellate review of an order disposing of any of [the post-trial
    motions listed in subdivision (a)(4)] requires the party, in
    compliance with Appellate Rule 3(c), to amend a previously filed
    notice of appeal. A party intending to challenge an alteration or
    amendment of the judgment shall file a notice, or amended notice,
    of appeal within the time prescribed by this Rule 4 measured from
    the entry of the order disposing of the last such motion
    outstanding." After the restyling, subdivision (a)(4)(B)(ii)
    provided: "A party intending to challenge an order disposing of any
    motion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A), or a judgment altered or amended
    upon such a motion, must file a notice of appeal, or an amended
    notice of appeal - in compliance with Rule 3(c) - within the time
    prescribed by this Rule measured from the entry of the order
    disposing of the last such remaining motion."
      One court has explained that the 1998 amendment introduced
    ambiguity into the Rule: "The new formulation could be read to
    expand the obligation to file an amended notice to circumstances
    where the ruling on the post-trial motion alters the prior judgment
    in an insignificant manner or in a manner favorable to the
    appellant, even though the appeal is not directed against the
    alteration of the judgment." Sorensen v. City of New York, 413 F.3d
    292, 296 n.2 (2d Cir. 2005). The current amendment removes that
    ambiguous reference to "a judgment altered or amended upon" a post-
    trial motion, and refers instead to "a judgment's alteration or
    amendment" upon such a motion. Thus, subdivision (a)(4)(B)(ii)
    requires a new or amended notice of appeal when an appellant wishes
    to challenge an order disposing of a motion listed in Rule
    4(a)(4)(A) or a judgment's alteration or amendment upon such a
    motion.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made
    to the proposal as published. Instead, the Committee has added the
    commentators' suggestions to its study agenda.
      Subdivision (a)(4)(A)(vi). Subdivision (a)(4) provides that
    certain timely post-trial motions extend the time for filing an
    appeal. Lawyers sometimes move under Civil Rule 60 for relief that
    is still available under another rule such as Civil Rule 59.
    Subdivision (a)(4)(A)(vi) provides for such eventualities by
    extending the time for filing an appeal so long as the Rule 60
    motion is filed within a limited time. Formerly, the time limit
    under subdivision (a)(4)(A)(vi) was 10 days, reflecting the 10-day
    limits for making motions under Civil Rules 50(b), 52(b), and 59.
    Subdivision (a)(4)(A)(vi) now contains a 28-day limit to match the
    revisions to the time limits in the Civil Rules.
      Subdivision (a)(5)(C). The time set in the former rule at 10 days
    has been revised to 14 days. See the Note to Rule 26.
      Subdivision (a)(6)(B). The time set in the former rule at 7 days
    has been revised to 14 days. Under the time-computation approach
    set by former Rule 26(a), "7 days" always meant at least 9 days and
    could mean as many as 11 or even 13 days. Under current Rule 26(a),
    intermediate weekends and holidays are counted. Changing the period
    from 7 to 14 days offsets the change in computation approach. See
    the Note to Rule 26.
      Subdivisions (b)(1)(A) and (b)(3)(A). The times set in the former
    rule at 10 days have been revised to 14 days. See the Note to Rule
    26.

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
    TITLE II. APPEAL FROM A JUDGMENT OR ORDER OF A DISTRICT COURT

-HEAD-
    Rule 5. Appeal by Permission

-STATUTE-
      (a) Petition for Permission to Appeal.
        (1) To request permission to appeal when an appeal is within
      the court of appeals' discretion, a party must file a petition
      for permission to appeal. The petition must be filed with the
      circuit clerk with proof of service on all other parties to the
      district-court action.
        (2) The petition must be filed within the time specified by the
      statute or rule authorizing the appeal or, if no such time is
      specified, within the time provided by Rule 4(a) for filing a
      notice of appeal.
        (3) If a party cannot petition for appeal unless the district
      court first enters an order granting permission to do so or
      stating that the necessary conditions are met, the district court
      may amend its order, either on its own or in response to a
      party's motion, to include the required permission or statement.
      In that event, the time to petition runs from entry of the
      amended order.

      (b) Contents of the Petition; Answer or Cross-Petition; Oral
    Argument.
        (1) The petition must include the following:
          (A) the facts necessary to understand the question presented;
          (B) the question itself;
          (C) the relief sought;
          (D) the reasons why the appeal should be allowed and is
        authorized by a statute or rule; and
          (E) an attached copy of:
            (i) the order, decree, or judgment complained of and any
          related opinion or memorandum, and
            (ii) any order stating the district court's permission to
          appeal or finding that the necessary conditions are met.

        (2) A party may file an answer in opposition or a cross-
      petition within 10 days after the petition is served.
        (3) The petition and answer will be submitted without oral
      argument unless the court of appeals orders otherwise.

      (c) Form of Papers; Number of Copies. All papers must conform to
    Rule 32(c)(2). Except by the court's permission, a paper must not
    exceed 20 pages, exclusive of the disclosure statement, the proof
    of service, and the accompanying documents required by Rule
    5(b)(1)(E). An original and 3 copies must be filed unless the court
    requires a different number by local rule or by order in a
    particular case.
      (d) Grant of Permission; Fees; Cost Bond; Filing the Record.
        (1) Within 14 days after the entry of the order granting
      permission to appeal, the appellant must:
          (A) pay the district clerk all required fees; and
          (B) file a cost bond if required under Rule 7.

        (2) A notice of appeal need not be filed. The date when the
      order granting permission to appeal is entered serves as the date
      of the notice of appeal for calculating time under these rules.
        (3) The district clerk must notify the circuit clerk once the
      petitioner has paid the fees. Upon receiving this notice, the
      circuit clerk must enter the appeal on the docket. The record
      must be forwarded and filed in accordance with Rules 11 and
      12(c).

      This rule is derived in the main from Third Circuit Rule 11(2),
    which is similar to the rule governing appeals under 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    1292(b) in a majority of the circuits. The second sentence of
    subdivision (a) resolves a conflict over the question of whether
    the district court can amend an order by supplying the statement
    required by Sec. 1292(b) at any time after entry of the order, with
    the result that the time fixed by the statute commences to run on
    the date of entry of the order as amended. Compare Milbert v. Bison
    Laboratories, 260 F.2d 431 (3d Cir., 1958) with Sperry Rand
    Corporation v. Bell Telephone Laboratories, 272 F.2d (2d Cir.,
    1959), Hadjipateras v. Pacifica, S.A., 290 F.2d 697 (5th Cir.,
    1961), and Houston Fearless Corporation v. Teter, 313 F.2d 91 (10th
    Cir., 1962). The view taken by the Second, Fifth and Tenth Circuits
    seems theoretically and practically sound, and the rule adopts it.
    Although a majority of the circuits now require the filing of a
    notice of appeal following the grant of permission to appeal,
    filing of the notice serves no function other than to provide a
    time from which the time for transmitting the record and docketing
    the appeal begins to run.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1979 AMENDMENT       
      The proposed amendment adapts to the practice in appeals from
    interlocutory orders under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(b) the provisions of
    proposed Rule 3(e) above, requiring payment of all fees in the
    district court upon the filing of the notice of appeal. See Note to
    proposed amended Rule 3(e), supra.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (c). The amendment makes it clear that a court may
    require a different number of copies either by rule or by order in
    an individual case. The number of copies of any document that a
    court of appeals needs varies depending upon the way in which the
    court conducts business. The internal operation of the courts of
    appeals necessarily varies from circuit to circuit because of
    differences in the number of judges, the geographic area included
    within the circuit, and other such factors. Uniformity could be
    achieved only by setting the number of copies artificially high so
    that parties in all circuits file enough copies to satisfy the
    needs of the court requiring the greatest number. Rather than do
    that, the Committee decided to make it clear that local rules may
    require a greater or lesser number of copies and that, if the
    circumstances of a particular case indicate the need for a
    different number of copies in that case, the court may so order.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      In 1992 Congress added subsection (e) to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292.
    Subsection (e) says that the Supreme Court has power to prescribe
    rules that "provide for an appeal of an interlocutory decision to
    the courts of appeals that is not otherwise provided for" in
    section 1292. The amendment of Rule 5 was prompted by the
    possibility of new rules authorizing additional interlocutory
    appeals. Rather than add a separate rule governing each such
    appeal, the Committee believes it is preferable to amend Rule 5 so
    that is will govern all such appeals.
      In addition the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L.
    104-317, abolished appeals by permission under 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    636(c)(5), making Rule 5.1 obsolete.
      This new Rule 5 is intended to govern all discretionary appeals
    from district-court orders, judgments, or decrees. At this time
    that includes interlocutory appeals under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(b),
    (c)(1), and (d)(1) & (2). If additional interlocutory appeals are
    authorized under Sec. 1292(e), the new Rule is intended to govern
    them if the appeals are discretionary.
      Subdivision (a). Paragraph (a)(1) says that when granting an
    appeal is within a court of appeals' discretion, a party may file a
    petition for permission to appeal. The time for filing provision
    states only that the petition must be filed within the time
    provided in the statute or rule authorizing the appeal or, if no
    such time is specified, within the time provided by Rule 4(a) for
    filing a notice of appeal.
      Section 1292(b), (c), and (d) provide that the petition must be
    filed within 10 days after entry of the order containing the
    statement prescribed in the statute. Existing Rule 5(a) provides
    that if a district court amends an order to contain the prescribed
    statement, the petition must be filed within 10 days after entry of
    the amended order. The new rule similarly says that if a party
    cannot petition without the district court's permission or
    statement that necessary circumstances are present, the district
    court may amend its order to include such a statement and the time
    to petition runs from the entry of the amended order.
      The provision that the Rule 4(a) time for filing a notice of
    appeal should apply if the statute or rule is silent about the
    filing time was drawn from existing Rule 5.1.
      Subdivision (b). The changes made in the provisions in paragraph
    (b)(1) are intended only to broaden them sufficiently to make them
    appropriate for all discretionary appeals.
      In paragraph (b)(2) a uniform time - 7 days - is established for
    filing an answer in opposition or cross-petition. Seven days is the
    time for responding under existing Rule 5 and is an appropriate
    length of time when dealing with an interlocutory appeal. Although
    existing Rule 5.1 provides 14 days for responding, the Committee
    does not believe that the longer response time is necessary.
      Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) is substantively unchanged.
      Subdivision (d). Paragraph (d)(2) is amended to state that "the
    date when the order granting permission to appeal is entered serves
    as the date of the notice of appeal" for purposes of calculating
    time under the rules. That language simply clarifies existing
    practice.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (c). A petition for permission to appeal, a cross-
    petition for permission to appeal, and an answer to a petition or
    cross-petition for permission to appeal are all "other papers" for
    purposes of Rule 32(c)(2), and all of the requirements of Rule
    32(a) apply to those papers, except as provided in Rule 32(c)(2).
    During the 1998 restyling of the Federal Rules of Appellate
    Procedure, Rule 5(c) was inadvertently changed to suggest that only
    the requirements of Rule 32(a)(1) apply to such papers. Rule 5(c)
    has been amended to correct that error.
      Rule 5(c) has been further amended to limit the length of papers
    filed under Rule 5.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (b)(2). Subdivision (b)(2) is amended in the light of
    the change in Rule 26(a)'s time computation rules. Subdivision
    (b)(2) formerly required that an answer in opposition to a petition
    for permission to appeal, or a cross-petition for permission to
    appeal, be filed "within 7 days after the petition is served."
    Under former Rule 26(a), "7 days" always meant at least 9 days and
    could mean as many as 11 or even 13 days. Under current Rule 26(a),
    intermediate weekends and holidays are counted. Changing the period
    from 7 to 10 days offsets the change in computation approach. See
    the Note to Rule 26.
      Subdivision (d)(1). The time set in the former rule at 10 days
    has been revised to 14 days. See the Note to Rule 26.

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
    TITLE II. APPEAL FROM A JUDGMENT OR ORDER OF A DISTRICT COURT

-HEAD-
    Rule 6. Appeal in a Bankruptcy Case from a Final Judgment, Order,
      or Decree of a District Court or Bankruptcy Appellate Panel

-STATUTE-
      (a) Appeal From a Judgment, Order, or Decree of a District Court
    Exercising Original Jurisdiction in a Bankruptcy Case. An appeal to
    a court of appeals from a final judgment, order, or decree of a
    district court exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1334 is
    taken as any other civil appeal under these rules.
      (b) Appeal From a Judgment, Order, or Decree of a District Court
    or Bankruptcy Appellate Panel Exercising Appellate Jurisdiction in
    a Bankruptcy Case.
        (1) Applicability of Other Rules. These rules apply to an
      appeal to a court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(d) from a
      final judgment, order, or decree of a district court or
      bankruptcy appellate panel exercising appellate jurisdiction
      under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(a) or (b). But there are 3 exceptions:
          (A) Rules 4(a)(4), 4(b), 9, 10, 11, 12(b), 13-20, 22-23, and
        24(b) do not apply;
          (B) the reference in Rule 3(c) to "Form 1 in the Appendix of
        Forms" must be read as a reference to Form 5; and
          (C) when the appeal is from a bankruptcy appellate panel, the
        term "district court," as used in any applicable rule, means
        "appellate panel."

        (2) Additional Rules. In addition to the rules made applicable
      by Rule 6(b)(1), the following rules apply:
          (A) Motion for Rehearing.
            (i) If a timely motion for rehearing under Bankruptcy Rule
          8015 is filed, the time to appeal for all parties runs from
          the entry of the order disposing of the motion. A notice of
          appeal filed after the district court or bankruptcy appellate
          panel announces or enters a judgment, order, or decree - but
          before disposition of the motion for rehearing - becomes
          effective when the order disposing of the motion for
          rehearing is entered.
            (ii) Appellate review of the order disposing of the motion
          requires the party, in compliance with Rules 3(c) and
          6(b)(1)(B), to amend a previously filed notice of appeal. A
          party intending to challenge an altered or amended judgment,
          order, or decree must file a notice of appeal or amended
          notice of appeal within the time prescribed by Rule 4 -
          excluding Rules 4(a)(4) and 4(b) - measured from the entry of
          the order disposing of the motion.
            (iii) No additional fee is required to file an amended
          notice.

          (B) The record on appeal.
            (i) Within 14 days after filing the notice of appeal, the
          appellant must file with the clerk possessing the record
          assembled in accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 8006 - and serve
          on the appellee - a statement of the issues to be presented
          on appeal and a designation of the record to be certified and
          sent to the circuit clerk.
            (ii) An appellee who believes that other parts of the
          record are necessary must, within 14 days after being served
          with the appellant's designation, file with the clerk and
          serve on the appellant a designation of additional parts to
          be included.
            (iii) The record on appeal consists of:
              -- the redesignated record as provided above;
              -- the proceedings in the district court or bankruptcy
            appellate panel; and
              -- a certified copy of the docket entries prepared by the
            clerk under Rule 3(d).

          (C) Forwarding the Record.
            (i) When the record is complete, the district clerk or
          bankruptcy appellate panel clerk must number the documents
          constituting the record and send them promptly to the circuit
          clerk together with a list of the documents correspondingly
          numbered and reasonably identified. Unless directed to do so
          by a party or the circuit clerk, the clerk will not send to
          the court of appeals documents of unusual bulk or weight,
          physical exhibits other than documents, or other parts of the
          record designated for omission by local rule of the court of
          appeals. If the exhibits are unusually bulky or heavy, a
          party must arrange with the clerks in advance for their
          transportation and receipt.
            (ii) All parties must do whatever else is necessary to
          enable the clerk to assemble and forward the record. The
          court of appeals may provide by rule or order that a
          certified copy of the docket entries be sent in place of the
          redesignated record, but any party may request at any time
          during the pendency of the appeal that the redesignated
          record be sent.

          (D) Filing the Record. Upon receiving the record - or a
        certified copy of the docket entries sent in place of the
        redesignated record - the circuit clerk must file it and
        immediately notify all parties of the filing date.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      This rule is substantially a restatement of present procedure.
    See D.C. Cir. Rule 34; 6th Cir. Rule 11; 7th Cir. Rule 10(d); 10th
    Cir. Rule 13.
      Present circuit rules commonly provide that the petition for
    allowance of an appeal shall be filed within the time allowed by
    Section 25 of the Bankruptcy Act for taking appeals of right. For
    the reasons explained in the Note accompanying Rule 4, that rule
    makes the time for appeal in bankruptcy cases the same as that
    which obtains in other civil cases and thus supersedes Section 25.
    Thus the present rule simply continues the former practice of
    making the time for filing the petition in appeals by allowance the
    same as that provided for filing the notice of appeal in appeals of
    right.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1979 AMENDMENT       
      The proposed amendment adapts to the practice in appeals by
    allowance in bankruptcy proceedings the provisions of proposed Rule
    3(e) above, requiring payment of all fees in the district court at
    the time of the filing of the notice of appeal. See Note to Rule
    3(e), supra.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1989 AMENDMENT       
      A new Rule 6 is proposed. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, Pub.
    L. No. 95-598, 92 Stat. 2549, the Supreme Court decision in
    Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458
    U.S. 50 (1982), and the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship
    Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-353, 98 Stat. 333, have made the
    existing Rule 6 obsolete.
      Subdivision (a). Subdivision (a) provides that when a district
    court exercises original jurisdiction in a bankruptcy matter,
    rather than referring it to a bankruptcy judge for a final
    determination, the appeal should be taken in identical fashion as
    appeals from district court decisions in other civil actions. A
    district court exercises original jurisdiction and this subdivision
    applies when the district court enters a final order or judgment
    upon consideration of a bankruptcy judge's proposed findings of
    fact and conclusions of law in a non-core proceeding pursuant to 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 157(c)(1) or when a district court withdraws a
    proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 157(d). This subdivision is
    included to avoid uncertainty arising from the question of whether
    a bankruptcy case is a civil case. The rules refer at various
    points to the procedure "in a civil case", see, e.g. Rule 4(a)(1).
    Subdivision (a) makes it clear that such rules apply to an appeal
    from a district court bankruptcy decision.
      Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b) governs appeals that follow
    intermediate review of a bankruptcy judge's decision by a district
    court or a bankruptcy appellate panel.
      Subdivision (b)(1). Subdivision (b)(1) provides for the general
    applicability of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, with
    specified exceptions, to appeals covered by subdivision (b) and
    makes necessary word adjustments.
      Subdivision (b)(2). Paragraph (i) provides that the time for
    filing a notice of appeal shall begin to run anew from the entry of
    an order denying a rehearing or from the entry of a subsequent
    judgment. The Committee deliberately omitted from the rule any
    provision governing the validity of a notice of appeal filed prior
    to the entry of an order denying a rehearing; the Committee
    intended to leave undisturbed the current state of the law on that
    issue. Paragraph (ii) calls for a redesignation of the appellate
    record assembled in the bankruptcy court pursuant to Rule 8006 of
    the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. After an intermediate appeal, a
    party may well narrow the focus of its efforts on the second appeal
    and a redesignation of the record may eliminate unnecessary
    material. The proceedings during the first appeal are included to
    cover the possibility that independent error in the intermediate
    appeal, for example failure to follow appropriate procedures, may
    be assigned in the court of appeals. Paragraph (iii) provides for
    the transmission of the record and tracks the appropriate
    subsections of Rule 11. Paragraph (iv) provides for the filing of
    the record and notices to the parties. Paragraph (ii) and Paragraph
    (iv) both refer to "a certified copy of the docket entries". The
    "docket entries" referred to are the docket entries in the district
    court or the bankruptcy appellate panel, not the entire docket in
    the bankruptcy court.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Note to Subparagraph (b)(2)(i). The amendment accompanies
    concurrent changes to Rule 4(a)(4). Although Rule 6 never included
    language such as that being changed in Rule 4(a)(4), language that
    made a notice of appeal void if it was filed before, or during the
    pendency of, certain posttrial motions, courts have found that a
    notice of appeal is premature if it is filed before the court
    disposes of a motion for rehearing. See, e.g., In re X-Cel, Inc.,
    823 F.2d 192 (7th Cir. 1987); In re Shah, 859 F.2d 1463 (10th Cir.
    1988). The Committee wants to achieve the same result here as in
    Rule 4, the elimination of a procedural trap.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Subdivision (b). Language is added to Rule 6(b)(2)(A)(ii) to
    conform with the corresponding provision in Rule 4(a)(4). The new
    language is clarifying rather than substantive. The existing rule
    states that a party intending to challenge an alteration or
    amendment of a judgment must file an amended notice of appeal. Of
    course if a party has not previously filed a notice of appeal, the
    party would simply file a notice of appeal not an amended one. The
    new language states that the party must file "a notice of appeal or
    amended notice of appeal."

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (b)(2)(B). The times set in the former rule at 10
    days have been revised to 14 days. See the Note to Rule 26.

      In a civil case, the district court may require an appellant to

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1979 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment would eliminate the provision of the present rule
    that requires the appellant to file a $250 bond for costs on appeal
    at the time of filing his notice of appeal. The $250 provision was
    carried forward in the F.R.App.P. from former Rule 73(c) of the
    F.R.Civ.P., and the $250 figure has remained unchanged since the
    adoption of that rule in 1937. Today it bears no relationship to
    actual costs. The amended rule would leave the question of the need
    for a bond for costs and its amount in the discretion of the court.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily

    Rule 8. Stay or Injunction Pending Appeal

-STATUTE-
      (a) Motion for Stay.
        (1) Initial Motion in the District Court. A party must
      ordinarily move first in the district court for the following
      relief:
          (A) a stay of the judgment or order of a district court
        pending appeal;
          (B) approval of a supersedeas bond; or
          (C) an order suspending, modifying, restoring, or granting an
        injunction while an appeal is pending.

        (2) Motion in the Court of Appeals; Conditions on Relief. A
      motion for the relief mentioned in Rule 8(a)(1) may be made to
      the court of appeals or to one of its judges.
          (A) The motion must:
            (i) show that moving first in the district court would be
          impracticable; or
            (ii) state that, a motion having been made, the district
          court denied the motion or failed to afford the relief
          requested and state any reasons given by the district court
          for its action.

          (B) The motion must also include:
            (i) the reasons for granting the relief requested and the
          facts relied on;
            (ii) originals or copies of affidavits or other sworn
          statements supporting facts subject to dispute; and
            (iii) relevant parts of the record.

          (C) The moving party must give reasonable notice of the
        motion to all parties.
          (D) A motion under this Rule 8(a)(2) must be filed with the
        circuit clerk and normally will be considered by a panel of the
        court. But in an exceptional case in which time requirements
        make that procedure impracticable, the motion may be made to
        and considered by a single judge.
          (E) The court may condition relief on a party's filing a bond
        or other appropriate security in the district court.

      (b) Proceeding Against a Surety. If a party gives security in the
    form of a bond or stipulation or other undertaking with one or more
    sureties, each surety submits to the jurisdiction of the district
    court and irrevocably appoints the district clerk as the surety's
    agent on whom any papers affecting the surety's liability on the
    bond or undertaking may be served. On motion, a surety's liability
    may be enforced in the district court without the necessity of an
    independent action. The motion and any notice that the district
    court prescribes may be served on the district clerk, who must
    promptly mail a copy to each surety whose address is known.
      (c) Stay in a Criminal Case. Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of
    Criminal Procedure governs a stay in a criminal case.

      Subdivision (a). While the power of a court of appeals to stay
    proceedings in the district court during the pendency of an appeal
    is not explicitly conferred by statute, it exists by virtue of the
    all writs statute, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1651. Eastern Greyhound Lines v.
    Fusco, 310 F.2d 632 (6th Cir., 1962); United States v. Lynd, 301
    F.2d 818 (5th Cir., 1962); Public Utilities Commission of Dist. of
    Col. v. Capital Transit Co., 94 U.S.App.D.C. 140, 214 F.2d 242
    (1954). And the Supreme Court has termed the power "inherent" (In
    re McKenzie, 180 U.S. 536, 551, 21 S.Ct. 468, 45 L.Ed. 657 (1901))
    and "part of its (the court of appeals) traditional equipment for
    the administration of justice." (Scripps-Howard Radio v. F.C.C.,
    316 U.S. 4, 9-10, 62 S.Ct. 875, 86 L.Ed. 1229 (1942)). The power of
    a single judge of the court of appeals to grant a stay pending
    appeal was recognized in In re McKenzie, supra. Alexander v. United
    States, 173 F.2d 865 (9th Cir., 1949) held that a single judge
    could not stay the judgment of a district court, but it noted the
    absence of a rule of court authorizing the practice. FRCP 62(g)
    adverts to the grant of a stay by a single judge of the appellate
    court. The requirement that application be first made to the
    district court is the case law rule. Cumberland Tel. & Tel. Co. v.
    Louisiana Public Service Commission, 260 U.S. 212, 219, 43 S.Ct.
    75, 67 L.Ed. 217 (1922); United States v. El-O-Pathic Pharmacy, 192
    F.2d 62 (9th Cir., 1951); United States v. Hansell, 109 F.2d 613
    (2d Cir., 1940). The requirement is explicitly stated in FRCrP
    38(c) and in the rules of the First, Third, Fourth and Tenth
    Circuits. See also Supreme Court Rules 18 and 27.
      The statement of the requirement in the proposed rule would work
    a minor change in present practice. FRCP 73(e) requires that if a
    bond for costs on appeal or a supersedeas bond is offered after the
    appeal is docketed, leave to file the bond must be obtained from
    the court of appeals. There appears to be no reason why matters
    relating to supersedeas and cost bonds should not be initially
    presented to the district court whenever they arise prior to the
    disposition of the appeal. The requirement of FRCP 73(e) appears to
    be a concession to the view that once an appeal is perfected, the
    district court loses all power over its judgment. See In re Federal
    Facilities Trust, 227 F.2d 651 (7th Cir., 1955) and cases - cited
    at 654-655. No reason appears why all questions related to
    supersedeas or the bond for costs on appeal should not be presented
    in the first instance to the district court in the ordinary case.
      Subdivision (b). The provisions respecting a surety upon a bond
    or other undertaking are based upon FRCP 65.1.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1986 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments to Rule 8(b) are technical. No substantive change
    is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1995 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (c). The amendment conforms subdivision (c) to
    previous amendments to Fed. R. Crim. P. 38. This amendment strikes
    the reference to subdivision (a) of Fed. R. Crim. P. 38 so that
    Fed. R. App. P. 8(c) refers instead to all of Criminal Rule 38.
    When Rule 8(c) was adopted Fed. R. Crim. P. 38(a) included the
    procedures for obtaining a stay of execution when the sentence in
    question was death, imprisonment, a fine, or probation. Criminal
    Rule 38 was later amended and now addresses those topics in
    separate subdivisions. Subdivision 38(a) now addresses only stays
    of death sentences. The proper cross reference is to all of
    Criminal Rule 38.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
    TITLE II. APPEAL FROM A JUDGMENT OR ORDER OF A DISTRICT COURT

-HEAD-
    Rule 9. Release in a Criminal Case

-STATUTE-
      (a) Release Before Judgment of Conviction.
        (1) The district court must state in writing, or orally on the
      record, the reasons for an order regarding the release or
      detention of a defendant in a criminal case. A party appealing
      from the order must file with the court of appeals a copy of the
      district court's order and the court's statement of reasons as
      soon as practicable after filing the notice of appeal. An
      appellant who questions the factual basis for the district
      court's order must file a transcript of the release proceedings
      or an explanation of why a transcript was not obtained.
        (2) After reasonable notice to the appellee, the court of
      appeals must promptly determine the appeal on the basis of the
      papers, affidavits, and parts of the record that the parties
      present or the court requires. Unless the court so orders, briefs
      need not be filed.
        (3) The court of appeals or one of its judges may order the
      defendant's release pending the disposition of the appeal.

      (b) Release After Judgment of Conviction. A party entitled to do
    so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release
    after a judgment of conviction by filing a notice of appeal from
    that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in the
    court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal
    from the judgment of conviction. Both the order and the review are
    subject to Rule 9(a). The papers filed by the party seeking review
    must include a copy of the judgment of conviction.
      (c) Criteria for Release. The court must make its decision
    regarding release in accordance with the applicable provisions of
    18 U.S.C. Secs. 3142, 3143, and 3145(c).

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      Subdivision (a). The appealability of release orders entered
    prior to a judgment of conviction is determined by the provisions
    of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3147, as qualified by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3148, and by
    the rule announced in Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 72 S.Ct. 1, 96
    L.Ed. 3 (1951), holding certain orders respecting release
    appealable as final orders under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291. The language
    of the rule, "(an)n appeal authorized by law from an order refusing
    or imposing conditions of release," is intentionally broader than
    that used in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3147 in describing orders made
    appealable by that section. The summary procedure ordained by the
    rule is intended to apply to all appeals from orders respecting
    release, and it would appear that at least some orders not made
    appealable by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3147 are nevertheless appealable under
    the Stack v. Boyle rationale. See, for example, United States v.
    Foster, 278 F.2d 567 (2d Cir., 1960), holding appealable an order
    refusing to extend bail limits. Note also the provisions of 18
    U.S.C. Sec. 3148, which after withdrawing from persons charged with
    an offense punishable by death and from those who have been
    convicted of an offense the right of appeal granted by 18 U.S.C.
    Sec. 3147, expressly preserves "other rights to judicial review of
    conditions of release or orders of detention."
      The purpose of the subdivision is to insure the expeditious
    determination of appeals respecting release orders, an expedition
    commanded by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3147 and by the Court in Stack v.
    Boyle, supra. It permits such appeals to be heard on an informal
    record without the necessity of briefs and on reasonable notice.
    Equally important to the just and speedy disposition of these
    appeals is the requirement that the district court state the
    reasons for its decision. See Jones v. United States, 358 F.2d 543
    (D.C. Cir., 1966); Rhodes v. United States, 275 F.2d 78 (4th Cir.,
    1960); United States v. Williams, 253 F.2d 144 (7th Cir., 1958).
      Subdivision (b). This subdivision regulates procedure for review
    of an order respecting release at a time when the jurisdiction of
    the court of appeals has already attached by virtue of an appeal
    from the judgment of conviction. Notwithstanding the fact that
    jurisdiction has passed to the court of appeals, both 18 U.S.C.
    Sec. 3148 and FRCrP 38(c) contemplate that the initial
    determination of whether a convicted defendant is to be released
    pending the appeal is to be made by the district court. But at this
    point there is obviously no need for a separate appeal from the
    order of the district court respecting release. The court of
    appeals or a judge thereof has power to effect release on motion as
    an incident to the pending appeal. See FRCrP 38(c) and 46(a)(2).
    But the motion is functionally identical with the appeal regulated
    by subdivision (a) and requires the same speedy determination if
    relief is to be effective. Hence the similarity of the procedure
    outlined in the two subdivisions.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1972 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (c) is intended to bring the rule into conformity
    with 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3148 and to allocate to the defendant the
    burden of establishing that he will not flee and that he poses no
    danger to any other person or to the community. The burden is
    placed upon the defendant in the view that the fact of his
    conviction justifies retention in custody in situations where doubt
    exists as to whether he can be safely released pending disposition
    of his appeal. Release pending appeal may also be denied if "it
    appears that an appeal is frivolous or taken for delay." 18 U.S.C.
    Sec. 3148. The burden of establishing the existence of these
    criteria remains with the government.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 9 has been entirely rewritten. The basic structure of the
    rule has been retained. Subdivision (a) governs appeals from bail
    decisions made before the judgment of conviction is entered at the
    time of sentencing. Subdivision (b) governs review of bail
    decisions made after sentencing and pending appeal.
      Subdivision (a). The subdivision applies to appeals from "an
    order regarding release or detention" of a criminal defendant
    before judgment of conviction, i.e., before sentencing. See
    Fed.R.Crim.P. 32. The old rule applied only to a defendant's appeal
    from an order "refusing or imposing conditions of release." The new
    broader language is needed because the government is now permitted
    to appeal bail decisions in certain circumstances. 18 U.S.C. Secs.
    3145 and 3731. For the same reason, the rule now requires a
    district court to state reasons for its decision in all instances,
    not only when it refuses release or imposes conditions on release.
      The rule requires a party appealing from a district court's
    decision to supply the court of appeals with a copy of the district
    court's order and its statement of reasons. In addition, an
    appellant who questions the factual basis for the district court's
    decision must file a transcript of the release proceedings, if
    possible. The rule also permits a court to require additional
    papers. A court must act promptly to decide these appeals; lack of
    pertinent information can cause delays. The old rule left the
    determination of what should be filed entirely within the party's
    discretion; it stated that the court of appeals would hear the
    appeal "upon such papers, affidavits, and portions of the record as
    the parties shall present."
      Subdivision (b). This subdivision applies to review of a district
    court's decision regarding release made after judgment of
    conviction. As in subdivision (a), the language has been changed to
    accommodate the government's ability to seek review.
      The word "review" is used in this subdivision, rather than
    "appeal" because review may be obtained, in some instances, upon
    motion. Review may be obtained by motion if the party has already
    filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of conviction. If the
    party desiring review of the release decision has not filed such a
    notice of appeal, review may be obtained only by filing a notice of
    appeal from the order regarding release.
      The requirements of subdivision (a) apply to both the order and
    the review. That is, the district court must state its reasons for
    the order. The party seeking review must supply the court of
    appeals with the same information required by subdivision (a). In
    addition, the party seeking review must also supply the court with
    information about the conviction and the sentence.
      Subdivision (c). This subdivision has been amended to include
    references to the correct statutory provisions.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

                          AMENDMENT BY PUBLIC LAW                      
      1984 - Subd. (c). Pub. L. 98-473 substituted "3143" for "3148"
    and inserted "and that the appeal is not for purpose of delay and
    raises a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in
    reversal or in an order for a new trial" after "community".

    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
    TITLE II. APPEAL FROM A JUDGMENT OR ORDER OF A DISTRICT COURT

-HEAD-
    Rule 10. The Record on Appeal

-STATUTE-
      (a) Composition of the Record on Appeal. The following items
    constitute the record on appeal:
        (1) the original papers and exhibits filed in the district
      court;
        (2) the transcript of proceedings, if any; and
        (3) a certified copy of the docket entries prepared by the
      district clerk.

      (b) The Transcript of Proceedings.
        (1) Appellant's Duty to Order. Within 14 days after filing the
      notice of appeal or entry of an order disposing of the last
      timely remaining motion of a type specified in Rule 4(a)(4)(A),
      whichever is later, the appellant must do either of the
      following:
          (A) order from the reporter a transcript of such parts of the
        proceedings not already on file as the appellant considers
        necessary, subject to a local rule of the court of appeals and
        with the following qualifications:
            (i) the order must be in writing;
            (ii) if the cost of the transcript is to be paid by the
          United States under the Criminal Justice Act, the order must
          so state; and
            (iii) the appellant must, within the same period, file a
          copy of the order with the district clerk; or

          (B) file a certificate stating that no transcript will be
        ordered.

        (2) Unsupported Finding or Conclusion. If the appellant intends
      to urge on appeal that a finding or conclusion is unsupported by
      the evidence or is contrary to the evidence, the appellant must
      include in the record a transcript of all evidence relevant to
      that finding or conclusion.
        (3) Partial Transcript. Unless the entire transcript is
      ordered:
          (A) the appellant must - within the 14 days provided in Rule
        10(b)(1) - file a statement of the issues that the appellant
        intends to present on the appeal and must serve on the appellee
        a copy of both the order or certificate and the statement;
          (B) if the appellee considers it necessary to have a
        transcript of other parts of the proceedings, the appellee
        must, within 14 days after the service of the order or
        certificate and the statement of the issues, file and serve on
        the appellant a designation of additional parts to be ordered;
        and
          (C) unless within 14 days after service of that designation
        the appellant has ordered all such parts, and has so notified
        the appellee, the appellee may within the following 14 days
        either order the parts or move in the district court for an
        order requiring the appellant to do so.

        (4) Payment. At the time of ordering, a party must make
      satisfactory arrangements with the reporter for paying the cost
      of the transcript.

      (c) Statement of the Evidence When the Proceedings Were Not
    Recorded or When a Transcript Is Unavailable. If the transcript of
    a hearing or trial is unavailable, the appellant may prepare a
    statement of the evidence or proceedings from the best available
    means, including the appellant's recollection. The statement must
    be served on the appellee, who may serve objections or proposed
    amendments within 14 days after being served. The statement and any
    objections or proposed amendments must then be submitted to the
    district court for settlement and approval. As settled and
    approved, the statement must be included by the district clerk in
    the record on appeal.
      (d) Agreed Statement as the Record on Appeal. In place of the
    record on appeal as defined in Rule 10(a), the parties may prepare,
    sign, and submit to the district court a statement of the case
    showing how the issues presented by the appeal arose and were
    decided in the district court. The statement must set forth only
    those facts averred and proved or sought to be proved that are
    essential to the courts resolution of the issues. If the statement
    is truthful, it - together with any additions that the district
    court may consider necessary to a full presentation of the issues
    on appeal - must be approved by the district court and must then be
    certified to the court of appeals as the record on appeal. The
    district clerk must then send it to the circuit clerk within the
    time provided by Rule 11. A copy of the agreed statement may be
    filed in place of the appendix required by Rule 30.
      (e) Correction or Modification of the Record.
        (1) If any difference arises about whether the record truly
      discloses what occurred in the district court, the difference
      must be submitted to and settled by that court and the record
      conformed accordingly.
        (2) If anything material to either party is omitted from or
      misstated in the record by error or accident, the omission or
      misstatement may be corrected and a supplemental record may be
      certified and forwarded:
          (A) on stipulation of the parties;
          (B) by the district court before or after the record has been
        forwarded; or
          (C) by the court of appeals.

        (3) All other questions as to the form and content of the
      record must be presented to the court of appeals.

      The proposed amendments to Rule 10(b) would require the appellant
    to place with the reporter a written order for the transcript of
    proceedings and file a copy with the clerk, and to indicate on the
    order if the transcript is to be provided under the Criminal
    Justice Act. If the appellant does not plan to order a transcript
    of any of the proceedings, he must file a certificate to that
    effect. These requirements make the appellant's steps in readying
    the appeal a matter of record and give the district court notice of
    requests for transcripts at the expense of the United States under
    the Criminal Justice Act. They are also the third step in giving
    the court of appeals some control over the production and
    transmission of the record. See Note to Rules 3(d)(e) above and
    Rule 11 below.
      In the event the appellant orders no transcript, or orders a
    transcript of less than all the proceedings, the procedure under
    the proposed amended rule remains substantially as before. The
    appellant must serve on the appellee a copy of his order or in the
    event no order is placed, of the certificate to that effect, and a
    statement of the issues he intends to present on appeal, and the
    appellee may thereupon designate additional parts of the transcript
    to be included, and upon appellant's refusal to order the
    additional parts, may either order them himself or seek an order
    requiring the appellant to order them. The only change proposed in
    this procedure is to place a 10 day time limit on motions to
    require the appellant to order the additional portions.
      Rule 10(b) is made subject to local rules of the courts of
    appeals in recognition of the practice in some circuits in some
    classes of cases, e. g., appeals by indigents in criminal cases
    after a short trial, of ordering immediate preparation of a
    complete transcript, thus making compliance with the rule
    unnecessary.

      Subdivision (b)(1). The amendment conforms this rule to
    amendments made in Rule 4(a)(4) in 1993. The amendments to Rule
    4(a)(4) provide that certain postjudgment motions have the effect
    of suspending a filed notice of appeal until the disposition of the
    last of such motions. The purpose of this amendment is to suspend
    the 10-day period for ordering a transcript if a timely
    postjudgment motion is made and a notice of appeal is suspended
    under Rule 4(a)(4). The 10-day period set forth in the first
    sentence of this rule begins to run when the order disposing of the
    last of such postjudgment motions outstanding is entered.

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
    TITLE II. APPEAL FROM A JUDGMENT OR ORDER OF A DISTRICT COURT

-HEAD-
    Rule 11. Forwarding the Record

-STATUTE-
      (a) Appellant's Duty. An appellant filing a notice of appeal must
    comply with Rule 10(b) and must do whatever else is necessary to
    enable the clerk to assemble and forward the record. If there are
    multiple appeals from a judgment or order, the clerk must forward a
    single record.
      (b) Duties of Reporter and District Clerk.
        (1) Reporter's Duty to Prepare and File a Transcript. The
      reporter must prepare and file a transcript as follows:
          (A) Upon receiving an order for a transcript, the reporter
        must enter at the foot of the order the date of its receipt and
        the expected completion date and send a copy, so endorsed, to
        the circuit clerk.
          (B) If the transcript cannot be completed within 30 days of
        the reporters receipt of the order, the reporter may request
        the circuit clerk to grant additional time to complete it. The
        clerk must note on the docket the action taken and notify the
        parties.
          (C) When a transcript is complete, the reporter must file it
        with the district clerk and notify the circuit clerk of the
        filing.
          (D) If the reporter fails to file the transcript on time, the
        circuit clerk must notify the district judge and do whatever
        else the court of appeals directs.

        (2) District Clerk's Duty to Forward. When the record is
      complete, the district clerk must number the documents
      constituting the record and send them promptly to the circuit
      clerk together with a list of the documents correspondingly
      numbered and reasonably identified. Unless directed to do so by a
      party or the circuit clerk, the district clerk will not send to
      the court of appeals documents of unusual bulk or weight,
      physical exhibits other than documents, or other parts of the
      record designated for omission by local rule of the court of
      appeals. If the exhibits are unusually bulky or heavy, a party
      must arrange with the clerks in advance for their transportation
      and receipt.

      (c) Retaining the Record Temporarily in the District Court for
    Use in Preparing the Appeal. The parties may stipulate, or the
    district court on motion may order, that the district clerk retain
    the record temporarily for the parties to use in preparing the
    papers on appeal. In that event the district clerk must certify to
    the circuit clerk that the record on appeal is complete. Upon
    receipt of the appellee's brief, or earlier if the court orders or
    the parties agree, the appellant must request the district clerk to
    forward the record.
      (d) [Abrogated.]
      (e) Retaining the Record by Court Order.
        (1) The court of appeals may, by order or local rule, provide
      that a certified copy of the docket entries be forwarded instead
      of the entire record. But a party may at any time during the
      appeal request that designated parts of the record be forwarded.
        (2) The district court may order the record or some part of it
      retained if the court needs it while the appeal is pending,
      subject, however, to call by the court of appeals.
        (3) If part or all of the record is ordered retained, the
      district clerk must send to the court of appeals a copy of the
      order and the docket entries together with the parts of the
      original record allowed by the district court and copies of any
      parts of the record designated by the parties.

      (f) Retaining Parts of the Record in the District Court by
    Stipulation of the Parties. The parties may agree by written
    stipulation filed in the district court that designated parts of
    the record be retained in the district court subject to call by the
    court of appeals or request by a party. The parts of the record so
    designated remain a part of the record on appeal.
      (g) Record for a Preliminary Motion in the Court of Appeals. If,
    before the record is forwarded, a party makes any of the following
    motions in the court of appeals:
        -- for dismissal;
        -- for release;
        -- for a stay pending appeal;
        -- for additional security on the bond on appeal or on a
      supersedeas bond; or
        -- for any other intermediate order - 

    the district clerk must send the court of appeals any parts of the
    record designated by any party.

      Subdivisions (a) and (b). These subdivisions are derived from
    FRCP 73(g) and FRCP 75(e). FRCP 75(e) presently directs the clerk
    of the district court to transmit the record within the time
    allowed or fixed for its filing, which, under the provisions of
    FRCP 73(g) is within 40 days from the date of filing the notice of
    appeal, unless an extension is obtained from the district court.
    The precise time at which the record must be transmitted thus
    depends upon the time required for delivery of the record from the
    district court to the court of appeals, since, to permit its timely
    filing, it must reach the court of appeals before expiration of the
    40-day period of an extension thereof. Subdivision (a) of this rule
    provides that the record is to be transmitted within the 40-day
    period, or any extension thereof; subdivision (b) provides that
    transmission is effected when the clerk of the district court mails
    or otherwise forwards the record to the clerk of the court of
    appeals; Rule 12(b) directs the clerk of the court of appeals to
    file the record upon its receipt following timely docketing and
    transmittal. It can thus be determined with certainty precisely
    when the clerk of the district court must forward the record to the
    clerk of the court of appeals in order to effect timely filing: the
    final day of the 40-day period or of any extension thereof.
      Subdivision (c). This subdivision is derived from FRCP 75(e)
    without change of substance.
      Subdivision (d). This subdivision is derived from FRCP 73(g) and
    FRCrP 39(c). Under present rules the district court is empowered to
    extend the time for filing the record and docketing the appeal.
    Since under the proposed rule timely transmission now insures
    timely filing (see note to subdivisions (a) and (b) above) the
    power of the district court is expressed in terms of its power to
    extend the time for transmitting the record. Restriction of that
    power to a period of 90 days after the filing of the notice of
    appeal represents a change in the rule with respect to appeals in
    criminal cases. FRCrP 39(c) now permits the district court to
    extend the time for filing and docketing without restriction. No
    good reason appears for a difference between the civil and criminal
    rule in this regard, and subdivision (d) limits the power of the
    district court to extend the time for transmitting the record in
    all cases to 90 days from the date of filing the notice of appeal,
    just as its power is now limited with respect to docketing and
    filing in civil cases. Subdivision (d) makes explicit the power of
    the court of appeals to permit the record to be filed at any time.
    See Pyramid Motor Freight Corporation v. Ispass, 330, U.S. 695, 67
    S.Ct. 954, 91 L.Ed. 1184 (1947).
      Subdivisions (e), (f) and (g). These subdivisions are derived
    from FRCP 75(f), (a) and (g), respectively, without change of
    substance.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1979 AMENDMENT       
      Under present Rule 11(a) it is provided that the record shall be
    transmitted to the court of appeals within 40 days after the filing
    of the notice of appeal. Under present Rule 11(d) the district
    court, on request made during the initial time or any extension
    thereof, and cause shown, may extend the time for the transmission
    of the record to a point not more than 90 days after the filing of
    the first notice of appeal. If the district court is without
    authority to grant a request to extend the time, or denies a
    request for extension, the appellant may make a motion for
    extension of time in the court of appeals. Thus the duty to see
    that the record is transmitted is placed on the appellant. Aside
    from ordering the transcript within the time prescribed the
    appellant has no control over the time at which the record is
    transmitted, since all steps beyond this point are in the hands of
    the reporter and the clerk. The proposed amendments recognize this
    fact and place the duty directly on the reporter and the clerk.
    After receiving the written order for the transcript (See Note to
    Rule 10(b) above), the reporter must acknowledge its receipt,
    indicate when he expects to have it completed, and mail the order
    so endorsed to the clerk of the court of appeals. Requests for
    extensions of time must be made by the reporter to the clerk of the
    court of appeals and action on such requests is entered on the
    docket. Thus from the point at which the transcript is ordered the
    clerk of the court of appeals is made aware of any delays. If the
    transcript is not filed on time, the clerk of the court of appeals
    will notify the district judge.
      Present Rule 11(b) provides that the record shall be transmitted
    when it is "complete for the purposes of the appeal." The proposed
    amended rule continues this requirement. The record is complete for
    the purposes of the appeal when it contains the original papers on
    file in the clerk's office, all necessary exhibits, and the
    transcript, if one is to be included. Cf. present Rule 11(c). The
    original papers will be in the custody of the clerk of the district
    court at the time the notice of appeal is filed. See Rule 5(e) of
    the F.R.C.P. The custody of exhibits is often the subject of local
    rules. Some of them require that documentary exhibits must be
    deposited with the clerk. See Local Rule 13 of the Eastern District
    of Virginia. Others leave exhibits with counsel, subject to order
    of the court. See Local Rule 33 of the Northern District of
    Illinois. If under local rules the custody of exhibits is left with
    counsel, the district court should make adequate provision for
    their preservation during the time during which an appeal may be
    taken, the prompt deposit with the clerk of such as under Rule
    11(b) are to be transmitted to the court of appeals, and the
    availability of others in the event that the court of appeals
    should require their transmission. Cf. Local Rule 11 of the Second
    Circuit.
      Usually the record will be complete with the filing of the
    transcript. While the proposed amendment requires transmission
    "forthwith" when the record is complete, it was not designed to
    preclude a local requirement by the court of appeals that the
    original papers and exhibits be transmitted when complete without
    awaiting the filing of the transcript.
      The proposed amendments continue the provision in the present
    rule that documents of unusual bulk or weight and physical exhibits
    other than documents shall not be transmitted without direction by
    the parties or by the court of appeals, and the requirement that
    the parties make special arrangements for transmission and receipt
    of exhibits of unusual bulk or weight. In addition, they give
    recognition to local rules that make transmission of other record
    items subject to order of the court of appeals. See Local Rule 4 of
    the Seventh Circuit.

      Filing the Record

-STATUTE-
      (a) Docketing the Appeal. Upon receiving the copy of the notice
    of appeal and the docket entries from the district clerk under Rule
    3(d), the circuit clerk must docket the appeal under the title of
    the district-court action and must identify the appellant, adding
    the appellant's name if necessary.
      (b) Filing a Representation Statement. Unless the court of
    appeals designates another time, the attorney who filed the notice
    of appeal must, within 14 days after filing the notice, file a
    statement with the circuit clerk naming the parties that the
    attorney represents on appeal.
      (c) Filing the Record, Partial Record, or Certificate. Upon
    receiving the record, partial record, or district clerk's
    certificate as provided in Rule 11, the circuit clerk must file it
    and immediately notify all parties of the filing date.

      Subdivision (a). All that is involved in the docketing of an
    appeal is the payment of the docket fee. In practice, after the
    clerk of the court of appeals receives the record from the clerk of
    the district court he notifies the appellant of its receipt and
    requests payment of the fee. Upon receipt of the fee, the clerk
    enters the appeal upon the docket and files the record. The
    appellant is allowed to pay the fee at any time within the time
    allowed or fixed for transmission of the record and thereby to
    discharge his responsibility for docketing. The final sentence is
    added in the interest of facilitating future reference and citation
    and location of cases in indexes. Compare 3d Cir. Rule 10(2); 4th
    Cir. Rule 9(8); 6th Cir. Rule 14(1).
      Subdivision (c). The rules of the circuits generally permit the
    appellee to move for dismissal in the event the appellant fails to
    effect timely filing of the record. See 1st Cir. Rule 21(3); 3d
    Cir. Rule 21(4); 5th Cir. Rule 16(1); 8th Cir. Rule 7(d).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1979 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). Under present Rule 12(a) the appellant must pay
    the docket fee within the time fixed for the transmission of the
    record, and upon timely payment of the fee, the appeal is docketed.
    The proposed amendment takes the docketing out of the hands of the
    appellant. The fee is paid at the time the notice of appeal is
    filed and the appeal is entered on the docket upon receipt of a
    copy of the notice of appeal and of the docket entries, which are
    sent to the court of appeals under the provisions of Rule 3(d).
    This is designed to give the court of appeals control of its docket
    at the earliest possible time so that within the limits of its
    facilities and personnel it can screen cases for appropriately
    different treatment, expedite the proceedings through prehearing
    conferences or otherwise, and in general plan more effectively for
    the prompt disposition of cases.
      Subdivision (b). The proposed amendment conforms the provision to
    the changes in Rule 11.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1986 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment to Rule 12(a) is technical. No substantive change
    is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Note to new subdivision (b). This amendment is a companion to the
    amendment of Rule 3(c). The Rule 3(c) amendment allows an attorney
    who represents more than one party on appeal to "specify" the
    appellants by general description rather than by naming them
    individually. The requirement added here is that whenever an
    attorney files a notice of appeal, the attorney must soon
    thereafter file a statement indicating all parties represented on
    the appeal by that attorney. Although the notice of appeal is the
    jurisdictional document and it must clearly indicate who is
    bringing the appeal, the representation statement will be helpful
    especially to the court of appeals in identifying the individual
    appellants.
      The rule allows a court of appeals to require the filing of the
    representation statement at some time other than specified in the
    rule so that if a court of appeals requires a docketing statement
    or appearance form the representation statement may be combined
    with it.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily
    understood. In addition to changes made to improve the
    understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make
    style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

      on a Motion for Relief That Is Barred by a Pending Appeal

-STATUTE-
      (a) Notice to the Court of Appeals. If a timely motion is made in
    the district court for relief that it lacks authority to grant
    because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending, the
    movant must promptly notify the circuit clerk if the district court
    states either that it would grant the motion or that the motion
    raises a substantial issue.
      (b) Remand After an Indicative Ruling. If the district court
    states that it would grant the motion or that the motion raises a
    substantial issue, the court of appeals may remand for further
    proceedings but retains jurisdiction unless it expressly dismisses
    the appeal. If the court of appeals remands but retains
    jurisdiction, the parties must promptly notify the circuit clerk
    when the district court has decided the motion on remand.

-MISC1-
                      COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009                  
      This new rule corresponds to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
    62.1, which adopts for any motion that the district court cannot
    grant because of a pending appeal the practice that most courts
    follow when a party moves under Civil Rule 60(b) to vacate a
    judgment that is pending on appeal. After an appeal has been
    docketed and while it remains pending, the district court cannot
    grant relief under a rule such as Civil Rule 60(b) without a
    remand. But it can entertain the motion and deny it, defer
    consideration, state that it would grant the motion if the court of
    appeals remands for that purpose, or state that the motion raises a
    substantial issue. Experienced lawyers often refer to the
    suggestion for remand as an "indicative ruling." (Appellate Rule
    4(a)(4) lists six motions that, if filed within the relevant time
    limit, suspend the effect of a notice of appeal filed before or
    after the motion is filed until the last such motion is disposed
    of. The district court has authority to grant the motion without
    resorting to the indicative ruling procedure.)
      The procedure formalized by Rule 12.1 is helpful when relief is
    sought from an order that the court cannot reconsider because the
    order is the subject of a pending appeal. In the criminal context,
    the Committee anticipates that Rule 12.1 will be used primarily if
    not exclusively for newly discovered evidence motions under
    Criminal Rule 33(b)(1) (see United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648,
    667 n.42 (1984)), reduced sentence motions under Criminal Rule
    35(b), and motions under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3582(c).
      Rule 12.1 does not attempt to define the circumstances in which
    an appeal limits or defeats the district court's authority to act
    in the face of a pending appeal. The rules that govern the
    relationship between trial courts and appellate courts may be
    complex, depending in part on the nature of the order and the
    source of appeal jurisdiction. Appellate Rule 12.1 applies only
    when those rules deprive the district court of authority to grant
    relief without appellate permission.
      To ensure proper coordination of proceedings in the district
    court and in the court of appeals, the movant must notify the
    circuit clerk if the district court states that it would grant the
    motion or that the motion raises a substantial issue. The
    "substantial issue" standard may be illustrated by the following
    hypothetical: The district court grants summary judgment dismissing
    a case. While the plaintiff's appeal is pending, the plaintiff
    moves for relief from the judgment, claiming newly discovered
    evidence and also possible fraud by the defendant during the
    discovery process. If the district court reviews the motion and
    indicates that the motion "raises a substantial issue," the court
    of appeals may well wish to remand rather than proceed to determine
    the appeal.
      If the district court states that it would grant the motion or
    that the motion raises a substantial issue, the movant may ask the
    court of appeals to remand so that the district court can make its
    final ruling on the motion. In accordance with Rule 47(a)(1), a
    local rule may prescribe the format for the litigants'
    notifications and the district court's statement.
      Remand is in the court of appeals' discretion. The court of
    appeals may remand all proceedings, terminating the initial appeal.
    In the context of postjudgment motions, however, that procedure
    should be followed only when the appellant has stated clearly its
    intention to abandon the appeal. The danger is that if the initial
    appeal is terminated and the district court then denies the
    requested relief, the time for appealing the initial judgment will
    have run out and a court might rule that the appellant is limited
    to appealing the denial of the postjudgment motion. The latter
    appeal may well not provide the appellant with the opportunity to
    raise all the challenges that could have been raised on appeal from
    the underlying judgment. See, e.g., Browder v. Dir., Dep't of
    Corrections of Ill., 434 U.S. 257, 263 n.7 (1978) ("[A]n appeal
    from denial of Rule 60(b) relief does not bring up the underlying
    judgment for review."). The Committee does not endorse the notion
    that a court of appeals should decide that the initial appeal was
    abandoned - despite the absence of any clear statement of intent to
    abandon the appeal - merely because an unlimited remand occurred,
    but the possibility that a court might take that troubling view
    underscores the need for caution in delimiting the scope of the
    remand.
      The court of appeals may instead choose to remand for the sole
    purpose of ruling on the motion while retaining jurisdiction to
    proceed with the appeal after the district court rules on the
    motion (if the appeal is not moot at that point and if any party
    wishes to proceed). This will often be the preferred course in the
    light of the concerns expressed above. It is also possible that the
    court of appeals may wish to proceed to hear the appeal even after
    the district court has granted relief on remand; thus, even when
    the district court indicates that it would grant relief, the court
    of appeals may in appropriate circumstances choose a limited rather
    than unlimited remand.
      If the court of appeals remands but retains jurisdiction,
    subdivision (b) requires the parties to notify the circuit clerk
    when the district court has decided the motion on remand. This is a
    joint obligation that is discharged when the required notice is
    given by any litigant involved in the motion in the district court.
      When relief is sought in the district court during the pendency
    of an appeal, litigants should bear in mind the likelihood that a
    new or amended notice of appeal will be necessary in order to
    challenge the district court's disposition of the motion. See,
    e.g., Jordan v. Bowen, 808 F.2d 733, 736-37 (10th Cir. 1987)
    (viewing district court's response to appellant's motion for
    indicative ruling as a denial of appellant's request for relief
    under Rule 60(b), and refusing to review that denial because
    appellant had failed to take an appeal from the denial); TAAG
    Linhas Aereas de Angola v. Transamerica Airlines, Inc., 915 F.2d
    1351, 1354 (9th Cir. 1990) ("[W]here a 60(b) motion is filed
    subsequent to the notice of appeal and considered by the district
    court after a limited remand, an appeal specifically from the
    ruling on the motion must be taken if the issues raised in that
    motion are to be considered by the Court of Appeals.").
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made
    to the text of Rule 12.1. The Appellate Rules Committee made two
    changes to the Note in response to public comments, and made
    additional changes in consultation with the Civil Rules Committee
    and in response to some Appellate Rules Committee members'
    suggestions. The Standing Committee made two further changes to the
    Note.
      As published for comment, the second paragraph of the Note read:
    "[Appellate Rule 12.1 is not limited to the Civil Rule 62.1
    context; Rule 12.1 may also be used, for example, in connection
    with motions under Criminal Rule 33. See United States v. Cronic,
    466 U.S. 648, 667 n.42 (1984).] The procedure formalized by Rule
    12.1 is helpful whenever relief is sought from an order that the
    court cannot reconsider because the order is the subject of a
    pending appeal." The Appellate Rules Committee discussed the
    Solicitor General's concern that Appellate Rule 12.1 might be
    misused in the criminal context. In response, the Appellate Rules
    Committee deleted the second paragraph as published and substituted
    the following language: "The procedure formalized by Rule 12.1 is
    helpful when relief is sought from an order that the court cannot
    reconsider because the order is the subject of a pending appeal. In
    the criminal context, the Committee anticipates that Rule 12.1's
    use will be limited to newly discovered evidence motions under
    Criminal Rule 33(b)(1) (see United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648,
    667 n.42 (1984)), reduced sentence motions under Criminal Rule
    35(b), and motions under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3582(c)." The Standing
    Committee further revised the latter sentence to read: "In the
    criminal context, the Committee anticipates that Rule 12.1 will be
    used primarily if not exclusively for newly discovered evidence
    motions under Criminal Rule 33(b)(1) (see United States v. Cronic,
    466 U.S. 648, 667 n.42 (1984)), reduced sentence motions under
    Criminal Rule 35(b), and motions under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3582(c)."
      As published for comment, the first sentence of the Note's last
    paragraph read: "When relief is sought in the district court during
    the pendency of an appeal, litigants should bear in mind the
    likelihood that a separate notice of appeal will be necessary in
    order to challenge the district court's disposition of the motion."
    In response to a suggestion by Public Citizen, the Appellate Rules
    Committee revised this sentence to refer to a "new or amended"
    notice of appeal rather than a "separate" notice of appeal.
      The Appellate Rules Committee, in consultation with the Civil
    Rules Committee, added the following parenthetical at the end of
    the Note's first paragraph: "(The effect of a notice of appeal on
    district-court authority is addressed by Appellate Rule 4(a)(4),
    which lists six motions that, if filed within the relevant time
    limit, suspend the effect of a notice of appeal filed before or
    after the motion is filed until the last such motion is disposed
    of. The district court has authority to grant the motion without
    resorting to the indicative ruling procedure.)" This parenthetical
    is designed to forestall confusion concerning the effect of tolling
    motions on a district court's power to act. The Standing Committee
    approved a change to the first sentence of the parenthetical; it
    now reads: "Appellate Rule 4(a)(4) lists six motions that, if filed
    within the relevant time limit, suspend the effect of a notice of
    appeal filed before or after the motion is filed until the last
    such motion is disposed of."
      The Appellate Rules Committee, acting at the suggestion of the
    Civil Rules Committee, altered the wording of one sentence in the
    first paragraph and one sentence in the fifth paragraph of the
    Note. The changes are designed to remove references to remands of
    "the action," since those references would be in tension with the
    Note's advice concerning the advisability of limited remands. Thus,
    in the Note's first paragraph "if the action is remanded" became
    "if the court of appeals remands for that purpose," and in the
    Note's fifth paragraph "may ask the court of appeals to remand the
    action" became "may ask the court of appeals to remand."
      The Appellate Rules Committee also made stylistic changes to the
    Note's first and third paragraphs. "Experienced appeal lawyers"
    became "Experienced lawyers," and "act in face of a pending appeal"
    became "act in the face of a pending appeal."

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
    TITLE III. REVIEW OF A DECISION OF THE UNITED STATES TAX COURT

-HEAD-
    Rule 13. Review of a Decision of the Tax Court

-STATUTE-
      (a) How Obtained; Time for Filing Notice of Appeal.
        (1) Review of a decision of the United States Tax Court is
      commenced by filing a notice of appeal with the Tax Court clerk
      within 90 days after the entry of the Tax Court's decision. At
      the time of filing, the appellant must furnish the clerk with
      enough copies of the notice to enable the clerk to comply with
      Rule 3(d). If one party files a timely notice of appeal, any
      other party may file a notice of appeal within 120 days after the
      Tax Court's decision is entered.
        (2) If, under Tax Court rules, a party makes a timely motion to
      vacate or revise the Tax Court's decision, the time to file a
      notice of appeal runs from the entry of the order disposing of
      the motion or from the entry of a new decision, whichever is
      later.

      (b) Notice of Appeal; How Filed. The notice of appeal may be
    filed either at the Tax Court clerk's office in the District of
    Columbia or by mail addressed to the clerk. If sent by mail the
    notice is considered filed on the postmark date, subject to Sec.
    7502 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and the applicable
    regulations.
      (c) Contents of the Notice of Appeal; Service; Effect of Filing
    and Service. Rule 3 prescribes the contents of a notice of appeal,
    the manner of service, and the effect of its filing and service.
    Form 2 in the Appendix of Forms is a suggested form of a notice of
    appeal.
      (d) The Record on Appeal; Forwarding; Filing.
        (1) An appeal from the Tax Court is governed by the parts of
      Rules 10, 11, and 12 regarding the record on appeal from a
      district court, the time and manner of forwarding and filing, and
      the docketing in the court of appeals. References in those rules
      and in Rule 3 to the district court and district clerk are to be
      read as referring to the Tax Court and its clerk.
        (2) If an appeal from a Tax Court decision is taken to more
      than one court of appeals, the original record must be sent to
      the court named in the first notice of appeal filed. In an appeal
      to any other court of appeals, the appellant must apply to that
      other court to make provision for the record.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      Subdivision (a). This subdivision effects two changes in practice
    respecting review of Tax Court decisions: (1) Section 7483 of the
    Internal Revenue Code, 68A Stat. 891, 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7483, provides
    that review of a Tax Court decision may be obtained by filing a
    petition for review. The subdivision provides for review by the
    filing of the simple and familiar notice of appeal used to obtain
    review of district court judgments; (2) Section 7483, supra,
    requires that a petition for review be filed within 3 months after
    a decision is rendered, and provides that if a petition is so filed
    by one party, any other party may file a petition for review within
    4 months after the decision is rendered. In the interest of fixing
    the time for review with precision, the proposed rule substitutes
    "90 days" and "120 days" for the statutory "3 months" and "4
    months", respectively. The power of the Court to regulate these
    details of practice is clear. Title 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2072, as amended
    by the Act of November 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 1323 (1 U.S. Code Cong. &
    Ad. News, p. 1546 (1966)), authorizes the Court to regulate ". . .
    practice and procedure in proceedings for the review by the courts
    of appeals of decisions of the Tax Court of the United States. . .
    ."
      The second paragraph states the settled teaching of the case law.
    See Robert Louis Stevenson Apartments, Inc. v. C.I.R., 337 F.2d
    681, 10 A.L.R.3d 112 (8th Cir., 1964); Denholm & McKay Co. v.
    C.I.R., 132 F.2d 243 (1st Cir., 1942); Helvering v. Continental Oil
    Co., 63 App.D.C. 5, 68 F.2d 750 (1934); Burnet v. Lexington Ice &
    Coal Co., 62 F.2d 906 (4th Cir., 1933); Griffiths v. C.I.R., 50
    F.2d 782 (7th Cir., 1931).
      Subdivision (b). The subdivision incorporates the statutory
    provision (Title 26, U.S.C. Sec. 7502) that timely mailing is to be
    treated as timely filing. The statute contains special provisions
    respecting other than ordinary mailing. If the notice of appeal is
    sent by registered mail, registration is deemed prima facie
    evidence that the notice was delivered to the clerk of the Tax
    Court, and the date of registration is deemed the postmark date. If
    the notice of appeal is sent by certified mail, the effect of
    certification with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and
    the postmark date depends upon regulations of the Secretary of the
    Treasury. The effect of a postmark made other than by the United
    States Post Office likewise depends upon regulations of the
    Secretary. Current regulations are found in 26 CFR Sec. 301.7502-1.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1979 AMENDMENT       
      The proposed amendment reflects the change in the title of the
    Tax Court to "United States Tax Court." See 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7441.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The amendment requires a party filing a notice
    of appeal to provide the court with sufficient copies of the notice
    for service on all other parties.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

-HEAD-
    Rule 15. Review or Enforcement of an Agency Order - How Obtained;
      Intervention

-STATUTE-
      (a) Petition for Review; Joint Petition.
        (1) Review of an agency order is commenced by filing, within
      the time prescribed by law, a petition for review with the clerk
      of a court of appeals authorized to review the agency order. If
      their interests make joinder practicable, two or more persons may
      join in a petition to the same court to review the same order.
        (2) The petition must:
          (A) name each party seeking review either in the caption or
        the body of the petition - using such terms as "et al.,"
        "petitioners," or "respondents" does not effectively name the
        parties;
          (B) name the agency as a respondent (even though not named in
        the petition, the United States is a respondent if required by
        statute); and
          (C) specify the order or part thereof to be reviewed.

        (3) Form 3 in the Appendix of Forms is a suggested form of a
      petition for review.
        (4) In this rule "agency" includes an agency, board,
      commission, or officer; "petition for review" includes a petition
      to enjoin, suspend, modify, or otherwise review, or a notice of
      appeal, whichever form is indicated by the applicable statute.

      (b) Application or Cross-Application to Enforce an Order; Answer;
    Default.
        (1) An application to enforce an agency order must be filed
      with the clerk of a court of appeals authorized to enforce the
      order. If a petition is filed to review an agency order that the
      court may enforce, a party opposing the petition may file a cross-
      application for enforcement.
        (2) Within 21 days after the application for enforcement is
      filed, the respondent must serve on the applicant an answer to
      the application and file it with the clerk. If the respondent
      fails to answer in time, the court will enter judgment for the
      relief requested.
        (3) The application must contain a concise statement of the
      proceedings in which the order was entered, the facts upon which
      venue is based, and the relief requested.

      (c) Service of the Petition or Application. The circuit clerk
    must serve a copy of the petition for review, or an application or
    cross-application to enforce an agency order, on each respondent as
    prescribed by Rule 3(d), unless a different manner of service is
    prescribed by statute. At the time of filing, the petitioner must:
        (1) serve, or have served, a copy on each party admitted to
      participate in the agency proceedings, except for the
      respondents;
        (2) file with the clerk a list of those so served; and
        (3) give the clerk enough copies of the petition or application
      to serve each respondent.

      (d) Intervention. Unless a statute provides another method, a
    person who wants to intervene in a proceeding under this rule must
    file a motion for leave to intervene with the circuit clerk and
    serve a copy on all parties. The motion - or other notice of
    intervention authorized by statute - must be filed within 30 days
    after the petition for review is filed and must contain a concise
    statement of the interest of the moving party and the grounds for
    intervention.
      (e) Payment of Fees. When filing any separate or joint petition
    for review in a court of appeals, the petitioner must pay the
    circuit clerk all required fees.

    News, p. 1546 (1966)). Section 11 of the Hobbs Administrative
    Orders Review Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 1132, reenacted as 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 2352 (28 U.S.C.A. Sec. 2352 (Suppl. 1966)), repealed by the
    Act of November 6, 1966, Sec. 4, supra, directed the courts of
    appeals to adopt and promulgate, subject to approval by the
    Judicial Conference rules governing practice and procedure in
    proceedings to review the orders of boards, commissions and
    officers whose orders were made reviewable in the courts of appeals
    by the Act. Thereafter, the Judicial Conference approved a uniform
    rule, and that rule, with minor variations, is now in effect in all
    circuits. Third Circuit Rule 18 is a typical circuit rule, and for
    convenience it is referred to as the uniform rule in the notes
    which accompany rules under this Title.
      Subdivision (a). The uniform rule (see General Note above)
    requires that the petition for review contain "a concise statement,
    in barest outline, of the nature of the proceedings as to which
    relief is sought, the facts upon which venue is based, the grounds
    upon which relief is sought, and the relief prayed." That language
    is derived from Section 4 of the Hobbs Administrative Orders Review
    Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 1130, reenacted as 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2344 (28
    U.S.C.A. Sec. 2344 (Suppl. 1966)). A few other statutes also
    prescribe the content of the petition, but the great majority are
    silent on the point. The proposed rule supersedes 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    2344 and other statutory provisions prescribing the form of the
    petition for review and permits review to be initiated by the
    filing of a simple petition similar in form to the notice of appeal
    used in appeals from judgments of district courts. The more
    elaborate form of petition for review now required is rarely useful
    either to the litigants or to the courts. There is no effective,
    reasonable way of obliging petitioners to come to the real issues
    before those issues are formulated in the briefs. Other provisions
    of this subdivision are derived from sections 1 and 2 of the
    uniform rule.
      Subdivision (b). This subdivision is derived from sections 3, 4
    and 5 of the uniform rule.
      Subdivision (c). This subdivision is derived from section 1 of
    the uniform rule.
      Subdivision (d). This subdivision is based upon section 6 of the
    uniform rule. Statutes occasionally permit intervention by the
    filing of a notice of intention to intervene. The uniform rule does
    not fix a time limit for intervention, and the only time limits
    fixed by statute are the 30-day periods found in the Communications
    Act Amendments, 1952, Sec. 402(e), 66 Stat. 719, 47 U.S.C. Sec.
    402(e), and the Sugar Act of 1948, Sec. 205(d), 61 Stat. 927, 7
    U.S.C. Sec. 1115(d).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The amendment is a companion to the amendment of
    Rule 3(c). Both Rule 3(c) and Rule 15(a) state that a notice of
    appeal or petition for review must name the parties seeking
    appellate review. Rule 3(c), however, provides an attorney who
    represents more than one party on appeal the flexibility to
    describe the parties in general terms rather than naming them
    individually. Rule 15(a) does not allow that flexibility; each
    petitioner must be named. A petition for review of an agency
    decision is the first filing in any court and, therefore, is
    analogous to a complaint in which all parties must be named.
      Subdivision (e). The amendment adds subdivision (e). Subdivision
    (e) parallels Rule 3(e) that requires the payment of fees when
    filing a notice of appeal. The omission of such a requirement from
    Rule 15 is an apparent oversight. Five circuits have local rules
    requiring the payment of such fees, see, e.g., Fifth Cir. Loc. R.
    15.1, and Fed. Cir. Loc. R. 15(a)(2).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT

    has been revised to 21 days. See the Note to Rule 26.

-HEAD-
    Rule 16. The Record on Review or Enforcement

-STATUTE-
      (a) Composition of the Record. The record on review or
    enforcement of an agency order consists of:
        (1) the order involved;
        (2) any findings or report on which it is based; and
        (3) the pleadings, evidence, and other parts of the proceedings
      before the agency.

      (b) Omissions From or Misstatements in the Record. The parties
    may at any time, by stipulation, supply any omission from the
    record or correct a misstatement, or the court may so direct. If
    necessary, the court may direct that a supplemental record be
    prepared and filed.

      Subdivision (a) is based upon 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2112(b). There is no
    distinction between the record compiled in the agency proceeding
    and the record on review; they are one and the same. The record in
    agency cases is thus the same as that in appeals from the district
    court - the original papers, transcripts and exhibits in the
    proceeding below. Subdivision (b) is based upon section 8 of the
    uniform rule (see General Note following Rule 15).

-HEAD-
    Rule 17. Filing the Record

-STATUTE-
      (a) Agency to File; Time for Filing; Notice of Filing. The agency
    must file the record with the circuit clerk within 40 days after
    being served with a petition for review, unless the statute
    authorizing review provides otherwise, or within 40 days after it
    files an application for enforcement unless the respondent fails to
    answer or the court orders otherwise. The court may shorten or
    extend the time to file the record. The clerk must notify all
    parties of the date when the record is filed.
      (b) Filing - What Constitutes.
        (1) The agency must file:
          (A) the original or a certified copy of the entire record or
        parts designated by the parties; or
          (B) a certified list adequately describing all documents,
        transcripts of testimony, exhibits, and other material
        constituting the record, or describing those parts designated
        by the parties.

        (2) The parties may stipulate in writing that no record or
      certified list be filed. The date when the stipulation is filed
      with the circuit clerk is treated as the date when the record is
      filed.
        (3) The agency must retain any portion of the record not filed
      with the clerk. All parts of the record retained by the agency
      are a part of the record on review for all purposes and, if the
      court or a party so requests, must be sent to the court
      regardless of any prior stipulation.

-MISC1-

      Subdivision (a). This subdivision is based upon section 7 of the
    uniform rule (see General Note following Rule 15). That rule does
    not prescribe a time for filing the record in enforcement cases.
    Forty days are allowed in order to avoid useless preparation of the
    record or certified list in cases where the application for
    enforcement is not contested.
      Subdivision (b). This subdivision is based upon 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    2112 and section 7 of the uniform rule. It permits the agency to
    file either the record itself or a certified list of its contents.
    It also permits the parties to stipulate against transmission of
    designated parts of the record without the fear that an inadvertent
    stipulation may "diminish" the record. Finally, the parties may, in
    cases where consultation of the record is unnecessary, stipulate
    that neither the record nor a certified list of its contents be
    filed.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only; a
    substantive change is made, however, in subdivision (b).
      Subdivision (b). The current rule provides that when a court of
    appeals is asked to review or enforce an agency order, the agency
    must file either "the entire record or such parts thereof as the
    parties may designate by stipulation filed with the agency" or a
    certified list describing the documents, transcripts, exhibits, and
    other material constituting the record. If the agency is not filing
    a certified list, the current rule requires the agency to file the
    entire record unless the parties file a "stipulation" designating
    only parts of the record. Such a "stipulation" presumably requires
    agreement of the parties as to the parts to be filed. The amended
    language in subparagraph (b)(1)(A) permits the agency to file the
    entire record or "parts designated by the parties." The new
    language permits the filing of less than the entire record even
    when the parties do not agree as to which parts should be filed.
    Each party can designate the parts that it wants filed; the agency
    can then forward the parts designated by each party. In contrast,
    paragraph (b)(2) continues to require stipulation, that is
    agreement of the parties, that the agency need not file either the
    record or a certified list.

    Rule 18. Stay Pending Review

-STATUTE-
      (a) Motion for a Stay.
        (1) Initial Motion Before the Agency. A petitioner must
      ordinarily move first before the agency for a stay pending review
      of its decision or order.
        (2) Motion in the Court of Appeals. A motion for a stay may be
      made to the court of appeals or one of its judges.
          (A) The motion must:
            (i) show that moving first before the agency would be
          impracticable; or
            (ii) state that, a motion having been made, the agency
          denied the motion or failed to afford the relief requested
          and state any reasons given by the agency for its action.

          (B) The motion must also include:
            (i) the reasons for granting the relief requested and the
          facts relied on;
            (ii) originals or copies of affidavits or other sworn
          statements supporting facts subject to dispute; and
            (iii) relevant parts of the record.

          (C) The moving party must give reasonable notice of the
        motion to all parties.
          (D) The motion must be filed with the circuit clerk and
        normally will be considered by a panel of the court. But in an
        exceptional case in which time requirements make that procedure
        impracticable, the motion may be made to and considered by a
        single judge.

      (b) Bond. The court may condition relief on the filing of a bond
    or other appropriate security.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      While this rule has no counterpart in present rules regulating
    review of agency proceedings, it merely assimilates the procedure
    for obtaining stays in agency proceedings with that for obtaining
    stays in appeals from the district courts. The same considerations
    which justify the requirement of an initial application to the
    district court for a stay pending appeal support the requirement of
    an initial application to the agency pending review. See Note
    accompanying Rule 8. Title 5, U.S.C. Sec. 705 (5 U.S.C.A. Sec. 705
    (1966 Pamphlet)) confers general authority on both agencies and
    reviewing courts to stay agency action pending review. Many of the
    statutes authorizing review of agency action by the courts of
    appeals deal with the question of stays, and at least one, the Act
    of June 15, 1936, 49 Stat. 1499 (7 U.S.C. Sec. 10a), prohibits a
    stay pending review. The proposed rule in nowise affects such
    statutory provisions respecting stays. By its terms, it simply
    indicates the procedure to be followed when a stay is sought.

-HEAD-
    Rule 19. Settlement of a Judgment Enforcing an Agency Order in Part

-STATUTE-
      When the court files an opinion directing entry of judgment
    enforcing the agency's order in part, the agency must within 14
    days file with the clerk and serve on each other party a proposed
    judgment conforming to the opinion. A party who disagrees with the
    agency's proposed judgment must within 10 days file with the clerk
    and serve the agency with a proposed judgment that the party
    believes conforms to the opinion. The court will settle the
    judgment and direct entry without further hearing or argument.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1986 AMENDMENT       
      The deletion of the words "in whole or" is designed to eliminate
    delay in the issuance of a judgment when the court of appeals has
    either enforced completely the order of an agency or denied
    completely such enforcement. In such a clear-cut situation, it
    serves no useful purpose to delay the issuance of the judgment
    until a proposed judgment is submitted by the agency and reviewed
    by the respondent. This change conforms the Rule to the existing
    practice in most circuits. Other amendments are technical and no
    substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily
    understood. In addition to changes made to improve the
    understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make

    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 19 formerly required a party who disagreed with the agency's
    proposed judgment to file a proposed judgment "within 7 days."
    Under former Rule 26(a), "7 days" always meant at least 9 days and
    could mean as many as 11 or even 13 days. Under current Rule 26(a),
    intermediate weekends and holidays are counted. Changing the period
    from 7 to 10 days offsets the change in computation approach. See
    the Note to Rule 26.

      (a) Mandamus or Prohibition to a Court: Petition, Filing,
    Service, and Docketing.
        (1) A party petitioning for a writ of mandamus or prohibition
      directed to a court must file a petition with the circuit clerk
      with proof of service on all parties to the proceeding in the
      trial court. The party must also provide a copy to the trial-
      court judge. All parties to the proceeding in the trial court
      other than the petitioner are respondents for all purposes.
        (2)(A) The petition must be titled "In re [name of
      petitioner]."
        (B) The petition must state:
          (i) the relief sought;
          (ii) the issues presented;

        by the petition; and
          (iv) the reasons why the writ should issue.

        (C) The petition must include a copy of any order or opinion or
      parts of the record that may be essential to understand the
      matters set forth in the petition.
        (3) Upon receiving the prescribed docket fee, the clerk must
      docket the petition and submit it to the court.

      (b) Denial; Order Directing Answer; Briefs; Precedence.
        (1) The court may deny the petition without an answer.
      Otherwise, it must order the respondent, if any, to answer within
      a fixed time.
        (2) The clerk must serve the order to respond on all persons
      directed to respond.
        (3) Two or more respondents may answer jointly.
        (4) The court of appeals may invite or order the trial-court
      judge to address the petition or may invite an amicus curiae to
      do so. The trial-court judge may request permission to address
      the petition but may not do so unless invited or ordered to do so
      by the court of appeals.
        (5) If briefing or oral argument is required, the clerk must
      advise the parties, and when appropriate, the trial-court judge
      or amicus curiae.
        (6) The proceeding must be given preference over ordinary civil
      cases.
        (7) The circuit clerk must send a copy of the final disposition
      to the trial-court judge.

      (c) Other Extraordinary Writs. An application for an
    extraordinary writ other than one provided for in Rule 21(a) must
    be made by filing a petition with the circuit clerk with proof of
    service on the respondents. Proceedings on the application must
    conform, so far as is practicable, to the procedures prescribed in
    Rule 21(a) and (b).
      (d) Form of Papers; Number of Copies. All papers must conform to
    Rule 32(c)(2). Except by the court's permission, a paper must not
    exceed 30 pages, exclusive of the disclosure statement, the proof
    of service, and the accompanying documents required by Rule
    21(a)(2)(C). An original and 3 copies must be filed unless the
    court requires the filing of a different number by local rule or by
    order in a particular case.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      The authority of courts of appeals to issue extraordinary writs
    is derived from 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1651. Subdivisions (a) and (b)
    regulate in detail the procedure surrounding the writs most
    commonly sought - mandamus or prohibition directed to a judge or
    judges. Those subdivisions are based upon Supreme Court Rule 31,
    with certain changes which reflect the uniform practice among the
    circuits (Seventh Circuit Rule 19 is a typical circuit rule).
    Subdivision (c) sets out a very general procedure to be followed in
    applications for the variety of other writs which may be issued
    under the authority of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1651.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (d). The amendment makes it clear that a court may
    require a different number of copies either by rule or by order in
    an individual case. The number of copies of any document that a
    court of appeals needs varies depending upon the way in which the
    court conducts business. The internal operation of the courts of
    appeals necessarily varies from circuit to circuit because of
    differences in the number of judges, the geographic area included
    within the circuit, and other such factors. Uniformity could be
    achieved only by setting the number of copies artificially high so
    that parties in all circuits file enough copies to satisfy the
    needs of the court requiring the greatest number. Rather than do
    that, the Committee decided to make it clear that local rules may
    require a greater or lesser number of copies and that, if the
    circumstances of a particular case indicate the need for a
    different number of copies in that case, the court may so order.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1996 AMENDMENT       
      In most instances, a writ of mandamus or prohibition is not
    actually directed to a judge in any more personal way than is an
    order reversing a court's judgment. Most often a petition for a
    writ of mandamus seeks review of the intrinsic merits of a judge's
    action and is in reality an adversary proceeding between the
    parties. See, e.g., Walker v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.,
    443 F.2d 33 (7th Cir. 1971). In order to change the tone of the
    rule and of mandamus proceedings generally, the rule is amended so
    that the judge is not treated as a respondent. The caption and
    subdivision (a) are amended by deleting the reference to the writs
    as being "directed to a judge or judges."
      Subdivision (a). Subdivision (a) applies to writs of mandamus or
    prohibition directed to a court, but it is amended so that a
    petition for a writ of mandamus or prohibition does not bear the
    name of the judge. The amendments to subdivision (a) speak,
    however, about mandamus or prohibition "directed to a court." This
    language is inserted to distinguish subdivision (a) from
    subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) governs all other extraordinary
    writs, including a writ of mandamus or prohibition directed to an
    administrative agency rather than to a court and a writ of habeas
    corpus.
      The amendments require the petitioner to provide a copy of the
    petition to the trial court judge. This will alert the judge to the
    filing of the petition. This is necessary because the trial court
    judge is not treated as a respondent and, as a result, is not
    served. A companion amendment is made in subdivision (b). It
    requires the circuit clerk to send a copy of the disposition of the
    petition to the trial court judge.
      Subdivision (b). The amendment provides that even if relief is
    requested of a particular judge, although the judge may request
    permission to respond, the judge may not do so unless the court
    invites or orders a response.
      The court of appeals ordinarily will be adequately informed not
    only by the opinions or statements made by the trial court judge
    contemporaneously with the entry of the challenged order but also
    by the arguments made on behalf of the party opposing the relief.
    The latter does not create an attorney-client relationship between
    the party's attorney and the judge whose action is challenged, nor
    does it give rise to any right to compensation from the judge.
      If the court of appeals desires to hear from the trial court
    judge, however, the court may invite or order the judge to respond.
    In some instances, especially those involving court administration
    or the failure of a judge to act, it may be that no one other than
    the judge can provide a thorough explanation of the matters at
    issue. Because it is ordinarily undesirable to place the trial
    court judge, even temporarily, in an adversarial posture with a
    litigant, the rule permits a court of appeals to invite an amicus
    curiae to provide a response to the petition. In those instances in
    which the respondent does not oppose issuance of the writ or does
    not have sufficient perspective on the issue to provide an adequate
    response, participation of an amicus may avoid the need for the
    trial judge to participate.
      Subdivision (c). The changes are stylistic only. No substantive
    changes are intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (d). A petition for a writ of mandamus or
    prohibition, an application for another extraordinary writ, and an
    answer to such a petition or application are all "other papers" for
    purposes of Rule 32(c)(2), and all of the requirements of Rule
    32(a) apply to those papers, except as provided in Rule 32(c)(2).
    During the 1998 restyling of the Federal Rules of Appellate
    Procedure, Rule 21(d) was inadvertently changed to suggest that
    only the requirements of Rule 32(a)(1) apply to such papers. Rule
    21(d) has been amended to correct that error.
      Rule 21(d) has been further amended to limit the length of papers
    filed under Rule 21.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note,
    except that the page limit was increased from 20 pages to 30 pages.
    The Committee was persuaded by some commentators that petitions for
    extraordinary writs closely resemble principal briefs on the merits
    and should be allotted more than 20 pages.

    Rule 22. Habeas Corpus and Section 2255 Proceedings

-STATUTE-
      (a) Application for the Original Writ. An application for a writ
    of habeas corpus must be made to the appropriate district court. If
    made to a circuit judge, the application must be transferred to the
    appropriate district court. If a district court denies an
    application made or transferred to it, renewal of the application
    before a circuit judge is not permitted. The applicant may, under
    28 U.S.C. Sec. 2253, appeal to the court of appeals from the
    district court's order denying the application.
      (b) Certificate of Appealability.
        (1) In a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention
      complained of arises from process issued by a state court, or in
      a 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255 proceeding, the applicant cannot take an
      appeal unless a circuit justice or a circuit or district judge
      issues a certificate of appealability under 28 U.S.C. Sec.
      2253(c). If an applicant files a notice of appeal, the district
      clerk must send to the court of appeals the certificate (if any)
      and the statement described in Rule 11(a) of the Rules Governing
      Proceedings Under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2254 or Sec. 2255 (if any),
      along with the notice of appeal and the file of the district-
      court proceedings. If the district judge has denied the
      certificate, the applicant may request a circuit judge to issue
      it.
        (2) A request addressed to the court of appeals may be
      considered by a circuit judge or judges, as the court prescribes.
      If no express request for a certificate is filed, the notice of
      appeal constitutes a request addressed to the judges of the court
      of appeals.
        (3) A certificate of appealability is not required when a state
      or its representative or the United States or its representative
      appeals.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      Subdivision (a). Title 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2241(a) authorizes circuit
    judges to issue the writ of habeas corpus. Section 2241(b),
    however, authorizes a circuit judge to decline to entertain an
    application and to transfer it to the appropriate district court,
    and this is the usual practice. The first two sentences merely make
    present practice explicit. Title 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2253 seems clearly
    to contemplate that once an application is presented to a district
    judge and is denied by him, the remedy is an appeal from the order
    of denial. But the language of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2241 seems to
    authorize a second original application to a circuit judge
    following a denial by a district judge. In re Gersing, 79
    U.S.App.D.C. 245, 145 F.2d 481 (D.C. Cir., 1944) and Chapman v.
    Teets, 241 F.2d 186 (9th Cir., 1957) acknowledge the availability
    of such a procedure. But the procedure is ordinarily a waste of
    time for all involved, and the final sentence attempts to
    discourage it.
      A court of appeals has no jurisdiction as a court to grant an
    original writ of habeas corpus, and courts of appeals have
    dismissed applications addressed to them. Loum v. Alvis, 263 F.2d
    836 (6th Cir., 1959); In re Berry, 221 F.2d 798 (9th Cir., 1955);
    Posey v. Dowd, 134 F.2d 613 (7th Cir., 1943). The fairer and more
    expeditious practice is for the court of appeals to regard an
    application addressed to it as being addressed to one of its
    members, and to transfer the application to the appropriate
    district court in accordance with the provisions of this rule.
    Perhaps such a disposition is required by the rationale of In re
    Burwell, 350 U.S. 521, 76 S.Ct. 539, 100 L.Ed. 666 (1956).
      Subdivision (b). Title 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2253 provides that an
    appeal may not be taken in a habeas corpus proceeding where
    confinement is under a judgment of a state court unless the judge
    who rendered the order in the habeas corpus proceeding, or a
    circuit justice or judge, issues a certificate of probable cause.
    In the interest of insuring that the matter of the certificate will
    not be overlooked and that, if the certificate is denied, the
    reasons for denial in the first instance will be available on any
    subsequent application, the proposed rule requires the district
    judge to issue the certificate or to state reasons for its denial.
      While 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2253 does not authorize the court of appeals
    as a court to grant a certificate of probable cause, In re Burwell,
    350 U.S. 521, 76 S.Ct. 539, 100 L.Ed. 666 (1956) makes it clear
    that a court of appeals may not decline to consider a request for
    the certificate addressed to it as a court but must regard the
    request as made to the judges thereof. The fourth sentence
    incorporates the Burwell rule.
      Although 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2253 appears to require a certificate of
    probable cause even when an appeal is taken by a state or its
    representative, the legislative history strongly suggests that the
    intention of Congress was to require a certificate only in the case
    in which an appeal is taken by an applicant for the writ. See
    United States ex rel. Tillery v. Cavell, 294 F.2d 12 (3d Cir.,
    1960). Four of the five circuits which have ruled on the point have
    so interpreted section 2253. United States ex rel. Tillery v.
    Cavell, supra; Buder v. Bell, 306 F.2d 71 (6th Cir., 1962); United
    States ex rel. Calhoun v. Pate, 341 F.2d 885 (7th Cir., 1965);
    State of Texas v. Graves, 352 F.2d 514 (5th Cir., 1965). Cf. United
    States ex rel. Carrol v. LaVallee, 342 F.2d 641 (2d Cir., 1965).
    The final sentence makes it clear that a certificate of probable
    cause is not required of a state or its representative.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only; in this
    rule, however, substantive changes are made in paragraphs (b)(1)
    and (b)(3).
      Subdivision (b), paragraph (1). Two substantive changes are made
    in this paragraph. First, the paragraph is made applicable to 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 2255 proceedings. This brings the rule into conformity
    with 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2253 as amended by the Anti-Terrorism and
    Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-132. Second,
    the rule states that a certificate of appealability may be issued
    by "a circuit justice or a circuit or district judge." That
    language adds a reference to the circuit justice which also brings
    the rule into conformity with section 2253. The language continues
    to state that in addition to the circuit justice, both a circuit
    and a district judge may issue a certificate of appealability. The
    language of section 2253 is ambiguous; it states that a certificate
    of appealability may be issued by "a circuit justice or judge."
    Since the enactment of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death
    Penalty Act, three circuits have held that both district and
    circuit judges, as well as the circuit justice, may issue a
    certificate of appealability. Else v. Johnson, 104 F.3d 82 (5th
    Cir. 1997); Lyons v. Ohio Adult Parole Authority, 105 F.3d 1063
    (6th Cir. 1997); and Hunter v. United States, 101 F.3d 1565 (11th
    Cir. 1996). The approach taken by the rule is consistent with those
    decisions.
      Subdivision (b), paragraph (3). The Anti-Terrorism and Effective
    Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-132, amended 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 2253 to make it applicable to Sec. 2255 proceedings.
    Accordingly, paragraph (3) is amended to provide that when the
    United States or its representative appeals, a certificate of
    appealability is not required.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (b)(1). The requirement that the district judge who
    rendered the judgment either issue a certificate of appealability
    or state why a certificate should not issue has been deleted from
    subdivision (b)(1). Rule 11(a) of the Rules Governing Proceedings
    under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2254 or Sec. 2255 now delineates the relevant
    requirement. When an applicant has filed a notice of appeal, the
    district clerk must transmit the record to the court of appeals; if
    the district judge has issued a certificate of appealability, the
    district clerk must include in this transmission the certificate
    and the statement of reasons for grant of the certificate.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. The Appellate Rules
    Committee approved the proposed amendment to Appellate Rule 22(b)
    with the style changes (described below) [omitted] which were
    suggested by Professor Kimble. As detailed in the report of the
    Criminal Rules Committee, a number of changes were made to the
    proposals concerning Rule 11 of the habeas and Section 2255 rules
    in response to public comment.
      At the Standing Committee's direction, the language proposed for
    Appellate Rule 22(b) was circulated to the circuit clerks for their
    comment. Pursuant to comments received from the circuit clerks, the
    second sentence of Rule 22(b) was revised to make clear that the
    Rule requires the transmission of the record by the district court
    when an appeal is filed, regardless of whether the certificate of
    appealability was granted or denied by the district judge; a
    conforming change was made to the last sentence of the Committee
    Note.

                          AMENDMENT BY PUBLIC LAW                      
      1996 - Pub. L. 104-132 inserted "and section 2255" after "corpus"
    in catchline and amended text generally. Prior to amendment, text
    read as follows:
      "(a) Application for the original writ. - An application for a
    writ of habeas corpus shall be made to the appropriate district
    court. If application is made to a circuit judge, the application
    will ordinarily be transferred to the appropriate district court.
    If an application is made to or transferred to the district court
    and denied, renewal of the application before a circuit judge is
    not favored; the proper remedy is by appeal to the court of appeals
    from the order of the district court denying the writ.
      "(b) Necessity of certificate of probable cause for appeal. - In
    a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of
    arises out of process issued by a state court, an appeal by the
    applicant for the writ may not proceed unless a district or a
    circuit judge issues a certificate of probable cause. If an appeal
    is taken by the applicant, the district judge who rendered the
    judgment shall either issue a certificate of probable cause or
    state the reasons why such a certificate should not issue. The
    certificate or the statement shall be forwarded to the court of
    appeals with the notice of appeal and the file of the proceedings
    in the district court. If the district judge has denied the
    certificate, the applicant for the writ may then request issuance
    of the certificate by a circuit judge. If such a request is
    addressed to the court of appeals, it shall be deemed addressed to
    the judges thereof and shall be considered by a circuit judge or
    judges as the court deems appropriate. If no express request for a
    certificate is filed, the notice of appeal shall be deemed to
    constitute a request addressed to the judges of the court of
    appeals. If an appeal is taken by a state or its representative, a
    certificate of probable cause is not required."

    Rule 23. Custody or Release of a Prisoner in a Habeas Corpus
      Proceeding

-STATUTE-
      (a) Transfer of Custody Pending Review. Pending review of a
    decision in a habeas corpus proceeding commenced before a court,
    justice, or judge of the United States for the release of a
    prisoner, the person having custody of the prisoner must not
    transfer custody to another unless a transfer is directed in
    accordance with this rule. When, upon application, a custodian
    shows the need for a transfer, the court, justice, or judge
    rendering the decision under review may authorize the transfer and
    substitute the successor custodian as a party.
      (b) Detention or Release Pending Review of Decision Not to
    Release. While a decision not to release a prisoner is under
    review, the court or judge rendering the decision, or the court of
    appeals, or the Supreme Court, or a judge or justice of either
    court, may order that the prisoner be:
        (1) detained in the custody from which release is sought;
        (2) detained in other appropriate custody; or
        (3) released on personal recognizance, with or without surety.

      (c) Release Pending Review of Decision Ordering Release. While a
    decision ordering the release of a prisoner is under review, the
    prisoner must - unless the court or judge rendering the decision,
    or the court of appeals, or the Supreme Court, or a judge or
    justice of either court orders otherwise - be released on personal
    recognizance, with or without surety.
      (d) Modification of the Initial Order on Custody. An initial
    order governing the prisoner's custody or release, including any
    recognizance or surety, continues in effect pending review unless
    for special reasons shown to the court of appeals or the Supreme
    Court, or to a judge or justice of either court, the order is
    modified or an independent order regarding custody, release, or
    surety is issued.

    substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Subdivison (d). The current rule states that the initial order
    governing custody or release "shall govern review" in the court of
    appeals. The amended language says that the initial order generally
    "continues in effect" pending review.
      When Rule 23 was adopted it used the same language as Supreme
    Court Rule 49, which then governed custody of prisoners in habeas
    corpus proceedings. The "shall govern review" language was drawn
    from the Supreme Court Rule. The Supreme Court has since amended
    its rule, now Rule 36, to say that the initial order "shall
    continue in effect" unless for reasons shown it is modified or a
    new order is entered. Rule 23 is amended to similarly state that
    the initial order "continues in effect." The new language is
    clearer. It removes the possible implication that the initial order
    created law of the case, a strange notion to attach to an order
    regarding custody or release.

    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
    TITLE VI. HABEAS CORPUS; PROCEEDINGS IN FORMA PAUPERIS

-HEAD-
    Rule 24. Proceeding in Forma Pauperis

-STATUTE-
      (a) Leave to Proceed in Forma Pauperis.
        (1) Motion in the District Court. Except as stated in Rule
      24(a)(3), a party to a district-court action who desires to
      appeal in forma pauperis must file a motion in the district
      court. The party must attach an affidavit that:
          (A) shows in the detail prescribed by Form 4 of the Appendix
        of Forms the party's inability to pay or to give security for
        fees and costs;
          (B) claims an entitlement to redress; and
          (C) states the issues that the party intends to present on
        appeal.

        (2) Action on the Motion. If the district court grants the
      motion, the party may proceed on appeal without prepaying or
      giving security for fees and costs, unless a statute provides
      otherwise. If the district court denies the motion, it must state
      its reasons in writing.
        (3) Prior Approval. A party who was permitted to proceed in
      forma pauperis in the district-court action, or who was
      determined to be financially unable to obtain an adequate defense
      in a criminal case, may proceed on appeal in forma pauperis
      without further authorization, unless:
          (A) the district court - before or after the notice of appeal
        is filed - certifies that the appeal is not taken in good faith
        or finds that the party is not otherwise entitled to proceed in
        forma pauperis and states in writing its reasons for the
        certification or finding; or
          (B) a statute provides otherwise.

        (4) Notice of District Court's Denial. The district clerk must
      immediately notify the parties and the court of appeals when the
      district court does any of the following:
          (A) denies a motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis;
          (B) certifies that the appeal is not taken in good faith; or
          (C) finds that the party is not otherwise entitled to proceed
        in forma pauperis.

        (5) Motion in the Court of Appeals. A party may file a motion
      to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis in the court of appeals
      within 30 days after service of the notice prescribed in Rule
      24(a)(4). The motion must include a copy of the affidavit filed
      in the district court and the district court's statement of
      reasons for its action. If no affidavit was filed in the district
      court, the party must include the affidavit prescribed by Rule
      24(a)(1).

      (b) Leave to Proceed in Forma Pauperis on Appeal or Review of an
    Administrative-Agency Proceeding. When an appeal or review of a
    proceeding before an administrative agency, board, commission, or
    officer (including for the purpose of this rule the United States
    Tax Court) proceeds directly in a court of appeals, a party may
    file in the court of appeals a motion for leave to proceed on
    appeal in forma pauperis with an affidavit prescribed by Rule
    24(a)(1).
      (c) Leave to Use Original Record. A party allowed to proceed on
    appeal in forma pauperis may request that the appeal be heard on
    the original record without reproducing any part.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      Subdivision (a). Authority to allow prosecution of an appeal in
    forma pauperis is vested in "[a]ny court of the United States" by
    28 U.S.C. Sec. 1915(a). The second paragraph of section 1915(a)
    seems to contemplate initial application to the district court for
    permission to proceed in forma pauperis, and although the circuit
    rules are generally silent on the question, the case law requires
    initial application to the district court. Hayes v. United States,
    258 F.2d 400 (5th Cir., 1958), cert. den. 358 U.S. 856, 79 S.Ct.
    87, 3 L.Ed.2d 89 (1958); Elkins v. United States, 250 F.2d 145 (9th
    Cir., 1957) see 364 U.S. 206, 80 S.Ct. 1437, 4 L.Ed.2d 1669 (1960);
    United States v. Farley, 238 F.2d 575 (2d Cir., 1956) see 354 U.S.
    521, 77 S.Ct. 1371, 1 L.Ed.2d 1529 (1957). D.C. Cir. Rule 41(a)
    requires initial application to the district court. The content of
    the affidavit follows the language of the statute; the requirement
    of a statement of the issues comprehends the statutory requirement
    of a statement of "the nature of the . . . appeal. . . ." The
    second sentence is in accord with the decision in McGann v. United
    States, 362 U.S. 309, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 734 (1960). The
    requirement contained in the third sentence has no counterpart in
    present circuit rules, but it has been imposed by decision in at
    least two circuits. Ragan v. Cox, 305 F.2d 58 (10th Cir., 1962);
    United States ex rel. Breedlove v. Dowd, 269 F.2d 693 (7th Cir.,
    1959).
      The second paragraph permits one whose indigency has been
    previously determined by the district court to proceed on appeal in
    forma pauperis without the necessity of a redetermination of
    indigency, while reserving to the district court its statutory
    authority to certify that the appeal is not taken in good faith, 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 1915(a), and permitting an inquiry into whether the
    circumstances of the party who was originally entitled to proceed
    in forma pauperis have changed during the course of the litigation.
    Cf. Sixth Circuit Rule 26.
      The final paragraph establishes a subsequent motion in the court
    of appeals, rather than an appeal from the order of denial or from
    the certification of lack of good faith, as the proper procedure
    for calling in question the correctness of the action of the
    district court. The simple and expeditious motion procedure seems
    clearly preferable to an appeal. This paragraph applies only to
    applications for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. The order of a
    district court refusing leave to initiate an action in the district
    court in forma pauperis is reviewable on appeal. See Roberts v.
    United States District Court, 339 U.S. 844, 70 S.Ct. 954, 94 L.Ed.
    1326 (1950).
      Subdivision (b). Authority to allow prosecution in forma pauperis
    is vested only in a "court of the United States" (see Note to
    subdivision (a), above). Thus in proceedings brought directly in a
    court of appeals to review decisions of agencies or of the Tax
    Court, authority to proceed in forma pauperis should be sought in
    the court of appeals. If initial review of agency action is had in
    a district court, an application to appeal to a court of appeals in
    forma pauperis from the judgment of the district court is governed
    by the provisions of subdivision (a).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1979 AMENDMENT       
      The proposed amendment reflects the change in the title of the
    Tax Court to "United States Tax Court." See 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7441.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1986 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments to Rule 24(a) are technical. No substantive change
    is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only. The
    Advisory Committee deletes the language in subdivision (c)
    authorizing a party proceeding in forma pauperis to file papers in
    typewritten form because the authorization is unnecessary. The
    rules permit all parties to file typewritten documents.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a)(2). Section 804 of the Prison Litigation Reform
    Act of 1995 ("PLRA") amended 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1915 to require that
    prisoners who bring civil actions or appeals from civil actions
    must "pay the full amount of a filing fee." 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    1915(b)(1). Prisoners who are unable to pay the full amount of the
    filing fee at the time that their actions or appeals are filed are
    generally required to pay part of the fee and then to pay the
    remainder of the fee in installments. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1915(b). By
    contrast, Rule 24(a)(2) has provided that, after the district court
    grants a litigant's motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis,
    the litigant may proceed "without prepaying or giving security for
    fees and costs." Thus, the PLRA and Rule 24(a)(2) appear to be in
    conflict.
      Rule 24(a)(2) has been amended to resolve this conflict.
    Recognizing that future legislation regarding prisoner litigation
    is likely, the Committee has not attempted to incorporate into Rule
    24 all of the requirements of the current version of 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    1915. Rather, the Committee has amended Rule 24(a)(2) to clarify
    that the rule is not meant to conflict with anything required by
    the PLRA or any other statute.
      Subdivision (a)(3). Rule 24(a)(3) has also been amended to
    eliminate an apparent conflict with the PLRA. Rule 24(a)(3) has
    provided that a party who was permitted to proceed in forma
    pauperis in the district court may continue to proceed in forma
    pauperis in the court of appeals without further authorization,
    subject to certain conditions. The PLRA, by contrast, provides that
    a prisoner who was permitted to proceed in forma pauperis in the
    district court and who wishes to continue to proceed in forma
    pauperis on appeal may not do so "automatically," but must seek
    permission. See, e.g., Morgan v. Haro, 112 F.3d 788, 789 (5th Cir.
    1997) ("A prisoner who seeks to proceed IFP on appeal must obtain
    leave to so proceed despite proceeding IFP in the district
    court.").
      Rule 24(a)(3) has been amended to resolve this conflict. Again,
    recognizing that future legislation regarding prisoner litigation
    is likely, the Committee has not attempted to incorporate into Rule
    24 all of the requirements of the current version of 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    1915. Rather, the Committee has amended Rule 24(a)(3) to clarify
    that the rule is not meant to conflict with anything required by
    the PLRA or any other statute.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note,
    except that "a statute provides otherwise" was substituted in place
    of "the law requires otherwise" in the text of the rule and
    conforming changes (as well as a couple of minor stylistic changes)
    were made to the Committee Note.

-EXPCITE-
    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
    TITLE VII. GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 25. Filing and Service

-STATUTE-
      (a) Filing.
        (1) Filing with the Clerk. A paper required or permitted to be
      filed in a court of appeals must be filed with the clerk.
        (2) Filing: Method and Timeliness.
          (A) In General. Filing may be accomplished by mail addressed
        to the clerk, but filing is not timely unless the clerk
        receives the papers within the time fixed for filing.
          (B) A brief or appendix. A brief or appendix is timely filed,
        however, if on or before the last day for filing, it is:
            (i) mailed to the clerk by First-Class Mail, or other class
          of mail that is at least as expeditious, postage prepaid; or
            (ii) dispatched to a third-party commercial carrier for
          delivery to the clerk within 3 days.

          (C) Inmate Filing. A paper filed by an inmate confined in an
        institution is timely if deposited in the institution's
        internal mailing system on or before the last day for filing.
        If an institution has a system designed for legal mail, the
        inmate must use that system to receive the benefit of this
        rule. Timely filing may be shown by a declaration in compliance
        with 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1746 or by a notarized statement, either of
        which must set forth the date of deposit and state that first-
        class postage has been prepaid.
          (D) Electronic Filing. A court of appeals may by local rule
        permit or require papers to be filed, signed, or verified by
        electronic means that are consistent with technical standards,
        if any, that the Judicial Conference of the United States
        establishes. A local rule may require filing by electronic
        means only if reasonable exceptions are allowed. A paper filed
        by electronic means in compliance with a local rule constitutes
        a written paper for the purpose of applying these rules.

        (3) Filing a Motion with a Judge. If a motion requests relief
      that may be granted by a single judge, the judge may permit the
      motion to be filed with the judge; the judge must note the filing
      date on the motion and give it to the clerk.
        (4) Clerk's Refusal of Documents. The clerk must not refuse to
      accept for filing any paper presented for that purpose solely
      because it is not presented in proper form as required by these
      rules or by any local rule or practice.
        (5) Privacy Protection. An appeal in a case whose privacy
      protection was governed by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure
      9037, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2, or Federal Rule of
      Criminal Procedure 49.1 is governed by the same rule on appeal.
      In all other proceedings, privacy protection is governed by
      Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2, except that Federal Rule of
      Criminal Procedure 49.1 governs when an extraordinary writ is
      sought in a criminal case.

      (b) Service of All Papers Required. Unless a rule requires
    service by the clerk, a party must, at or before the time of filing
    a paper, serve a copy on the other parties to the appeal or review.
    Service on a party represented by counsel must be made on the
    party's counsel.
      (c) Manner of Service.
        (1) Service may be any of the following:
          (A) personal, including delivery to a responsible person at
        the office of counsel;
          (B) by mail;
          (C) by third-party commercial carrier for delivery within 3
        days; or
          (D) by electronic means, if the party being served consents
        in writing.

        (2) If authorized by local rule, a party may use the court's
      transmission equipment to make electronic service under Rule
      25(c)(1)(D).
        (3) When reasonable considering such factors as the immediacy
      of the relief sought, distance, and cost, service on a party must
      be by a manner at least as expeditious as the manner used to file
      the paper with the court.
        (4) Service by mail or by commercial carrier is complete on
      mailing or delivery to the carrier. Service by electronic means
      is complete on transmission, unless the party making service is
      notified that the paper was not received by the party served.

      (d) Proof of Service.
        (1) A paper presented for filing must contain either of the
      following:
          (A) an acknowledgment of service by the person served; or
          (B) proof of service consisting of a statement by the person
        who made service certifying:
            (i) the date and manner of service;
            (ii) the names of the persons served; and
            (iii) their mail or electronic addresses, facsimile
          numbers, or the addresses of the places of delivery, as
          appropriate for the manner of service.

        (2) When a brief or appendix is filed by mailing or dispatch in
      accordance with Rule 25(a)(2)(B), the proof of service must also
      state the date and manner by which the document was mailed or
      dispatched to the clerk.
        (3) Proof of service may appear on or be affixed to the papers
      filed.

      (e) Number of Copies. When these rules require the filing or
    furnishing of a number of copies, a court may require a different
    number by local rule or by order in a particular case.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      The rule that filing is not timely unless the papers filed are
    received within the time allowed is the familiar one. Ward v.
    Atlantic Coast Line R.R. Co., 265 F.2d 75 (5th Cir., 1959), rev'd
    on other grounds 362 U.S. 396, 80 S.Ct. 789, 4 L.Ed.2d 820 (1960);
    Kahler-Ellis Co. v. Ohio Turnpike Commission, 225 F.2d 922 (6th
    Cir., 1955). An exception is made in the case of briefs and
    appendices in order to afford the parties the maximum time for
    their preparation. By the terms of the exception, air mail delivery
    must be used whenever it is the most expeditious manner of
    delivery.
      A majority of the circuits now require service of all papers
    filed with the clerk. The usual provision in present rules is for
    service on "adverse" parties. In view of the extreme simplicity of
    service by mail, there seems to be no reason why a party who files
    a paper should not be required to serve all parties to the
    proceeding in the court of appeals, whether or not they may be
    deemed adverse. The common requirement of proof of service is
    retained, but the rule permits it to be made by simple
    certification, which may be endorsed on the copy which is filed.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1986 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments to Rules 25(a) and (b) are technical. No
    substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The amendment permits, but does not require,
    courts of appeals to adopt local rules that allow filing of papers
    by electronic means. However, courts of appeals cannot adopt such
    local rules until the Judicial Conference of the United States
    authorizes filing by facsimile or other electronic means.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment accompanies new subdivision (c) of Rule 4 and
    extends the holding in Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266 (1988), to all
    papers filed in the courts of appeals by persons confined in
    institutions.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). Several circuits have local rules that authorize
    the office of the clerk to refuse to accept for filing papers that
    are not in the form required by these rules or by local rules. This
    is not a suitable role for the office of the clerk and the practice
    exposes litigants to the hazards of time bars; for these reasons,
    such rules are proscribed by this rule. This provision is similar
    to Fed.R.Civ.P. 5(e) and Fed.R.Bankr.P. 5005.
      The Committee wishes to make it clear that the provision
    prohibiting a clerk from refusing a document does not mean that a
    clerk's office may no longer screen documents to determine whether
    they comply with the rules. A court may delegate to the clerk
    authority to inform a party about any noncompliance with the rules
    and, if the party is willing to correct the document, to determine
    a date by which the corrected document must be resubmitted. If a
    party refuses to take the steps recommended by the clerk or if in
    the clerk's judgment the party fails to correct the noncompliance,
    the clerk must refer the matter to the court for a ruling.
      Subdivision (d). Two changes have been made in this subdivision.
    Subdivision (d) provides that a paper presented for filing must
    contain proof of service.
      The last sentence of subdivision (d) has been deleted as
    unnecessary. That sentence stated that a clerk could permit papers
    to be filed without acknowledgment or proof of service but must
    require that it be filed promptly thereafter. In light of the
    change made in subdivision (a) which states that a clerk may not
    refuse to accept for filing a document because it is not in the
    proper form, there is no further need for a provision stating that
    a clerk may accept a paper lacking a proof of service. The clerk
    must accept such a paper. That portion of the deleted sentence
    stating that the clerk must require that proof of service be filed
    promptly after the filing of the document if the proof is not filed
    concurrently with the document is also unnecessary.
      The second amendment requires that the certificate of service
    must state the addresses to which the papers were mailed or at
    which they were delivered. The Federal Circuit has a similar local
    rule, Fed.Cir.R. 25.
      Subdivision (e). Subdivision (e) is a new subdivision. It makes
    it clear that whenever these rules require a party to file or
    furnish a number of copies a court may require a different number
    of copies either by rule or by order in an individual case. The
    number of copies of any document that a court of appeals needs
    varies depending upon the way in which the court conducts business.
    The internal operation of the courts of appeals necessarily varies
    from circuit to circuit because of differences in the number of
    judges, the geographic area included within the circuit, and other
    such factors. Uniformity could be achieved only by setting the
    number of copies artificially high so that parties in all circuits
    file enough copies to satisfy the needs of the court requiring the
    greatest number. Rather than do that, the Committee decided to make
    it clear that local rules may require a greater or lesser number of
    copies and that, if the circumstances of a particular case indicate
    the need for a different number of copies in that case, the court
    may so order.
      A party must consult local rules to determine whether the court
    requires a different number than that specified in these national
    rules. The Committee believes it would be helpful if each circuit
    either: 1) included a chart at the beginning of its local rules
    showing the number of copies of each document required to be filed
    with the court along with citation to the controlling rule; or 2)
    made available such a chart to each party upon commencement of an
    appeal; or both. If a party fails to file the required number of
    copies, the failure does not create a jurisdictional defect. Rule
    3(a) states: "Failure of an appellant to take any step other than
    the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the
    validity of the appeal, but is ground only for such action as the
    court of appeals deems appropriate. . . ."

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1996 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The amendment deletes the language requiring a
    party to use "the most expeditious form of delivery by mail, except
    special delivery" in order to file a brief using the mailbox rule.
    That language was adopted before the Postal Service offered Express
    Mail and other expedited delivery services. The amendment makes it
    clear that it is sufficient to use First-Class Mail. Other equally
    or more expeditious classes of mail service, such as Express Mail,
    also may be used. In addition, the amendment permits the use of
    commercial carriers. The use of private, overnight courier services
    has become commonplace in law practice. Expedited services offered
    by commercial carriers often provide faster delivery than First-
    Class Mail; therefore, there should be no objection to the use of
    commercial carriers as long as they are reliable. In order to make
    use of the mailbox rule when using a commercial carrier, the
    amendment requires that the filer employ a carrier who undertakes
    to deliver the document in no more than three calendar days. The
    three-calendar-day period coordinates with the three-day extension
    provided by Rule 26(c).
      Subdivision (c). The amendment permits service by commercial
    carrier if the carrier is to deliver the paper to the party being
    served within three days of the carrier's receipt of the paper. The
    amendment also expresses a desire that when reasonable, service on
    a party be accomplished by a manner as expeditious as the manner
    used to file the paper with the court. When a brief or motion is
    filed with the court by hand delivering the paper to the clerk's
    office, or by overnight courier, the copies should be served on the
    other parties by an equally expeditious manner - meaning either by
    personal service, if distance permits, or by overnight courier, if
    mail delivery to the party is not ordinarily accomplished
    overnight. The reasonableness standard is included so that if a
    paper is hand delivered to the clerk's office for filing but the
    other parties must be served in a different city, state, or region,
    personal service on them ordinarily will not be expected. If use of
    an equally expeditious manner of service is not reasonable, use of
    the next most expeditious manner may be. For example, if the paper
    is filed by hand delivery to the clerk's office but the other
    parties reside in distant cities, service on them need not be
    personal but in most instances should be by overnight courier. Even
    that may not be required, however, if the number of parties that
    must be served would make the use of overnight service too costly.
    A factor that bears upon the reasonableness of serving parties
    expeditiously is the immediacy of the relief requested.
      Subdivision (d). The amendment adds a requirement that when a
    brief or appendix is filed by mail or commercial carrier, the
    certificate of service state the date and manner by which the
    document was mailed or dispatched to the clerk. Including that
    information in the certificate of service avoids the necessity for
    a separate certificate concerning the date and manner of filing.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only; a
    substantive amendment is made, however, in subdivision (a).
      Subdivision (a). The substantive amendment in this subdivision is
    in subparagraph (a)(2)(C) and is a companion to an amendment in
    Rule 4(c). Currently Rule 25(a)(2)(C) provides that if an inmate
    confined in an institution files a document by depositing it in the
    institution's internal mail system, the document is timely filed if
    deposited on or before the last day for filing. Some institutions
    have special internal mail systems for handling legal mail; such
    systems often record the date of deposit of mail by an inmate, the
    date of delivery of mail to an inmate, etc. The Advisory Committee
    amends the rule to require an inmate to use the system designed for
    legal mail, if there is one, in order to receive the benefit of
    this subparagraph.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 25(a)(2)(D) presently authorizes the courts of appeals to
    permit papers to be filed by electronic means. Rule 25 has been
    amended in several respects to permit papers also to be served
    electronically. In addition, Rule 25(c) has been reorganized and
    subdivided to make it easier to understand.
      Subdivision (c)(1)(D). New subdivision (c)(1)(D) has been added
    to permit service to be made electronically, such as by e-mail or
    fax. No party may be served electronically, either by the clerk or
    by another party, unless the party has consented in writing to such
    service.
      A court of appeals may not, by local rule, forbid the use of
    electronic service on a party that has consented to its use. At the
    same time, courts have considerable discretion to use local rules
    to regulate electronic service. Difficult and presently
    unforeseeable questions are likely to arise as electronic service
    becomes more common. Courts have the flexibility to use their local
    rules to address those questions. For example, courts may use local
    rules to set forth specific procedures that a party must follow
    before the party will be deemed to have given written consent to
    electronic service.
      Parties also have the flexibility to define the terms of their
    consent; a party's consent to electronic service does not have to
    be "all-or-nothing." For example, a party may consent to service by
    facsimile transmission, but not by electronic mail; or a party may
    consent to electronic service only if "courtesy" copies of all
    transmissions are mailed within 24 hours; or a party may consent to
    electronic service of only documents that were created with Corel
    WordPerfect.
      Subdivision (c)(2). The courts of appeals are authorized under
    Rule 25(a)(2)(D) to permit papers to be filed electronically.
    Technological advances may someday make it possible for a court to
    forward an electronically filed paper to all parties automatically
    or semi-automatically. When such court-facilitated service becomes
    possible, courts may decide to permit parties to use the courts'
    transmission facilities to serve electronically filed papers on
    other parties who have consented to such service. Court personnel
    would use the court's computer system to forward the papers, but
    the papers would be considered served by the filing parties, just
    as papers that are carried from one address to another by the
    United States Postal Service are considered served by the sending
    parties. New subdivision (c)(2) has been added so that the courts
    of appeals may use local rules to authorize such use of their
    transmission facilities, as well as to address the many questions
    that court-facilitated electronic service is likely to raise.
      Subdivision (c)(4). The second sentence of new subdivision (c)(4)
    has been added to provide that electronic service is complete upon
    transmission. Transmission occurs when the sender performs the last
    act that he or she must perform to transmit a paper electronically;
    typically, it occurs when the sender hits the "send" or "transmit"
    button on an electronic mail program. There is one exception to the
    rule that electronic service is complete upon transmission: If the
    sender is notified - by the sender's e-mail program or otherwise -
    that the paper was not received, service is not complete, and the
    sender must take additional steps to effect service. A paper has
    been "received" by the party on which it has been served as long as
    the party has the ability to retrieve it. A party cannot defeat
    service by choosing not to access electronic mail on its server.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment. A paragraph was added to the
    Committee Note to clarify that consent to electronic service is not
    an "all-or-nothing" matter.
      Subdivision (d)(1)(B)(iii). Subdivision (d)(1)(B)(iii) has been
    amended to require that, when a paper is served electronically, the
    proof of service of that paper must include the electronic address
    or facsimile number to which the paper was transmitted.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The text of the
    proposed amendment was changed to refer to "electronic" addresses
    (instead of to "e-mail" addresses), to include "facsimile numbers,"
    and to add the concluding phrase "as appropriate for the manner of
    service." Conforming changes were made to the Committee Note.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a)(2)(D). Amended Rule 25(a)(2)(D) acknowledges that
    many courts have required electronic filing by means of a standing
    order, procedures manual, or local rule. These local practices
    reflect the advantages that courts and most litigants realize from
    electronic filing. Courts that mandate electronic filing recognize
    the need to make exceptions when requiring electronic filing
    imposes a hardship on a party. Under Rule 25(a)(2)(D), a local rule
    that requires electronic filing must include reasonable exceptions,
    but Rule 25(a)(2)(D) does not define the scope of those exceptions.
    Experience with the local rules that have been adopted and that
    will emerge will aid in drafting new local rules and will
    facilitate gradual convergence on uniform exceptions, whether in
    local rules or in an amended Rule 25(a)(2)(D).
      A local rule may require that both electronic and "hard" copies
    of a paper be filed. Nothing in the last sentence of Rule
    25(a)(2)(D) is meant to imply otherwise.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Rule 25(a)(2)(D) has
    been changed in one significant respect: It now authorizes the
    courts of appeals to require electronic filing only "if reasonable
    exceptions are allowed." (!1) The published version of Rule
    25(a)(2)(D) did not require "reasonable exceptions." The change was
    made in response to the argument of many commentators that the
    national rule should require that the local rules include
    exceptions for those for whom mandatory electronic filing would
    pose a hardship.

      Although Rule 25(a)(2)(D) requires that hardship exceptions be
    included in any local rules that mandate electronic filing, it does
    not attempt to define the scope of those exceptions. Commentators
    were largely in agreement that the local rules should include
    hardship exceptions of some type. But commentators did not agree
    about the perimeters of those exceptions. The Advisory Committee
    believes that, at this point, it does not have enough experience
    with mandatory electronic filing to impose specific hardship
    exceptions on the circuits. Rather, the Advisory Committee believes
    that the circuits should be free for the time being to experiment
    with different formulations.
      The Committee Note has been changed to reflect the addition of
    the "reasonable exceptions" clause to the text of the rule. The
    Committee Note has also been changed to add the final two
    sentences. Those sentences were added at the request of Judge
    Sandra L. Lynch, a member of CACM [the Court Administration and
    Case Management Committee]. Judge Lynch believes that there will be
    few appellate judges who will want to receive only electronic
    copies of briefs, but there will be many who will want to receive
    electronic copies in addition to hard copies. Thus, the local rules
    of most circuits are likely to require a "written" copy or "paper"
    copy, in addition to an electronic copy. The problem is that the
    last sentence of Rule 25(a)(2)(D) provides that "[a] paper filed by
    electronic means in compliance with a local rule constitutes a
    written paper for the purpose of applying these rules." Judge
    Lynch's concern is that this sentence may leave attorneys confused
    as to whether a local rule requiring a "written" or "paper" copy of
    a brief requires anything in addition to the electronic copy. The
    final two sentences of the Committee Note are intended to clarify
    the matter.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a)(5). Section 205(c)(3)(A)(i) of the E-Government
    Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-347, as amended by Public Law 108-281)
    requires that the rules of practice and procedure be amended "to
    protect privacy and security concerns relating to electronic filing
    of documents and the public availability . . . of documents filed
    electronically." In response to that directive, the Federal Rules
    of Bankruptcy, Civil, and Criminal Procedure have been amended, not
    merely to address the privacy and security concerns raised by
    documents that are filed electronically, but also to address
    similar concerns raised by documents that are filed in paper form.
    See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9037; Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2; and Fed. R. Crim.
    P. 49.1.
      Appellate Rule 25(a)(5) requires that, in cases that arise on
    appeal from a district court, bankruptcy appellate panel, or
    bankruptcy court, the privacy rule that applied to the case below
    will continue to apply to the case on appeal. With one exception,
    all other cases - such as cases involving the review or enforcement
    of an agency order, the review of a decision of the tax court, or
    the consideration of a petition for an extraordinary writ - will be
    governed by Civil Rule 5.2. The only exception is when an
    extraordinary writ is sought in a criminal case - that is, a case
    in which the related trial-court proceeding is governed by Criminal
    Rule 49.1. In such a case, Criminal Rule 49.1 will govern in the
    court of appeals as well.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. The rule is a
    modified version of the provision as published. The changes from
    the published proposal implement suggestions by the Style
    Subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and
    Procedure.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Under former Rule 26(a), short periods that span weekends or
    holidays were computed without counting those weekends or holidays.
    To specify that a period should be calculated by counting all
    intermediate days, including weekends or holidays, the Rules used
    the term "calendar days." Rule 26(a) now takes a "days-are-days"
    approach under which all intermediate days are counted, no matter
    how short the period. Accordingly, "3 calendar days" in
    subdivisions (a)(2)(B)(ii) and (c)(1)(C) is amended to read simply
    "3 days."

-FOOTNOTE-
    (!1) At its June 15-16, 2005, meeting, the Standing Rules Committee
         with the concurrence of the advisory committee chair agreed to
         set out the "reasonable exception" clause as a separate
         sentence in the rule, consistent with drafting conventions of
         the Style Project.

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
    TITLE VII. GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 26. Computing and Extending Time

-STATUTE-
      (a) Computing Time. The following rules apply in computing any
    time period specified in these rules, in any local rule or court
    order, or in any statute that does not specify a method of
    computing time.
        (1) Period Stated in Days or a Longer Unit. When the period is
      stated in days or a longer unit of time:
          (A) exclude the day of the event that triggers the period;
          (B) count every day, including intermediate Saturdays,
        Sundays, and legal holidays; and
          (C) include the last day of the period, but if the last day
        is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues
        to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday,
        Sunday, or legal holiday.

        (2) Period Stated in Hours. When the period is stated in hours:
          (A) begin counting immediately on the occurrence of the event
        that triggers the period;
          (B) count every hour, including hours during intermediate
        Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and
          (C) if the period would end on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal
        holiday, the period continues to run until the same time on the
        next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.

        (3) Inaccessibility of the Clerk's Office. Unless the court
      orders otherwise, if the clerk's office is inaccessible:
          (A) on the last day for filing under Rule 26(a)(1), then the
        time for filing is extended to the first accessible day that is
        not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday; or
          (B) during the last hour for filing under Rule 26(a)(2), then
        the time for filing is extended to the same time on the first
        accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal
        holiday.

        (4) "Last Day" Defined. Unless a different time is set by a
      statute, local rule, or court order, the last day ends:
          (A) for electronic filing in the district court, at midnight
        in the court's time zone;
          (B) for electronic filing in the court of appeals, at
        midnight in the time zone of the circuit clerk's principal
        office;
          (C) for filing under Rules 4(c)(1), 25(a)(2)(B), and
        25(a)(2)(C) - and filing by mail under Rule 13(b) - at the
        latest time for the method chosen for delivery to the post
        office, third-party commercial carrier, or prison mailing
        system; and
          (D) for filing by other means, when the clerk's office is
        scheduled to close.

        (5) "Next Day" Defined. The "next day" is determined by
      continuing to count forward when the period is measured after an
      event and backward when measured before an event.
        (6) "Legal Holiday" Defined. "Legal holiday" means:
          (A) the day set aside by statute for observing New Year's
        Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday,
        Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day,
        Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, or Christmas Day;
          (B) any day declared a holiday by the President or Congress;
        and
          (C) for periods that are measured after an event, any other
        day declared a holiday by the state where either of the
        following is located: the district court that rendered the
        challenged judgment or order, or the circuit clerk's principal
        office.

      (b) Extending Time. For good cause, the court may extend the time
    prescribed by these rules or by its order to perform any act, or
    may permit an act to be done after that time expires. But the court
    may not extend the time to file:
        (1) a notice of appeal (except as authorized in Rule 4) or a
      petition for permission to appeal; or
        (2) a notice of appeal from or a petition to enjoin, set aside,
      suspend, modify, enforce, or otherwise review an order of an
      administrative agency, board, commission, or officer of the
      United States, unless specifically authorized by law.

      (c) Additional Time after Service. When a party may or must act
    within a specified time after service, 3 days are added after the
    period would otherwise expire under Rule 26(a), unless the paper is
    delivered on the date of service stated in the proof of service.
    For purposes of this Rule 26(c), a paper that is served
    electronically is not treated as delivered on the date of service
    stated in the proof of service.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      The provisions of this rule are based upon FRCP 6(a), (b) and
    (e). See also Supreme Court Rule 34 and FRCrP 45. Unlike FRCP 6(b),
    this rule, read with Rule 27, requires that every request for
    enlargement of time be made by motion, with proof of service on all
    parties. This is the simplest, most convenient way of keeping all
    parties advised of developments. By the terms of Rule 27(b) a
    motion for enlargement of time under Rule 26(b) may be entertained
    and acted upon immediately, subject to the right of any party to
    seek reconsideration. Thus the requirement of motion and notice
    will not delay the granting of relief of a kind which a court is
    inclined to grant as of course. Specifically, if a court is of the
    view that an extension of time sought before expiration of the
    period originally prescribed or as extended by a previous order
    ought to be granted in effect ex parte, as FRCP 6(b) permits, it
    may grant motions seeking such relief without delay.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1971 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment adds Columbus Day to the list of legal holidays to
    conform the subdivision to the Act of June 28, 1968, 82 Stat. 250,
    which constituted Columbus Day a legal holiday effective after
    January 1, 1971.
      The Act, which amended Title 5, U.S.C. Sec. 6103(a), changes the
    day on which certain holidays are to be observed. Washington's
    Birthday, Memorial Day and Veterans Day are to be observed on the
    third Monday in February, the last Monday in May and the fourth
    Monday in October, respectively, rather than, as heretofore, on
    February 22, May 30, and November 11, respectively. Columbus Day is
    to be observed on the second Monday in October. New Year's Day,
    Independence Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas continue to be
    observed on the traditional days.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1986 AMENDMENT       
      The Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., is added to the list of
    national holidays in Rule 26(a). The amendment to Rule 26(c) is
    technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1989 AMENDMENT       
      The proposed amendment brings Rule 26(a) into conformity with the
    provisions of Rule 6(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 45(a)
    of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, and Rule 9006(a) of the Rules
    of Bankruptcy Procedure which allow additional time for filing
    whenever a clerk's office is inaccessible on the last day for
    filing due to weather or other conditions.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1996 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment is a companion to the proposed amendments to Rule
    25 that permit service on a party by commercial carrier. The
    amendments to subdivision (c) of this rule make the three-day
    extension applicable not only when service is accomplished by mail,
    but whenever delivery to the party being served occurs later than
    the date of service stated in the proof of service. When service is
    by mail or commercial carrier, the proof of service recites the
    date of mailing or delivery to the commercial carrier. If the party
    being served receives the paper on a later date, the three-day
    extension applies. If the party being served receives the paper on
    the same date as the date of service recited in the proof of
    service, the three-day extension is not available.
      The amendment also states that the three-day extension is three
    calendar days. Rule 26(a) states that when a period prescribed or
    allowed by the rules is less than seven days, intermediate
    Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays do not count. Whether the
    three-day extension in Rule 26(c) is such a period, meaning that
    three-days could actually be five or even six days, is unclear. The
    D.C. Circuit recently held that the parallel three-day extension
    provided in the Civil Rules is not such a period and that weekends
    and legal holidays do count. CNPq v. Inter-Trade, 50 F.3d 56 (D.C.
    Cir. 1995). The Committee believes that is the right result and
    that the issue should be resolved. Providing that the extension is
    three calendar days means that if a period would otherwise end on
    Thursday but the three-day extension applies, the paper must be
    filed on Monday. Friday, Saturday, and Sunday are the extension
    days. Because the last day of the period as extended is Sunday, the
    paper must be filed the next day, Monday.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only; two
    substantive changes are made, however, in subdivision (a).
      Subdivision (a). First, the amendments make the computation
    method prescribed in this rule applicable to any time period
    imposed by a local rule. This means that if a local rule
    establishing a time limit is permitted, the national rule will
    govern the computation of that period.
      Second, paragraph (a)(2) includes language clarifying that
    whenever the rules establish a time period in "calendar days,"
    weekends and legal holidays are counted.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a)(2). The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the
    Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure compute time differently than
    the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) and
    Fed. R. Crim. P. 45(a) provide that, in computing any period of
    time, "[w]hen the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than
    11 days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall
    be excluded in the computation." By contrast, Rule 26(a)(2)
    provides that, in computing any period of time, a litigant should
    "[e]xclude intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays when
    the period is less than 7 days, unless stated in calendar days."
    Thus, deadlines of 7, 8, 9, and 10 days are calculated differently
    under the rules of civil and criminal procedure than they are under
    the rules of appellate procedure. This creates a trap for unwary
    litigants. No good reason for this discrepancy is apparent, and
    thus Rule 26(a)(2) has been amended so that, under all three sets
    of rules, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays will
    be excluded when computing deadlines under 11 days but will be
    counted when computing deadlines of 11 days and over.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.
      Subdivision (c). Rule 26(c) has been amended to provide that when
    a paper is served on a party by electronic means, and that party is
    required or permitted to respond to that paper within a prescribed
    period, 3 calendar days are added to the prescribed period.
    Electronic service is usually instantaneous, but sometimes it is
    not, because of technical problems. Also, if a paper is
    electronically transmitted to a party on a Friday evening, the
    party may not realize that he or she has been served until two or
    three days later. Finally, extending the "3-day rule" to electronic
    service will encourage parties to consent to such service under
    Rule 25(c).
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a)(4). Rule 26(a)(4) has been amended to refer to
    the third Monday in February as "Washington's Birthday." A federal
    statute officially designates the holiday as "Washington's
    Birthday," reflecting the desire of Congress specially to honor the
    first president of the United States. See 5 U.S.C. Sec. 6103(a).
    During the 1998 restyling of the Federal Rules of Appellate
    Procedure, references to "Washington's Birthday" were mistakenly
    changed to "Presidents' Day." The amendment corrects that error.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a). Subdivision (a) has been amended to simplify and
    clarify the provisions that describe how deadlines are computed.
    Subdivision (a) governs the computation of any time period found in
    a statute that does not specify a method of computing time, a
    Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure, a local rule, or a court
    order. In accordance with Rule 47(a)(1), a local rule may not
    direct that a deadline be computed in a manner inconsistent with
    subdivision (a).
      The time-computation provisions of subdivision (a) apply only
    when a time period must be computed. They do not apply when a fixed
    time to act is set. The amendments thus carry forward the approach
    taken in Violette v. P.A. Days, Inc., 427 F.3d 1015, 1016 (6th Cir.
    2005) (holding that Civil Rule 6(a) "does not apply to situations
    where the court has established a specific calendar day as a
    deadline"), and reject the contrary holding of In re American
    Healthcare Management, Inc., 900 F.2d 827, 832 (5th Cir. 1990)
    (holding that Bankruptcy Rule 9006(a) governs treatment of date-
    certain deadline set by court order). If, for example, the date
    for filing is "no later than November 1, 2007," subdivision (a)
    does not govern. But if a filing is required to be made "within 10
    days" or "within 72 hours," subdivision (a) describes how that
    deadline is computed.
      Subdivision (a) does not apply when computing a time period set
    by a statute if the statute specifies a method of computing time.
    See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. Sec. 7711(b)(1) (requiring certain petitions
    for review by a local educational agency or a state to be filed
    "within 30 working days (as determined by the local educational
    agency or State) after receiving notice of" federal agency
    decision).
      Subdivision (a)(1). New subdivision (a)(1) addresses the
    computation of time periods that are stated in days. It also
    applies to time periods that are stated in weeks, months, or years;
    though no such time period currently appears in the Federal Rules
    of Appellate Procedure, such periods may be set by other covered
    provisions such as a local rule. See, e.g., Third Circuit Local
    Appellate Rule 46.3(c)(1). Subdivision (a)(1)(B)'s directive to
    "count every day" is relevant only if the period is stated in days
    (not weeks, months or years).
      Under former Rule 26(a), a period of 11 days or more was computed
    differently than a period of less than 11 days. Intermediate
    Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays were included in computing
    the longer periods, but excluded in computing the shorter periods.
    Former Rule 26(a) thus made computing deadlines unnecessarily
    complicated and led to counterintuitive results. For example, a 10-
    day period and a 14-day period that started on the same day
    usually ended on the same day - and the 10-day period not
    infrequently ended later than the 14-day period. See Miltimore
    Sales, Inc. v. Int'l Rectifier, Inc., 412 F.3d 685, 686 (6th Cir.
    2005).
      Under new subdivision (a)(1), all deadlines stated in days (no
    matter the length) are computed in the same way. The day of the
    event that triggers the deadline is not counted. All other days -
    including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays - are
    counted, with only one exception: If the period ends on a Saturday,
    Sunday, or legal holiday, then the deadline falls on the next day
    that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. An illustration
    is provided below in the discussion of subdivision (a)(5).
    Subdivision (a)(3) addresses filing deadlines that expire on a day
    when the clerk's office is inaccessible.
      Where subdivision (a) formerly referred to the "act, event, or
    default" that triggers the deadline, new subdivision (a) refers
    simply to the "event" that triggers the deadline; this change in
    terminology is adopted for brevity and simplicity, and is not
    intended to change meaning.
      Periods previously expressed as less than 11 days will be
    shortened as a practical matter by the decision to count
    intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays in computing
    all periods. Many of those periods have been lengthened to
    compensate for the change. See, e.g., Rules 5(b)(2), 5(d)(1),
    28.1(f), & 31(a).
      Most of the 10-day periods were adjusted to meet the change in
    computation method by setting 14 days as the new period. A 14-day
    period corresponds to the most frequent result of a 10-day period
    under the former computation method - two Saturdays and two Sundays
    were excluded, giving 14 days in all. A 14-day period has an
    additional advantage. The final day falls on the same day of the
    week as the event that triggered the period - the 14th day after a
    Monday, for example, is a Monday. This advantage of using week-long
    periods led to adopting 7-day periods to replace some of the
    periods set at less than 10 days, and 21-day periods to replace 20-
    day periods. Thirty-day and longer periods, however, were retained
    without change.
      Subdivision (a)(2). New subdivision (a)(2) addresses the
    computation of time periods that are stated in hours. No such
    deadline currently appears in the Federal Rules of Appellate
    Procedure. But some statutes contain deadlines stated in hours, as
    do some court orders issued in expedited proceedings.
      Under subdivision (a)(2), a deadline stated in hours starts to
    run immediately on the occurrence of the event that triggers the
    deadline. The deadline generally ends when the time expires. If,
    however, the time period expires at a specific time (say, 2:17
    p.m.) on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the deadline is
    extended to the same time (2:17 p.m.) on the next day that is not a
    Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Periods stated in hours are not
    to be "rounded up" to the next whole hour. Subdivision (a)(3)
    addresses situations when the clerk's office is inaccessible during
    the last hour before a filing deadline expires.
      Subdivision (a)(2)(B) directs that every hour be counted. Thus,
    for example, a 72-hour period that commences at 10:00 a.m. on
    Friday, November 2, 2007, will run until 9:00 a.m. on Monday,
    November 5; the discrepancy in start and end times in this example
    results from the intervening shift from daylight saving time to
    standard time.
      Subdivision (a)(3). When determining the last day of a filing
    period stated in days or a longer unit of time, a day on which the
    clerk's office is not accessible because of the weather or another
    reason is treated like a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. When
    determining the end of a filing period stated in hours, if the
    clerk's office is inaccessible during the last hour of the filing
    period computed under subdivision (a)(2) then the period is
    extended to the same time on the next day that is not a weekend,
    holiday or day when the clerk's office is inaccessible.
      Subdivision (a)(3)'s extensions apply "[u]nless the court orders
    otherwise." In some circumstances, the court might not wish a
    period of inaccessibility to trigger a full 24-hour extension; in
    those instances, the court can specify a briefer extension.
      The text of the rule no longer refers to "weather or other
    conditions" as the reason for the inaccessibility of the clerk's
    office. The reference to "weather" was deleted from the text to
    underscore that inaccessibility can occur for reasons unrelated to
    weather, such as an outage of the electronic filing system. Weather
    can still be a reason for inaccessibility of the clerk's office.
    The rule does not attempt to define inaccessibility. Rather, the
    concept will continue to develop through caselaw, see, e.g.,
    Tchakmakjian v. Department of Defense, 57 Fed. Appx. 438, 441 (Fed.
    Cir. 2003) (unpublished per curiam opinion) (inaccessibility "due
    to anthrax concerns"); cf. William G. Phelps, When Is Office of
    Clerk of Court Inaccessible Due to Weather or Other Conditions for
    Purpose of Computing Time Period for Filing Papers under Rule 6(a)
    of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 135 A.L.R. Fed. 259 (1996)
    (collecting cases). In addition, local provisions may address
    inaccessibility for purposes of electronic filing.
      Subdivision (a)(4). New subdivision (a)(4) defines the end of the
    last day of a period for purposes of subdivision (a)(1).
    Subdivision (a)(4) does not apply in computing periods stated in
    hours under subdivision (a)(2), and does not apply if a different
    time is set by a statute, local rule, or order in the case. A local
    rule may, for example, address the problems that might arise under
    subdivision (a)(4)(A) if a single district has clerk's offices in
    different time zones, or provide that papers filed in a drop box
    after the normal hours of the clerk's office are filed as of the
    day that is date-stamped on the papers by a device in the drop box.
      28 U.S.C. Sec. 452 provides that "[a]ll courts of the United
    States shall be deemed always open for the purpose of filing proper
    papers, issuing and returning process, and making motions and
    orders." A corresponding provision exists in Rule 45(a)(2). Some
    courts have held that these provisions permit an after-hours filing
    by handing the papers to an appropriate official. See, e.g.,
    Casalduc v. Diaz, 117 F.2d 915, 917 (1st Cir. 1941). Subdivision
    (a)(4) does not address the effect of the statute on the question
    of after-hours filing; instead, the rule is designed to deal with
    filings in the ordinary course without regard to Section 452.
      Subdivision (a)(4)(A) addresses electronic filings in the
    district court. For example, subdivision (a)(4)(A) would apply to
    an electronically-filed notice of appeal. Subdivision (a)(4)(B)
    addresses electronic filings in the court of appeals.
      Subdivision (a)(4)(C) addresses filings by mail under Rules
    25(a)(2)(B)(i) and 13(b), filings by third-party commercial carrier
    under Rule 25(a)(2)(B)(ii), and inmate filings under Rules 4(c)(1)
    and 25(a)(2)(C). For such filings, subdivision (a)(4)(C) provides
    that the "last day" ends at the latest time (prior to midnight in
    the filer's time zone) that the filer can properly submit the
    filing to the post office, third-party commercial carrier, or
    prison mail system (as applicable) using the filer's chosen method
    of submission. For example, if a correctional institution's legal
    mail system's rules of operation provide that items may only be
    placed in the mail system between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., then the
    "last day" for filings under Rules 4(c)(1) and 25(a)(2)(C) by
    inmates in that institution ends at 5:00 p.m. As another example,
    if a filer uses a drop box maintained by a third-party commercial
    carrier, the "last day" ends at the time of that drop box's last
    scheduled pickup. Filings by mail under Rule 13(b) continue to be
    subject to Sec. 7502 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and
    the applicable regulations.
      Subdivision (a)(4)(D) addresses all other non-electronic filings;
    for such filings, the last day ends under (a)(4)(D) when the
    clerk's office in which the filing is made is scheduled to close.
      Subdivision (a)(5). New subdivision (a)(5) defines the "next" day
    for purposes of subdivisions (a)(1)(C) and (a)(2)(C). The Federal
    Rules of Appellate Procedure contain both forward-looking time
    periods and backward-looking time periods. A forward-looking time
    period requires something to be done within a period of time after
    an event. See, e.g., Rule 4(a)(1)(A) (subject to certain
    exceptions, notice of appeal in a civil case must be filed "within
    30 days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered"). A
    backward-looking time period requires something to be done within a
    period of time before an event. See, e.g., Rule 31(a)(1) ("[A]
    reply brief must be filed at least 7 days before argument, unless
    the court, for good cause, allows a later filing."). In determining
    what is the "next" day for purposes of subdivisions (a)(1)(C) and
    (a)(2)(C), one should continue counting in the same direction -
    that is, forward when computing a forward-looking period and
    backward when computing a backward-looking period. If, for example,
    a filing is due within 10 days after an event, and the tenth day
    falls on Saturday, September 1, 2007, then the filing is due on
    Tuesday, September 4, 2007 (Monday, September 3, is Labor Day). But
    if a filing is due 10 days before an event, and the tenth day falls
    on Saturday, September 1, then the filing is due on Friday, August
    31. If the clerk's office is inaccessible on August 31, then
    subdivision (a)(3) extends the filing deadline forward to the next
    accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday - no
    earlier than Tuesday, September 4.
      Subdivision (a)(6). New subdivision (a)(6) defines "legal
    holiday" for purposes of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure,
    including the time-computation provisions of subdivision (a).
    Subdivision (a)(6) continues to include within the definition of
    "legal holiday" days that are declared a holiday by the President
    or Congress.
      For forward-counted periods - i.e., periods that are measured
    after an event - subdivision (a)(6)(C) includes certain state
    holidays within the definition of legal holidays. However, state
    legal holidays are not recognized in computing backward-counted
    periods. For both forward- and backward-counted periods, the rule
    thus protects those who may be unsure of the effect of state
    holidays. For forward-counted deadlines, treating state holidays
    the same as federal holidays extends the deadline. Thus, someone
    who thought that the federal courts might be closed on a state
    holiday would be safeguarded against an inadvertent late filing. In
    contrast, for backward-counted deadlines, not giving state holidays
    the treatment of federal holidays allows filing on the state
    holiday itself rather than the day before. Take, for example,
    Monday, April 21, 2008 (Patriot's Day, a legal holiday in the
    relevant state). If a filing is due 14 days after an event, and the
    fourteenth day is April 21, then the filing is due on Tuesday,
    April 22 because Monday, April 21 counts as a legal holiday. But if
    a filing is due 14 days before an event, and the fourteenth day is
    April 21, the filing is due on Monday, April 21; the fact that
    April 21 is a state holiday does not make April 21 a legal holiday
    for purposes of computing this backward-counted deadline. But note
    that if the clerk's office is inaccessible on Monday, April 21,
    then subdivision (a)(3) extends the April 21 filing deadline
    forward to the next accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday
    or legal holiday - no earlier than Tuesday, April 22.
      Subdivision (c). To specify that a period should be calculated by
    counting all intermediate days, including weekends or holidays, the
    Rules formerly used the term "calendar days." Because new
    subdivision (a) takes a "days-are-days" approach under which all
    intermediate days are counted, no matter how short the period, "3
    calendar days" in subdivision (c) is amended to read simply "3
    days."
      Rule 26(c) has been amended to eliminate uncertainty about
    application of the 3-day rule. Civil Rule 6(e) was amended in 2004
    to eliminate similar uncertainty in the Civil Rules.
      Under the amendment, a party that is required or permitted to act
    within a prescribed period should first calculate that period,
    without reference to the 3-day rule provided by Rule 26(c), but
    with reference to the other time computation provisions of the
    Appellate Rules. After the party has identified the date on which
    the prescribed period would expire but for the operation of Rule
    26(c), the party should add 3 calendar days. The party must act by
    the third day of the extension, unless that day is a Saturday,
    Sunday, or legal holiday, in which case the party must act by the
    next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
      To illustrate: A paper is served by mail on Thursday, November 1,
    2007. The prescribed time to respond is 30 days. The prescribed
    period ends on Monday, December 3 (because the 30th day falls on a
    Saturday, the prescribed period extends to the following Monday).
    Under Rule 26(c), three calendar days are added - Tuesday,
    Wednesday, and Thursday - and thus the response is due on Thursday,
    December 6.

-HEAD-
    Rule 26.1. Corporate Disclosure Statement

-STATUTE-
      (a) Who Must File. Any nongovernmental corporate party to a
    proceeding in a court of appeals must file a statement that
    identifies any parent corporation and any publicly held corporation
    that owns 10% or more of its stock or states that there is no such
    corporation.
      (b) Time for Filing; Supplemental Filing. A party must file the
    Rule 26.1(a) statement with the principal brief or upon filing a
    motion, response, petition, or answer in the court of appeals,
    whichever occurs first, unless a local rule requires earlier
    filing. Even if the statement has already been filed, the party's
    principal brief must include the statement before the table of
    contents. A party must supplement its statement whenever the
    information that must be disclosed under Rule 26.1(a) changes.
      (c) Number of Copies. If the Rule 26.1(a) statement is filed
    before the principal brief, or if a supplemental statement is
    filed, the party must file an original and 3 copies unless the
    court requires a different number by local rule or by order in a
    particular case.

      The purpose of this rule is to assist judges in making a
    determination of whether they have any interests in any of a
    party's related corporate entities that would disqualify the judges
    from hearing the appeal. The committee believes that this rule
    represents minimum disclosure requirements. If a Court of Appeals
    wishes to require additional information, a court is free to do so
    by local rule. However, the committee requests the courts to
    consider the desirability of uniformity and the burden that varying
    circuit rules creates on attorneys who practice in many circuits.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment requires a party to file three copies of the
    disclosure statement whenever the statement is filed before the
    party's principal brief. Because the statement is included in each
    copy of the party's brief, there is no need to require the filing
    of additional copies at that time. A court of appeals may require
    the filing of a different number of copies by local rule or by
    order in a particular case.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only; a
    substantive change is made, however, in subdivision (a).
      Subdivison [sic] (a). The amendment deletes the requirement that
    a corporate party identify subsidiaries and affiliates that have
    issued shares to the public. Although several circuit rules require
    identification of such entities, the Committee believes that such
    disclosure is unnecessary.
      A disclosure statement assists a judge in ascertaining whether or
    not the judge has an interest that should cause the judge to recuse
    himself or herself from the case. Given that purpose, disclosure of
    entities that would not be adversely affected by a decision in the
    case is unnecessary.
      Disclosure of a party's parent corporation is necessary because a
    judgment against a subsidiary can negatively impact the parent. A
    judge who owns stock in the parent corporation, therefore, has an
    interest in litigation involving the subsidiary. The rule requires
    disclosure of all of a party's parent corporations meaning
    grandparent and great grandparent corporations as well. For
    example, if a party is a closely held corporation, the majority
    shareholder of which is a corporation formed by a publicly traded
    corporation for the purpose of acquiring and holding the shares of
    the party, the publicly traded grandparent corporation should be
    disclosed. Conversely, disclosure of a party's subsidiaries or
    affiliated corporations is ordinarily unnecessary. For example, if
    a party is a part owner of a corporation in which a judge owns
    stock, the possibility is quite remote that the judge might be
    biased by the fact that the judge and the litigant are co-owners of
    a corporation.
      The amendment, however, adds a requirement that the party lists
    all its stockholders that are publicly held companies owning 10% or
    more of the stock of the party. A judgment against a corporate
    party can adversely affect the value of the company's stock and,
    therefore, persons owning stock in the party have an interest in
    the outcome of the litigation. A judge owning stock in a corporate
    party ordinarily recuses himself or herself. The new requirement
    takes the analysis one step further and assumes that if a judge
    owns stock in a publicly held corporation which in turn owns 10% or
    more of the stock in the party, the judge may have sufficient
    interest in the litigation to require recusal. The 10% threshold
    ensures that the corporation in which the judge may own stock is
    itself sufficiently invested in the party that a judgment adverse
    to the party could have an adverse impact upon the investing
    corporation in which the judge may own stock. This requirement is
    modeled on the Seventh Circuit's disclosure requirement.
      Subdivision (b). The language requiring inclusion of the
    disclosure statement in a party's principal brief is moved to this
    subdivision because it deals with the time for filing the
    statement.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
       a. Alternative One [At its June 7-8, 2001, meeting, the
    Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure voted to reject
    Alternative One.]
      Subdivision (a). Rule 26.1(a) presently requires nongovernmental
    corporate parties to file a "corporate disclosure statement." In
    that statement, a nongovernmental corporate party is required to
    identify all of its parent corporations and all publicly held
    corporations that own 10% or more of its stock. The corporate
    disclosure statement is intended to assist judges in determining
    whether they must recuse themselves by reason of "a financial
    interest in the subject matter in controversy." Code of Judicial
    Conduct, Canon 3C(1)(c) (1972).
      Rule 26.1(a) has been amended to require that nongovernmental
    corporate parties who currently do not have to file a corporate
    disclosure statement - that is, nongovernmental corporate parties
    who do not have any parent corporations and at least 10% of whose
    stock is not owned by any publicly held corporation - inform the
    court of that fact. At present, when a corporate disclosure
    statement is not filed, courts do not know whether it has not been
    filed because there was nothing to report or because of ignorance
    of Rule 26.1(a).
      Rule 26.1(a) does not require the disclosure of all information
    that could conceivably be relevant to a judge who is trying to
    decide whether he or she has a "financial interest" in a case.
    Experience with divergent disclosure practices and improving
    technology may provide the foundation for more comprehensive
    disclosure requirements. The Judicial Conference, supported by the
    committees that work regularly with the Code of Judicial Conduct
    and by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, is in
    the best position to develop any additional requirements and to
    adjust those requirements as technology and other developments
    warrant. Thus, Rule 26.1(a) has been amended to authorize the
    Judicial Conference to promulgate more detailed financial
    disclosure requirements - requirements that might apply beyond
    nongovernmental corporate parties.
      As has been true in the past, Rule 26.1(a) does not forbid the
    promulgation of local rules that require disclosures in addition to
    those required by Rule 26.1(a) itself. However, along with the
    authority provided to the Judicial Conference to require additional
    disclosures is the authority to preempt any local rulemaking on the
    topic of financial disclosure.
      Subdivision (b). Rule 26.1(b) has been amended to require parties
    to file supplemental disclosure statements whenever there is a
    change in the information that Rule 26.1(a) requires the parties to
    disclose. For example, if a publicly held corporation acquires 10%
    or more of a party's stock after the party has filed its disclosure
    statement, the party should file a supplemental statement
    identifying that publicly held corporation.
      Subdivision (c). Rule 26.1(c) has been amended to provide that a
    party who is required to file a supplemental disclosure statement
    must file an original and 3 copies, unless a local rule or an order
    entered in a particular case provides otherwise.
       b. Alternative Two [At its June 7-8, 2001, meeting, the
    Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure voted to approve
    Alternative Two.]
      Subdivision (a). Rule 26.1(a) requires nongovernmental corporate
    parties to file a "corporate disclosure statement." In that
    statement, a nongovernmental corporate party is required to
    identify all of its parent corporations and all publicly held
    corporations that own 10% or more of its stock. The corporate
    disclosure statement is intended to assist judges in determining
    whether they must recuse themselves by reason of "a financial
    interest in the subject matter in controversy." Code of Judicial
    Conduct, Canon 3C(1)(c) (1972).
      Rule 26.1(a) has been amended to require that nongovernmental
    corporate parties who have not been required to file a corporate
    disclosure statement - that is, nongovernmental corporate parties
    who do not have any parent corporations and at least 10% of whose
    stock is not owned by any publicly held corporation - inform the
    court of that fact. At present, when a corporate disclosure
    statement is not filed, courts do not know whether it has not been
    filed because there was nothing to report or because of ignorance
    of Rule 26.1.
      Subdivision (b). Rule 26.1(b) has been amended to require parties
    to file supplemental disclosure statements whenever there is a
    change in the information that Rule 26.1(a) requires the parties to
    disclose. For example, if a publicly held corporation acquires 10%
    or more of a party's stock after the party has filed its disclosure
    statement, the party should file a supplemental statement
    identifying that publicly held corporation.
      Subdivision (c). Rule 26.1(c) has been amended to provide that a
    party who is required to file a supplemental disclosure statement
    must file an original and 3 copies, unless a local rule or an order
    entered in a particular case provides otherwise.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The Committee is
    submitting two versions of proposed Rule 26.1 for the consideration
    of the Standing Committee.
      The first version - "Alternative One" - is the same as the
    version that was published, except that the rule has been amended
    to refer to "any information that may be publicly designated by the
    Judicial Conference" instead of to "any information that may be
    required by the Judicial Conference." At its April meeting, the
    Committee gave unconditional approval to all of "Alternative One,"
    except the Judicial Conference provisions. The Committee
    conditioned its approval of the Judicial Conference provisions on
    the Standing Committee's assuring itself that lawyers would have
    ready access to any standards promulgated by the Judicial
    Conference and that the Judicial Conference provisions were
    consistent with the Rules Enabling Act.
      The second version - "Alternative Two" - is the same as the
    version that was published, except that the Judicial Conference
    provisions have been eliminated. The Civil Rules Committee met
    several days after the Appellate Rules Committee and joined the
    Bankruptcy Rules Committee in disapproving the Judicial Conference
    provisions. Given the decreasing likelihood that the Judicial
    Conference provisions will be approved by the Standing Committee, I
    asked Prof. Schiltz to draft, and the Appellate Rules Committee to
    approve, a version of Rule 26.1 that omitted those provisions.
    "Alternative Two" was circulated to and approved by the Committee
    in late April.
      I should note that, at its April meeting, the Appellate Rules
    Committee discussed the financial disclosure provision that was
    approved by the Bankruptcy Rules Committee. That provision defines
    the scope of the financial disclosure obligation much differently
    than the provisions approved by the Appellate, Civil, and Criminal
    Rules Committees, which are based on existing Rule 26.1. For
    example, the bankruptcy provision requires disclosure when a party
    "directly or indirectly" owns 10 percent or more of "any class" of
    a publicly or privately held corporation's "equity interests."
    Members of the Appellate Rules Committee expressed several concerns
    about the provision approved by the Bankruptcy Rules Committee,
    objecting both to its substance and to its ambiguity.

-EXPCITE-
    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
    TITLE VII. GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 27. Motions

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General.
        (1) Application for Relief. An application for an order or
      other relief is made by motion unless these rules prescribe
      another form. A motion must be in writing unless the court
      permits otherwise.
        (2) Contents of a Motion.
          (A) Grounds and Relief Sought. A motion must state with
        particularity the grounds for the motion, the relief sought,
        and the legal argument necessary to support it.
          (B) Accompanying Documents.
            (i) Any affidavit or other paper necessary to support a
          motion must be served and filed with the motion.
            (ii) An affidavit must contain only factual information,
          not legal argument.
            (iii) A motion seeking substantive relief must include a
          copy of the trial court's opinion or agency's decision as a
          separate exhibit.

          (C) Documents Barred or Not Required.
            (i) A separate brief supporting or responding to a motion
          must not be filed.
            (ii) A notice of motion is not required.
            (iii) A proposed order is not required.

        (3) Response.
          (A) Time to file. Any party may file a response to a motion;
        Rule 27(a)(2) governs its contents. The response must be filed
        within 10 days after service of the motion unless the court
        shortens or extends the time. A motion authorized by Rules 8,
        9, 18, or 41 may be granted before the 10-day period runs only
        if the court gives reasonable notice to the parties that it
        intends to act sooner.
          (B) Request for Affirmative Relief. A response may include a
        motion for affirmative relief. The time to respond to the new
        motion, and to reply to that response, are governed by Rule
        27(a)(3)(A) and (a)(4). The title of the response must alert
        the court to the request for relief.

        (4) Reply to Response. Any reply to a response must be filed
      within 7 days after service of the response. A reply must not
      present matters that do not relate to the response.

      (b) Disposition of a Motion for a Procedural Order. The court may
    act on a motion for a procedural order - including a motion under
    Rule 26(b) - at any time without awaiting a response, and may, by
    rule or by order in a particular case, authorize its clerk to act
    on specified types of procedural motions. A party adversely
    affected by the court's, or the clerk's, action may file a motion
    to reconsider, vacate, or modify that action. Timely opposition
    filed after the motion is granted in whole or in part does not
    constitute a request to reconsider, vacate, or modify the
    disposition; a motion requesting that relief must be filed.
      (c) Power of a Single Judge to Entertain a Motion. A circuit
    judge may act alone on any motion, but may not dismiss or otherwise
    determine an appeal or other proceeding. A court of appeals may
    provide by rule or by order in a particular case that only the
    court may act on any motion or class of motions. The court may
    review the action of a single judge.
      (d) Form of Papers; Page Limits; and Number of Copies.
        (1) Format.
          (A) Reproduction. A motion, response, or reply may be
        reproduced by any process that yields a clear black image on
        light paper. The paper must be opaque and unglazed. Only one
        side of the paper may be used.
          (B) Cover. A cover is not required, but there must be a
        caption that includes the case number, the name of the court,
        the title of the case, and a brief descriptive title indicating
        the purpose of the motion and identifying the party or parties
        for whom it is filed. If a cover is used, it must be white.
          (C) Binding. The document must be bound in any manner that is
        secure, does not obscure the text, and permits the document to
        lie reasonably flat when open.
          (D) Paper Size, Line Spacing, and Margins. The document must
        be on 8 1/2  by 11 inch paper. The text must be double-spaced,
        but quotations more than two lines long may be indented and
        single-spaced. Headings and footnotes may be single-spaced.
        Margins must be at least one inch on all four sides. Page
        numbers may be placed in the margins, but no text may appear
        there.
          (E) Typeface and Type Styles. The document must comply with
        the typeface requirements of Rule 32(a)(5) and the type-style
        requirements of Rule 32(a)(6).

        (2) Page Limits. A motion or a response to a motion must not
      exceed 20 pages, exclusive of the corporate disclosure statement
      and accompanying documents authorized by Rule 27(a)(2)(B), unless
      the court permits or directs otherwise. A reply to a response
      must not exceed 10 pages.
        (3) Number of Copies. An original and 3 copies must be filed
      unless the court requires a different number by local rule or by
      order in a particular case.

      (e) Oral Argument. A motion will be decided without oral argument
    unless the court orders otherwise.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      Subdivisions (a) and (b). Many motions seek relief of a sort
    which is ordinarily unopposed or which is granted as of course. The
    provision of subdivision (a) which permits any party to file a
    response in opposition to a motion within 7 days after its service
    upon him assumes that the motion is one of substance which ought
    not be acted upon without affording affected parties an opportunity
    to reply. A motion to dismiss or otherwise determine an appeal is
    clearly such a motion. Motions authorized by Rules 8, 9, 18 and 41
    are likewise motions of substance; but in the nature of the relief
    sought, to afford an adversary an automatic delay of at least 7
    days is undesirable, thus such motions may be acted upon after
    notice which is reasonable under the circumstances.
      The term "motions for procedural orders" is used in subdivision
    (b) to describe motions which do not substantially affect the
    rights of the parties or the ultimate disposition of the appeal. To
    prevent delay in the disposition of such motions, subdivision (b)
    provides that they may be acted upon immediately without awaiting a
    response, subject to the right of any party who is adversely
    affected by the action to seek reconsideration.
      Subdivision (c). Within the general consideration of procedure on
    motions is the problem of the power of a single circuit judge.
    Certain powers are granted to a single judge of a court of appeals
    by statute. Thus, under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2101(f) a single judge may
    stay execution and enforcement of a judgment to enable a party
    aggrieved to obtain certiorari; under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2251 a judge
    before whom a habeas corpus proceeding involving a person detained
    by state authority is pending may stay any proceeding against the
    person; under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2253 a single judge may issue a
    certificate of probable cause. In addition, certain of these rules
    expressly grant power to a single judge. See Rules 8, 9 and 18.
      This subdivision empowers a single circuit judge to act upon
    virtually all requests for intermediate relief which may be made
    during the course of an appeal or other proceeding. By its terms he
    may entertain and act upon any motion other than a motion to
    dismiss or otherwise determine an appeal or other proceeding. But
    the relief sought must be "relief which under these rules may
    properly be sought by motion."
      Examples of the power conferred on a single judge by this
    subdivision are: to extend the time for transmitting the record or
    docketing the appeal (Rules 11 and 12); to permit intervention in
    agency cases (Rule 15), or substitution in any case (Rule 43); to
    permit an appeal in forma pauperis (Rule 24); to enlarge any time
    period fixed by the rules other than that for initiating a
    proceeding in the court of appeals (Rule 26(b)); to permit the
    filing of a brief by amicus curiae (Rule 29); to authorize the
    filing of a deferred appendix (Rule 30(c)), or dispense with the
    requirement of an appendix in a specific case (Rule 30(f)), or
    permit carbon copies of briefs or appendices to be used (Rule
    32(a)); to permit the filing of additional briefs (Rule 28(c)), or
    the filing of briefs of extraordinary length (Rule 28(g)); to
    postpone oral argument (Rule 34(a)), or grant additional time
    therefor (Rule 34(b)).
      Certain rules require that application for the relief or orders
    which they authorize be made by petition. Since relief under those
    rules may not properly be sought by motion, a single judge may not
    entertain requests for such relief. Thus a single judge may not act
    upon requests for permission to appeal (see Rules 5 and 6); or for
    mandamus or other extraordinary writs (see Rule 21), other than for
    stays or injunctions pendente lite, authority to grant which is
    "expressly conferred by these rules" on a single judge under
    certain circumstances (see Rules 8 and 18); or upon petitions for
    rehearing (see Rule 40).
      A court of appeals may by order or rule abridge the power of a
    single judge if it is of the view that a motion or a class of
    motions should be disposed of by a panel. Exercise of any power
    granted a single judge is discretionary with the judge. The final
    sentence in this subdivision makes the disposition of any matter by
    a single judge subject to review by the court.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1979 AMENDMENT       
      The proposed amendment would give sanction to local rules in a
    number of circuits permitting the clerk to dispose of specified
    types of procedural motions.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1989 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (d). The amendment makes it clear that a court may
    require a different number of copies either by rule or by order in
    an individual case. The number of copies of any document that a
    court of appeals needs varies depending upon the way in which the
    court conducts business. The internal operation of the courts of
    appeals necessarily varies from circuit to circuit because of
    differences in the number of judges, the geographic area included
    within the circuit, and other such factors. Uniformity could be
    achieved only by setting the number of copies artificially high so
    that parties in all circuits file enough copies to satisfy the
    needs of the court requiring the greatest number. Rather than do
    that, the Committee decided to make it clear that local rules may
    require a greater or lesser number of copies and that, if the
    circumstances of a particular case indicate the need for a
    different number of copies in that case, the court may so order.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      In addition to amending Rule 27 to conform to uniform drafting
    standards, several substantive amendments are made. The Advisory
    Committee had been working on substantive amendments to Rule 27
    just prior to completion of this larger project.
      Subdivision (a). Paragraph (1) retains the language of the
    existing rule indicating that an application for an order or other
    relief is made by filing a motion unless another form is required
    by some other provision in the rules.
      Paragraph (1) also states that a motion must be in writing unless
    the court permits otherwise. The writing requirement has been
    implicit in the rule; the Advisory Committee decided to make it
    explicit. There are, however, instances in which a court may permit
    oral motions. Perhaps the most common such instance would be a
    motion made during oral argument in the presence of opposing
    counsel; for example, a request for permission to submit a
    supplemental brief on an issue raised by the court for the first
    time at oral argument. Rather than limit oral motions to those made
    during oral argument or, conversely, assume the propriety of making
    even extremely complex motions orally during argument, the Advisory
    Committee decided that it is better to leave the determination of
    the propriety of an oral motion to the court's discretion. The
    provision does not disturb the practice in those circuits that
    permit certain procedural motions, such as a motion for extension
    of time for filing a brief, to be made by telephone and ruled upon
    by the clerk.
      Paragraph (2) outlines the contents of a motion. It begins with
    the general requirement from the current rule that a motion must
    state with particularity the grounds supporting it and the relief
    requested. It adds a requirement that all legal arguments should be
    presented in the body of the motion; a separate brief or memorandum
    supporting or responding to a motion must not be filed. The Supreme
    Court uses this single document approach. Sup. Ct. R. 21.1. In
    furtherance of the requirement that all legal argument must be
    contained in the body of the motion, paragraph (2) also states that
    an affidavit that is attached to a motion should contain only
    factual information and not legal argument.
      Paragraph (2) further states that whenever a motion requests
    substantive relief, a copy of the trial court's opinion or agency's
    decision must be attached.
      Although it is common to present a district court with a proposed
    order along with the motion requesting relief, that is not the
    practice in the courts of appeals. A proposed order is not required
    and is not expected or desired. Nor is a notice of motion required.
      Paragraph (3) retains the provisions of the current rule
    concerning the filing of a response to a motion except that the
    time for responding has been expanded to 10 days rather than 7
    days. Because the time periods in the rule apply to a substantive
    motion as well as a procedural motion, the longer time period may
    help reduce the number of motions for extension of time, or at
    least provide a more realistic time frame within which to make and
    dispose of such a motion.
      A party filing a response in opposition to a motion may also
    request affirmative relief. It is the Advisory Committee's judgment
    that it is permissible to combine the response and the new motion
    in the same document. Indeed, because there may be substantial
    overlap of arguments in the response and in the request for
    affirmative relief, a combined document may be preferable. If a
    request for relief is combined with a response, the caption of the
    document must alert the court to the request for relief. The time
    for a response to such a new request and for reply to that response
    are governed by the general rules regulating responses and replies.
      Paragraph (4) is new. Two circuits currently have rules
    authorizing a reply. As a general matter, a reply should not
    reargue propositions presented in the motion or present matters
    that do not relate to the response. Sometimes matters relevant to
    the motion arise after the motion is filed; treatment of such
    matters in the reply is appropriate even though strictly speaking
    it may not relate to the response.
      Subdivision (b). The material in this subdivision remains
    substantively unchanged except to clarify that one may file a
    motion for reconsideration, etc., of a disposition by either the
    court or the clerk. A new sentence is added indicating that if a
    motion is granted in whole or in part before the filing of timely
    opposition to the motion, the filing of the opposition is not
    treated as a request for reconsideration, etc. A party wishing to
    have the court reconsider, vacate, or modify the disposition must
    file a new motion that addresses the order granting the motion.
      Although the rule does not require a court to do so, it would be
    helpful if, whenever a motion is disposed of before receipt of any
    response from the opposing party, the ruling indicates that it was
    issued without awaiting a response. Such a statement will aid the
    opposing party in deciding whether to request reconsideration. The
    opposing party may have mailed a response about the time of the
    ruling and be uncertain whether the court has considered it.
      Subdivision (c). The changes in this subdivision are stylistic
    only. No substantive changes are intended.
      Subdivision (d). This subdivision has been substantially revised.
      The format requirements have been moved from Rule 32(b) to
    paragraph (1) of this subdivision. No cover is required, but a
    caption is needed as well as a descriptive title indicating the
    purpose of the motion and identifying the party or parties for whom
    it is filed. Spiral binding or secure stapling at the upper left-
    hand corner satisfies the binding requirement. But they are not
    intended to be the exclusive methods of binding.
      Paragraph (2) establishes page limits; twenty pages for a motion
    or a response, and ten pages for a reply. Three circuits have
    established page limits by local rule. This rule does not establish
    special page limits for those instances in which a party combines a
    response to a motion with a new request for affirmative relief.
    Because a combined document most often will be used when there is
    substantial overlap in the argument in opposition to the motion and
    in the argument for the affirmative relief, twenty pages may be
    sufficient in most instances. If it is not, the party may request
    additional pages. If ten pages is insufficient for the original
    movant to both reply to the response, and respond to the new
    request for affirmative relief, two separate documents may be used
    or a request for additional pages may be made.
      The changes in paragraph (4) are stylistic only. No substantive
    changes are intended.
      Subdivision (e). This new provision makes it clear that there is
    no right to oral argument on a motion. Seven circuits have local
    rules stating that oral argument of motions will not be held unless
    the court orders it.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a)(3)(A). Subdivision (a)(3)(A) presently requires
    that a response to a motion be filed within 10 days after service
    of the motion. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays
    are counted in computing that 10-day deadline, which means that,
    except when the 10-day deadline ends on a weekend or legal holiday,
    parties generally must respond to motions within 10 actual days.
      Fed. R. App. P. 26(a)(2) has been amended to provide that, in
    computing any period of time, a litigant should "[e]xclude
    intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays when the period
    is less than 11 days, unless stated in calendar days." This change
    in the method of computing deadlines means that 10-day deadlines
    (such as that in subdivision (a)(3)(A)) have been lengthened as a
    practical matter. Under the new computation method, parties would
    never have less than 14 actual days to respond to motions, and
    legal holidays could extend that period to as much as 18 days.
      Permitting parties to take two weeks or more to respond to
    motions would introduce significant and unwarranted delay into
    appellate proceedings. For that reason, the 10-day deadline in
    subdivision (a)(3)(A) has been reduced to 8 days. This change will,
    as a practical matter, ensure that every party will have at least
    10 actual days - but, in the absence of a legal holiday, no more
    than 12 actual days - to respond to motions. The court continues to
    have discretion to shorten or extend that time in appropriate
    cases.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. In response to the
    objections of commentators, the time to respond to a motion was
    increased from the proposed 7 days to 8 days. No other changes were
    made to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee
    Note.
      Subdivision (a)(4). Subdivision (a)(4) presently requires that a
    reply to a response to a motion be filed within 7 days after
    service of the response. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
    holidays are counted in computing that 7-day deadline, which means
    that, except when the 7-day deadline ends on a weekend or legal
    holiday, parties generally must reply to responses to motions
    within one week.
      Fed. R. App. P. 26(a)(2) has been amended to provide that, in
    computing any period of time, a litigant should "[e]xclude
    intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays when the period
    is less than 11 days, unless stated in calendar days." This change
    in the method of computing deadlines means that 7-day deadlines
    (such as that in subdivision (a)(4)) have been lengthened as a
    practical matter. Under the new computation method, parties would
    never have less than 9 actual days to reply to responses to
    motions, and legal holidays could extend that period to as much as
    13 days.
      Permitting parties to take 9 or more days to reply to a response
    to a motion would introduce significant and unwarranted delay into
    appellate proceedings. For that reason, the 7-day deadline in
    subdivision (a)(4) has been reduced to 5 days. This change will, as
    a practical matter, ensure that every party will have 7 actual days
    to file replies to responses to motions (in the absence of a legal
    holiday).
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.
      Subdivision (d)(1)(B). A cover is not required on motions,
    responses to motions, or replies to responses to motions. However,
    Rule 27(d)(1)(B) has been amended to provide that if a cover is
    nevertheless used on such a paper, the cover must be white. The
    amendment is intended to promote uniformity in federal appellate
    practice.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (d)(1)(E). A new subdivision (E) has been added to
    Rule 27(d)(1) to provide that a motion, a response to a motion, and
    a reply to a response to a motion must comply with the typeface
    requirements of Rule 32(a)(5) and the type-style requirements of
    Rule 32(a)(6). The purpose of the amendment is to promote
    uniformity in federal appellate practice and to prevent the abuses
    that might occur if no restrictions were placed on the size of
    typeface used in motion papers.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a)(3)(A). Subdivision (a)(3)(A) formerly required
    that a response to a motion be filed "within 8 days after service
    of the motion unless the court shortens or extends the time." Prior
    to the 2002 amendments to Rule 27, subdivision (a)(3)(A) set this
    period at 10 days rather than 8 days. The period was changed in
    2002 to reflect the change from a time-computation approach that
    counted intermediate weekends and holidays to an approach that did
    not.(Prior to the 2002 amendments, intermediate weekends and
    holidays were excluded only if the period was less than 7 days;
    after those amendments, such days were excluded if the period was
    less than 11 days.) Under current Rule 26(a), intermediate weekends
    and holidays are counted for all periods. Accordingly, revised
    subdivision (a)(3)(A) once again sets the period at 10 days.
      Subdivision (a)(4). Subdivision (a)(4) formerly required that a
    reply to a response be filed "within 5 days after service of the
    response." Prior to the 2002 amendments, this period was set at 7
    days; in 2002 it was shortened in the light of the 2002 change in
    time-computation approach (discussed above). Under current Rule
    26(a), intermediate weekends and holidays are counted for all
    periods, and revised subdivision (a)(4) once again sets the period
    at 7 days.

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
    TITLE VII. GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 28. Briefs

-STATUTE-
      (a) Appellant's Brief. The appellant's brief must contain, under
    appropriate headings and in the order indicated:
        (1) a corporate disclosure statement if required by Rule 26.1;
        (2) a table of contents, with page references;
        (3) a table of authorities - cases (alphabetically arranged),
      statutes, and other authorities - with references to the pages of
      the brief where they are cited;
        (4) a jurisdictional statement, including:
          (A) the basis for the district court's or agency's subject-
        matter jurisdiction, with citations to applicable statutory
        provisions and stating relevant facts establishing
        jurisdiction;
          (B) the basis for the court of appeals' jurisdiction, with
        citations to applicable statutory provisions and stating
        relevant facts establishing jurisdiction;
          (C) the filing dates establishing the timeliness of the
        appeal or petition for review; and
          (D) an assertion that the appeal is from a final order or
        judgment that disposes of all parties' claims, or information
        establishing the court of appeals' jurisdiction on some other
        basis;

        (5) a statement of the issues presented for review;
        (6) a statement of the case briefly indicating the nature of
      the case, the course of proceedings, and the disposition below;
        (7) a statement of facts relevant to the issues submitted for
      review with appropriate references to the record (see Rule
      28(e));
        (8) a summary of the argument, which must contain a succinct,
      clear, and accurate statement of the arguments made in the body
      of the brief, and which must not merely repeat the argument
      headings;
        (9) the argument, which must contain:
          (A) appellant's contentions and the reasons for them, with
        citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which
        the appellant relies; and
          (B) for each issue, a concise statement of the applicable
        standard of review (which may appear in the discussion of the
        issue or under a separate heading placed before the discussion
        of the issues);

        (10) a short conclusion stating the precise relief sought; and
        (11) the certificate of compliance, if required by Rule
      32(a)(7).

      (b) Appellee's Brief. The appellee's brief must conform to the
    requirements of Rule 28(a)(1)-(9) and (11), except that none of the
    following need appear unless the appellee is dissatisfied with the
    appellant's statement:
        (1) the jurisdictional statement;
        (2) the statement of the issues;
        (3) the statement of the case;
        (4) the statement of the facts; and
        (5) the statement of the standard of review.

      (c) Reply Brief. The appellant may file a brief in reply to the
    appellee's brief. Unless the court permits, no further briefs may
    be filed. A reply brief must contain a table of contents, with page
    references, and a table of authorities - cases (alphabetically
    arranged), statutes, and other authorities - with references to the
    pages of the reply brief where they are cited.
      (d) References to Parties. In briefs and at oral argument,
    counsel should minimize use of the terms "appellant" and
    "appellee." To make briefs clear, counsel should use the parties'
    actual names or the designations used in the lower court or agency
    proceeding, or such descriptive terms as "the employee," "the
    injured person," "the taxpayer," "the ship," "the stevedore."
      (e) References to the Record. References to the parts of the
    record contained in the appendix filed with the appellant's brief
    must be to the pages of the appendix. If the appendix is prepared
    after the briefs are filed, a party referring to the record must
    follow one of the methods detailed in Rule 30(c). If the original
    record is used under Rule 30(f) and is not consecutively paginated,
    or if the brief refers to an unreproduced part of the record, any
    reference must be to the page of the original document. For
    example:
        -- Answer p. 7;
        -- Motion for Judgment p. 2;
        -- Transcript p. 231.

    Only clear abbreviations may be used. A party referring to evidence
    whose admissibility is in controversy must cite the pages of the
    appendix or of the transcript at which the evidence was identified,
    offered, and received or rejected.
      (f) Reproduction of Statutes, Rules, Regulations, etc. If the
    court's determination of the issues presented requires the study of
    statutes, rules, regulations, etc., the relevant parts must be set
    out in the brief or in an addendum at the end, or may be supplied
    to the court in pamphlet form.
      (g) [Reserved]
      (h) [Reserved]
      (i) Briefs in a Case Involving Multiple Appellants or Appellees.
    In a case involving more than one appellant or appellee, including
    consolidated cases, any number of appellants or appellees may join
    in a brief, and any party may adopt by reference a part of
    another's brief. Parties may also join in reply briefs.
      (j) Citation of Supplemental Authorities. If pertinent and
    significant authorities come to a party's attention after the
    party's brief has been filed - or after oral argument but before
    decision - a party may promptly advise the circuit clerk by letter,
    with a copy to all other parties, setting forth the citations. The
    letter must state the reasons for the supplemental citations,
    referring either to the page of the brief or to a point argued
    orally. The body of the letter must not exceed 350 words. Any
    response must be made promptly and must be similarly limited.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      This rule is based upon Supreme Court Rule 40. For variations in
    present circuit rules on briefs see 2d Cir. Rule 17, 3d Cir. Rule
    24, 5th Cir. Rule 24, and 7th Cir. Rule 17. All circuits now limit
    the number of pages of briefs, a majority limiting the brief to 50
    pages of standard typographic printing. Fifty pages of standard
    typographic printing is the approximate equivalent of 70 pages of
    typewritten text, given the page sizes required by Rule 32 and the
    requirement set out there that text produced by a method other than
    standard typographic must be double spaced.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1979 AMENDMENT       
      The proposed amendment eliminates the distinction appearing in
    the present rule between the permissible length in pages of printed
    and typewritten briefs, investigation of the matter having
    disclosed that the number of words on the printed page is little if
    any larger than the number on a page typed in standard elite type.
      The provision is made subject to local rule to permit the court
    of appeals to require that typewritten briefs be typed in larger
    type and permit a correspondingly larger number of pages.
      Subdivision (j). Proposed new Rule 28(j) makes provision for
    calling the court's attention to authorities that come to the
    party's attention after the brief has been filed. It is patterned
    after the practice under local rule in some of the circuits.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1986 AMENDMENT       
      While Rule 28(g) can be read as requiring that tables of
    authorities be included in a reply brief, such tables are often not
    included. Their absence impedes efficient use of the reply brief to
    ascertain the appellant's response to a particular argument of the
    appellee or to the appellee's use of a particular authority. The
    amendment to Rule 28(c) is intended to make it clear that such
    tables are required in reply briefs.
      The amendment to Rule 28(j) is technical. No substantive change
    is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1989 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment provides that the corporate disclosure statement
    required by new rule 26.1 shall be treated similarly to tables of
    contents and tables of citations and shall not be counted for
    purposes of the number of pages allowed in a brief.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The amendment adds a new subparagraph (2) that
    requires an appellant to include a specific jurisdictional
    statement in the appellant's brief to aid the court of appeals in
    determining whether it has both federal subject matter and
    appellate jurisdiction.
      Subdivision (b). The amendment requires the appellee to include a
    jurisdictional statement in the appellee's brief except that the
    appellee need not include the statement if the appellee is
    satisfied with the appellant's jurisdictional statement.
      Subdivision (h). The amendment provides that when more than one
    party appeals from a judgment or order, the party filing the first
    appeal is normally treated as the appellant for purposes of this
    rule and Rules 30 and 31. The party who first files an appeal
    usually is the principal appellant and should be treated as such.
    Parties who file a notice of appeal after the first notice often
    bring protective appeals and they should be treated as cross
    appellants. Local rules in the Fourth and Federal Circuits now take
    that approach. If notices of appeal are filed on the same day, the
    rule follows the old approach of treating the plaintiff below as
    the appellant. For purposes of this rule, in criminal cases "the
    plaintiff" means the United States. In those instances where the
    designations provided by the rule are inappropriate, they may be
    altered by agreement of the parties or by an order of the court.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Note to paragraph (a)(5). The amendment requires an appellant's
    brief to state the standard of review applicable to each issue on
    appeal. Five circuits currently require these statements.
    Experience in those circuits indicates that requiring a statement
    of the standard of review generally results in arguments that are
    properly shaped in light of the standard.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The amendment adds a requirement that an
    appellant's brief contain a summary of the argument. A number of
    circuits have local rules requiring a summary and the courts report
    that they find the summary useful. See, D.C. Cir. R. 11(a)(5); 5th
    Cir. R. 28.2.2; 8th Cir. R. 28A(i)(6); 11th Cir. R. 28-2(i); and
    Fed. Cir. R. 28.
      Subdivision (b). The amendment adds a requirement that an
    appellee's brief contain a summary of the argument.
      Subdivision (g). The amendment adds proof of service to the list
    of items in a brief that do not count for purposes of the page
    limitation. The concurrent amendment to Rule 25(d) requires a
    certificate of service to list the addresses to which a paper was
    mailed or at which it was delivered. When a number of parties must
    be served, the listing of addresses may run to several pages and
    those pages should not count for purposes of the page limitation.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In additional to changes made to
    improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed
    language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the
    appellate rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Several substantive changes are made in this rule, however. Most
    of them are necessary to conform Rule 28 with changes recommended
    in Rule 32.
      Subdivision (a). The current rule requires a brief to include a
    statement of the case which includes a description of the nature of
    the case, the course of proceedings, the disposition of the case -
    all of which might be described as the procedural history - as well
    as a statement of the facts. The amendments separate this into two
    statements: one procedural, called the statement of the case; and
    one factual, called the statement of the facts. The Advisory
    Committee believes that the separation will be helpful to the
    judges. The table of contents and table of authorities have also
    been separated into two distinct items.
      An additional amendment of subdivision (a) is made to conform it
    with an amendment being made to Rule 32. Rule 32(a)(7) generally
    requires a brief to include a certificate of compliance with type-
    volume limitations contained in that rule. (No certificate is
    required if a brief does not exceed 30 pages, or 15 pages for a
    reply brief.) Rule 28(a) is amended to include that certificate in
    the list of items that must be included in a brief whenever it is
    required by Rule 32.
      Subdivision (g). The amendments delete subdivision (g) that
    limited a principal brief to 50 pages and a reply brief to 25
    pages. The length limitations have been moved to Rule 32. Rule 32
    deals generally with the format for a brief or appendix.
      Subdivision (h). The amendment requires an appellee's brief to
    comply with Rule 28(a)(1) through (11) with regard to a cross-
    appeal. The addition of separate paragraphs requiring a corporate
    disclosure statement, table of authorities, statement of facts, and
    certificate of compliance increased the relevant paragraphs of
    subdivision (a) from (7) to (11). The other changes are stylistic;
    no substantive changes are intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (j). In the past, Rule 28(j) has required parties to
    describe supplemental authorities "without argument." Enforcement
    of this restriction has been lax, in part because of the difficulty
    of distinguishing "state[ment] . . . [of] the reasons for the
    supplemental citations," which is required, from "argument" about
    the supplemental citations, which is forbidden.
      As amended, Rule 28(j) continues to require parties to state the
    reasons for supplemental citations, with reference to the part of a
    brief or oral argument to which the supplemental citations pertain.
    But Rule 28(j) no longer forbids "argument." Rather, Rule 28(j)
    permits parties to decide for themselves what they wish to say
    about supplemental authorities. The only restriction upon parties
    is that the body of a Rule 28(j) letter - that is, the part of the
    letter that begins with the first word after the salutation and
    ends with the last word before the complimentary close - cannot
    exceed 350 words. All words found in footnotes will count toward
    the 350-word limit.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note,
    except that the word limit was increased from 250 to 350 in
    response to the complaint of some commentators that parties would
    have difficulty bringing multiple supplemental authorities to the
    attention of the court in one 250-word letter.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) has been amended to delete a
    sentence that authorized an appellee who had cross-appealed to file
    a brief in reply to the appellant's response. All rules regarding
    briefing in cases involving cross-appeals have been consolidated
    into new Rule 28.1.
      Subdivision (h). Subdivision (h) - regarding briefing in cases
    involving cross-appeals - has been deleted. All rules regarding
    such briefing have been consolidated into new Rule 28.1.

    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
    TITLE VII. GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 28.1. Cross-Appeals

-STATUTE-
      (a) Applicability. This rule applies to a case in which a cross-
    appeal is filed. Rules 28(a)-(c), 31(a)(1), 32(a)(2), and
    32(a)(7)(A)-(B) do not apply to such a case, except as otherwise
    provided in this rule.
      (b) Designation of Appellant. The party who files a notice of
    appeal first is the appellant for the purposes of this rule and
    Rules 30 and 34. If notices are filed on the same day, the
    plaintiff in the proceeding below is the appellant. These
    designations may be modified by the parties' agreement or by court
    order.
      (c) Briefs. In a case involving a cross-appeal:
        (1) Appellant's Principal Brief. The appellant must file a
      principal brief in the appeal. That brief must comply with Rule
      28(a).
        (2) Appellee's Principal and Response Brief. The appellee must
      file a principal brief in the cross-appeal and must, in the same
      brief, respond to the principal brief in the appeal. That
      appellee's brief must comply with Rule 28(a), except that the
      brief need not include a statement of the case or a statement of
      the facts unless the appellee is dissatisfied with the
      appellant's statement.
        (3) Appellant's Response and Reply Brief. The appellant must
      file a brief that responds to the principal brief in the cross-
      appeal and may, in the same brief, reply to the response in the
      appeal. That brief must comply with Rule 28(a)(2)-(9) and (11),
      except that none of the following need appear unless the
      appellant is dissatisfied with the appellee's statement in the
      cross-appeal:

          (B) the statement of the issues;
          (C) the statement of the case;
          (D) the statement of the facts; and
          (E) the statement of the standard of review.

        (4) Appellee's Reply Brief. The appellee may file a brief in
      reply to the response in the cross-appeal. That brief must comply
      with Rule 28(a)(2)-(3) and (11) and must be limited to the issues
      presented by the cross-appeal.
        (5) No Further Briefs. Unless the court permits, no further
      briefs may be filed in a case involving a cross-appeal.

      (d) Cover. Except for filings by unrepresented parties, the cover

    principal and response brief, red; the appellant's response and
    reply brief, yellow; the appellee's reply brief, gray; an
    intervenor's or amicus curiae's brief, green; and any supplemental
    brief, tan. The front cover of a brief must contain the information
    required by Rule 32(a)(2).
      (e) Length.
        (1) Page Limitation. Unless it complies with Rule 28.1(e)(2)
      and (3), the appellant's principal brief must not exceed 30
      pages; the appellee's principal and response brief, 35 pages; the
      appellant's response and reply brief, 30 pages; and the
      appellee's reply brief, 15 pages.
        (2) Type-Volume Limitation.
          (A) The appellant's principal brief or the appellant's
        response and reply brief is acceptable if:
            (i) it contains no more than 14,000 words; or

          1,300 lines of text.

          (B) The appellee's principal and response brief is acceptable
        if:
            (i) it contains no more than 16,500 words; or
            (ii) it uses a monospaced face and contains no more than
          1,500 lines of text.

          (C) The appellee's reply brief is acceptable if it contains
        no more than half of the type volume specified in Rule
        28.1(e)(2)(A).

        (3) Certificate of Compliance. A brief submitted under Rule
      28.1(e)(2) must comply with Rule 32(a)(7)(C).

      (f) Time to Serve and File a Brief. Briefs must be served and
    filed as follows:

      record is filed;
        (2) the appellee's principal and response brief, within 30 days
      after the appellant's principal brief is served;
        (3) the appellant's response and reply brief, within 30 days
      after the appellee's principal and response brief is served; and
        (4) the appellee's reply brief, within 14 days after the
      appellant's response and reply brief is served, but at least 7
      days before argument unless the court, for good cause, allows a
      later filing.

                      COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005                  
      The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure have said very little
    about briefing in cases involving cross-appeals. This vacuum has
    frustrated judges, attorneys, and parties who have sought guidance
    in the rules. More importantly, this vacuum has been filled by
    conflicting local rules regarding such matters as the number and
    length of briefs, the colors of the covers of briefs, and the
    deadlines for serving and filing briefs. These local rules have
    created a hardship for attorneys who practice in more than one
    circuit.
      New Rule 28.1 provides a comprehensive set of rules governing
    briefing in cases involving cross-appeals. The few existing
    provisions regarding briefing in such cases have been moved into
    new Rule 28.1, and several new provisions have been added to fill
    the gaps in the existing rules. The new provisions reflect the
    practices of the large majority of circuits and, to a significant
    extent, the new provisions have been patterned after the
    requirements imposed by Rules 28, 31, and 32 on briefs filed in
    cases that do not involve cross-appeals.
      Subdivision (a). Subdivision (a) makes clear that, in a case
    involving a cross-appeal, briefing is governed by new Rule 28.1,
    and not by Rules 28(a), 28(b), 28(c), 31(a)(1), 32(a)(2),
    32(a)(7)(A), and 32(a)(7)(B), except to the extent that Rule 28.1
    specifically incorporates those rules by reference.
      Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b) defines who is the "appellant"
    and who is the "appellee" in a case involving a cross-appeal.
    Subdivision (b) is taken directly from former Rule 28(h), except
    that subdivision (b) refers to a party being designated as an
    appellant "for the purposes of this rule and Rules 30 and 34,"
    whereas former Rule 28(h) also referred to Rule 31. Because the
    matter addressed by Rule 31(a)(1) - the time to serve and file
    briefs - is now addressed directly in new Rule 28.1(f), the cross-
    reference to Rule 31 is no longer necessary. In Rule 31 and in all
    rules other than Rules 28.1, 30, and 34, references to an
    "appellant" refer both to the appellant in an appeal and to the
    cross-appellant in a cross-appeal, and references to an "appellee"
    refer both to the appellee in an appeal and to the cross-appellee
    in a cross-appeal. Cf. Rule 31(c).
      Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) provides for the filing of four
    briefs in a case involving a cross-appeal. This reflects the
    practice of every circuit except the Seventh. See 7th Cir. R.
    28(d)(1)(a).
      The first brief is the "appellant's principal brief." That brief -
     like the appellant's principal brief in a case that does not
    involve a cross-appeal - must comply with Rule 28(a).
      The second brief is the "appellee's principal and response
    brief." Because this brief serves as the appellee's principal brief
    on the merits of the cross-appeal, as well as the appellee's
    response brief on the merits of the appeal, it must also comply
    with Rule 28(a), with the limited exceptions noted in the text of
    the rule.
      The third brief is the "appellant's response and reply brief."
    Like a response brief in a case that does not involve a cross-
    appeal - that is, a response brief that does not also serve as a
    principal brief on the merits of a cross-appeal - the appellant's
    response and reply brief must comply with Rule 28(a)(2)-(9) and
    (11), with the exceptions noted in the text of the rule. See Rule
    28(b). The one difference between the appellant's response and
    reply brief, on the one hand, and a response brief filed in a case
    that does not involve a cross-appeal, on the other, is that the
    latter must include a corporate disclosure statement. See Rule
    28(a)(1) and (b). An appellant filing a response and reply brief in
    a case involving a cross-appeal has already filed a corporate
    disclosure statement with its principal brief on the merits of the
    appeal.
      The fourth brief is the "appellee's reply brief." Like a reply
    brief in a case that does not involve a cross-appeal, it must
    comply with Rule 28(c), which essentially restates the requirements
    of Rule 28(a)(2)-(3) and (11). (Rather than restating the
    requirements of Rule 28(a)(2)-(3) and (11), as Rule 28(c) does,
    Rule 28.1(c)(4) includes a direct cross-reference.) The appellee's
    reply brief must also be limited to the issues presented by the
    cross-appeal.
      Subdivision (d). Subdivision (d) specifies the colors of the
    covers on briefs filed in a case involving a cross-appeal. It is
    patterned after Rule 32(a)(2), which does not specifically refer to
    cross-appeals.
      Subdivision (e). Subdivision (e) sets forth limits on the length
    of the briefs filed in a case involving a cross-appeal. It is
    patterned after Rule 32(a)(7), which does not specifically refer to
    cross-appeals. Subdivision (e) permits the appellee's principal and
    response brief to be longer than a typical principal brief on the
    merits because this brief serves not only as the principal brief on
    the merits of the cross-appeal, but also as the response brief on
    the merits of the appeal. Likewise, subdivision (e) permits the
    appellant's response and reply brief to be longer than a typical
    reply brief because this brief serves not only as the reply brief
    in the appeal, but also as the response brief in the cross-appeal.
    For purposes of determining the maximum length of an amicus
    curiae's brief filed in a case involving a cross-appeal, Rule
    29(d)'s reference to "the maximum length authorized by these rules
    for a party's principal brief" should be understood to refer to
    subdivision (e)'s limitations on the length of an appellant's
    principal brief.
      Subdivision (f). Subdivision (f) provides deadlines for serving
    and filing briefs in a cross-appeal. It is patterned after Rule
    31(a)(1), which does not specifically refer to cross-appeals.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The Committee
    adopted the recommendation of the Style Subcommittee that the text
    of Rule 28.1 be changed in a few minor respects to improve clarity.
    (That recommendation is described below.) The Committee also
    adopted three suggestions made by the Department of Justice: (1) A
    sentence was added to the Committee Note to Rule 28.1(b) to clarify
    that the term "appellant" (and "appellee") as used by rules other
    than Rules 28.1, 30, and 34, refers to both the appellant in an
    appeal and the cross-appellant in a cross-appeal (and to both the
    appellee in an appeal and the cross-appellee in a cross-appeal).
    (2) Rule 28.1(d) was amended to prescribe cover colors for
    supplemental briefs and briefs filed by an intervenor or amicus
    curiae. (3) A few words were added to the Committee Note to Rule
    28.1(e) to clarify the length of an amicus curiae's brief.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (f)(4). Subdivision (f)(4) formerly required that the
    appellee's reply brief be served "at least 3 days before argument
    unless the court, for good cause, allows a later filing." Under
    former Rule 26(a), "3 days" could mean as many as 5 or even 6 days.
    See the Note to Rule 26. Under revised Rule 26(a), intermediate
    weekends and holidays are counted. Changing "3 days" to "7 days"
    alters the period accordingly. Under revised Rule 26(a), when a
    period ends on a weekend or holiday, one must continue to count in
    the same direction until the next day that is not a weekend or
    holiday; the choice of the 7-day period for subdivision (f)(4) will
    minimize such occurrences.

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
    TITLE VII. GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 29. Brief of an Amicus Curiae

-STATUTE-
      (a) When Permitted. The United States or its officer or agency,
    or a State, Territory, Commonwealth, or the District of Columbia
    may file an amicus-curiae brief without the consent of the parties
    or leave of court. Any other amicus curiae may file a brief only by
    leave of court or if the brief states that all parties have
    consented to its filing.
      (b) Motion for Leave to File. The motion must be accompanied by
    the proposed brief and state:
        (1) the movant's interest; and
        (2) the reason why an amicus brief is desirable and why the
      matters asserted are relevant to the disposition of the case.

      (c) Contents and Form. An amicus brief must comply with Rule 32.
    In addition to the requirements of Rule 32, the cover must identify
    the party or parties supported and indicate whether the brief
    supports affirmance or reversal. If an amicus curiae is a
    corporation, the brief must include a disclosure statement like
    that required of parties by Rule 26.1. An amicus brief need not
    comply with Rule 28, but must include the following:
        (1) a table of contents, with page references;
        (2) a table of authorities - cases (alphabetically arranged),
      statutes and other authorities - with references to the pages of
      the brief where they are cited;
        (3) a concise statement of the identity of the amicus curiae,
      its interest in the case, and the source of its authority to
      file;
        (4) an argument, which may be preceded by a summary and which
      need not include a statement of the applicable standard of
      review; and
        (5) a certificate of compliance, if required by Rule 32(a)(7).

      (d) Length. Except by the court's permission, an amicus brief may
    be no more than one-half the maximum length authorized by these
    rules for a party's principal brief. If the court grants a party
    permission to file a longer brief, that extension does not affect
    the length of an amicus brief.
      (e) Time for Filing. An amicus curiae must file its brief,
    accompanied by a motion for filing when necessary, no later than 7
    days after the principal brief of the party being supported is
    filed. An amicus curiae that does not support either party must
    file its brief no later than 7 days after the appellant's or
    petitioner's principal brief is filed. A court may grant leave for
    later filing, specifying the time within which an opposing party
    may answer.
      (f) Reply Brief. Except by the court's permission, an amicus
    curiae may not file a reply brief.
      (g) Oral Argument. An amicus curiae may participate in oral
    argument only with the court's permission.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      Only five circuits presently regulate the filing of the brief of
    an amicus curiae. See D.C. Cir. Rule 18(j); 1st Cir. Rule 23(10);
    6th Cir. Rule 17(4); 9th Cir. Rule 18(9); 10th Cir. Rule 20. This
    rule follows the practice of a majority of circuits in requiring
    leave of court to file an amicus brief except under the
    circumstances stated therein. Compare Supreme Court Rule 42.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Several substantive changes are made in this rule, however.
      Subdivision (a). The major change in this subpart is that when a
    brief is filed with the consent of all parties, it is no longer
    necessary to obtain the parties' written consent and to file the
    consents with the brief. It is sufficient to obtain the parties'
    oral consent and to state in the brief that all parties have
    consented. It is sometimes difficult to obtain all the written
    consents by the filing deadline and it is not unusual for counsel
    to represent that parties have consented; for example, in a motion
    for extension of time to file a brief it is not unusual for the
    movant to state that the other parties have been consulted and they
    do not object to the extension. If a party's consent has been
    misrepresented, the party will be able to take action before the
    court considers the amicus brief.
      The District of Columbia is added to the list of entities allowed
    to file an amicus brief without consent of all parties. The other
    changes in this material are stylistic.
      Subdivision (b). The provision in the former rule, granting
    permission to conditionally file the brief with the motion, is
    changed to one requiring that the brief accompany the motion. Sup.
    Ct. R. 37.4 requires that the proposed brief be presented with the
    motion.
      The former rule only required the motion to identify the
    applicant's interest and to generally state the reasons why an
    amicus brief is desirable. The amended rule additionally requires
    that the motion state the relevance of the matters asserted to the
    disposition of the case. As Sup. Ct. R. 37.1 states:
      An amicus curiae brief which brings relevant matter to the
      attention of the Court that has not already been brought to its
      attention by the parties is of considerable help to the Court. An
      amicus curiae brief which does not serve this purpose simply
      burdens the staff and facilities of the Court and its filing is
      not favored.
    Because the relevance of the matters asserted by an amicus is
    ordinarily the most compelling reason for granting leave to file,
    the Committee believes that it is helpful to explicitly require
    such a showing.
      Subdivision (c). The provisions in this subdivision are entirely
    new. Previously there was confusion as to whether an amicus brief
    must include all of the items listed in Rule 28. Out of caution
    practitioners in some circuits included all those items. Ordinarily
    that is unnecessary.
      The requirement that the cover identify the party supported and
    indicate whether the amicus supports affirmance or reversal is an
    administrative aid.
      Paragraph (c)(3) requires an amicus to state the source of its
    authority to file. The amicus simply must identify which of the
    provisions in Rule 29(a) provides the basis for the amicus to file
    its brief.
      Subdivision (d). This new provision imposes a shorter page limit
    for an amicus brief than for a party's brief. This is appropriate
    for two reasons. First, an amicus may omit certain items that must
    be included in a party's brief. Second, an amicus brief is
    supplemental. It need not address all issues or all facets of a
    case. It should treat only matter not adequately addressed by a
    party.
      Subdivision (e). The time limit for filing is changed. An amicus
    brief must be filed no later than 7 days after the principal brief
    of the party being supported is filed. Occasionally, an amicus
    supports neither party; in such instances, the amendment provides
    that the amicus brief must be filed no later than 7 days after the
    appellant's or petitioner's principal brief is filed. Note that in
    both instances the 7-day period runs from when a brief is filed.
    The passive voice - "is filed" - is used deliberately. A party or
    amicus can send its brief to a court for filing and, under Rule 25,
    the brief is timely if mailed within the filing period. Although
    the brief is timely if mailed within the filing period, it is not
    "filed" until the court receives it and file stamps it. "Filing" is
    done by the court, not by the party. It may be necessary for an
    amicus to contact the court to ascertain the filing date.
      The 7-day stagger was adopted because it is long enough to permit
    an amicus to review the completed brief of the party being
    supported and avoid repetitious argument. A 7-day period also is
    short enough that no adjustment need be made in the opposing
    party's briefing schedule. The opposing party will have sufficient
    time to review arguments made by the amicus and address them in the
    party's responsive pleading. The timetable for filing the parties'
    briefs is unaffected by this change.
      A court may grant permission to file an amicus brief in a context
    in which the party does not file a "principal brief"; for example,
    an amicus may be permitted to file in support of a party's petition
    for rehearing. In such instances the court will establish the
    filing time for the amicus.
      The former rule's statement that a court may, for cause shown,
    grant leave for later filing is unnecessary. Rule 26(b) grants
    general authority to enlarge the time prescribed in these rules for
    good cause shown. This new rule, however, states that when a court
    grants permission for later filing, the court must specify the
    period within which an opposing party may answer the arguments of
    the amicus.
      Subdivision (f). This subdivision generally prohibits the filing
    a a reply brief by an amicus curiae. Sup. Ct. R. 37 and local rules
    of the D.C., Ninth, and Federal Circuits state that an amicus may
    not file a reply brief. The role of an amicus should not require
    the use of a reply brief.
      Subdivision (g). The language of this subdivision stating that an
    amicus will be granted permission to participate in oral argument
    "only for extraordinary reasons" has been deleted. The change is
    made to reflect more accurately the current practice in which it is
    not unusual for a court to permit an amicus to argue when a party
    is willing to share its argument time with the amicus. The
    Committee does not intend, however, to suggest that in other
    instances an amicus will be permitted to argue absent extraordinary
    circumstances.

-EXPCITE-
    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
    TITLE VII. GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 30. Appendix to the Briefs

-STATUTE-
      (a) Appellant's Responsibility.
        (1) Contents of the Appendix. The appellant must prepare and
      file an appendix to the briefs containing:
          (A) the relevant docket entries in the proceeding below;
          (B) the relevant portions of the pleadings, charge, findings,
        or opinion;
          (C) the judgment, order, or decision in question; and
          (D) other parts of the record to which the parties wish to
        direct the court's attention.

        (2) Excluded Material. Memoranda of law in the district court
      should not be included in the appendix unless they have
      independent relevance. Parts of the record may be relied on by
      the court or the parties even though not included in the
      appendix.
        (3) Time to File; Number of Copies. Unless filing is deferred
      under Rule 30(c), the appellant must file 10 copies of the
      appendix with the brief and must serve one copy on counsel for
      each party separately represented. An unrepresented party
      proceeding in forma pauperis must file 4 legible copies with the
      clerk, and one copy must be served on counsel for each separately
      represented party. The court may by local rule or by order in a
      particular case require the filing or service of a different
      number.

      (b) All Parties' Responsibilities.
        (1) Determining the Contents of the Appendix. The parties are
      encouraged to agree on the contents of the appendix. In the
      absence of an agreement, the appellant must, within 14 days after
      the record is filed, serve on the appellee a designation of the
      parts of the record the appellant intends to include in the
      appendix and a statement of the issues the appellant intends to
      present for review. The appellee may, within 14 days after
      receiving the designation, serve on the appellant a designation
      of additional parts to which it wishes to direct the court's
      attention. The appellant must include the designated parts in the
      appendix. The parties must not engage in unnecessary designation
      of parts of the record, because the entire record is available to
      the court. This paragraph applies also to a cross-appellant and a
      cross-appellee.
        (2) Costs of Appendix. Unless the parties agree otherwise, the
      appellant must pay the cost of the appendix. If the appellant
      considers parts of the record designated by the appellee to be
      unnecessary, the appellant may advise the appellee, who must then
      advance the cost of including those parts. The cost of the
      appendix is a taxable cost. But if any party causes unnecessary
      parts of the record to be included in the appendix, the court may
      impose the cost of those parts on that party. Each circuit must,
      by local rule, provide for sanctions against attorneys who
      unreasonably and vexatiously increase litigation costs by
      including unnecessary material in the appendix.

      (c) Deferred Appendix.
        (1) Deferral Until After Briefs Are Filed. The court may
      provide by rule for classes of cases or by order in a particular
      case that preparation of the appendix may be deferred until after
      the briefs have been filed and that the appendix may be filed 21
      days after the appellee's brief is served. Even though the filing
      of the appendix may be deferred, Rule 30(b) applies; except that
      a party must designate the parts of the record it wants included
      in the appendix when it serves its brief, and need not include a
      statement of the issues presented.
        (2) References to the Record.
          (A) If the deferred appendix is used, the parties may cite in
        their briefs the pertinent pages of the record. When the
        appendix is prepared, the record pages cited in the briefs must
        be indicated by inserting record page numbers, in brackets, at
        places in the appendix where those pages of the record appear.
          (B) A party who wants to refer directly to pages of the
        appendix may serve and file copies of the brief within the time
        required by Rule 31(a), containing appropriate references to
        pertinent pages of the record. In that event, within 14 days
        after the appendix is filed, the party must serve and file
        copies of the brief, containing references to the pages of the
        appendix in place of or in addition to the references to the
        pertinent pages of the record. Except for the correction of
        typographical errors, no other changes may be made to the
        brief.

      (d) Format of the Appendix. The appendix must begin with a table
    of contents identifying the page at which each part begins. The
    relevant docket entries must follow the table of contents. Other
    parts of the record must follow chronologically. When pages from
    the transcript of proceedings are placed in the appendix, the
    transcript page numbers must be shown in brackets immediately
    before the included pages. Omissions in the text of papers or of
    the transcript must be indicated by asterisks. Immaterial formal
    matters (captions, subscriptions, acknowledgments, etc.) should be
    omitted.
      (e) Reproduction of Exhibits. Exhibits designated for inclusion
    in the appendix may be reproduced in a separate volume, or volumes,
    suitably indexed. Four copies must be filed with the appendix, and
    one copy must be served on counsel for each separately represented
    party. If a transcript of a proceeding before an administrative
    agency, board, commission, or officer was used in a district-court
    action and has been designated for inclusion in the appendix, the
    transcript must be placed in the appendix as an exhibit.
      (f) Appeal on the Original Record Without an Appendix. The court
    may, either by rule for all cases or classes of cases or by order
    in a particular case, dispense with the appendix and permit an
    appeal to proceed on the original record with any copies of the
    record, or relevant parts, that the court may order the parties to
    file.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      Subdivision (a). Only two circuits presently require a printed
    record (5th Cir. Rule 23(a); 8th Cir. Rule 10 (in civil appeals
    only)), and the rules and practice in those circuits combine to
    make the difference between a printed record and the appendix,
    which is now used in eight circuits and in the Supreme Court in
    lieu of the printed record, largely nominal. The essential
    characteristics of the appendix method are: (1) the entire record
    may not be reproduced; (2) instead, the parties are to set out in
    an appendix to the briefs those parts of the record which in their
    judgment the judges must consult in order to determine the issues
    presented by the appeal; (3) the appendix is not the record but
    merely a selection therefrom for the convenience of the judges of
    the court of appeals; the record is the actual trial court record,
    and the record itself is always available to supply inadvertent
    omissions from the appendix. These essentials are incorporated,
    either by rule or by practice, in the circuits that continue to
    require the printed record rather than the appendix. See 5th Cir.
    Rule 23(a)(9) and 8th Cir. Rule 10(a)-(d).
      Subdivision (b). Under the practice in six of the eight circuits
    which now use the appendix method, unless the parties agree to use
    a single appendix, the appellant files with his brief an appendix
    containing the parts of the record which he deems it essential that
    the court read in order to determine the questions presented. If
    the appellee deems additional parts of the record necessary he must
    include such parts as an appendix to his brief. The proposed rules
    differ from that practice. By the new rule a single appendix is to
    be filed. It is to be prepared by the appellant, who must include
    therein those parts which he deems essential and those which the
    appellee designates as essential.
      Under the practice by which each party files his own appendix the
    resulting reproduction of essential parts of the record is often
    fragmentary; it is not infrequently necessary to piece several
    appendices together to arrive at a usable reproduction. Too, there
    seems to be a tendency on the part of some appellants to reproduce
    less than what is necessary for a determination of the issues
    presented (see Moran Towing Corp. v. M. A. Gammino Construction
    Co., 363 F.2d 108 (1st Cir. 1966); Walters v. Shari Music
    Publishing Corp., 298 F.2d 206 (2d Cir. 1962) and cases cited
    therein; Morrison v. Texas Co., 289 F.2d 382 (7th Cir. 1961) and
    cases cited therein), a tendency which is doubtless encouraged by
    the requirement in present rules that the appellee reproduce in his
    separately prepared appendix such necessary parts of the record as
    are not included by the appellant.
      Under the proposed rule responsibility for the preparation of the
    appendix is placed on the appellant. If the appellee feels that the
    appellant has omitted essential portions of the record, he may
    require the appellant to include such portions in the appendix. The
    appellant is protected against a demand that he reproduce parts
    which he considers unnecessary by the provisions entitling him to
    require the appellee to advance the costs of reproducing such parts
    and authorizing denial of costs for matter unnecessarily
    reproduced.
      Subdivision (c). This subdivision permits the appellant to elect
    to defer the production of the appendix to the briefs until the
    briefs of both sides are written, and authorizes a court of appeals
    to require such deferred filing by rule or order. The advantage of
    this method of preparing the appendix is that it permits the
    parties to determine what parts of the record need to be reproduced
    in the light of the issues actually presented by the briefs. Often
    neither side is in a position to say precisely what is needed until
    the briefs are completed. Once the argument on both sides is known,
    it should be possible to confine the matter reproduced in the
    appendix to that which is essential to a determination of the
    appeal or review. This method of preparing the appendix is
    presently in use in the Tenth Circuit (Rule 17) and in other
    circuits in review of agency proceedings, and it has proven its
    value in reducing the volume required to be reproduced. When the
    record is long, use of this method is likely to result in
    substantial economy to the parties.
      Subdivision (e). The purpose of this subdivision is to reduce the
    cost of reproducing exhibits. While subdivision (a) requires that
    10 copies of the appendix be filed, unless the court requires a
    lesser number, subdivision (e) permits exhibits necessary for the
    determination of an appeal to be bound separately, and requires
    only 4 copies of such a separate volume or volumes to be filed and
    a single copy to be served on counsel.
      Subdivision (f). This subdivision authorizes a court of appeals
    to dispense with the appendix method of reproducing parts of the
    record and to hear appeals on the original record and such copies
    of it as the court may require.
      Since 1962 the Ninth Circuit has permitted all appeals to be
    heard on the original record and a very limited number of copies.
    Under the practice as adopted in 1962, any party to an appeal could
    elect to have the appeal heard on the original record and two
    copies thereof rather than on the printed record theretofore
    required. The resulting substantial saving of printing costs led to
    the election of the new practice in virtually all cases, and by
    1967 the use of printed records had ceased. By a recent amendment,
    the Ninth Circuit has abolished the printed record altogether. Its
    rules now provide that all appeals are to be heard on the original
    record, and it has reduced the number of copies required to two
    sets of copies of the transmitted original papers (excluding copies
    of exhibits, which need not be filed unless specifically ordered).
    See 9 Cir. Rule 10, as amended June 2, 1967, effective September 1,
    1967. The Eighth Circuit permits appeals in criminal cases and in
    habeas corpus and 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255 proceedings to be heard on
    the original record and two copies thereof. See 8 Cir. Rule 8 (i)-
    (j). The Tenth Circuit permits appeals in all cases to be heard on
    the original record and four copies thereof whenever the record
    consists of two hundred pages or less. See 10 Cir. Rule 17(a). This
    subdivision expressly authorizes the continuation of the practices
    in the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Circuits.
      The judges of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit have
    expressed complete satisfaction with the practice there in use and
    have suggested that attention be called to the advantages which it
    offers in terms of reducing cost.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1970 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The amendment of subdivision (a) is related to
    the amendment of Rule 31(a), which authorizes a court of appeals to
    shorten the time for filing briefs. By virtue of this amendment, if
    the time for filing the brief of the appellant is shortened the
    time for filing the appendix is likewise shortened.
      Subdivision (c). As originally written, subdivision (c) permitted
    the appellant to elect to defer filing of the appendix until 21
    days after service of the brief of the appellee. As amended,
    subdivision (c) requires that an order of court be obtained before
    filing of the appendix can be deferred, unless a court permits
    deferred filing by local rule. The amendment should not cause use
    of the deferred appendix to be viewed with disfavor. In cases
    involving lengthy records, permission to defer filing of the
    appendix should be freely granted as an inducement to the parties
    to include in the appendix only matter that the briefs show to be
    necessary for consideration by the judges. But the Committee is
    advised that appellants have elected to defer filing of the
    appendix in cases involving brief records merely to obtain the 21
    day delay. The subdivision is amended to prevent that practice.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1986 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). During its study of the separate appendix [see
    Report on the Advisory Committee on the Federal Appellate Rules on
    the Operation of Rule 30,  -  FRD  -  (1985)], the Advisory
    Committee found that this document was frequently encumbered with
    memoranda submitted to the trial court. United States v. Noall, 587
    F.2d 123, 125 n. 1 (2nd Cir. 1978). See generally Drewett v. Aetna
    Cas. & Sur. Co., 539 F.2d 496, 500 (5th Cir. 1976); Volkswagenwerk
    Aktiengesellschaft v. Church, 413 F.2d 1126, 1128 (9th Cir. 1969).
    Inclusion of such material makes the appendix more bulky and
    therefore less useful to the appellate panel. It also can increase
    significantly the costs of litigation.
      There are occasions when such trial court memoranda have
    independent relevance in the appellate litigation. For instance,
    there may be a dispute as to whether a particular point was raised
    or whether a concession was made in the district court. In such
    circumstances, it is appropriate to include pertinent sections of
    such memoranda in the appendix.
      Subdivision (b). The amendment to subdivision (b) is designed to
    require the circuits, by local rule, to establish a procedural
    mechanism for the imposition of sanctions against those attorneys
    who conduct appellate litigation in bad faith. Both 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    1927 and the inherent power of the court authorized such sanctions.
    See Brennan v. Local 357, International Brotherhood of Teamsters,
    709 F.2d 611 (9th Cir. 1983). See generally Roadway Express, Inc.
    v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752 (1980). While considerations of uniformity
    are important and doubtless will be taken into account by the
    judges of the respective circuits, the Advisory Committee believes
    that, at this time, the circuits need the flexibility to tailor
    their approach to the conditions of local practice. The local rule
    shall provide for notice and opportunity to respond before the
    imposition of any sanction.
      Technical amendments also are made to subdivisions (a), (b) and
    (c) which are not intended to be substantive changes.

    TAXATION OF FEES IN APPEALS IN WHICH THE REQUIREMENT OF AN APPENDIX
                             IS DISPENSED WITH
      The Judicial Conference of the United States at its session on
    October 28th and 29th approved the following resolution relating to
    fees to be taxed in the courts of appeals as submitted by the
    Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit with the proviso that its
    application to any court of appeals shall be at the election of
    each such court:
      For some time it has been the practice in the Ninth Circuit Court
    of Appeals to dispense with an appendix in an appellate record and
    to hear the appeal on the original record, with a number of copies
    thereof being supplied (Rule 30f, Federal Rules of Appellate
    Procedure). It has been the practice of the Court to tax a fee of
    $5 in small records and $10 in large records for the time of the
    clerk involved in preparing such appeals and by way of
    reimbursement for postage expense. Judicial Conference approval
    heretofore has not been secured and the Judicial Council of the
    Ninth Circuit now seeks to fix a flat fee of $15 to be charged as
    fees for costs to be charged by any court of appeals "in any appeal
    in which the requirement of an appendix is dispensed with pursuant
    to Rule 30f, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure."

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b). The amendment requires a cross appellant to
    serve the appellant with a statement of the issues that the cross
    appellant intends to pursue on appeal. No later than ten days after
    the record is filed, the appellant and cross appellant must serve
    each other with a statement of the issues each intends to present
    for review and with a designation of the parts of the record that
    each wants included in the appendix. Within the next ten days, both
    the appellee and the cross appellee may designate additional
    materials for inclusion in the appendix. The appellant must then
    include in the appendix the parts thus designated for both the
    appeal and any cross appeals. The Committee expects that
    simultaneous compliance with this subdivision by an appellant and a
    cross appellant will be feasible in most cases. If a cross
    appellant cannot fairly be expected to comply until receipt of the
    appellant's statement of issues, relief may be sought by motion in
    the court of appeals.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The only substantive change is to allow a court
    to require the filing of a greater number of copies of an appendix
    as well as a lesser number.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Subdivision (a). Paragraph (a)(3) is amended so that it is
    consistent with Rule 31(b). An unrepresented party proceeding in
    forma pauperis is only required to file 4 copies of the appendix
    rather than 10.
      Subdivision (c). When a deferred appendix is used, a brief must
    make reference to the original record rather than to the appendix
    because it does not exist when the briefs are prepared. Unless a
    party later files an amended brief with direct references to the
    pages of the appendix (as provided in subparagraph (c)(2)(B)), the
    material in the appendix must indicate the pages of the original
    record from which it was drawn so that a reader of the brief can
    make meaningful use of the appendix. The instructions in the
    current rule for cross-referencing the appendix materials to the
    original record are unclear. The language in paragraph (c)(2) has
    been amended to try to clarify the procedure.
      Subdivision (d). In recognition of the fact that use of a typeset
    appendix is exceedingly rare in the courts of appeals, the last
    sentence - permitting a question and answer (as from a transcript)
    to be in a single paragraph - has been omitted.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (b)(1). The times set in the former rule at 10 days
    have been revised to 14 days. See the Note to Rule 26.

-HEAD-
    Rule 31. Serving and Filing Briefs

-STATUTE-
      (a) Time to Serve and File a Brief.
        (1) The appellant must serve and file a brief within 40 days
      after the record is filed. The appellee must serve and file a
      brief within 30 days after the appellant's brief is served. The
      appellant may serve and file a reply brief within 14 days after
      service of the appellee's brief but a reply brief must be filed
      at least 7 days before argument, unless the court, for good
      cause, allows a later filing.
        (2) A court of appeals that routinely considers cases on the
      merits promptly after the briefs are filed may shorten the time
      to serve and file briefs, either by local rule or by order in a
      particular case.

      (b) Number of Copies. Twenty-five copies of each brief must be
    filed with the clerk and 2 copies must be served on each
    unrepresented party and on counsel for each separately represented
    party. An unrepresented party proceeding in forma pauperis must
    file 4 legible copies with the clerk, and one copy must be served
    on each unrepresented party and on counsel for each separately
    represented party. The court may by local rule or by order in a
    particular case require the filing or service of a different
    number.
      (c) Consequence of Failure to File. If an appellant fails to file
    a brief within the time provided by this rule, or within an
    extended time, an appellee may move to dismiss the appeal. An
    appellee who fails to file a brief will not be heard at oral
    argument unless the court grants permission.

      A majority of the circuits now require the brief of the appellant
    to be filed within 30 days from the date on which the record is
    filed. But in those circuits an exchange of designations is
    unnecessary in the preparation of the appendix. The appellant files
    with his brief an appendix containing the parts of the record which
    he deems essential. If the appellee considers other parts
    essential, he includes those parts in his own appendix. Since the
    proposed rule requires the appellant to file with his brief an
    appendix containing necessary parts of the record as designated by
    both parties, the rule allows the appellant 40 days in order to
    provide time for the exchange of designations respecting the
    content of the appendix (see Rule 30(b)).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1970 AMENDMENT       
      The time prescribed by Rule 31(a) for preparing briefs - 40 days
    to the appellant, 30 days to the appellee - is well within the time
    that must ordinarily elapse in most circuits before an appeal can
    be reached for consideration. In those circuits, the time
    prescribed by the Rule should not be disturbed. But if a court of
    appeals maintains a current calendar, that is, if an appeal can be
    heard as soon as the briefs have been filed, or if the practice of
    the court permits the submission of appeals for preliminary
    consideration as soon as the briefs have been filed, the court
    should be free to prescribe shorter periods in the interest of
    expediting decision.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1986 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments to Rules 31(a) and (c) are technical. No
    substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b). The amendment allows a court of appeals to
    require the filing of a greater, as well as a lesser, number of
    copies of briefs. The amendment also allows the required number to
    be prescribed by local rule as well as by order in a particular
    case.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only; a
    substantive change is made, however, in subdivision (b).
      Subdivision (a). Paragraph (a)(2) explicitly authorizes a court
    of appeals to shorten a briefing schedule if the court routinely
    considers cases on the merits promptly after the briefs are filed.
    Extensions of the briefing schedule, by order, are permitted under
    the general provisions of Rule 26(b).
      Subdivision (b). The current rule says that a party who is
    permitted to file "typewritten ribbon and carbon copies of the
    brief" need only file an original and three copies of the brief.
    The quoted language, in conjunction with current rule 24(c), means
    that a party allowed to proceed in forma pauperis need not file 25
    copies of the brief. Two changes are made in this subdivision.
    First, it is anachronistic to refer to a party who is allowed to
    file a typewritten brief as if that would distinguish the party
    from all other parties; any party is permitted to file a
    typewritten brief. The amended rule states directly that it applies
    to a party permitted to proceed in forma pauperis. Second, the
    amended rule does not generally permit parties who are represented
    by counsel to file the lesser number of briefs. Inexpensive methods
    of copying are generally available. Unless it would impose
    hardship, in which case a motion to file a lesser number should be
    filed, a represented party must file the usual number of briefs.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (b). In requiring that two copies of each brief "must
    be served on counsel for each separately represented party," Rule
    31(b) may be read to imply that copies of briefs need not be served
    on unrepresented parties. The Rule has been amended to clarify that
    briefs must be served on all parties, including those who are not
    represented by counsel.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a)(1). Subdivision (a)(1) formerly required that the
    appellant's reply brief be served "at least 3 days before argument,
    unless the court, for good cause, allows a later filing." Under
    former Rule 26(a), "3 days" could mean as many as 5 or even 6 days.
    See the Note to Rule 26. Under revised Rule 26(a), intermediate
    weekends and holidays are counted. Changing "3 days" to "7 days"
    alters the period accordingly. Under revised Rule 26(a), when a
    period ends on a weekend or holiday, one must continue to count in
    the same direction until the next day that is not a weekend or
    holiday; the choice of the 7-day period for subdivision (a)(1) will
    minimize such occurrences.

-EXPCITE-
    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
    TITLE VII. GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 32. Form of Briefs, Appendices, and Other Papers

-STATUTE-
      (a) Form of a Brief.
        (1) Reproduction.
          (A) A brief may be reproduced by any process that yields a
        clear black image on light paper. The paper must be opaque and
        unglazed. Only one side of the paper may be used.
          (B) Text must be reproduced with a clarity that equals or
        exceeds the output of a laser printer.
          (C) Photographs, illustrations, and tables may be reproduced
        by any method that results in a good copy of the original; a
        glossy finish is acceptable if the original is glossy.

        (2) Cover. Except for filings by unrepresented parties, the
      cover of the appellant's brief must be blue; the appellee's, red;
      an intervenor's or amicus curiae's, green; any reply brief, gray;
      and any supplemental brief, tan. The front cover of a brief must
      contain:
          (A) the number of the case centered at the top;
          (B) the name of the court;
          (C) the title of the case (see Rule 12(a));
          (D) the nature of the proceeding (e.g., Appeal, Petition for
        Review) and the name of the court, agency, or board below;
          (E) the title of the brief, identifying the party or parties
        for whom the brief is filed; and
          (F) the name, office address, and telephone number of counsel
        representing the party for whom the brief is filed.

        (3) Binding. The brief must be bound in any manner that is
      secure, does not obscure the text, and permits the brief to lie
      reasonably flat when open.
        (4) Paper Size, Line Spacing, and Margins. The brief must be on
      8 1/2  by 11 inch paper. The text must be double-spaced, but
      quotations more than two lines long may be indented and single-
      spaced. Headings and footnotes may be single-spaced. Margins
      must be at least one inch on all four sides. Page numbers may be
      placed in the margins, but no text may appear there.
        (5) Typeface. Either a proportionally spaced or a monospaced
      face may be used.
          (A) A proportionally spaced face must include serifs, but
        sans-serif type may be used in headings and captions. A
        proportionally spaced face must be 14-point or larger.
          (B) A monospaced face may not contain more than 10 1/2 
        characters per inch.

        (6) Type Styles. A brief must be set in a plain, roman style,
      although italics or boldface may be used for emphasis. Case names
      must be italicized or underlined.
        (7) Length.
          (A) Page Limitation. A principal brief may not exceed 30
        pages, or a reply brief 15 pages, unless it complies with Rule
        32(a)(7)(B) and (C).
          (B) Type-Volume Limitation.
            (i) A principal brief is acceptable if:
              -- it contains no more than 14,000 words; or
              -- it uses a monospaced face and contains no more than
            1,300 lines of text.

            (ii) A reply brief is acceptable if it contains no more
          than half of the type volume specified in Rule
          32(a)(7)(B)(i).
            (iii) Headings, footnotes, and quotations count toward the
          word and line limitations. The corporate disclosure
          statement, table of contents, table of citations, statement
          with respect to oral argument, any addendum containing
          statutes, rules or regulations, and any certificates of
          counsel do not count toward the limitation.

          (C) Certificate of Compliance.
            (i) A brief submitted under Rules 28.1(e)(2) or 32(a)(7)(B)
          must include a certificate by the attorney, or an
          unrepresented party, that the brief complies with the type-
          volume limitation. The person preparing the certificate may
          rely on the word or line count of the word-processing system
          used to prepare the brief. The certificate must state either:
              -- the number of words in the brief; or
              -- the number of lines of monospaced type in the brief.

            (ii) Form 6 in the Appendix of Forms is a suggested form of
          a certificate of compliance. Use of Form 6 must be regarded
          as sufficient to meet the requirements of Rules 28.1(e)(3)
          and 32(a)(7)(C)(i).

      (b) Form of an Appendix. An appendix must comply with Rule
    32(a)(1), (2), (3), and (4), with the following exceptions:
        (1) The cover of a separately bound appendix must be white.
        (2) An appendix may include a legible photocopy of any document
      found in the record or of a printed judicial or agency decision.
        (3) When necessary to facilitate inclusion of odd-sized
      documents such as technical drawings, an appendix may be a size
      other than 8 1/2  by 11 inches, and need not lie reasonably flat
      when opened.

      (c) Form of Other Papers.
        (1) Motion. The form of a motion is governed by Rule 27(d).
        (2) Other Papers. Any other paper, including a petition for
      panel rehearing and a petition for hearing or rehearing en banc,
      and any response to such a petition, must be reproduced in the
      manner prescribed by Rule 32(a), with the following exceptions:
          (A) A cover is not necessary if the caption and signature
        page of the paper together contain the information required by
        Rule 32(a)(2). If a cover is used, it must be white.
          (B) Rule 32(a)(7) does not apply.

      (d) Signature. Every brief, motion, or other paper filed with the
    court must be signed by the party filing the paper or, if the party
    is represented, by one of the party's attorneys.
      (e) Local Variation. Every court of appeals must accept documents
    that comply with the form requirements of this rule. By local rule
    or order in a particular case a court of appeals may accept
    documents that do not meet all of the form requirements of this
    rule.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      Only two methods of printing are now generally recognized by the
    circuits - standard typographic printing and the offset duplicating
    process (multilith). A third, mimeographing, is permitted in the
    Fifth Circuit. The District of Columbia, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits
    permit records to be reproduced by copying processes. The Committee
    feels that recent and impending advances in the arts of duplicating
    and copying warrant experimentation with less costly forms of
    reproduction than those now generally authorized. The proposed rule
    permits, in effect, the use of any process other than the carbon
    copy process which produces a clean, readable page. What
    constitutes such is left in first instance to the parties and
    ultimately to the court to determine. The final sentence of the
    first paragraph of subdivision (a) is added to allow the use of
    multilith, mimeograph, or other forms of copies of the reporter's
    original transcript whenever such are available.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      In addition to amending Rule 32 to conform to uniform drafting
    standards, several substantive amendments are made. The Advisory
    Committee had been working on substantive amendments to Rule 32 for
    some time prior to completion of this larger project.
      Subdivison (a). Form of a Brief.
      Paragraph (a)(1). Reproduction.
      The rule permits the use of "light" paper, not just "white"
    paper. Cream and buff colored paper, including recycled paper, are
    acceptable. The rule permits printing on only one side of the
    paper. Although some argue that paper could be saved by allowing
    double-sided printing, others argue that in order to preserve
    legibility a heavier weight paper would be needed, resulting in
    little, if any, paper saving. In addition, the blank sides of a
    brief are commonly used by judges and their clerks for making notes
    about the case.
      Because photocopying is inexpensive and widely available and
    because use of carbon paper is now very rare, all references to the
    use of carbon copies have been deleted.
      The rule requires that the text be reproduced with a clarity that
    equals or exceeds the output of a laser printer. That means that
    the method used must have a print resolution of 300 dots per inch
    (dpi) or more. This will ensure the legibility of the brief. A
    brief produced by a typewriter or a daisy wheel printer, as well as
    one produced by a laser printer, has a print resolution of 300 dpi
    or more. But a brief produced by a dot-matrix printer, fax machine,
    or portable printer that uses heat or dye transfer methods does
    not. Some ink jet printers are 300 dpi or more, but some are 216
    dpi and would not be sufficient.
      Photographs, illustrations, and tables may be reproduced by any
    method that results in a good copy.
      Paragraph (a)(2). Cover.
      The rule requires that the number of the case be centered at the
    top of the front cover of a brief. This will aid in identification
    of the brief. The idea was drawn from a local rule. The rule also
    requires that the title of the brief identify the party or parties
    on whose behalf the brief is filed. When there are multiple
    appellants or appellees, the information is necessary to the court.
    If, however, the brief is filed on behalf of all appellants or
    appellees, it may so indicate. Further, it may be possible to
    identify the class of parties on whose behalf the brief is filed.
    Otherwise, it may be necessary to name each party. The rule also
    requires that attorney's telephone numbers appear on the front
    cover of a brief or appendix.
      Paragraph (a)(3). Binding.
      The rule requires a brief to be bound in any manner that is
    secure, does not obscure the text, and that permits the brief to
    lie reasonably flat when open. Many judges and most court employees
    do much of their work at computer keyboards and a brief that lies
    flat when open is significantly more convenient. One circuit
    already has such a requirement and another states a preference for
    it. While a spiral binding would comply with this requirement, it
    is not intended to be the exclusive method of binding. Stapling a
    brief at the upper left-hand corner also satisfies this requirement
    as long as it is sufficiently secure.
      Paragraph (a)(4). Paper Size, Line Spacing, and Margins.
      The provisions for pamphlet-size briefs are deleted because their
    use is so rare. If a circuit wishes to authorize their use, it has
    authority to do so under subdivision (d) of this rule.
      Paragraph (a)(5). Typeface.
      This paragraph and the next one, governing type style, are new.
    The existing rule simply states that a brief produced by the
    standard typographic process must be printed in at least 11 point
    type, or if produced in any other manner, the lines of text must be
    double spaced. Today few briefs are produced by commercial printers
    or by typewriters; most are produced on and printed by computer.
    The availability of computer fonts in a variety of sizes and styles
    has given rise to local rules limiting type styles. The Advisory
    Committee believes that some standards are needed both to ensure
    that all litigants have an equal opportunity to present their
    material and to ensure that the briefs are easily legible.
      With regard to typeface there are two options: proportionally-
    spaced typeface or monospaced typeface.
      A proportionally-spaced typeface gives a different amount of
    horizontal space to characters depending upon the width of the
    character. A capital "M" is given more horizontal space than a
    lower case "i." The rule requires that a proportionally-spaced
    typeface have serifs. Serifs are small horizontal or vertical
    strokes at the ends of the lines that make up the letters and
    numbers. Studies have shown that long passages of serif type are
    easier to read and comprehend than long passages of sans-serif
    type. The rule accordingly limits the principal sections of
    submissions to serif type, although sans-serif type may be used in
    headings and captions. This is the same approach magazines,
    newspapers, and commercial printers take. Look at a professionally
    printed brief; you will find sans-serif type confined to captions,
    if it is used at all. The next line shows two characters enlarged
    for detail. The first has serifs, the second does not.

    Y    -----    Y
    So that the type is easily legible, the rule requires a minimum
    type size of 14 points for proportionally-spaced typeface.
      A monospaced typeface is one in which all characters have the
    same advance width. That means that each character is given the
    same horizontal space on the line. A wide letter such as a capital
    "M" and a narrow letter such as a lower case "i" are given the same
    space. Most typewriters produce mono-spaced type, and most
    computers also can do so using fonts with names such as "Courier."

      This sentence is in a proportionally spaced font; as you can see,
      the m and i have different widths.

      This sentence is in a monospaced font; as you can see, the m and
      i have the same width.

    The rule requires use of a monospaced typeface that produces no
    more than 10 1/2  characters per inch. A standard typewriter with
    pica type produces a monospaced typeface with 10 characters per
    inch (cpi). That is the ideal monospaced typeface. The rule permits
    up to 10 1/2  cpi because some computer software programs contain
    monospaced fonts that purport to produce 10 cpi but that in fact
    produce slightly more than 10 cpi. In order to avoid the need to
    reprint a brief produced in good faith reliance upon such a
    program, the rule permits a bit of leeway. A monospace typeface
    with no more than 10 cpi is preferred.
      Paragraph (a)(6). Type Styles.
      The rule requires use of plain roman, that is not italic or
    script, type. Italics and boldface may be used for emphasis.
    Italicizing case names is preferred but underlining may be used.
      Paragraph (a)(7). Type-Volume Limitation.
      Subparagraph (a)(7)(A) contains a safe-harbor provision. A
    principal brief that does not exceed 30 pages complies with the
    type-volume limitation without further question or certification. A
    reply brief that does not exceed 15 pages is similarly treated. The
    current limit is 50 pages but that limit was established when most
    briefs were produced on typewriters. The widespread use of personal
    computers has made a multitude of printing options available to
    practitioners. Use of a proportional typeface alone can greatly
    increase the amount of material per page as compared with use of a
    monospace typeface. Even though the rule requires use of 14-point
    proportional type, there is great variation in the x-height of
    different 14-point typefaces. Selection of a typeface with a small
    x-height increases the amount of text per page. Computers also make
    possible fine gradations in spacing between lines and tight
    tracking between letters and words. All of this, and more, have
    made the 50-page limit virtually meaningless. Establishing a safe-
    harbor of 50 pages would permit a person who makes use of the
    multitude of printing "tricks" available with most personal
    computers to file a brief far longer than the "old" 50-page brief.
    Therefore, as to those briefs not subject to any other volume
    control than a page limit, a 30-page limit is imposed.
      The limits in subparagraph (B) approximate the current 50-page
    limit and compliance with them is easy even for a person without a
    personal computer. The aim of these provisions is to create a level
    playing field. The rule gives every party an equal opportunity to
    make arguments, without permitting those with the best in-house
    typesetting an opportunity to expand their submissions.
      The length can be determined either by counting words or lines.
    That is, the length of a brief is determined not by the number of
    pages but by the number of words or lines in the brief. This gives
    every party the same opportunity to present an argument without
    regard to the typeface used and eliminates any incentive to use
    footnotes or typographical "tricks" to squeeze more material onto a
    page.
      The word counting method can be used with any typeface.
      A monospaced brief can meet the volume limitation by using the
    word or a line count. If the line counting method is used, the
    number of lines may not exceed 1,300 - 26 lines per page in a 50-
    page brief. The number of lines is easily counted manually. Line
    counting is not sufficient if a proportionally spaced typeface is
    used, because the amount of material per line can vary widely.
      A brief using the type-volume limitations in subparagraph (B)
    must include a certificate by the attorney, or party proceeding pro
    se, that the brief complies with the limitation. The rule permits
    the person preparing the certification to rely upon the word or
    line count of the word-processing system used to prepare the brief.
      Currently, Rule 28(g) governs the length of a brief. Rule 28(g)
    begins with the words "[e]xcept by permission of the court,"
    signaling that a party may file a motion to exceed the limits
    established in the rule. The absence of similar language in Rule 32
    does not mean that the Advisory Committee intends to prohibit
    motions to deviate from the requirements of the rule. The Advisory
    Committee does not believe that any such language is needed to
    authorize such a motion.
      Subdivision (b). Form of an Appendix.
      The provisions governing the form of a brief generally apply to
    an appendix. The rule recognizes, however, that an appendix is
    usually produced by photocopying existing documents. The rule
    requires that the photocopies be legible.
      The rule permits inclusion not only of documents from the record
    but also copies of a printed judicial or agency decision. If a
    decision that is part of the record in the case has been published,
    it is helpful to provide a copy of the published decision in place
    of a copy of the decision from the record.
      Subdivision (c). Form of Other Papers.
      The old rule required a petition for rehearing to be produced in
    the same manner as a brief or appendix. The new rule also requires
    that a petition for rehearing en banc and a response to either a
    petition for panel rehearing or a petition for rehearing en banc be
    prepared in the same manner. But the length limitations of
    paragraph (a)(7) do not apply to those documents and a cover is not
    required if all the information needed by the court to properly
    identify the document and the parties is included in the caption or
    signature page.
      Existing subdivision (b) states that other papers may be produced
    in like manner, or "they may be typewritten upon opaque, unglazed
    paper 8 1/2  by 11 inches in size." The quoted language is deleted
    but that method of preparing documents is not eliminated because
    (a)(5)(B) permits use of standard pica type. The only change is
    that the new rule now specifies margins for typewritten documents.
      Subdivision (d). Local Variation.
      A brief that complies with the national rule should be acceptable
    in every court. Local rules may move in one direction only; they
    may authorize noncompliance with certain of the national norms. For
    example, a court that wishes to do so may authorize printing of
    briefs on both sides of the paper, or the use of smaller type size
    or sans-serif proportional type. A local rule may not, however,
    impose requirements that are not in the national rule.


                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a)(2). On occasion, a court may permit or order the
    parties to file supplemental briefs addressing an issue that was
    not addressed - or adequately addressed - in the principal briefs.
    Rule 32(a)(2) has been amended to require that tan covers be used
    on such supplemental briefs. The amendment is intended to promote
    uniformity in federal appellate practice. At present, the local
    rules of the circuit courts conflict. See, e.g., D.C. Cir. R. 28(g)
    (requiring yellow covers on supplemental briefs); 11th Cir. R. 32,
    I.O.P. 1 (requiring white covers on supplemental briefs).
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.
      Subdivision (a)(7)(C). If the principal brief of a party exceeds
    30 pages, or if the reply brief of a party exceeds 15 pages, Rule
    32(a)(7)(C) provides that the party or the party's attorney must
    certify that the brief complies with the type-volume limitation of
    Rule 32(a)(7)(B). Rule 32(a)(7)(C) has been amended to refer to
    Form 6 (which has been added to the Appendix of Forms) and to
    provide that a party or attorney who uses Form 6 has complied with
    Rule 32(a)(7)(C). No court may provide to the contrary, in its
    local rules or otherwise.
      Form 6 requests not only the information mandated by Rule
    32(a)(7)(C), but also information that will assist courts in
    enforcing the typeface requirements of Rule 32(a)(5) and the type
    style requirements of Rule 32(a)(6). Parties and attorneys are not
    required to use Form 6, but they are encouraged to do so.
      Subdivision (c)(2)(A). Under Rule 32(c)(2)(A), a cover is not
    required on a petition for panel rehearing, petition for hearing or
    rehearing en banc, answer to a petition for panel rehearing,
    response to a petition for hearing or rehearing en banc, or any
    other paper. Rule 32(d) makes it clear that no court can require
    that a cover be used on any of these papers. However, nothing
    prohibits a court from providing in its local rules that if a cover
    on one of these papers is "voluntarily" used, it must be a
    particular color. Several circuits have adopted such local rules.
    See, e.g., Fed. Cir. R. 35(c) (requiring yellow covers on petitions
    for hearing or rehearing en banc and brown covers on responses to
    such petitions); Fed. Cir. R. 40(a) (requiring yellow covers on
    petitions for panel rehearing and brown covers on answers to such
    petitions); 7th Cir. R. 28 (requiring blue covers on petitions for
    rehearing filed by appellants or answers to such petitions, and
    requiring red covers on petitions for rehearing filed by appellees
    or answers to such petitions); 9th Cir. R. 40-1 (requiring blue
    covers on petitions for panel rehearing filed by appellants and red
    covers on answers to such petitions, and requiring red covers on
    petitions for panel rehearing filed by appellees and blue covers on
    answers to such petitions); 11th Cir. R. 35-6 (requiring white
    covers on petitions for hearing or rehearing en banc).
      These conflicting local rules create a hardship for counsel who
    practice in more than one circuit. For that reason, Rule
    32(c)(2)(A) has been amended to provide that if a party chooses to
    use a cover on a paper that is not required to have one, that cover
    must be white. The amendment is intended to preempt all local
    rulemaking on the subject of cover colors and thereby promote
    uniformity in federal appellate practice.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.
      Subdivisions (d) and (e). Former subdivision (d) has been
    redesignated as subdivision (e), and a new subdivision (d) has been
    added. The new subdivision (d) requires that every brief, motion,
    or other paper filed with the court be signed by the attorney or
    unrepresented party who files it, much as Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(a)
    imposes a signature requirement on papers filed in district court.
    Only the original copy of every paper must be signed. An appendix
    filed with the court does not have to be signed at all.
      By requiring a signature, subdivision (d) ensures that a readily
    identifiable attorney or party takes responsibility for every
    paper. The courts of appeals already have authority to sanction
    attorneys and parties who file papers that contain misleading or
    frivolous assertions, see, e.g., 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1912, Fed. R. App.
    P. 38 & 46(b)(1)(B), and thus subdivision (d) has not been amended
    to incorporate provisions similar to those found in Fed. R. Civ. P.
    11(b) and 11(c).
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment. A line was added to the
    Committee Note to clarify that only the original copy of a paper
    needs to be signed.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT

    cross-references to new Rule 28.1, which governs briefs filed in
    cases involving cross-appeals. Rule 28.1(e)(2) prescribes type-
    volume limitations that apply to such briefs, and Rule 28.1(e)(3)
    requires parties to certify compliance with those type-volume
    limitations under Rule 32(a)(7)(C).

-MISC1-
                      COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006                  
      Rule 32.1 is a new rule addressing the citation of judicial
    opinions, orders, judgments, or other written dispositions that
    have been designated by a federal court as "unpublished," "not for
    publication," "non-precedential," "not precedent," or the like.
    This Committee Note will refer to these dispositions collectively
    as"unpublished" opinions.
      Rule 32.1 is extremely limited. It does not require any court to
    issue an unpublished opinion or forbid any court from doing so. It
    does not dictate the circumstances under which a court may choose
    to designate an opinion as "unpublished" or specify the procedure
    that a court must follow in making that determination. It says
    nothing about what effect a court must give to one of its
    unpublished opinions or to the unpublished opinions of another
    court. Rule 32.1 addresses only the citation of federal judicial
    dispositions that have been designated as "unpublished" or "non-
    precedential" - whether or not those dispositions have been
    published in some way or are precedential in some sense.
      Subdivision (a). Every court of appeals has allowed unpublished
    opinions to be cited in some circumstances, such as to support a
    contention of issue preclusion or claim preclusion. But the
    circuits have differed dramatically with respect to the
    restrictions that they have placed on the citation of unpublished
    opinions for their persuasive value. Some circuits have freely
    permitted such citation, others have discouraged it but permitted
    it in limited circumstances, and still others have forbidden it
    altogether.
      Rule 32.1(a) is intended to replace these inconsistent standards
    with one uniform rule. Under Rule 32.1(a), a court of appeals may
    not prohibit a party from citing an unpublished opinion of a
    federal court for its persuasive value or for any other reason. In
    addition, under Rule 32.1(a), a court may not place any restriction
    on the citation of such opinions. For example, a court may not
    instruct parties that the citation of unpublished opinions is
    discouraged, nor may a court forbid parties to cite unpublished
    opinions when a published opinion addresses the same issue.
      Rule 32.1(a) applies only to unpublished opinions issued on or
    after January 1, 2007. The citation of unpublished opinions issued
    before January 1, 2007, will continue to be governed by the local
    rules of the circuits.
      Subdivision (b). Under Rule 32.1(b), a party who cites an opinion
    of a federal court must provide a copy of that opinion to the court
    of appeals and to the other parties, unless that opinion is
    available in a publicly accessible electronic database - such as a
    commercial database maintained by a legal research service or a
    database maintained by a court. A party who is required under
    Rule32.1(b) to provide a copy of an opinion must file and serve the
    copy with the brief or other paper in which the opinion is cited.
    Rule 32.1(b) applies to all unpublished opinions, regardless of
    when they were issued.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. (At its June 15-16,
    2005, meeting, the Standing Rules Committee with the advisory
    committee chair's concurrence agreed to delete sections of the
    Committee Note, which provided background information on the
    justification of the proposal.) The changes made by the Advisory
    Committee after publication are described in my May 14, 2004 report
    to the Standing Committee. At its April 2005 meeting, the Advisory
    Committee directed that two additional changes be made.
      First, the Committee decided to add "federal" before "judicial
    opinions" in subdivision (a) and before "judicial opinion" in
    subdivision (b) to make clear that Rule 32.1 applies only to the
    unpublished opinions of federal courts. Conforming changes were
    made to the Committee Note. These changes address the concern of
    some state court judges - conveyed by Chief Justice Wells at the
    June 2004 Standing Committee meeting - that Rule 32.1 might have an
    impact on state law.
      Second, the Committee decided to insert into the Committee Note
    references to the studies conducted by the Federal Judicial Center
    ("FJC") and the Administrative Office ("AO"). (The studies are
    described below. [Omitted]) These references make clear that the
    arguments of Rule 32.1's opponents were taken seriously and studied
    carefully, but ultimately rejected because they were unsupported by
    or, in some instances, actually refuted by the best available
    empirical evidence.

-STATUTE-
      The court may direct the attorneys - and, when appropriate, the
    parties - to participate in one or more conferences to address any
    matter that may aid in disposing of the proceedings, including
    simplifying the issues and discussing settlement. A judge or other
    person designated by the court may preside over the conference,
    which may be conducted in person or by telephone. Before a
    settlement conference, the attorneys must consult with their
    clients and obtain as much authority as feasible to settle the
    case. The court may, as a result of the conference, enter an order
    controlling the course of the proceedings or implementing any
    settlement agreement.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      The uniform rule for review or enforcement of orders of
    administrative agencies, boards, commissions or officers (see the
    general note following Rule 15) authorizes a prehearing conference
    in agency review proceedings. The same considerations which make a
    prehearing conference desirable in such proceedings may be present
    in certain cases on appeal from the district courts. The proposed
    rule is based upon subdivision 11 of the present uniform rule for
    review of agency orders.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 33 has been entirely rewritten. The new rule makes several
    changes.
      The caption of the rule has been changed from "Prehearing
    Conference" to "Appeal Conferences" to reflect the fact that
    occasionally a conference is held after oral argument.
      The rule permits the court to require the parties to attend the
    conference in appropriate cases. The Committee does not contemplate
    that attendance of the parties will become routine, but in certain
    instances the parties' presence can be useful. The language of the
    rule is broad enough to allow a court to determine that an
    executive or employee (other than the general counsel) of a
    corporation or government agency with authority regarding the
    matter at issue, constitutes "the party."
      The rule includes the possibility of settlement among the
    possible conference topics.
      The rule recognizes that conferences are often held by telephone.
      The rule allows a judge or other person designated by the court
    to preside over a conference. A number of local rules permit
    persons other than judges to preside over conferences. 1st Cir. R.
    47.5; 6th Cir. R. 18; 8th Cir. R. 33A; 9th Cir. R. 33-1; and 10th
    Cir. R. 33.
      The rule requires an attorney to consult with his or her client
    before a settlement conference and obtain as much authority as
    feasible to settle the case. An attorney can never settle a case
    without his or her client's consent. Certain entities, especially
    government entities, have particular difficulty obtaining authority
    to settle a case. The rule requires counsel to obtain only as much
    authority "as feasible."

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily
    understood. In addition to changes made to improve the
    understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make
    style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
    TITLE VII. GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 34. Oral Argument

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General.
        (1) Party's Statement. Any party may file, or a court may
      require by local rule, a statement explaining why oral argument
      should, or need not, be permitted.
        (2) Standards. Oral argument must be allowed in every case
      unless a panel of three judges who have examined the briefs and
      record unanimously agrees that oral argument is unnecessary for
      any of the following reasons:
          (A) the appeal is frivolous;
          (B) the dispositive issue or issues have been authoritatively
        decided; or
          (C) the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in
        the briefs and record, and the decisional process would not be
        significantly aided by oral argument.

      (b) Notice of Argument; Postponement. The clerk must advise all
    parties whether oral argument will be scheduled, and, if so, the
    date, time, and place for it, and the time allowed for each side. A
    motion to postpone the argument or to allow longer argument must be
    filed reasonably in advance of the hearing date.
      (c) Order and Contents of Argument. The appellant opens and
    concludes the argument. Counsel must not read at length from
    briefs, records, or authorities.
      (d) Cross-Appeals and Separate Appeals. If there is a cross-
    appeal, Rule 28.1(b) determines which party is the appellant and
    which is the appellee for purposes of oral argument. Unless the
    court directs otherwise, a cross-appeal or separate appeal must be
    argued when the initial appeal is argued. Separate parties should
    avoid duplicative argument.
      (e) Nonappearance of a Party. If the appellee fails to appear for
    argument, the court must hear appellant's argument. If the
    appellant fails to appear for argument, the court may hear the
    appellee's argument. If neither party appears, the case will be
    decided on the briefs, unless the court orders otherwise.
      (f) Submission on Briefs. The parties may agree to submit a case
    for decision on the briefs, but the court may direct that the case
    be argued.
      (g) Use of Physical Exhibits at Argument; Removal. Counsel
    intending to use physical exhibits other than documents at the
    argument must arrange to place them in the courtroom on the day of
    the argument before the court convenes. After the argument, counsel
    must remove the exhibits from the courtroom, unless the court
    directs otherwise. The clerk may destroy or dispose of the exhibits
    if counsel does not reclaim them within a reasonable time after the
    clerk gives notice to remove them.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      A majority of circuits now limit oral argument to thirty minutes
    for each side, with the provision that additional time may be made
    available upon request. The Committee is of the view that thirty
    minutes to each side is sufficient in most cases, but that where
    additional time is necessary it should be freely granted on a
    proper showing of cause therefor. It further feels that the matter
    of time should be left ultimately to each court of appeals, subject
    to the spirit of the rule that a reasonable time should be allowed
    for argument. The term "side" is used to indicate that the time
    allowed by the rule is afforded to opposing interests rather than
    to individual parties. Thus if multiple appellants or appellees
    have a common interest, they constitute only a single side. If
    counsel for multiple parties who constitute a single side feel that
    additional time is necessary, they may request it. In other
    particulars this rule follows the usual practice among the
    circuits. See 3d Cir. Rule 31; 6th Cir. Rule 20; 10th Cir. Rule 23.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1979 AMENDMENT       
      The proposed amendment, patterned after the recommendations in
    the Report of the Commission on Revision of the Federal Court
    Appellate System, Structure and Internal Procedures:
    Recommendations for Change, 1975, created by Public Law 489 of the
    92nd Cong. 2nd Sess., 86 Stat. 807, sets forth general principles
    and minimum standards to be observed in formulating any local rule.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1986 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments to Rules 34(a) and (e) are technical. No
    substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (d). The amendment of subdivision (d) conforms this
    rule with the amendment of Rule 28(h).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (c). The amendment deletes the requirement that the
    opening argument must include a fair statement of the case. The
    Committee proposed the change because in some circuits the court
    does not want appellants to give such statements. In those
    circuits, the rule is not followed and is misleading. Nevertheless,
    the Committee does not want the deletion of the requirement to
    indicate disapproval of the practice. Those circuits that desire a
    statement of the case may continue the practice.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily
    understood. In addition to changes made to improve the
    understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make
    style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only. Substantive
    changes are made in subdivision (a).
      Subdivision (a). Currently subdivision (a) says that oral
    argument must be permitted unless, applying a local rule, a panel
    of three judges unanimously agrees that oral argument is not
    necessary. Rule 34 then outlines the criteria to be used to
    determine whether oral argument is needed and requires any local
    rule to "conform substantially" to the "minimum standard[s]"
    established in the national rule. The amendments omit the local
    rule requirement and make the criteria applicable by force of the
    national rule. The local rule is an unnecessary instrument.
      Paragraph (a)(2) states that one reason for deciding that oral
    argument is unnecessary is that the dispositive issue has been
    authoritatively decided. The amended language no longer states that
    the issue must have been "recently" decided. The Advisory Committee
    does not intend any substantive change, but thinks that the use of
    "recently" may be misleading.
      Subdivision (d). A cross-reference to Rule 28(h) has been
    substituted for a reiteration of the provisions of Rule 28(h).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (d). A cross-reference in subdivision (d) has been
    changed to reflect the fact that, as part of an effort to collect
    within one rule all provisions regarding briefing in cases
    involving cross-appeals, former Rule 28(h) has been abrogated and
    its contents moved to new Rule 28.1(b).

-EXPCITE-
    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
    TITLE VII. GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 35. En Banc Determination

-STATUTE-
      (a) When Hearing or Rehearing En Banc May Be Ordered. A majority
    of the circuit judges who are in regular active service and who are
    not disqualified may order that an appeal or other proceeding be
    heard or reheard by the court of appeals en banc. An en banc
    hearing or rehearing is not favored and ordinarily will not be
    ordered unless:
        (1) en banc consideration is necessary to secure or maintain
      uniformity of the court's decisions; or
        (2) the proceeding involves a question of exceptional
      importance.

      (b) Petition for Hearing or Rehearing En Banc. A party may
    petition for a hearing or rehearing en banc.
        (1) The petition must begin with a statement that either:
          (A) the panel decision conflicts with a decision of the
        United States Supreme Court or of the court to which the
        petition is addressed (with citation to the conflicting case or
        cases) and consideration by the full court is therefore
        necessary to secure and maintain uniformity of the court's
        decisions; or
          (B) the proceeding involves one or more questions of
        exceptional importance, each of which must be concisely stated;
        for example, a petition may assert that a proceeding presents a
        question of exceptional importance if it involves an issue on
        which the panel decision conflicts with the authoritative
        decisions of other United States Courts of Appeals that have
        addressed the issue.

        (2) Except by the court's permission, a petition for an en banc
      hearing or rehearing must not exceed 15 pages, excluding material
      not counted under Rule 32.
        (3) For purposes of the page limit in Rule 35(b)(2), if a party
      files both a petition for panel rehearing and a petition for
      rehearing en banc, they are considered a single document even if
      they are filed separately, unless separate filing is required by
      local rule.

      (c) Time for Petition for Hearing or Rehearing En Banc. A
    petition that an appeal be heard initially en banc must be filed by
    the date when the appellee's brief is due. A petition for a
    rehearing en banc must be filed within the time prescribed by Rule
    40 for filing a petition for rehearing.
      (d) Number of Copies. The number of copies to be filed must be
    prescribed by local rule and may be altered by order in a
    particular case.
      (e) Response. No response may be filed to a petition for an en
    banc consideration unless the court orders a response.
      (f) Call for a Vote. A vote need not be taken to determine
    whether the case will be heard or reheard en banc unless a judge
    calls for a vote.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      Statutory authority for in banc hearings is found in 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 46(c). The proposed rule is responsive to the Supreme Court's
    view in Western Pacific Ry. Corp. v. Western Pacific Ry. Co., 345
    U.S. 247, 73 S.Ct. 656, 97 L.Ed. 986 (1953), that litigants should
    be free to suggest that a particular case is appropriate for
    consideration by all the judges of a court of appeals. The rule is
    addressed to the procedure whereby a party may suggest the
    appropriateness of convening the court in banc. It does not affect
    the power of a court of appeals to initiate in banc hearings sua
    sponte.
      The provision that a vote will not be taken as a result of the
    suggestion of the party unless requested by a judge of the court in
    regular active service or by a judge who was a member of the panel
    that rendered a decision sought to be reheard is intended to make
    it clear that a suggestion of a party as such does not require any
    action by the court. See Western Pacific Ry. Corp. v. Western
    Pacific Ry. Co., supra, 345 U.S. at 262, 73 S.Ct. 656. The rule
    merely authorizes a suggestion, imposes a time limit on suggestions
    for rehearings in banc, and provides that suggestions will be
    directed to the judges of the court in regular active service.
      In practice, the suggestion of a party that a case be reheard in
    banc is frequently contained in a petition for rehearing, commonly
    styled "petition for rehearing in banc." Such a petition is in fact
    merely a petition for a rehearing, with a suggestion that the case
    be reheard in banc. Since no response to the suggestion, as
    distinguished from the petition for rehearing, is required, the
    panel which heard the case may quite properly dispose of the
    petition without reference to the suggestion. In such a case the
    fact that no response has been made to the suggestion does not
    affect the finality of the judgment or the issuance of the mandate,
    and the final sentence of the rule expressly so provides.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1979 AMENDMENT       
      Under the present rule there is no specific provision for a
    response to a suggestion that an appeal be heard in banc. This has
    led to some uncertainty as to whether such a response may be filed.
    The proposed amendment would resolve this uncertainty.
      While the present rule provides a time limit for suggestions for
    rehearing in banc, it does not deal with the timing of a request
    that the appeal be heard in banc initially. The proposed amendment
    fills this gap as well, providing that the suggestion must be made
    by the date of which the appellee's brief is filed.
      Provision is made for circulating the suggestions to members of
    the panel despite the fact that senior judges on the panel would
    not be entitled to vote on whether a suggestion will be granted.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (d). Subdivision (d) is added; it authorizes the
    courts of appeals to prescribe the number of copies of suggestions
    for hearing or rehearing in banc that must be filed. Because the
    number of copies needed depends directly upon the number of judges
    in the circuit, local rules are the best vehicle for setting the
    required number of copies.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Several substantive changes are made in this rule, however.
      One of the purposes of the substantive amendments is to treat a
    request for a rehearing en banc like a petition for panel rehearing
    so that a request for a rehearing en banc will suspend the finality
    of the court of appeals' judgment and delay the running of the
    period for filing a petition for writ of certiorari. Companion
    amendments are made to Rule 41.
      Subdivision (a). The title of this subdivision is changed from
    "when hearing or rehearing in banc will be ordered" to "When
    Hearing or Rehearing En Banc May Be Ordered." The change emphasizes
    the discretion a court has with regard to granting en banc review.
      Subdivision (b). The term "petition" for rehearing en banc is
    substituted for the term "suggestion" for rehearing en banc. The
    terminology change reflects the Committee's intent to treat
    similarly a petition for panel rehearing and a request for a
    rehearing en banc. The terminology change also delays the running
    of the time for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari because
    Sup. Ct. R. 13.3 says:
      if a petition for rehearing is timely filed in the lower court by
      any party, the time to file the petition for a writ of certiorari
      for all parties . . . runs from the date of the denial of the
      petition for rehearing or, if the petition for rehearing is
      granted, the subsequent entry of judgment.
      The amendments also require each petition for en banc
    consideration to begin with a statement concisely demonstrating
    that the case meets the usual criteria for en banc consideration.
    It is the Committee's hope that requiring such a statement will
    cause the drafter of a petition to focus on the narrow grounds that
    support en banc consideration and to realize that a petition should
    not be filed unless the case meets those rigid standards.
      Intercircuit conflict is cited as one reason for asserting that a
    proceeding involves a question of "exceptional importance."
    Intercircuit conflicts create problems. When the circuits construe
    the same federal law differently, parties' rights and duties depend
    upon where a case is litigated. Given the increase in the number of
    cases decided by the federal courts and the limitation on the
    number of cases the Supreme Court can hear, conflicts between the
    circuits may remain unresolved by the Supreme Court for an extended
    period of time. The existence of an intercircuit conflict often
    generates additional litigation in the other circuits as well as in
    the circuits that are already in conflict. Although an en banc
    proceeding will not necessarily prevent intercircuit conflicts, an
    en banc proceeding provides a safeguard against unnecessary
    intercircuit conflicts.
      Some circuits have had rules or internal operating procedures
    that recognize a conflict with another circuit as a legitimate
    basis for granting a rehearing en banc. An intercircuit conflict
    may present a question of "exceptional importance" because of the
    costs that intercircuit conflicts impose on the system as a whole,
    in addition to the significance of the issues involved. It is not,
    however, the Committee's intent to make the granting of a hearing
    or rehearing en banc mandatory whenever there is an intercircuit
    conflict.
      The amendment states that "a petition may assert that a
    proceeding presents a question of exceptional importance if it
    involves an issue on which the panel decision conflicts with the
    authoritative decisions of every other United States Court of
    Appeals that has addressed the issue." [The Supreme Court revised
    the proposed amendment to Rule 35(b)(1)(B) by deleting "every"
    before "other United States Court of Appeals".] That language
    contemplates two situations in which a rehearing en banc may be
    appropriate. The first is when a panel decision creates a conflict.
    A panel decision creates a conflict when it conflicts with the
    decisions of all other circuits that have considered the issue. If
    a panel decision simply joins one side of an already existing
    conflict, a rehearing en banc may not be as important because it
    cannot avoid the conflict. The second situation that may be a
    strong candidate for a rehearing en banc is one in which the
    circuit persists in a conflict created by a pre-existing decision
    of the same circuit and no other circuits have joined on that side
    of the conflict. The amendment states that the conflict must be
    with an "authoritative" decision of another circuit.
    "Authoritative" is used rather than "published" because in some
    circuits unpublished opinions may be treated as authoritative.
      Counsel are reminded that their duty is fully discharged without
    filing a petition for rehearing en banc unless the case meets the
    rigid standards of subdivision (a) of this rule and even then the
    granting of a petition is entirely within the court's discretion.
      Paragraph (2) of this subdivision establishes a maximum length
    for a petition. Fifteen pages is the length currently used in
    several circuits. Each request for en banc consideration must be
    studied by every active judge of the court and is a serious call on
    limited judicial resources. The extraordinary nature of the issue
    or the threat to uniformity of the court's decision can be
    established in most cases in less than fifteen pages. A court may
    shorten the maximum length on a case by case basis but the rule
    does not permit a circuit to shorten the length by local rule. The
    Committee has retained page limits rather than using word or line
    counts similar to those in amended Rule 32 because there has not
    been a serious enough problem to justify importing the word and
    line-count and typeface requirements that are applicable to briefs
    into other contexts.
      Paragraph (3), although similar to (2), is separate because it
    deals with those instances in which a party files both a petition
    for rehearing en banc under this rule and a petition for panel
    rehearing under Rule 40.
      To improve the clarity of the rule, the material dealing with
    filing a response to a petition and with voting on a petition have
    been moved to new subdivisions (e) and (f).
      Subdivision (c). Two changes are made in this subdivision. First,
    the sentence stating that a request for a rehearing en banc does
    not affect the finality of the judgment or stay the issuance of the
    mandate is deleted. Second, the language permitting a party to
    include a request for rehearing en banc in a petition for panel
    rehearing is deleted. The Committee believes that those circuits
    that want to require two separate documents should have the option
    to do so.
      Subdivision (e). This is a new subdivision. The substance of the
    subdivision, however, was drawn from former subdivision (b). The
    only changes are stylistic; no substantive changes are intended.
      Subdivision (f). This is a new subdivision. The substance of the
    subdivision, however, was drawn from former subdivision (b).
      Because of the discretionary nature of the en banc procedure, the
    filing of a suggestion for rehearing en banc has not required a
    vote; a vote is taken only when requested by a judge. It is not the
    Committee's intent to change the discretionary nature of the
    procedure or to require a vote on a petition for rehearing en banc.
    The rule continues, therefore, to provide that a court is not
    obligated to vote on such petitions. It is necessary, however, that
    each court develop a procedure for disposing of such petitions
    because they will suspend the finality of the court's judgment and
    toll the time for filing a petition for certiorari.
      Former subdivision (b) contained language directing the clerk to
    distribute a "suggestion" to certain judges and indicating which
    judges may call for a vote. New subdivision (f) does not address
    those issues because they deal with internal court procedures.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a). Two national standards - 28 U.S.C. Sec. 46(c)
    and Rule 35(a) - provide that a hearing or rehearing en banc may be
    ordered by "a majority of the circuit judges who are in regular
    active service." Although these standards apply to all of the
    courts of appeals, the circuits are deeply divided over the
    interpretation of this language when one or more active judges are
    disqualified.
      The Supreme Court has never addressed this issue. In Shenker v.
    Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co., 374 U.S. 1 (1963), the Court rejected a
    petitioner's claim that his rights under Sec. 46(c) had been
    violated when the Third Circuit refused to rehear his case en banc.
    The Third Circuit had 8 active judges at the time; 4 voted in favor
    of rehearing the case, 2 against, and 2 abstained. No judge was
    disqualified. The Supreme Court ruled against the petitioner,
    holding, in essence, that Sec. 46(c) did not provide a cause of
    action, but instead simply gave litigants "the right to know the
    administrative machinery that will be followed and the right to
    suggest that the en banc procedure be set in motion in his case."
    Id. at 5. Shenker did stress that a court of appeals has broad
    discretion in establishing internal procedures to handle requests
    for rehearings - or, as Shenker put it, " 'to devise its own
    administrative machinery to provide the means whereby a majority
    may order such a hearing.' " Id. (quoting Western Pac. R.R. Corp.
    v. Western Pac. R.R. Co., 345 U.S. 247, 250 (1953) (emphasis
    added)). But Shenker did not address what is meant by "a majority"
    in Sec. 46(c) (or Rule 35(a), which did not yet exist) - and
    Shenker certainly did not suggest that the phrase should have
    different meanings in different circuits.
      In interpreting that phrase, 7 of the courts of appeals follow
    the "absolute majority" approach. See Marie Leary, Defining the
    "Majority" Vote Requirement in Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure
    35(a) for Rehearings En Banc in the United States Courts of Appeals
    8 tbl.1 (Federal Judicial Center 2002). Under this approach,
    disqualified judges are counted in the base in calculating whether
    a majority of judges have voted to hear a case en banc. Thus, in a
    circuit with 12 active judges, 7 must vote to hear a case en banc.
    If 5 of the 12 active judges are disqualified, all 7 non-
    disqualified judges must vote to hear the case en banc. The votes
    of 6 of the 7 non-disqualified judges are not enough, as 6 is not a
    majority of 12.
      Six of the courts of appeals follow the "case majority" approach.
    Id. Under this approach, disqualified judges are not counted in the
    base in calculating whether a majority of judges have voted to hear
    a case en banc. Thus, in a case in which 5 of a circuit's 12 active
    judges are disqualified, only 4 judges (a majority of the 7 non-
    disqualified judges) must vote to hear a case en banc. (The First
    and Third Circuits explicitly qualify the case majority approach by
    providing that a case cannot be heard en banc unless a majority of
    all active judges - disqualified and non-disqualified - are
    eligible to participate.)
      Rule 35(a) has been amended to adopt the case majority approach
    as a uniform national interpretation of Sec. 46(c). The federal
    rules of practice and procedure exist to "maintain consistency,"
    which Congress has equated with "promot[ing] the interest of
    justice." 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2073(b). The courts of appeals should not
    follow two inconsistent approaches in deciding whether sufficient
    votes exist to hear a case en banc, especially when there is a
    governing statute and governing rule that apply to all circuits and
    that use identical terms, and especially when there is nothing
    about the local conditions of each circuit that justifies
    conflicting approaches.
      The case majority approach represents the better interpretation
    of the phrase "the circuit judges . . . in regular active service"
    in the first sentence of Sec. 46(c). The second sentence of Sec.
    46(c) - which defines which judges are eligible to participate in a
    case being heard or reheard en banc - uses the similar expression
    "all circuit judges in regular active service." It is clear that
    "all circuit judges in regular active service" in the second
    sentence does not include disqualified judges, as disqualified
    judges clearly cannot participate in a case being heard or reheard
    en banc. Therefore, assuming that two nearly identical phrases
    appearing in adjacent sentences in a statute should be interpreted
    in the same way, the best reading of "the circuit judges . . . in
    regular active service" in the first sentence of Sec. 46(c) is that
    it, too, does not include disqualified judges.
      This interpretation of Sec. 46(c) is bolstered by the fact that
    the case majority approach has at least two major advantages over
    the absolute majority approach:
      First, under the absolute majority approach, a disqualified judge
    is, as a practical matter, counted as voting against hearing a case
    en banc. This defeats the purpose of recusal. To the extent
    possible, the disqualification of a judge should not result in the
    equivalent of a vote for or against hearing a case en banc.
      Second, the absolute majority approach can leave the en banc
    court helpless to overturn a panel decision with which almost all
    of the circuit's active judges disagree. For example, in a case in
    which 5 of a circuit's 12 active judges are disqualified, the case
    cannot be heard en banc even if 6 of the 7 non-disqualified judges
    strongly disagree with the panel opinion. This permits one active
    judge - perhaps sitting on a panel with a visiting judge -
    effectively to control circuit precedent, even over the objection
    of all of his or her colleagues. See Gulf Power Co. v. FCC, 226
    F.3d 1220, 1222-23 (11th Cir. 2000) (Carnes, J., concerning the
    denial of reh'g en banc), rev'd sub nom. National Cable & Telecomm.
    Ass'n, Inc. v. Gulf Power Co., 534 U.S. 327 (2002). Even though the
    en banc court may, in a future case, be able to correct an
    erroneous legal interpretation, the en banc court will never be
    able to correct the injustice inflicted by the panel on the parties
    to the case. Morever [sic], it may take many years before
    sufficient non-disqualified judges can be mustered to overturn the
    panel's erroneous legal interpretation. In the meantime, the lower
    courts of the circuit must apply - and the citizens of the circuit
    must conform their behavior to - an interpretation of the law that
    almost all of the circuit's active judges believe is incorrect.
      The amendment to Rule 35(a) is not meant to alter or affect the
    quorum requirement of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 46(d). In particular, the
    amendment is not intended to foreclose the possibility that Sec.
    46(d) might be read to require that more than half of all circuit
    judges in regular active service be eligible to participate in
    order for the court to hear or rehear a case en banc.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment. The Committee Note was
    modified in three respects. First, the Note was changed to put more
    emphasis on the fact that the case majority rule is the best
    interpretation of Sec. 46(c). Second, the Note now clarifies that
    nothing in the proposed amendment is intended to foreclose courts
    from interpreting 28 U.S.C. Sec. 46(d) to provide that a case
    cannot be heard or reheard en banc unless a majority of all judges
    in regular active service - disqualified or not - are eligible to
    participate. Finally, a couple of arguments made by supporters of
    the amendment to Rule 35(a) were incorporated into the Note.

      (a) Entry. A judgment is entered when it is noted on the docket.
    The clerk must prepare, sign, and enter the judgment:
        (1) after receiving the court's opinion - but if settlement of
      the judgment's form is required, after final settlement; or

      This is the typical rule. See 1st Cir. Rule 29; 3rd Cir. Rule 32;
    6th Cir. Rule 21. At present, uncertainty exists as to the date of
    entry of judgment when the opinion directs subsequent settlement of
    the precise terms of the judgment, a common practice in cases
    involving enforcement of agency orders. See Stern and Gressman,
    Supreme Court Practice, p. 203 (3d Ed., 1962). The principle of
    finality suggests that in such cases entry of judgment should be
    delayed until approval of the judgment in final form.

    Rule 37. Interest on Judgment

-STATUTE-
      (a) When the Court Affirms. Unless the law provides otherwise, if
    a money judgment in a civil case is affirmed, whatever interest is
    allowed by law is payable from the date when the district court's
    judgment was entered.
      (b) When the Court Reverses. If the court modifies or reverses a
    judgment with a direction that a money judgment be entered in the
    district court, the mandate must contain instructions about the
    allowance of interest.

      The first sentence makes it clear that if a money judgment is
    affirmed in the court of appeals, the interest which attaches to
    money judgments by force of law (see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1961 and Sec.
    2411) upon their initial entry is payable as if no appeal had been
    taken, whether or not the mandate makes mention of interest. There
    has been some confusion on this point. See Blair v. Durham, 139
    F.2d 260 (6th Cir., 1943) and cases cited therein.
      In reversing or modifying the judgment of the district court, the
    court of appeals may direct the entry of a money judgment, as, for
    example, when the court of appeals reverses a judgment
    notwithstanding the verdict and directs entry of judgment on the
    verdict. In such a case the question may arise as to whether
    interest is to run from the date of entry of the judgment directed
    by the court of appeals or from the date on which the judgment
    would have been entered in the district court except for the
    erroneous ruling corrected on appeal. In Briggs v. Pennsylvania R.
    Co., 334 U.S. 304, 68 S.Ct. 1039, 92 L.Ed. 1403 (1948), the Court
    held that where the mandate of the court of appeals directed entry
    of judgment upon a verdict but made no mention of interest from the
    date of the verdict to the date of the entry of the judgment
    directed by the mandate, the district court was powerless to add
    such interest. The second sentence of the proposed rule is a
    reminder to the court, the clerk and counsel of the Briggs rule.
    Since the rule directs that the matter of interest be disposed of
    by the mandate, in cases where interest is simply overlooked, a
    party who conceives himself entitled to interest from a date other
    than the date of entry of judgment in accordance with the mandate
    should be entitled to seek recall of the mandate for determination
    of the question.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

-HEAD-
    Rule 38. Frivolous Appeal - Damages and Costs

-STATUTE-
      If a court of appeals determines that an appeal is frivolous, it
    may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and
    reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or
    double costs to the appellee.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      Compare 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1912. While both the statute and the usual
    rule on the subject by courts of appeals (Fourth Circuit Rule 20 is
    a typical rule) speak of "damages for delay," the courts of appeals
    quite properly allow damages, attorney's fees and other expenses
    incurred by an appellee if the appeal is frivolous without
    requiring a showing that the appeal resulted in delay. See
    Dunscombe v. Sayle, 340 F.2d 311 (5th Cir., 1965), cert. den., 382
    U.S. 814, 86 S.Ct. 32, 15 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965); Lowe v. Willacy, 239
    F.2d 179 (9th Cir., 1956); Griffith Wellpoint Corp. v. Munro-
    Langstroth, Inc., 269 F.2d 64 (1st Cir., 1959); Ginsburg v. Stern,
    295 F.2d 698 (3d Cir., 1961). The subjects of interest and damages
    are separately regulated, contrary to the present practice of
    combining the two (see Fourth Circuit Rule 20) to make it clear
    that the awards are distinct and independent. Interest is provided
    for by law; damages are awarded by the court in its discretion in
    the case of a frivolous appeal as a matter of justice to the
    appellee and as a penalty against the appellant.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment requires that before a court of appeals may impose
    sanctions, the person to be sanctioned must have notice and an
    opportunity to respond. The amendment reflects the basic principle
    enunciated in the Supreme Court's opinion in Roadway Express, Inc.
    v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752, 767 (1980), that notice and opportunity to
    respond must precede the imposition of sanctions. A separately
    filed motion requesting sanctions constitutes notice. A statement
    inserted in a party's brief that the party moves for sanctions is
    not sufficient notice. Requests in briefs for sanctions have become
    so commonplace that it is unrealistic to expect careful responses
    to such requests without any indication that the court is actually
    contemplating such measures. Only a motion, the purpose of which is
    to request sanctions, is sufficient. If there is no such motion
    filed, notice must come from the court. The form of notice from the
    court and of the opportunity for comment purposely are left to the
    court's discretion.

    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
    TITLE VII. GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 39. Costs

-STATUTE-
      (a) Against Whom Assessed. The following rules apply unless the
    law provides or the court orders otherwise:
        (1) if an appeal is dismissed, costs are taxed against the
      appellant, unless the parties agree otherwise;
        (2) if a judgment is affirmed, costs are taxed against the
      appellant;
        (3) if a judgment is reversed, costs are taxed against the
      appellee;
        (4) if a judgment is affirmed in part, reversed in part,
      modified, or vacated, costs are taxed only as the court orders.

      (b) Costs For and Against the United States. Costs for or against
    the United States, its agency, or officer will be assessed under
    Rule 39(a) only if authorized by law.
      (c) Costs of Copies. Each court of appeals must, by local rule,
    fix the maximum rate for taxing the cost of producing necessary
    copies of a brief or appendix, or copies of records authorized by
    Rule 30(f). The rate must not exceed that generally charged for
    such work in the area where the clerk's office is located and
    should encourage economical methods of copying.
      (d) Bill of Costs: Objections; Insertion in Mandate.
        (1) A party who wants costs taxed must - within 14 days after
      entry of judgment - file with the circuit clerk, with proof of
      service, an itemized and verified bill of costs.
        (2) Objections must be filed within 14 days after service of
      the bill of costs, unless the court extends the time.
        (3) The clerk must prepare and certify an itemized statement of
      costs for insertion in the mandate, but issuance of the mandate
      must not be delayed for taxing costs. If the mandate issues
      before costs are finally determined, the district clerk must -
      upon the circuit clerk's request - add the statement of costs, or
      any amendment of it, to the mandate.

      (e) Costs on Appeal Taxable in the District Court. The following
    costs on appeal are taxable in the district court for the benefit
    of the party entitled to costs under this rule:
        (1) the preparation and transmission of the record;
        (2) the reporter's transcript, if needed to determine the
      appeal;
        (3) premiums paid for a supersedeas bond or other bond to
      preserve rights pending appeal; and
        (4) the fee for filing the notice of appeal.

-MISC1-
                NOTES ON ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      Subdivision (a). Statutory authorization for taxation of costs is
    found in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1920. The provisions of this subdivision
    follow the usual practice in the circuits. A few statutes contain
    specific provisions in derogation of these general provisions. (See
    28 U.S.C. Sec. 1928, which forbids the award of costs to a
    successful plaintiff in a patent infringement action under the
    circumstances described by the statute). These statutes are
    controlling in cases to which they apply.
      Subdivision (b). The rules of the courts of appeals at present
    commonly deny costs to the United States except as allowance may be
    directed by statute. Those rules were promulgated at a time when
    the United States was generally invulnerable to an award of costs
    against it, and they appear to be based on the view that if the
    United States is not subject to costs if it loses, it ought not be
    entitled to recover costs if it wins.
      The number of cases affected by such rules has been greatly
    reduced by the Act of July 18, 1966, 80 Stat. 308 (1 U.S. Code
    Cong. & Ad. News, p. 349 (1966), 89th Cong., 2d Sess., which
    amended 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2412, the former general bar to the award of
    costs against the United States. Section 2412 as amended generally
    places the United States on the same footing as private parties
    with respect to the award of costs in civil cases. But the United
    States continues to enjoy immunity from costs in certain cases. By
    its terms amended section 2412 authorizes an award of costs against
    the United States only in civil actions, and it excepts from its
    general authorization of an award of costs against the United
    States cases which are "otherwise specifically provided (for) by
    statute." Furthermore, the Act of July 18, 1966, supra, provides
    that the amendments of section 2412 which it effects shall apply
    only to actions filed subsequent to the date of its enactment. The
    second clause continues in effect, for these and all other cases in
    which the United States enjoys immunity from costs, the presently
    prevailing rule that the United States may recover costs as the
    prevailing party only if it would have suffered them as the losing
    party.
      Subdivision (c). While only five circuits (D.C. Cir. Rule 20(d);
    1st Cir. Rule 31(4); 3d Cir. Rule 35(4); 4th Cir. Rule 21(4); 9th
    Cir. Rule 25, as amended June 2, 1967) presently tax the cost of
    printing briefs, the proposed rule makes the cost taxable in
    keeping with the principle of this rule that all cost items
    expended in the prosecution of a proceeding should be borne by the
    unsuccessful party.
      Subdivision (e). The costs described in this subdivision are
    costs of the appeal and, as such, are within the undertaking of the
    appeal bond. They are made taxable in the district court for
    general convenience. Taxation of the cost of the reporter's
    transcript is specifically authorized by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1920, but
    in the absence of a rule some district courts have held themselves
    without authority to tax the cost (Perlman v. Feldmann, 116 F.Supp.
    102 (D.Conn., 1953); Firtag v. Gendleman, 152 F.Supp. 226 (D.D.C.,
    1957); Todd Atlantic Shipyards Corps. v. The Southport, 100 F.Supp.
    763 (E.D.S.C., 1951). Provision for taxation of the cost of
    premiums paid for supersedeas bonds is common in the local rules of
    district courts and the practice is established in the Second,
    Seventh, and Ninth Circuits. Berner v. British Commonwealth Pacific
    Air Lines, Ltd., 362 F.2d 799 (2d Cir. 1966); Land Oberoesterreich
    v. Gude, 93 F.2d 292 (2d Cir., 1937); In re Northern Ind. Oil Co.,
    192 F.2d 139 (7th Cir., 1951); Lunn v. F. W. Woolworth, 210 F.2d
    159 (9th Cir., 1954).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1979 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (c). The proposed amendment would permit variations
    among the circuits in regulating the maximum rates taxable as costs
    for printing or otherwise reproducing briefs, appendices, and
    copies of records authorized by Rule 30(f). The present rule has
    had a different effect in different circuits depending upon the
    size of the circuit, the location of the clerk's office, and the
    location of other cities. As a consequence there was a growing
    sense that strict adherence to the rule produces some unfairness in
    some of the circuits and the matter should be made subject to local
    rule.
      Subdivision (d). The present rule makes no provision for
    objections to a bill of costs. The proposed amendment would allow
    10 days for such objections. Cf. Rule 54(d) of the F.R.C.P. It
    provides further that the mandate shall not be delayed for taxation
    of costs.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1986 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment to subdivision (c) is intended to increase the
    degree of control exercised by the courts of appeals over rates for
    printing and copying recoverable as costs. It further requires the
    courts of appeals to encourage cost-consciousness by requiring
    that, in fixing the rate, the court consider the most economical
    methods of printing and copying.
      The amendment to subdivision (d) is technical. No substantive
    change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only. All
    references to the cost of "printing" have been deleted from
    subdivision (c) because commercial printing is so rarely used for
    preparation of documents filed with a court of appeals.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT

    Rule 40. Petition for Panel Rehearing

-STATUTE-
      (a) Time to File; Contents; Answer; Action by the Court if
    Granted.
        (1) Time. Unless the time is shortened or extended by order or
      local rule, a petition for panel rehearing may be filed within 14
      days after entry of judgment. But in a civil case, if the United
      States or its officer or agency is a party, the time within which
      any party may seek rehearing is 45 days after entry of judgment,
      unless an order shortens or extends the time.
        (2) Contents. The petition must state with particularity each
      point of law or fact that the petitioner believes the court has
      overlooked or misapprehended and must argue in support of the
      petition. Oral argument is not permitted.
        (3) Answer. Unless the court requests, no answer to a petition
      for panel rehearing is permitted. But ordinarily rehearing will
      not be granted in the absence of such a request.
        (4) Action by the Court. If a petition for panel rehearing is
      granted, the court may do any of the following:
          (A) make a final disposition of the case without reargument;
          (B) restore the case to the calendar for reargument or
        resubmission; or
          (C) issue any other appropriate order.

      (b) Form of Petition; Length. The petition must comply in form
    with Rule 32. Copies must be served and filed as Rule 31
    prescribes. Unless the court permits or a local rule provides
    otherwise, a petition for panel rehearing must not exceed 15 pages.

      This is the usual rule among the circuits, except that the
    express prohibition against filing a reply to the petition is found
    only in the rules of the Fourth, Sixth and Eighth Circuits (it is
    also contained in Supreme Court Rule 58(3)). It is included to save
    time and expense to the party victorious on appeal. In the very
    rare instances in which a reply is useful, the court will ask for
    it.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1979 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The Standing Committee added to the first
    sentence of Rule 40(a) the words "or by local rule," to conform to
    current practice in the circuits. The Standing Committee believes
    the change noncontroversial.
      Subdivision (b). The proposed amendment would eliminate the
    distinction drawn in the present rule between printed briefs and
    those duplicated from typewritten pages in fixing their maximum
    length. See Note to Rule 28. Since petitions for rehearing must be
    prepared in a short time, making typographic printing less likely,
    the maximum number of pages is fixed at 15, the figure used in the
    present rule for petitions duplicated by means other than
    typographic printing.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The amendment lengthens the time for filing a
    petition for rehearing from 14 to 45 days in civil cases involving
    the United States or its agencies or officers. It has no effect
    upon the time for filing in criminal cases. The amendment makes
    nation-wide the current practice in the District of Columbia and
    the Tenth Circuits, see D.C. Cir. R. 15(a), 10th Cir. R. 40.3. This
    amendment, analogous to the provision in Rule 4(a) extending the
    time for filing a notice of appeal in cases involving the United
    States, recognizes that the Solicitor General needs time to conduct
    a thorough review of the merits of a case before requesting a
    rehearing. In a case in which a court of appeals believes it
    necessary to restrict the time for filing a rehearing petition, the
    amendment provides that the court may do so by order. Although the
    first sentence of Rule 40 permits a court of appeals to shorten or
    lengthen the usual 14 day filing period by order or by local rule,
    the sentence governing appeals in civil cases involving the United
    States purposely limits a court's power to alter the 45 day period
    to orders in specific cases. If a court of appeals could adopt a
    local rule shortening the time for filing a petition for rehearing
    in all cases involving the United States, the purpose of the
    amendment would be defeated.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

-HEAD-
    Rule 41. Mandate: Contents; Issuance and Effective Date; Stay

-STATUTE-
      (a) Contents. Unless the court directs that a formal mandate
    issue, the mandate consists of a certified copy of the judgment, a
    copy of the court's opinion, if any, and any direction about costs.
      (b) When Issued. The court's mandate must issue 7 days after the
    time to file a petition for rehearing expires, or 7 days after
    entry of an order denying a timely petition for panel rehearing,
    petition for rehearing en banc, or motion for stay of mandate,
    whichever is later. The court may shorten or extend the time.
      (c) Effective Date. The mandate is effective when issued.
      (d) Staying the Mandate.
        (1) On Petition for Rehearing or Motion. The timely filing of a
      petition for panel rehearing, petition for rehearing en banc, or
      motion for stay of mandate, stays the mandate until disposition
      of the petition or motion, unless the court orders otherwise.
        (2) Pending Petition for Certiorari.
          (A) A party may move to stay the mandate pending the filing
        of a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court.
        The motion must be served on all parties and must show that the
        certiorari petition would present a substantial question and
        that there is good cause for a stay.
          (B) The stay must not exceed 90 days, unless the period is
        extended for good cause or unless the party who obtained the
        stay files a petition for the writ and so notifies the circuit
        clerk in writing within the period of the stay. In that case,
        the stay continues until the Supreme Court's final disposition.
          (C) The court may require a bond or other security as a
        condition to granting or continuing a stay of the mandate.
          (D) The court of appeals must issue the mandate immediately
        when a copy of a Supreme Court order denying the petition for

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      The proposed rule follows the rule or practice in a majority of
    circuits by which copies of the opinion and the judgment serve in
    lieu of a formal mandate in the ordinary case. Compare Supreme
    Court Rule 59. Although 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2101(c) permits a writ of
    certiorari to be filed within 90 days after entry of judgment,
    seven of the eight circuits which now regulate the matter of stays
    pending application for certiorari limit the initial stay of the
    mandate to the 30-day period provided in the proposed rule. Compare
    D.C. Cir. Rule 27(e).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The amendment conforms Rule 41(a) to the
    amendment made to Rule 40(a). The amendment keys the time for
    issuance of the mandate to the expiration of the time for filing a
    petition for rehearing, unless such a petition is filed in which
    case the mandate issues 7 days after the entry of the order denying
    the petition. Because the amendment to Rule 40(a) lengthens the
    time for filing a petition for rehearing in civil cases involving
    the United States from 14 to 45 days, the rule requiring the
    mandate to issue 21 days after the entry of judgment would cause
    the mandate to issue while the government is still considering
    requesting a rehearing. Therefore, the amendment generally requires
    the mandate to issue 7 days after the expiration of the time for
    filing a petition for rehearing.
      Subdivision (b). The amendment requires a party who files a
    motion requesting a stay of mandate to file, at the same time,
    proof of service on all other parties. The old rule required the
    party to give notice to the other parties; the amendment merely
    requires the party to provide the court with evidence of having
    done so.
      The amendment also states that the motion must show that a
    petition for certiorari would present a substantial question and
    that there is good cause for a stay. The amendment is intended to
    alert the parties to the fact that a stay of mandate is not granted
    automatically and to the type of showing that needs to be made. The
    Supreme Court has established conditions that must be met before it
    will stay a mandate. See Robert L. Stern et al., Supreme Court
    Practice Sec. 17.19 (6th ed. 1986).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Several substantive changes are made in this rule, however.
      Subdivision (b). The existing rule provides that the mandate
    issues 7 days after the time to file a petition for panel rehearing
    expires unless such a petition is timely filed. If the petition is
    denied, the mandate issues 7 days after entry of the order denying
    the petition. Those provisions are retained but the amendments
    further provide that if a timely petition for rehearing en banc or
    motion for stay of mandate is filed, the mandate does not issue
    until 7 days after entry of an order denying the last of all such
    requests. If a petition for rehearing or a petition for rehearing
    en banc is granted, the court enters a new judgment after the
    rehearing and the mandate issues within the normal time after entry
    of that judgment.
      Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) is new. It provides that the
    mandate is effective when the court issues it. A court of appeals'
    judgment or order is not final until issuance of the mandate; at
    that time the parties' obligations become fixed. This amendment is
    intended to make it clear that the mandate is effective upon
    issuance and that its effectiveness is not delayed until receipt of
    the mandate by the trial court or agency, or until the trial court
    or agency acts upon it. This amendment is consistent with the
    current understanding. Unless the court orders that the mandate
    issue earlier than provided in the rule, the parties can easily
    calculate the anticipated date of issuance and verify issuance with
    the clerk's office. In those instances in which the court orders
    earlier issuance of the mandate, the entry of the order on the
    docket alerts the parties to that fact.
      Subdivision (d). Amended paragraph (1) provides that the filing
    of a petition for panel rehearing, a petition for rehearing en banc
    or a motion for a stay of mandate pending petition to the Supreme
    Court for a writ of certiorari stays the issuance of the mandate
    until the court disposes of the petition or motion. The provision
    that a petition for rehearing en banc stays the mandate is a
    companion to the amendment of Rule 35 that deletes the language
    stating that a request for a rehearing en banc does not affect the
    finality of the judgment or stay the issuance of the mandate. The
    Committee's objective is to treat a request for a rehearing en banc
    like a petition for panel rehearing so that a request for a
    rehearing en banc will suspend the finality of the court of
    appeals' judgment and delay the running of the period for filing a
    petition for writ of certiorari. Because the filing of a petition
    for rehearing en banc will stay the mandate, a court of appeals
    will need to take final action on the petition but the procedure
    for doing so is left to local practice.
      Paragraph (1) also provides that the filing of a motion for a
    stay of mandate pending petition to the Supreme Court for a writ of
    certiorari stays the mandate until the court disposes of the
    motion. If the court denies the motion, the court must issue the
    mandate 7 days after entering the order denying the motion. If the
    court grants the motion, the mandate is stayed according to the
    terms of the order granting the stay. Delaying issuance of the
    mandate eliminates the need to recall the mandate if the motion for
    a stay is granted. If, however, the court believes that it would be
    inappropriate to delay issuance of the mandate until disposition of
    the motion for a stay, the court may order that the mandate issue
    immediately.
      Paragraph (2). The amendment changes the maximum period for a
    stay of mandate, absent the court of appeals granting an extension
    for cause, to 90 days. The presumptive 30-day period was adopted
    when a party had to file a petition for a writ of certiorari in
    criminal cases within 30 days after entry of judgment. Supreme
    Court Rule 13.1 now provides that a party has 90 days after entry
    of judgment by a court of appeals to file a petition for a writ of
    certiorari whether the case is civil or criminal.
      The amendment does not require a court of appeals to grant a stay
    of mandate that is coextensive with the period granted for filing a
    petition for a writ of certiorari. The granting of a stay and the
    length of the stay remain within the discretion of the court of
    appeals. The amendment means only that a 90-day stay may be granted
    without a need to show cause for a stay longer than 30 days.
      Subparagraph (C) is not new; it has been moved from the end of
    the rule to this position.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b) directs that the mandate of a
    court must issue 7 days after the time to file a petition for
    rehearing expires or 7 days after the court denies a timely
    petition for panel rehearing, petition for rehearing en banc, or
    motion for stay of mandate, whichever is later. Intermediate
    Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are counted in computing
    that 7-day deadline, which means that, except when the 7-day
    deadline ends on a weekend or legal holiday, the mandate issues
    exactly one week after the triggering event.
      Fed. R. App. P. 26(a)(2) has been amended to provide that, in
    computing any period of time, one should "[e]xclude intermediate
    Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays when the period is less than
    11 days, unless stated in calendar days." This change in the method
    of computing deadlines means that 7-day deadlines (such as that in
    subdivision (b)) have been lengthened as a practical matter. Under
    the new computation method, a mandate would never issue sooner than
    9 actual days after a triggering event, and legal holidays could
    extend that period to as much as 13 days.
      Delaying mandates for 9 or more days would introduce significant
    and unwarranted delay into appellate proceedings. For that reason,
    subdivision (b) has been amended to require that mandates issue 7
    calendar days after a triggering event.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Under former Rule 26(a), short periods that span weekends or
    holidays were computed without counting those weekends or holidays.
    To specify that a period should be calculated by counting all
    intermediate days, including weekends or holidays, the Rules used
    the term "calendar days." Rule 26(a) now takes a "days-are-days"
    approach under which all intermediate days are counted, no matter
    how short the period. Accordingly, "7 calendar days" in subdivision
    (b) is amended to read simply "7 days."
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. The Appellate Rules
    Committee made only one change to Rule 26(a) after publication and
    comment: Because the Committee is seeking permission to publish for
    comment a proposed new Rule 1(b) that would adopt a FRAP-wide
    definition of the term "state," the Committee decided to delete
    from Rule 26(a)(6)(B) the following parenthetical sentence: "(In
    this rule, 'state' includes the District of Columbia and any United
    States commonwealth, territory, or possession.)" That change
    required the corresponding deletion - from the Note to Rule
    26(a)(6) - of part of the final sentence (the deleted portion read
    ", and defines the term 'state' - for purposes of subdivision
    (a)(6) - to include the District of Columbia and any commonwealth,
    territory or possession of the United States. Thus, for purposes of
    subdivision (a)(6)'s definition of 'legal holiday,' 'state'
    includes the District of Columbia, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S.
    Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the
    Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.")
      The Appellate Rules Committee made one change to its proposed
    amendments concerning Appellate Rules deadlines. Based on comments
    received with respect to the timing for motions that toll the time
    for taking a civil appeal, the Committee changed the cutoff time in
    Rule 4(a)(4)(A)(vi) to 28 days (rather than to 30 days as in the
    published proposal). The published proposal's choice of 30 days had
    been designed to accord with the proposed amendments published by
    the Civil Rules Committee, which would have extended the deadline
    for tolling motions to 30 days. Because 30 days is also the time
    period set by Appellate Rule 4 and by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2107 for
    taking a civil appeal (when the United States and its officers or
    agencies are not parties), commentators pointed out that adopting
    30 days as the cutoff for filing tolling motions would sometimes
    place would-be appellants in an awkward position: If the deadline
    for making a tolling motion falls on the same day as the deadline
    for filing a notice of appeal, then in a case involving multiple
    parties on one side, a litigant who wishes to appeal may not know,
    when filing the notice of appeal, whether a tolling motion will be
    filed; such a timing system can be expected to produce instances
    when appeals are filed, only to go into abeyance while the tolling
    motion is resolved.
      By the time of the Appellate Rules Committee's April 2008
    meeting, the Civil Rules Committee had discussed this issue and had
    determined that the best resolution would be to extend the deadline
    for tolling motions to 28 days rather than 30 days. The choice of a
    28-day deadline responds to the concerns of those who feel that the
    current 10-day deadlines are much too short, but also takes into
    account the problem of the 30-day appeal deadline. As described in
    the draft minutes of the Committee's April meeting, Committee
    members carefully discussed the relevant concerns and determined,
    by a vote of 7 to 1, to assent to the 28-day time period for
    tolling motions and to change the cutoff time in Rule
    4(a)(4)(A)(vi) to 28 days.
      The Standing Committee changed Rule 26(a)(6) to exclude state
    holidays from the definition of "legal holiday" for purposes of
    computing backward-counted periods; conforming changes were made to
    the Committee Note.

    FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE

-HEAD-
    Rule 43. Substitution of Parties

-STATUTE-
      (a) Death of a Party.
        (1) After Notice of Appeal Is Filed. If a party dies after a
      notice of appeal has been filed or while a proceeding is pending
      in the court of appeals, the decedent's personal representative
      may be substituted as a party on motion filed with the circuit
      clerk by the representative or by any party. A party's motion
      must be served on the representative in accordance with Rule 25.
      If the decedent has no representative, any party may suggest the
      death on the record, and the court of appeals may then direct
      appropriate proceedings.
        (2) Before Notice of Appeal Is Filed - Potential Appellant. If
      a party entitled to appeal dies before filing a notice of appeal,
      the decedent's personal representative - or, if there is no
      personal representative, the decedent's attorney of record - may
      file a notice of appeal within the time prescribed by these
      rules. After the notice of appeal is filed, substitution must be
      in accordance with Rule 43(a)(1).
        (3) Before Notice of Appeal Is Filed - Potential Appellee. If a
      party against whom an appeal may be taken dies after entry of a
      judgment or order in the district court, but before a notice of
      appeal is filed, an appellant may proceed as if the death had not
      occurred. After the notice of appeal is filed, substitution must
      be in accordance with Rule 43(a)(1).

      (b) Substitution for a Reason Other Than Death. If a party needs
    to be substituted for any reason other than death, the procedure
    prescribed in Rule 43(a) applies.
      (c) Public Officer: Identification; Substitution.
        (1) Identification of Party. A public officer who is a party to
      an appeal or other proceeding in an official capacity may be
      described as a party by the public officer's official title
      rather than by name. But the court may require the public
      officer's name to be added.
        (2) Automatic Substitution of Officeholder. When a public
      officer who is a party to an appeal or other proceeding in an
      official capacity dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold
      office, the action does not abate. The public officer's successor
      is automatically substituted as a party. Proceedings following
      the substitution are to be in the name of the substituted party,
      but any misnomer that does not affect the substantial rights of
      the parties may be disregarded. An order of substitution may be
      entered at any time, but failure to enter an order does not
      affect the substitution.

    similar to the rule on substitution in civil actions in the
    district court. See FRCP 25(a). The fourth sentence expressly
    authorizes an appeal to be taken against one who has died after the
    entry of judgment. Compare FRCP 73(b), which impliedly authorizes
    such an appeal.
      The sixth sentence authorizes an attorney of record for the
    deceased to take an appeal on behalf of successors in interest if
    the deceased has no representative. At present, if a party entitled
    to appeal dies before the notice of appeal is filed, the appeal can
    presumably be taken only by his legal representative and must be
    taken within the time ordinarily prescribed. 13 Cyclopedia of

      This rule is now found in the rules of a majority of the
    circuits. It is in response to the Act of August 24, 1937 (28
    U.S.C. Sec. 2403), which requires all courts of the United States
    to advise the Attorney General of the existence of an action or
    proceeding of the kind described in the rule.

      The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily

    understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make
    style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 44 requires that a party who "questions the
    constitutionality of an Act of Congress" in a proceeding in which
    the United States is not a party must provide written notice of
    that challenge to the clerk. Rule 44 is designed to implement 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 2403(a), which states that: "In any action, suit or
    proceeding in a court of the United States to which the United
    States or any agency, officer or employee thereof is not a party,
    wherein the constitutionality of any Act of Congress affecting the
    public interest is drawn in question, the court shall certify such
    fact to the Attorney General, and shall permit the United States to
    intervene . . . for argument on the question of constitutionality."
      The subsequent section of the statute - Sec. 2403(b) - contains
    virtually identical language imposing upon the courts the duty to
    notify the attorney general of a state of a constitutional
    challenge to any statute of that state. But Sec. 2403(b), unlike
    Sec. 2403(a), was not implemented in Rule 44.
      Rule 44 has been amended to correct this omission. The text of
    former Rule 44 regarding constitutional challenges to federal
    statutes now appears as Rule 44(a), while new language regarding
    constitutional challenges to state statutes now appears as Rule
    44(b).

      deputy in attendance must be open during business hours on all
      days except Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. A court may
      provide by local rule or by order that the clerk's office be open
      for specified hours on Saturdays or on legal holidays other than
      New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's
      Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus
      Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.

      (b) Records.
        (1) The Docket. The circuit clerk must maintain a docket and an
      index of all docketed cases in the manner prescribed by the
      Director of the Administrative Office of the United States
      Courts. The clerk must record all papers filed with the clerk and
      all process, orders, and judgments.
        (2) Calendar. Under the court's direction, the clerk must
      prepare a calendar of cases awaiting argument. In placing cases
      on the calendar for argument, the clerk must give preference to
      appeals in criminal cases and to other proceedings and appeals
      entitled to preference by law.
        (3) Other Records. The clerk must keep other books and records
      required by the Director of the Administrative Office of the
      United States Courts, with the approval of the Judicial
      Conference of the United States, or by the court.

      (c) Notice of an Order or Judgment. Upon the entry of an order or
    judgment, the circuit clerk must immediately serve a notice of
    entry on each party, with a copy of any opinion, and must note the
    date of service on the docket. Service on a party represented by
    counsel must be made on counsel.
      (d) Custody of Records and Papers. The circuit clerk has custody
    of the court's records and papers. Unless the court orders or
    instructs otherwise, the clerk must not permit an original record
    or paper to be taken from the clerk's office. Upon disposition of
    the case, original papers constituting the record on appeal or
    review must be returned to the court or agency from which they were
    received. The clerk must preserve a copy of any brief, appendix, or
    other paper that has been filed.

      The duties imposed upon clerks of the courts of appeals by this
    rule are those imposed by rule or practice in a majority of the
    circuits. The second sentence of subdivision (a) authorizing the
    closing of the clerk's office on Saturday and non-national legal
    holidays follows a similar provision respecting the district court
    clerk's office found in FRCP 77(c) and in FRCrP 56.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1971 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment adds Columbus Day to the list of legal holidays.
    See the Note accompanying the amendment of Rule 26(a).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1986 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment to Rule 45(b) permits the courts of appeals to
    maintain computerized dockets. The Committee believes that the
    Administrative Office of the United States Courts ought to have
    maximum flexibility in prescribing the format of this docket in
    order to ensure a smooth transition from manual to automated
    systems and subsequent adaptation to technological improvements.
      The amendments to Rules 45(a) and (d) are technical. No
    substantive change is intended. The Birthday of Martin Luther King,
    Jr. has been added to the list of national holidays.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) has been amended so that the
    clerk may use electronic means to serve notice of entry of an order
    or judgment upon parties who have consented to such service.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a)(2). Rule 45(a)(2) has been amended to refer to
    the third Monday in February as "Washington's Birthday." A federal
    statute officially designates the holiday as "Washington's
    Birthday," reflecting the desire of Congress specially to honor the
    first president of the United States. See 5 U.S.C. Sec. 6103(a).
    During the 1998 restyling of the Federal Rules of Appellate
    Procedure, references to "Washington's Birthday" were mistakenly
    changed to "Presidents' Day." The amendment corrects that error.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.

-HEAD-
    Rule 46. Attorneys

-STATUTE-
      (a) Admission to the Bar.
        (1) Eligibility. An attorney is eligible for admission to the
      bar of a court of appeals if that attorney is of good moral and
      professional character and is admitted to practice before the
      Supreme Court of the United States, the highest court of a state,
      another United States court of appeals, or a United States
      district court (including the district courts for Guam, the
      Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands).
        (2) Application. An applicant must file an application for
      admission, on a form approved by the court that contains the
      applicant's personal statement showing eligibility for
      membership. The applicant must subscribe to the following oath or
      affirmation:
        "I, ____________, do solemnly swear [or affirm] that I will
        conduct myself as an attorney and counselor of this court,
        uprightly and according to law; and that I will support the
        Constitution of the United States."

        (3) Admission Procedures. On written or oral motion of a member
      of the court's bar, the court will act on the application. An
      applicant may be admitted by oral motion in open court. But,
      unless the court orders otherwise, an applicant need not appear
      before the court to be admitted. Upon admission, an applicant
      must pay the clerk the fee prescribed by local rule or court
      order.

      (b) Suspension or Disbarment.
        (1) Standard. A member of the court's bar is subject to
      suspension or disbarment by the court if the member:
          (A) has been suspended or disbarred from practice in any
        other court; or
          (B) is guilty of conduct unbecoming a member of the court's
        bar.

        (2) Procedure. The member must be given an opportunity to show
      good cause, within the time prescribed by the court, why the
      member should not be suspended or disbarred.
        (3) Order. The court must enter an appropriate order after the
      member responds and a hearing is held, if requested, or after the
      time prescribed for a response expires, if no response is made.

      (c) Discipline. A court of appeals may discipline an attorney who
    practices before it for conduct unbecoming a member of the bar or
    for failure to comply with any court rule. First, however, the
    court must afford the attorney reasonable notice, an opportunity to
    show cause to the contrary, and, if requested, a hearing.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      Subdivision (a). The basic requirement of membership in the bar
    of the Supreme Court, or of the highest court of a state, or in
    another court of appeals or a district court is found, with minor
    variations, in the rules of ten circuits. The only other
    requirement in those circuits is that the applicant be of good
    moral and professional character. In the District of Columbia
    Circuit applicants other than members of the District of Columbia
    District bar or the Supreme Court bar must claim membership in the
    bar of the highest court of a state, territory or possession for
    three years prior to application for admission (D.C. Cir. Rule 7).
    Members of the District of Columbia District bar and the Supreme
    Court bar again excepted, applicants for admission to the District
    of Columbia Circuit bar must meet precisely defined prelaw and law
    school study requirements (D.C. Cir. Rule 7 1/2 ).
      A few circuits now require that application for admission be made
    by oral motion by a sponsor member in open court. The proposed rule
    permits both the application and the motion by the sponsor member
    to be in writing, and permits action on the motion without the
    appearance of the applicant or the sponsor, unless the court
    otherwise orders.
      Subdivision (b). The provision respecting suspension or
    disbarment is uniform. Third Circuit Rule 8(3) is typical.
      Subdivision (c). At present only Fourth Circuit Rule 36 contains
    an equivalent provision. The purpose of this provision is to make
    explicit the power of a court of appeals to impose sanctions less
    serious than suspension or disbarment for the breach of rules. It
    also affords some measure of control over attorneys who are not
    members of the bar of the court. Several circuits permit a non-
    member attorney to file briefs and motions, membership being
    required only at the time of oral argument. And several circuits
    permit argument pro hac vice by non-member attorneys.

    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate

    TITLE VII. GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 47. Local Rules by Courts of Appeals

-STATUTE-
      (a) Local Rules.
        (1) Each court of appeals acting by a majority of its judges in
      regular active service may, after giving appropriate public
      notice and opportunity for comment, make and amend rules
      governing its practice. A generally applicable direction to
      parties or lawyers regarding practice before a court must be in a
      local rule rather than an internal operating procedure or
      standing order. A local rule must be consistent with - but not
      duplicative of - Acts of Congress and rules adopted under 28
      U.S.C. Sec. 2072 and must conform to any uniform numbering system
      prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States. Each
      circuit clerk must send the Administrative Office of the United
      States Courts a copy of each local rule and internal operating
      procedure when it is promulgated or amended.
        (2) A local rule imposing a requirement of form must not be
      enforced in a manner that causes a party to lose rights because
      of a nonwillful failure to comply with the requirement.

      (b) Procedure When There Is No Controlling Law. A court of
    appeals may regulate practice in a particular case in any manner
    consistent with federal law, these rules, and local rules of the
    circuit. No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed for
    noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law, federal
    rules, or the local circuit rules unless the alleged violator has
    been furnished in the particular case with actual notice of the
    requirement.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1967            
      This rule continues the authority now vested in individual courts
    of appeals by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2071 to make rules consistent with
    rules of practice and procedure promulgated by the Supreme Court.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1995 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). This rule is amended to require that a generally
    applicable direction regarding practice before a court of appeals
    must be in a local rule rather than an internal operating procedure
    or some other general directive. It is the intent of this rule that
    a local rule may not bar any practice that these rules explicitly
    or implicitly permit. Subdivision (b) allows a court of appeals to
    regulate practice in an individual case by entry of an order in the
    case. The amendment also reflects the requirement that local rules
    be consistent not only with the national rules but also with Acts
    of Congress. The amendment also states that local rules should not
    repeat national rules and Acts of Congress.
      The amendment also requires that the numbering of local rules
    conform with any uniform numbering system that may be prescribed by
    the Judicial Conference. Lack of uniform numbering might create
    unnecessary traps for counsel and litigants. A uniform numbering
    system would make it easier for an increasingly national bar and
    for litigants to locate a local rule that applies to a particular
    procedural issue.
      Paragraph (2) is new. Its aim is to protect against loss of
    rights in the enforcement of local rules relating to matters of
    form. The proscription of paragraph (2) is narrowly drawn -
    covering only violations that are not willful and only those
    involving local rules directed to matters of form. It does not
    limit the court's power to impose substantive penalties upon a
    party if it or its attorney stubbornly or repeatedly violates a
    local rule, even one involving merely a matter of form. Nor does it
    affect the court's power to enforce local rules that involve more
    than mere matters of form.
      Subdivision (b). This rule provides flexibility to the court in
    regulating practice in a particular case when there is no
    controlling law. Specifically, it permits the court to regulate
    practice in any manner consistent with Acts of Congress, with rules
    adopted under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2072, and with the circuit's local
    rules.
      The amendment to this rule disapproves imposing any sanction or
    other disadvantage on a person for noncompliance with such a
    directive, unless the alleged violator has been furnished in a
    particular case with actual notice of the requirement. There should
    be no adverse consequence to a party or attorney for violating
    special requirements relating to practice before a particular court
    unless the party or attorney has actual notice of those
    requirements.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily
    understood. In addition to changes made to improve the
    understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make
    style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Appointment; Powers. A court of appeals may appoint a special
    master to hold hearings, if necessary, and to recommend factual
    findings and disposition in matters ancillary to proceedings in the
    court. Unless the order referring a matter to a master specifies or
    limits the master's powers, those powers include, but are not
    limited to, the following:
        (1) regulating all aspects of a hearing;
        (2) taking all appropriate action for the efficient performance
      of the master's duties under the order;
        (3) requiring the production of evidence on all matters
      embraced in the reference; and
        (4) administering oaths and examining witnesses and parties.

      (b) Compensation. If the master is not a judge or court employee,
    the court must determine the master's compensation and whether the
    cost is to be charged to any party.

-MISC1-
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      The text of the existing Rule 48 concerning the title was moved
    to Rule 1.
      This new Rule 48 authorizes a court of appeals to appoint a
    special master to make recommendations concerning ancillary
    matters. The courts of appeals have long used masters in contempt
    proceedings where the issue is compliance with an enforcement
    order. See Polish National Alliance v. NLRB, 159 F.2d 38 (7th Cir.
    1946), NLRB v. Arcade-Sunshine Co., 132 F.2d 8 (D.C. Cir. 1942);
    NLRB v. Remington Rand, Inc., 130 F.2d 919 (2d Cir. 1942). There
    are other instances when the question before a court of appeals
    requires a factual determination. An application for fees or
    eligibility for Criminal Justice Act status on appeal are examples.
      Ordinarily when a factual issue is unresolved, a court of appeals
    remands the case to the district court or agency that originally
    heard the case. It is not the Committee's intent to alter that
    practice. However, when factual issues arise in the first instance
    in the court of appeals, such as fees for representation on appeal,
    it would be useful to have authority to refer such determinations
    to a master for a recommendation.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the
    rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve
    the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to
    make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate
    rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      1. Rule 81 states certain limitations in the application of these
    rules to enumerated special proceedings.
      2. The expression "district courts of the United States"
    appearing in the statute authorizing the Supreme Court of the
    United States to promulgate rules of civil procedure does not
    include the district courts held in the Territories and insular
    possessions. See Mookini et al. v. United States, 303 U.S. 201, 58
    S.Ct. 543, 82 L.Ed. 748 (1938).
      3. These rules are drawn under the authority of the act of June
    19, 1934, U.S.C., Title 28, Sec. 723b [see 2072] (Rules in actions
    at law; Supreme Court authorized to make), and Sec. 723c [see 2072]
    (Union of equity and action at law rules; power of Supreme Court)
    and also other grants of rule making power to the Court. See Clark
    and Moore, A New Federal Civil Procedure - I. The Background, 44
    Yale L.J. 387, 391 (1935). Under Sec. 723b after the rules have
    taken effect all laws in conflict therewith are of no further force
    or effect. In accordance with Sec. 723c the Court has united the
    general rules prescribed for cases in equity with those in actions
    at law so as to secure one form of civil action and procedure for
    both. See Rule 2 (One Form of Action). For the former practice in
    equity and at law see U.S.C., Title 28, Secs. 723 and 730 [see 2071
    et seq.] (conferring power on the Supreme Court to make rules of
    practice in equity) and the [former] Equity Rules promulgated
    thereunder; U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Sec. 724 (Conformity act):
    [former] Equity Rule 22 (Action at Law Erroneously Begun as Suit in
    Equity - Transfer); [former] Equity Rule 23 (Matters Ordinarily
    Determinable at Law When Arising in Suit in Equity to be Disposed
    of Therein); U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Secs. 397 (Amendments to
    pleadings when case brought to wrong side of court), and 398
    (Equitable defenses and equitable relief in actions at law).
      4. With the second sentence compare U.S.C., Title 28, [former]
    Secs. 777 (Defects of form; amendments), 767 (Amendment of
    process); [former] Equity Rule 19 (Amendments Generally).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1948 AMENDMENT       
      The change in nomenclature conforms to the official designation
    of district courts in Title 28, U.S.C., Sec. 132(a).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      This is the fundamental change necessary to effect unification of
    the civil and admiralty procedure. Just as the 1938 rules abolished
    the distinction between actions at law and suits in equity, this
    change would abolish the distinction between civil actions and
    suits in admiralty. See also Rule 81.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      The purpose of this revision, adding the words "and administered"
    to the second sentence, is to recognize the affirmative duty of the
    court to exercise the authority conferred by these rules to ensure
    that civil litigation is resolved not only fairly, but also without
    undue cost or delay. As officers of the court, attorneys share this
    responsibility with the judge to whom the case is assigned.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 1 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      The merger of law, equity, and admiralty practice is complete.
    There is no need to carry forward the phrases that initially
    accomplished the merger.
      The former reference to "suits of a civil nature" is changed to
    the more modern "civil actions and proceedings." This change does
    not affect such questions as whether the Civil Rules apply to
    summary proceedings created by statute. See SEC v. McCarthy, 322
    F.3d 650 (9th Cir. 2003); see also New Hampshire Fire Ins. Co. v
    Scanlon, 362 U.S. 404 (1960).

                             THE STYLE PROJECT                         
      The Civil Rules are the third set of the rules to be restyled.
    The restyled Rules of Appellate Procedure took effect in 1998. The
    restyled Rules of Criminal Procedure took effect in 2002. The
    restyled Rules of Civil Procedure apply the same general drafting
    guidelines and principles used in restyling the Appellate and
    Criminal Rules.
      1. General Guidelines. Guidance in drafting, usage, and style was
    provided by Bryan Garner, Guidelines for Drafting and Editing Court
    Rules, Administrative Office of the United States Courts (1996) and
    Bryan Garner, Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage (2d ed. 1995). See
    also Joseph Kimble, Guiding Principles for Restyling the Civil
    Rules, in Preliminary Draft of Proposed Style Revision of the
    Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, at x [sic] (Feb. 2005) (available
    at http://www.uscourts.gov/rules/Prelim - draft - proposed -
    ptl.pdf).
      2. Formatting Changes. Many of the changes in the restyled Civil
    Rules result from using format to achieve clearer presentation. The
    rules are broken down into constituent parts, using progressively
    indented subparagraphs with headings and substituting vertical for
    horizontal lists. "Hanging indents" are used throughout. These
    formatting changes make the structure of the rules graphic and make
    the restyled rules easier to read and understand even when the
    words are not changed. Rule 14(a) illustrates the benefits of
    formatting changes.
      3. Changes to Reduce Inconsistent, Ambiguous, Redundant,
    Repetitive, or Archaic Words. The restyled rules reduce the use of
    inconsistent terms that say the same thing in different ways.
    Because different words are presumed to have different meanings,
    such inconsistencies can result in confusion. The restyled rules
    reduce inconsistencies by using the same words to express the same
    meaning. For example, consistent expression is achieved without
    affecting meaning by the changes from "infant" in many rules to
    "minor" in all rules; from "upon motion or on its own initiative"
    in Rule 4(m) and variations in many other rules to "on motion or on
    its own"; and from "deemed" to "considered" in Rules 5(c), 12(e),
    and elsewhere. Some variations of expression have been carried
    forward when the context made that appropriate. As an example,
    "stipulate," "agree," and "consent" appear throughout the rules,
    and "written" qualifies these words in some places but not others.
    The number of variations has been reduced, but at times the former
    words were carried forward. None of the changes, when made, alters
    the rule's meaning.
      The restyled rules minimize the use of inherently ambiguous
    words. For example, the word "shall" can mean "must," "may," or
    something else, depending on context. The potential for confusion
    is exacerbated by the fact that "shall" is no longer generally used
    in spoken or clearly written English. The restyled rules replace
    "shall" with "must," "may," or "should," depending on which one the
    context and established interpretation make correct in each rule.
      The restyled rules minimize the use of redundant "intensifiers."
    These are expressions that attempt to add emphasis, but instead
    state the obvious and create negative implications for other rules.
    "The court in its discretion may" becomes "the court may"; "unless
    the order expressly directs otherwise" becomes "unless the court
    orders otherwise." The absence of intensifiers in the restyled
    rules does not change their substantive meaning. For example, the
    absence of the word "reasonable" to describe the written notice of
    foreign law required in Rule 44.1 does not mean that "unreasonable"
    notice is permitted.
      The restyled rules also remove words and concepts that are
    outdated or redundant. The reference to "at law or in equity" in
    Rule 1 has become redundant with the merger of law and equity.
    Outdated words and concepts include the reference to "demurrers,
    pleas, and exceptions" in Rule 7(c); the reference to "mesne"
    process in Rule 77(c); and the reference in Rule 81(f) to a now-
    abolished official position.
      The restyled rules remove a number of redundant cross-references.
    For example, Rule 8(b) states that a general denial is subject to
    the obligations of Rule 11, but all pleadings are subject to Rule
    11. Removing such cross-references does not defeat application of
    the formerly cross-referenced rule.
      4. Rule Numbers. The restyled rules keep the same rule numbers to
    minimize the effect on research. Subdivisions have been rearranged
    within some rules to achieve greater clarity and simplicity. The
    only change that moves one part of a rule to another is the
    transfer of former Rule 25(d)(2) to Rule 17(d). The restyled rules
    include a comparison chart to make it easy to identify transfers of
    provisions between subdivisions and redesignations of some
    subdivisions.
      5. Other Changes. The style changes to the rules are intended to
    make no changes in substantive meaning. A very small number of
    minor technical amendments that arguably do change meaning were
    approved separately from the restyled rules, but become effective
    at the same time. An example is adding "e-mail address" to the
    information that must be included in pleadings[.] These minor
    changes occur in Rules 4(k), 9(h), 11(a), 14(b), 16(c)(1),
    26(g)(1), 30(b), 31, 40, 71.1, and 78.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment.

                             STYLE RULES 1-86                         
      Most of the changes in Styles Rule [sic] 1-86 reflect style
    improvements made in response to public comments and continuing
    work by consultants, reporters, Subcommittees A and B, the Standing
    Committee Style Subcommittee, and the Advisory Committee. They are
    marked above [omitted] as changes made after publication. An
    explanation of each would be both burdensome and unnecessary. Many
    are self-explanatory. Some are set out in the introduction to the
    Style Project materials. Others are explained in the minutes of the
    May 2006 Civil Rules Committee meeting. A few changes - and
    decisions against change - deserve individual mention here as well.
      Present Rule 1 says that the Rules govern "in all suits of a
    civil nature." Style Rule 1 as published changed this to "all civil
    actions and proceedings." Comments suggested that the addition of
    "proceedings" might inadvertently expand the domain governed by the
    Civil Rules. The Standing Committee Style Subcommittee was
    persuaded that "and proceedings" should be removed. Subcommittee A
    accepted this recommendation. Further consideration, however,
    persuaded the Advisory Committee that "and proceedings" should be
    retained. The reasons for concluding that the term "civil actions"
    does not express all of the events properly governed by the Rules
    are described in the draft Minutes for the May meeting. As noted in
    the introduction, the Committee Note to Rule 1 is expanded to
    include a general description of the Style Project.
      Present Rule 25(a)(1) is a classic illustration of the "shall"
    trap. It says that "the action shall be dismissed as to" a deceased
    party unless a motion to substitute is made within 90 days after
    death is suggested on the record. Style Rule 25(a)(1) translated
    "shall" as "may," providing that the action "may be dismissed."
    This choice was bolstered by considering the effects of the Rule
    6(b) authority to extend the 90-day period even after it expires.
    To say that the court "must" dismiss might distract attention from
    the alternative authority to extend the time and grant a motion to
    substitute. Comments suggested that "may" effects a substantive
    change. The comments took pains to express no view on the
    desirability of substantive change. The Committee concluded that it
    is better to replace "may" with "must," and to delete the Committee
    Note explanation of the Rule 6(b) reasons for concluding that "may"
    does not work a substantive change.
      A syntactic ambiguity in Rule 65(d) was corrected in response to
    comments and further research demonstrating that the ambiguity
    resulted from inadvertent omission of a comma when the Rule was
    adopted to carry forward former 28 U.S.C. Sec. 363. As revised,
    Rule 65(d) clearly provides that an injunction binds a party only
    after actual notice. It also clearly provides that after actual
    notice of an injunction, the injunction binds a person in active
    concert or participation with a party's officers, agents, servants,
    employees, and attorneys. The change is explained further in the
    new paragraph added to the Rule 65 Committee Note.
      Finally, the Committee decided not to change the approach taken
    to identifying shifts of material among subdivisions. The
    Bankruptcy Rules Committee urged that the Committee Notes should
    identify decisions to rearrange material among subdivisions of the
    same rule to improve clarity and simplicity. In Rule 12, for
    example, subdivision (c) was divided between Style Rule 12(c) and
    (d), while former subdivision (d) became Style Rule 12(i). The
    purpose of expanding the Committee Notes would be to alert future
    researchers - particularly those who rely on tightly focused
    electronic searches - to define search terms that will reach back
    before the Style Amendments took effect. The approach taken in the
    published Style Rules was to identify in Committee Notes only the
    one instance in which material was shifted between Rules - from
    Rule 25 to Rule 17. Forty-four shifts among subdivisions of the
    same rule were charted in Appendix B, "Current and Restyled Rules
    Comparison Chart" The chart is set out below [omitted]. The
    Committee decided again that this approach is better than the
    alternative of adding length to many of the Committee Notes. It can
    be expected that many rules publications will draw attention to the
    changes identified in the chart.

                           STYLE-SUBSTANCE TRACK                       
      Two rules published on the Style-Substance Track were abandoned.
      Rule 8 would have been revised to call for "a demand for the
    relief sought, which may include alternative forms or different
    types of relief." Comments showed that the old-fashioned "relief in
    the alternative" better describes circumstances in which the
    pleader is uncertain as to the available forms of relief, or
    prefers a form of relief that may not be available.
      Rule 36 would have been amended to make clear the rule that an
    admission adopted at a final pretrial conference can be withdrawn
    or amended only on satisfying the "manifest injustice" standard of
    Style Rule 16(e). Revisions of Style Rule 16(e) make this clear,
    avoiding the need to further amend Rule 36.

     "E-DISCOVERY" STYLE AMENDMENTS: RULES 16, 26, 33, 34, 37, AND 45 
      As noted above [omitted], the Style revisions to the "e-
    discovery" amendments published for comment in 2004, before the
    Style Project was published for comment in 2005, are all "changes
    made after publication." All involve pure style. They can be
    evaluated by reading the overstrike-underline version set out above
    [omitted].

    730 [see 2071 et seq.] (conferring power on the Supreme Court to
    make rules of practice in equity), are unaffected insofar as they
    relate to the rule making power in admiralty. These sections,
    together with Sec. 723b [see 2072] (Rules in actions at law;
    Supreme Court authorized to make) are continued insofar as they are
    not inconsistent with Sec. 723c [see 2072] (Union of equity and
    action at law rules; power of Supreme Court). See Note 3 to Rule 1.
    U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Secs. 724 (Conformity act), 397
    (Amendments to pleadings when case brought to wrong side of court)
    and 398 (Equitable defenses and equitable relief in actions at law)
    are superseded.
      2. Reference to actions at law or suits in equity in all statutes
    should now be treated as referring to the civil action prescribed
    in these rules.
      3. This rule follows in substance the usual introductory
    statements to code practices which provide for a single action and
    mode of procedure, with abolition of forms of action and procedural
    distinctions. Representative statutes are N.Y. Code 1848 (Laws
    1848, ch. 379) Sec. 62; N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) Sec. 8; Calif.Code
    Civ.Proc. (Deering, 1937) Sec. 307; 2 Minn.Stat. (Mason, 1927) Sec.
    9164; 2 Wash.Rev.Stat.Ann. (Remington, 1932) Secs. 153, 255.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 2 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

    Rule 3. Commencing an Action

-STATUTE-
      A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      1. Rule 5(e) defines what constitutes filing with the court.
      2. This rule governs the commencement of all actions, including
    those brought by or against the United States or an officer or
    agency thereof, regardless of whether service is to be made
    personally pursuant to Rule 4(d), or otherwise pursuant to Rule
    4(e).
      3. With this rule compare [former] Equity Rule 12 (Issue of
    Subpoena - Time for Answer) and the following statutes (and other
    similar statutes) which provide a similar method for commencing an
    action:

    U.S.C., Title 28:

     Sec. 45 [former] (District courts; practice and procedure in
          certain cases under interstate commerce laws).
     Sec. 762 [see 1402] (Petition in suit against United States).
     Sec. 766 [see 2409] (Partition suits where United States is tenant
          in common or joint tenant).

      4. This rule provides that the first step in an action is the
    filing of the complaint. Under Rule 4(a) this is to be followed
    forthwith by issuance of a summons and its delivery to an officer
    for service. Other rules providing for dismissal for failure to
    prosecute suggest a method available to attack unreasonable delay
    in prosecuting an action after it has been commenced. When a
    Federal or State statute of limitations is pleaded as a defense, a
    question may arise under this rule whether the mere filing of the
    complaint stops the running of the statute, or whether any further
    step is required, such as, service of the summons and complaint or
    their delivery to the marshal for service. The answer to this
    question may depend on whether it is competent for the Supreme
    Court, exercising the power to make rules of procedure without
    affecting substantive rights, to vary the operation of statutes of
    limitations. The requirement of Rule 4(a) that the clerk shall
    forthwith issue the summons and deliver it to the marshal for
    service will reduce the chances of such a question arising.

-HEAD-
    Rule 4. Summons

-STATUTE-
      (a) Contents; Amendments.
        (1) Contents. A summons must:
          (A) name the court and the parties;
          (B) be directed to the defendant;
          (C) state the name and address of the plaintiff's attorney or
        - if unrepresented - of the plaintiff;
          (D) state the time within which the defendant must appear and
        defend;
          (E) notify the defendant that a failure to appear and defend
        will result in a default judgment against the defendant for the
        relief demanded in the complaint;
          (F) be signed by the clerk; and
          (G) bear the court's seal.

        (2) Amendments. The court may permit a summons to be amended.

      (b) Issuance. On or after filing the complaint, the plaintiff may
    present a summons to the clerk for signature and seal. If the
    summons is properly completed, the clerk must sign, seal, and issue
    it to the plaintiff for service on the defendant. A summons - or a
    copy of a summons that is addressed to multiple defendants - must
    be issued for each defendant to be served.
      (c) Service.
        (1) In General. A summons must be served with a copy of the
      complaint. The plaintiff is responsible for having the summons
      and complaint served within the time allowed by Rule 4(m) and
      must furnish the necessary copies to the person who makes
      service.
        (2) By Whom. Any person who is at least 18 years old and not a
      party may serve a summons and complaint.
        (3) By a Marshal or Someone Specially Appointed. At the
      plaintiff's request, the court may order that service be made by
      a United States marshal or deputy marshal or by a person
      specially appointed by the court. The court must so order if the
      plaintiff is authorized to proceed in forma pauperis under 28
      U.S.C. Sec. 1915 or as a seaman under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1916.

      (d) Waiving Service.
        (1) Requesting a Waiver. An individual, corporation, or
      association that is subject to service under Rule 4(e), (f), or
      (h) has a duty to avoid unnecessary expenses of serving the
      summons. The plaintiff may notify such a defendant that an action
      has been commenced and request that the defendant waive service
      of a summons. The notice and request must:
          (A) be in writing and be addressed:
            (i) to the individual defendant; or
            (ii) for a defendant subject to service under Rule 4(h), to
          an officer, a managing or general agent, or any other agent
          authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of
          process;

          (B) name the court where the complaint was filed;
          (C) be accompanied by a copy of the complaint, 2 copies of a
        waiver form, and a prepaid means for returning the form;
          (D) inform the defendant, using text prescribed in Form 5, of
        the consequences of waiving and not waiving service;
          (E) state the date when the request is sent;
          (F) give the defendant a reasonable time of at least 30 days
        after the request was sent - or at least 60 days if sent to the
        defendant outside any judicial district of the United States -
        to return the waiver; and
          (G) be sent by first-class mail or other reliable means.

        (2) Failure to Waive. If a defendant located within the United
      States fails, without good cause, to sign and return a waiver
      requested by a plaintiff located within the United States, the
      court must impose on the defendant:
          (A) the expenses later incurred in making service; and
          (B) the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, of
        any motion required to collect those service expenses.

        (3) Time to Answer After a Waiver. A defendant who, before
      being served with process, timely returns a waiver need not serve
      an answer to the complaint until 60 days after the request was
      sent - or until 90 days after it was sent to the defendant
      outside any judicial district of the United States.
        (4) Results of Filing a Waiver. When the plaintiff files a
      waiver, proof of service is not required and these rules apply as
      if a summons and complaint had been served at the time of filing
      the waiver.
        (5) Jurisdiction and Venue Not Waived. Waiving service of a
      summons does not waive any objection to personal jurisdiction or
      to venue.

      (e) Serving an Individual Within a Judicial District of the
    United States. Unless federal law provides otherwise, an individual
    - other than a minor, an incompetent person, or a person whose
    waiver has been filed - may be served in a judicial district of the
    United States by:
        (1) following state law for serving a summons in an action
      brought in courts of general jurisdiction in the state where the
      district court is located or where service is made; or
        (2) doing any of the following:
          (A) delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to
        the individual personally;
          (B) leaving a copy of each at the individual's dwelling or
        usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and
        discretion who resides there; or
          (C) delivering a copy of each to an agent authorized by
        appointment or by law to receive service of process.

      (f) Serving an Individual in a Foreign Country. Unless federal
    law provides otherwise, an individual - other than a minor, an
    incompetent person, or a person whose waiver has been filed - may
    be served at a place not within any judicial district of the United
    States:
        (1) by any internationally agreed means of service that is
      reasonably calculated to give notice, such as those authorized by
      the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and
      Extrajudicial Documents;
        (2) if there is no internationally agreed means, or if an
      international agreement allows but does not specify other means,
      by a method that is reasonably calculated to give notice:
          (A) as prescribed by the foreign country's law for service in
        that country in an action in its courts of general
        jurisdiction;
          (B) as the foreign authority directs in response to a letter
        rogatory or letter of request; or
          (C) unless prohibited by the foreign country's law, by:
            (i) delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint
          to the individual personally; or
            (ii) using any form of mail that the clerk addresses and
          sends to the individual and that requires a signed receipt;
          or

        (3) by other means not prohibited by international agreement,
      as the court orders.

      (g) Serving a Minor or an Incompetent Person. A minor or an
    incompetent person in a judicial district of the United States must
    be served by following state law for serving a summons or like
    process on such a defendant in an action brought in the courts of
    general jurisdiction of the state where service is made. A minor or
    an incompetent person who is not within any judicial district of
    the United States must be served in the manner prescribed by Rule
    4(f)(2)(A), (f)(2)(B), or (f)(3).
      (h) Serving a Corporation, Partnership, or Association. Unless
    federal law provides otherwise or the defendant's waiver has been
    filed, a domestic or foreign corporation, or a partnership or other
    unincorporated association that is subject to suit under a common
    name, must be served:
        (1) in a judicial district of the United States:
          (A) in the manner prescribed by Rule 4(e)(1) for serving an
        individual; or
          (B) by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint
        to an officer, a managing or general agent, or any other agent
        authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of
        process and - if the agent is one authorized by statute and the
        statute so requires - by also mailing a copy of each to the
        defendant; or

        (2) at a place not within any judicial district of the United
      States, in any manner prescribed by Rule 4(f) for serving an
      individual, except personal delivery under (f)(2)(C)(i).

      (i) Serving the United States and Its Agencies, Corporations,
    Officers, or Employees.
        (1) United States. To serve the United States, a party must:
          (A)(i) deliver a copy of the summons and of the complaint to
        the United States attorney for the district where the action is
        brought - or to an assistant United States attorney or clerical
        employee whom the United States attorney designates in a
        writing filed with the court clerk - or
          (ii) send a copy of each by registered or certified mail to
        the civil-process clerk at the United States attorney's office;

          (B) send a copy of each by registered or certified mail to
        the Attorney General of the United States at Washington, D.C.;
        and
          (C) if the action challenges an order of a nonparty agency or
        officer of the United States, send a copy of each by registered
        or certified mail to the agency or officer.

        (2) Agency; Corporation; Officer or Employee Sued in an
      Official Capacity. To serve a United States agency or
      corporation, or a United States officer or employee sued only in
      an official capacity, a party must serve the United States and
      also send a copy of the summons and of the complaint by
      registered or certified mail to the agency, corporation, officer,
      or employee.
        (3) Officer or Employee Sued Individually. To serve a United
      States officer or employee sued in an individual capacity for an
      act or omission occurring in connection with duties performed on
      the United States' behalf (whether or not the officer or employee
      is also sued in an official capacity), a party must serve the
      United States and also serve the officer or employee under Rule
      4(e), (f), or (g).
        (4) Extending Time. The court must allow a party a reasonable
      time to cure its failure to:
          (A) serve a person required to be served under Rule 4(i)(2),
        if the party has served either the United States attorney or
        the Attorney General of the United States; or
          (B) serve the United States under Rule 4(i)(3), if the party
        has served the United States officer or employee.

      (j) Serving a Foreign, State, or Local Government.
        (1) Foreign State. A foreign state or its political
      subdivision, agency, or instrumentality must be served in
      accordance with 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1608.
        (2) State or Local Government. A state, a municipal
      corporation, or any other state-created governmental organization
      that is subject to suit must be served by:
          (A) delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to
        its chief executive officer; or
          (B) serving a copy of each in the manner prescribed by that
        state's law for serving a summons or like process on such a
        defendant.

      (k) Territorial Limits of Effective Service.
        (1) In General. Serving a summons or filing a waiver of service
      establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant:
          (A) who is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of general
        jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located;
          (B) who is a party joined under Rule 14 or 19 and is served
        within a judicial district of the United States and not more
        than 100 miles from where the summons was issued; or
          (C) when authorized by a federal statute.

        (2) Federal Claim Outside State-Court Jurisdiction. For a claim
      that arises under federal law, serving a summons or filing a
      waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction over a
      defendant if:
          (A) the defendant is not subject to jurisdiction in any
        state's courts of general jurisdiction; and
          (B) exercising jurisdiction is consistent with the United
        States Constitution and laws.

      (l) Proving Service.
        (1) Affidavit Required. Unless service is waived, proof of
      service must be made to the court. Except for service by a United
      States marshal or deputy marshal, proof must be by the server's
      affidavit.
        (2) Service Outside the United States. Service not within any
      judicial district of the United States must be proved as follows:
          (A) if made under Rule 4(f)(1), as provided in the applicable
        treaty or convention; or
          (B) if made under Rule 4(f)(2) or (f)(3), by a receipt signed
        by the addressee, or by other evidence satisfying the court
        that the summons and complaint were delivered to the addressee.

        (3) Validity of Service; Amending Proof. Failure to prove
      service does not affect the validity of service. The court may
      permit proof of service to be amended.

      (m) Time Limit for Service. If a defendant is not served within
    120 days after the complaint is filed, the court - on motion or on
    its own after notice to the plaintiff - must dismiss the action
    without prejudice against that defendant or order that service be
    made within a specified time. But if the plaintiff shows good cause
    for the failure, the court must extend the time for service for an
    appropriate period. This subdivision (m) does not apply to service
    in a foreign country under Rule 4(f) or 4(j)(1).
      (n) Asserting Jurisdiction over Property or Assets.
        (1) Federal Law. The court may assert jurisdiction over
      property if authorized by a federal statute. Notice to claimants
      of the property must be given as provided in the statute or by
      serving a summons under this rule.
        (2) State Law. On a showing that personal jurisdiction over a
      defendant cannot be obtained in the district where the action is
      brought by reasonable efforts to serve a summons under this rule,
      the court may assert jurisdiction over the defendant's assets
      found in the district. Jurisdiction is acquired by seizing the
      assets under the circumstances and in the manner provided by
      state law in that district.

      Note to Subdivision (d). Under this rule the complaint must
    always be served with the summons.
      Paragraph (1). For an example of a statute providing for service
    upon an agent of an individual see U.S.C., Title 28, Sec. 109 [now
    1400, 1694] (Patent cases).
      Paragraph (3). This enumerates the officers and agents of a
    corporation or of a partnership or other unincorporated association
    upon whom service of process may be made, and permits service of
    process only upon the officers, managing or general agents, or
    agents authorized by appointment or by law, of the corporation,
    partnership or unincorporated association against which the action
    is brought. See Christian v. International Ass'n of Machinists, 7
    F.(2d) 481 (D.C.Ky., 1925) and Singleton v. Order of Railway
    Conductors of America, 9 F.Supp. 417 (D.C.Ill., 1935). Compare
    Operative Plasterers' and Cement Finishers' International Ass'n of
    the United States and Canada v. Case, 93 F.(2d) 56 (App.D.C.,
    1937).
      For a statute authorizing service upon a specified agent and
    requiring mailing to the defendant, see U.S.C., Title 6, Sec. 7
    [now Title 31, Sec. 9306] (Surety companies as sureties;
    appointment of agents; service of process).
      Paragraphs (4) and (5) provide a uniform and comprehensive method
    of service for all actions against the United States or an officer
    or agency thereof. For statutes providing for such service, see
    U.S.C., Title 7, Secs. 217 (Proceedings for suspension of orders),
    499k (Injunctions; application of injunction laws governing orders
    of Interstate Commerce Commission), 608c(15)(B) (Court review of
    ruling of Secretary of Agriculture), and 855 (making Sec.
    608c(15)(B) applicable to orders of the Secretary of Agriculture as
    to handlers of anti-hog-cholera serum and hog-cholera virus);

    where United States is tenant in common or joint tenant), 902 [now
    2410] (Foreclosure of mortgages or other liens on property in which
    the United States has an interest). These and similar statutes are
    modified insofar as they prescribe a different method of service or
    dispense with the service of a summons.
      For the [former] Equity Rule on service, see [former] Equity Rule
    13 (Manner of Serving Subpoena).
      Note to Subdivision (e). The provisions for the service of a
    summons or of notice or of an order in lieu of summons contained in
    U.S.C., Title 8, Sec. 405 [see 1451] (Cancellation of certificates
    of citizenship fraudulently or illegally procured) (service by
    publication in accordance with State law); U.S.C., Title 28, Sec.
    118 [now 1655] (Absent defendants in suits to enforce liens);

    Court of United States for the District of Columbia in certain
    equity suits where adverse parties reside elsewhere) (service by
    publication against parties residing in foreign countries); U.S.C.,
    Title 38, Sec. 445 [now 1984] (Action against the United States on
    a veteran's contract of insurance) (parties not inhabitants of or
    not found within the District may be served with an order of the
    court, personally or by publication) and similar statutes are
    continued by this rule. Title 24, Sec. 378 [now Title 13, Sec. 336]
    of the Code of the District of Columbia (Publication against
    nonresident; those absent for six months; unknown heirs or
    devisees; for divorce or in rem; actual service beyond District) is
    continued by this rule.
      Note to Subdivision (f). This rule enlarges to some extent the
    present rule as to where service may be made. It does not, however,
    enlarge the jurisdiction of the district courts.
      U.S.C., Title 28, Secs. 113 [now 1392] (Suits in States
    containing more than one district) (where there are two or more

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b). Under amended subdivision (e) of this rule, an
    action may be commenced against a nonresident of the State in which
    the district court is held by complying with State procedures.
    Frequently the form of the summons or notice required in these
    cases by State law differs from the Federal form of summons
    described in present subdivision (b) and exemplified in Form 1. To
    avoid confusion, the amendment of subdivision (b) states that a
    form of summons or notice, corresponding "as nearly as may be" to
    the State form, shall be employed. See also a corresponding
    amendment of Rule 12(a) with regard to the time to answer.
      Subdivision (d)(4). This paragraph, governing service upon the
    United States, is amended to allow the use of certified mail as an
    alternative to registered mail for sending copies of the papers to
    the Attorney General or to a United States officer or agency. Cf.
    N.J. Rule 4:5-2. See also the amendment of Rule 30(f)(1).
      Subdivision (d)(7). Formerly a question was raised whether this
    paragraph, in the context of the rule as a whole, authorized
    service in original Federal actions pursuant to State statutes
    permitting service on a State official as a means of bringing a
    nonresident motorist defendant into court. It was argued in McCoy
    v. Siler, 205 F.2d 498, 501-2 (3d Cir.) (concurring opinion), cert.
    denied, 346 U.S. 872, 74 S.Ct. 120, 98 L.Ed. 380 (1953), that the
    effective service in those cases occurred not when the State
    official was served but when notice was given to the defendant
    outside the State, and that subdivision (f) (Territorial limits of
    effective service), as then worded, did not authorize out-of-State
    service. This contention found little support. A considerable
    number of cases held the service to be good, either by fixing upon
    the service on the official within the State as the effective
    service, thus satisfying the wording of subdivision (f) as it then
    stood, see Holbrook v. Cafiero, 18 F.R.D. 218 (D.Md. 1955);
    Pasternack v. Dalo, 17 F.R.D. 420; (W.D.Pa. 1955); cf. Super Prods.
    Corp. v. Parkin, 20 F.R.D. 377 (S.D.N.Y. 1957), or by reading
    paragraph (7) as not limited by subdivision (f). See Griffin v.
    Ensign, 234 F.2d 307 (3d Cir. 1956); 2 Moore's Federal Practice,
    &#182; 4.19 (2d ed. 1948); 1 Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice &
    Procedure Sec. 182.1 (Wright ed. 1960); Comment, 27 U. of
    Chi.L.Rev. 751 (1960). See also Olberding v. Illinois Central R.R.,
    201 F.2d 582 (6th Cir.), rev'd on other grounds, 346 U.S. 338, 74
    S.Ct. 83, 98 L.Ed. 39 (1953); Feinsinger v. Bard, 195 F.2d 45 (7th
    Cir. 1952).
      An important and growing class of State statutes base personal
    jurisdiction over nonresidents on the doing of acts or on other
    contacts within the State, and permit notice to be given the
    defendant outside the State without any requirement of service on a
    local State official. See, e.g., Ill.Ann.Stat. ch. 110, Secs. 16,
    17 (Smith-Hurd 1956); Wis.Stat. Sec. 262.06 (1959). This service,
    employed in original Federal actions pursuant to paragraph (7), has
    also been held proper. See Farr & Co. v. Cia. Intercontinental de
    Nav. de Cuba, 243 F.2d 342 (2d Cir. 1957); Kappus v. Western Hills
    Oil, Inc., 24 F.R.D. 123 (E.D.Wis. 1959); Star v. Rogalny, 162
    F.Supp. 181 (E.D.Ill. 1957). It has also been held that the clause
    of paragraph (7) which permits service "in the manner prescribed by
    the law of the state," etc., is not limited by subdivision (c)
    requiring that service of all process be made by certain designated
    persons. See Farr & Co. v. Cia. Intercontinental de Nav. de Cuba,
    supra. But cf. Sappia v. Lauro Lines, 130 F.Supp. 810 (S.D.N.Y.
    1955).
      The salutary results of these cases are intended to be preserved.
    See paragraph (7), with a clarified reference to State law, and
    amended subdivisions (e) and (f).
      Subdivision (e). For the general relation between subdivisions
    (d) and (e), see 2 Moore, supra, &#182; 4.32.
      The amendment of the first sentence inserting the word
    "thereunder" supports the original intention that the "order of
    court" must be authorized by a specific United States statute. See
    1 Barron & Holtzoff, supra, at 731. The clause added at the end of
    the first sentence expressly adopts the view taken by commentators
    that, if no manner of service is prescribed in the statute or
    order, the service may be made in a manner stated in Rule 4. See 2
    Moore, supra, &#182; 4.32, at 1004; Smit, International Aspects of
    Federal Civil Procedure, 61 Colum.L.Rev. 1031, 1036-39 (1961). But
    see Commentary, 5 Fed. Rules Serv. 791 (1942).
      Examples of the statutes to which the first sentence relates are
    28 U.S.C. Sec. 2361 (Interpleader; process and procedure); 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 1655 (Lien enforcement; absent defendants).
      The second sentence, added by amendment, expressly allows resort
    in original Federal actions to the procedures provided by State law
    for effecting service on nonresident parties (as well as on
    domiciliaries not found within the State). See, as illustrative,
    the discussion under amended subdivision (d)(7) of service pursuant
    to State nonresident motorist statutes and other comparable State
    statutes. Of particular interest is the change brought about by the
    reference in this sentence to State procedures for commencing
    actions against nonresidents by attachment and the like,
    accompanied by notice. Although an action commenced in a State
    court by attachment may be removed to the Federal court if ordinary
    conditions for removal are satisfied, see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1450;
    Rorick v. Devon Syndicate, Ltd., 307 U.S. 299, 59 S.Ct. 877, 83
    L.Ed. 1303 (1939); Clark v. Wells, 203 U.S. 164, 27 S.Ct. 43, 51
    L.Ed. 138 (1906), there has heretofore been no provision recognized
    by the courts for commencing an original Federal civil action by
    attachment. See Currie, Attachment and Garnishment in the Federal
    Courts, 59 Mich.L.Rev. 337 (1961), arguing that this result came
    about through historical anomaly. Rule 64, which refers to
    attachment, garnishment, and similar procedures under State law,
    furnishes only provisional remedies in actions otherwise validly
    commenced. See Big Vein Coal Co. v. Read, 229 U.S. 31, 33 S.Ct.
    694, 57 L.Ed. 1953 (1913); Davis v. Ensign-Bickford Co., 139 F.2d
    624 (8th Cir. 1944); 7 Moore's Federal Practice &#182; 64.05 (2d
    ed. 1954); 3 Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice & Procedure Sec.
    1423 (Wright ed. 1958); but cf. Note, 13 So.Calif.L.Rev. 361
    (1940). The amendment will now permit the institution of original
    Federal actions against nonresidents through the use of familiar
    State procedures by which property of these defendants is brought
    within the custody of the court and some appropriate service is
    made up them.
      The necessity of satisfying subject-matter jurisdictional
    requirements and requirements of venue will limit the practical
    utilization of these methods of effecting service. Within those
    limits, however, there appears to be no reason for denying
    plaintiffs means of commencing actions in Federal courts which are
    generally available in the State courts. See 1 Barron & Holtzoff,
    supra, at 374-80; Nordbye, Comments on Proposed Amendments to Rules
    of Civil Procedure for the United States District Courts, 18 F.R.D.
    105, 106 (1956); Note, 34 Corn.L.Q. 103 (1948); Note, 13
    So.Calif.L.Rev. 361 (1940).
      If the circumstances of a particular case satisfy the applicable
    Federal law (first sentence of Rule 4(e), as amended) and the
    applicable State law (second sentence), the party seeking to make
    the service may proceed under the Federal or the State law, at his
    option.
      See also amended Rule 13(a), and the Advisory Committee's Note
    thereto.
      Subdivision (f). The first sentence is amended to assure the
    effectiveness of service outside the territorial limits of the
    State in all the cases in which any of the rules authorize service
    beyond those boundaries. Besides the preceding provisions of Rule
    4, see Rule 71A(d)(3). In addition, the new second sentence of the
    subdivision permits effective service within a limited area outside
    the State in certain special situations, namely, to bring in
    additional parties to a counterclaim or cross-claim (Rule 13(h)),
    impleaded parties (Rule 14), and indispensable or conditionally
    necessary parties to a pending action (Rule 19); and to secure
    compliance with an order of commitment for civil contempt. In those
    situations effective service can be made at points not more than
    100 miles distant from the courthouse in which the action is
    commenced, or to which it is assigned or transferred for trial.
      The bringing in of parties under the 100-mile provision in the
    limited situations enumerated is designed to promote the objective
    of enabling the court to determine entire controversies. In the
    light of present-day facilities for communication and travel, the
    territorial range of the service allowed, analogous to that which
    applies to the service of a subpoena under Rule 45(e)(1), can
    hardly work hardship on the parties summoned. The provision will be
    especially useful in metropolitan areas spanning more than one
    State. Any requirements of subject-matter jurisdiction and venue
    will still have to be satisfied as to the parties brought in,
    although these requirements will be eased in some instances when
    the parties can be regarded as "ancillary." See Pennsylvania R.R.
    v. Erie Avenue Warehouse Co., 5 F.R.Serv.2d 14a.62, Case 2 (3d Cir.
    1962); Dery v. Wyer, 265 F.2d 804 (2d Cir. 1959); United Artists
    Corp. v. Masterpiece Productions, Inc., 221 F.2d 213 (2d Cir.
    1955); Lesnik v. Public Industrials Corp., 144 F.2d 968 (2d Cir.
    1944); Vaughn v. Terminal Transp. Co., 162 F.Supp. 647 (E.D.Tenn.
    1957); and compare the fifth paragraph of the Advisory Committee's
    Note to Rule 4(e), as amended. The amendment is but a moderate
    extension of the territorial reach of Federal process and has ample
    practical justification. See 2 Moore, supra. Sec. 4.01[13] (Supp.
    1960); 1 Barron & Holtzoff, supra, Sec. 184; Note, 51 Nw.U.L.Rev.
    354 (1956). But cf. Nordbye, Comments on Proposed Amendments to
    Rules of Civil Procedure for the United States District Courts, 18
    F.R.D. 105, 106 (1956).
      As to the need for enlarging the territorial area in which orders
    of commitment for civil contempt may be served, see Graber v.
    Graber, 93 F.Supp. 281 (D.D.C. 1950); Teele Soap Mfg. Co. v. Pine
    Tree Products Co., Inc., 8 F.Supp. 546 (D.N.H. 1934); Mitchell v.
    Dexter, 244 Fed. 926 (1st Cir. 1917); in re Graves, 29 Fed. 60
    (N.D. Iowa 1886).
      As to the Court's power to amend subdivisions (e) and (f) as here
    set forth, see Mississippi Pub. Corp. v. Murphree, 326 U.S. 438, 66
    S.Ct. 242, 90 L.Ed. 185 (1946).
      Subdivision (i). The continual increase of civil litigation
    having international elements makes it advisable to consolidate,
    amplify, and clarify the provisions governing service upon parties
    in foreign countries. See generally Jones, International Judicial
    Assistance: Procedural Chaos and a Program for Reform, 62 Yale L.J.
    515 (1953); Longley, Serving Process, Subpoenas and Other Documents
    in Foreign Territory, Proc. A.B.A., Sec. Int'l & Comp. L. 34
    (1959); Smit, International Aspects of Federal Civil Procedure, 61
    Colum.L.Rev. 1031 (1961).
      As indicated in the opening lines of new subdivision (i),
    referring to the provisions of subdivision (e), the authority for
    effecting foreign service must be found in a statute of the United
    States or a statute or rule of court of the State in which the
    district court is held providing in terms or upon proper
    interpretation for service abroad upon persons not inhabitants of
    or found within the State. See the Advisory Committee's Note to
    amended Rule 4(d)(7) and Rule 4(e). For examples of Federal and
    State statutes expressly authorizing such service, see 8 U.S.C.
    Sec. 1451(b); 35 U.S.C. Secs. 146, 293; Me.Rev.Stat., ch. 22, Sec.
    70 (Supp. 1961); Minn.Stat.Ann. Sec. 303.13 (1947); N.Y.Veh. &
    Tfc.Law Sec. 253. Several decisions have construed statutes to
    permit service in foreign countries, although the matter is not
    expressly mentioned in the statutes. See, e.g., Chapman v. Superior
    Court, 162 Cal.App.2d 421, 328 P.2d 23 (Dist.Ct.App. 1958); Sperry
    v. Fliegers, 194 Misc. 438, 86 N.Y.S.2d 830 (Sup.Ct. 1949); Ewing
    v. Thompson, 233 N.C. 564, 65 S.E.2d 17 (1951); Rushing v. Bush,
    260 S.W.2d 900 (Tex.Ct.Civ.App. 1953). Federal and State statutes
    authorizing service on nonresidents in such terms as to warrant the
    interpretation that service abroad is permissible include 15 U.S.C.
    Secs. 77v(a), 78aa, 79y; 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1655; 38 U.S.C. Sec.
    784(a); Ill.Ann.Stat. ch. 110, Secs. 16, 17 (Smith-Hurd 1956);
    Wis.Stat. Sec. 262.06 (1959).
      Under subdivisions (e) and (i), when authority to make foreign
    service is found in a Federal statute or statute or rule of court
    of a State, it is always sufficient to carry out the service in the
    manner indicated therein. Subdivision (i) introduces considerable
    further flexibility by permitting the foreign service and return
    thereof to be carried out in any of a number of other alternative
    ways that are also declared to be sufficient. Other aspects of
    foreign service continue to be governed by the other provisions of
    Rule 4. Thus, for example, subdivision (i) effects no change in the
    form of the summons, or the issuance of separate or additional
    summons, or the amendment of service.
      Service of process beyond the territorial limits of the United
    States may involve difficulties not encountered in the case of
    domestic service. Service abroad may be considered by a foreign
    country to require the performance of judicial, and therefore
    "sovereign," acts within its territory, which that country may
    conceive to be offensive to its policy or contrary to its law. See
    Jones, supra, at 537. For example, a person not qualified to serve
    process according to the law of the foreign country may find
    himself subject to sanctions if he attempts service therein. See
    Inter-American Judicial Committee, Report on Uniformity of
    Legislation on International Cooperation in Judicial Procedures 20
    (1952). The enforcement of a judgment in the foreign country in
    which the service was made may be embarrassed or prevented if the
    service did not comport with the law of that country. See ibid.
      One of the purposes of subdivision (i) is to allow accommodation
    to the policies and procedures of the foreign country. It is
    emphasized, however, that the attitudes of foreign countries vary
    considerably and that the question of recognition of United States
    judgments abroad is complex. Accordingly, if enforcement is to be
    sought in the country of service, the foreign law should be
    examined before a choice is made among the methods of service
    allowed by subdivision (i).
      Subdivision (i)(1). Subparagraph (a) of paragraph (1), permitting
    service by the method prescribed by the law of the foreign country
    for service on a person in that country in a civil action in any of
    its courts of general jurisdiction, provides an alternative that is
    likely to create least objection in the place of service and also
    is likely to enhance the possibilities of securing ultimate
    enforcement of the judgment abroad. See Report on Uniformity of
    Legislation on International Cooperation in Judicial Procedures,
    supra.
      In certain foreign countries service in aid of litigation pending
    in other countries can lawfully be accomplished only upon request
    to the foreign court, which in turn directs the service to be made.
    In many countries this has long been a customary way of
    accomplishing the service. See In re Letters Rogatory out of First
    Civil Court of City of Mexico, 261 Fed. 652 (S.D.N.Y. 1919); Jones,
    supra, at 543; Comment, 44 Colum.L.Rev. 72 (1944); Note, 58 Yale
    L.J. 1193 (1949). Subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1), referring to a
    letter rogatory, validates this method. A proviso, applicable to
    this subparagraph and the preceding one, requires, as a safeguard,
    that the service made shall be reasonably calculated to give actual
    notice of the proceedings to the party. See Milliken v. Meyer, 311
    U.S. 457, 61 S.Ct. 339, 85 L.Ed. 278 (1940).
      Subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1), permitting foreign service by
    personal delivery on individuals and corporations, partnerships,
    and associations, provides for a manner of service that is not only
    traditionally preferred, but also is most likely to lead to actual
    notice. Explicit provision for this manner of service was thought
    desirable because a number of Federal and State statutes permitting
    foreign service do not specifically provide for service by personal
    delivery abroad, see e.g., 35 U.S.C. Secs. 146, 293; 46 [App.]
    U.S.C. Sec. 1292; Calif.Ins.Code Sec. 1612; N.Y.Veh. & Tfc.Law Sec.
    253, and it also may be unavailable under the law of the country in
    which the service is made.
      Subparagraph (D) of paragraph (1), permitting service by certain
    types of mail, affords a manner of service that is inexpensive and
    expeditious, and requires a minimum of activity within the foreign
    country. Several statutes specifically provide for service in a
    foreign country by mail, e.g., Hawaii Rev.Laws Secs. 230-31, 230-32
    (1955); Minn.Stat.Ann. Sec. 303.13 (1947); N.Y.Civ.Prac.Act, Sec.
    229-b; N.Y.Veh. & Tfc.Law Sec. 253, and it has been sanctioned by
    the courts even in the absence of statutory provision specifying
    that form of service. Zurini v. United States, 189 F.2d 722 (8th
    Cir. 1951); United States v. Cardillo, 135 F.Supp. 798 (W.D.Pa.
    1955); Autogiro Co. v. Kay Gyroplanes, Ltd., 55 F.Supp. 919 (D.D.C.
    1944). Since the reliability of postal service may vary from
    country to country, service by mail is proper only when it is
    addressed to the party to be served and a form of mail requiring a
    signed receipt is used. An additional safeguard is provided by the
    requirement that the mailing be attended to be the clerk of the
    court. See also the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subdivision
    (i) regarding proof of service by mail.
      Under the applicable law it may be necessary, when the defendant
    is an infant or incompetent person, to deliver the summons and
    complaint to a guardian, committee, or similar fiduciary. In such a
    case it would be advisable to make service under subparagraph (A),
    (B), or (E).
      Subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1) adds flexibility by permitting
    the court by order to tailor the manner of service to fit the
    necessities of a particular case or the peculiar requirements of
    the law of the country in which the service is to be made. A
    similar provision appears in a number of statutes, e.g., 35 U.S.C.
    Secs. 146, 293; 38 U.S.C. Sec. 784(a); 46 [App.] U.S.C. Sec. 1292.
      The next-to-last sentence of paragraph (1) permits service under
    (C) and (E) to be made by any person who is not a party and is not
    less than 18 years of age or who is designated by court order or by
    the foreign court. Cf. Rule 45(c); N.Y.Civ.Prac.Act Secs. 233, 235.
    This alternative increases the possibility that the plaintiff will
    be able to find a process server who can proceed unimpeded in the
    foreign country; it also may improve the chances of enforcing the
    judgment in the country of service. Especially is the alternative
    valuable when authority for the foreign service is found in a
    statute or rule of court that limits the group of eligible process
    servers to designated officials or special appointees who, because
    directly connected with another "sovereign," may be particularly
    offensive to the foreign country. See generally Smit, supra, at
    1040-41. When recourse is had to subparagraph (A) or (B) the
    identity of the process server always will be determined by the law
    of the foreign country in which the service is made.
      The last sentence of paragraph (1) sets forth an alternative
    manner for the issuance and transmission of the summons for
    service. After obtaining the summons from the clerk, the plaintiff
    must ascertain the best manner of delivering the summons and
    complaint to the person, court, or officer who will make the
    service. Thus the clerk is not burdened with the task of
    determining who is permitted to serve process under the law of a
    particular country or the appropriate governmental or
    nongovernmental channel for forwarding a letter rogatory. Under
    (D), however, the papers must always be posted by the clerk.
      Subdivision (i)(2). When service is made in a foreign country,
    paragraph (2) permits methods for proof of service in addition to
    those prescribed by subdivision (g). Proof of service in accordance
    with the law of the foreign country is permitted because foreign
    process servers, unaccustomed to the form or the requirement of
    return of service prevalent in the United States, have on occasion
    been unwilling to execute the affidavit required by Rule 4(g). See
    Jones, supra, at 537; Longley, supra, at 35. As a corollary of the
    alternate manner of service in subdivision (i)(1)(E), proof of
    service as directed by order of the court is permitted. The special
    provision for proof of service by mail is intended as an additional
    safeguard when that method is used. On the type of evidence of
    delivery that may be satisfactory to a court in lieu of a signed
    receipt, see Aero Associates, Inc. v. La Metropolitana, 183 F.Supp.
    357 (S.D.N.Y. 1960).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      The wording of Rule 4(f) is changed to accord with the amendment
    of Rule 13(h) referring to Rule 19 as amended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1980 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). This is a technical amendment to conform this
    subdivision with the amendment of subdivision (c).
      Subdivision (c). The purpose of this amendment is to authorize
    service of process to be made by any person who is authorized to
    make service in actions in the courts of general jurisdiction of
    the state in which the district court is held or in which service
    is made.
      There is a troublesome ambiguity in Rule 4. Rule 4(c) directs
    that all process is to be served by the marshal, by his deputy, or
    by a person specially appointed by the court. But Rule 4(d)(7)
    authorizes service in certain cases "in the manner prescribed by
    the law of the state in which the district court is held. . . ."
    And Rule 4(e), which authorizes service beyond the state and
    service in quasi in rem cases when state law permits such service,
    directs that "service may be made . . . under the circumstances and
    in the manner prescribed in the [state] statute or rule." State
    statutes and rules of the kind referred to in Rule 4(d)(7) and Rule
    4(e) commonly designate the persons who are to make the service
    provided for, e.g., a sheriff or a plaintiff. When that is so, may
    the persons so designated by state law make service, or is service
    in all cases to be made by a marshal or by one specially appointed
    under present Rule 4(c)? The commentators have noted the ambiguity
    and have suggested the desirability of an amendment. See 2 Moore's
    Federal Practice &#182; 4.08 (1974); Wright & Miller, Federal
    Practice and Procedure: Civil Sec. 1092 (1969). And the ambiguity
    has given rise to unfortunate results. See United States for the
    use of Tanos v. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co., 361 F. 2d 838 (5th Cir.
    1966); Veeck v. Commodity Enterprises, Inc., 487 F. 2d 423 (9th
    Cir. 1973).
      The ambiguity can be resolved by specific amendments to Rules
    4(d)(7) and 4(e), but the Committee is of the view that there is no
    reason why Rule 4(c) should not generally authorize service of
    process in all cases by anyone authorized to make service in the
    courts of general jurisdiction of the state in which the district
    court is held or in which service is made. The marshal continues to
    be the obvious, always effective officer for service of process.

                  LEGISLATIVE STATEMENT - 1983 AMENDMENT              

               128 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD H9848, DEC. 15, 1982           
      Mr. EDWARDS of California. Mr. Speaker, in July Mr. McClory and I
    brought before the House a bill to delay the effective date of
    proposed changes in rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
    dealing with service of process. The Congress enacted that
    legislation and delayed the effective date so that we could cure
    certain problems in the proposed amendments to rule 4.
      Since that time, Mr. McClory and I introduced a bill, H.R. 7154,
    that cures those problems. It was drafted in consultation with
    representatives of the Department of Justice, the Judicial
    Conference of the United States, and others.
      The Department of Justice and the Judicial Conference have
    endorsed the bill and have urged its prompt enactment. Indeed, the
    Department of Justice has indicated that the changes occasioned by
    the bill will facilitate its collection of debts owned to the
    Government.
      I have a letter from the Office of Legislative Affairs of the
    Department of Justice supporting the bill that I will submit for
    the Record. Also, I am submitting for the Record a section-by-
    section analysis of the bill.
      H.R. 7154 makes much needed changes in rule 4 of the Federal
    Rules of Civil Procedure and is supported by all interested
    parties. I urge my colleagues to support it.

                                         U.S. Department of Justice.    
                                        Office of Legislative Affairs,  
                                    Washington, D.C., December 10, 1982.
    Hon. Peter W. Rodino, Jr.,
    Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives,
      Washington, D.C.
      Dear Mr. Chairman: This is to proffer the views of the Department
    of Justice on H.R. 7154, the proposed Federal Rules of Civil
    Procedure Amendments Act of 1982. While the agenda is extremely
    tight and we appreciate that fact, we do reiterate that this
    Department strongly endorses the enactment of H.R. 7154. We would
    greatly appreciate your watching for any possible way to enact this
    legislation expeditiously.
      H.R. 7154 would amend Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil
    Procedure to relieve effectively the United States Marshals Service
    of the duty of routinely serving summonses and complaints for
    private parties in civil actions and would thus achieve a goal this
    Department has long sought. Experience has shown that the Marshals
    Service's increasing workload and limited budget require such major
    relief from the burdens imposed by its role as process-server in
    all civil actions.
      The bill would also amend Rule 4 to permit certain classes of
    defendants to be served by first class mail with a notice and
    acknowledgment of receipt form enclosed. We have previously
    expressed a preference for the service-by-mail provisions of the
    proposed amendments to Rule 4 which the Supreme Court transmitted
    to Congress on April 28, 1982.
      The amendments proposed by the Supreme Court would permit service
    by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. We had
    regarded the Supreme Court proposal as the more efficient because
    it would not require and affirmative act of signing and mailing on
    the part of a defendant. Moreover, the Supreme Court proposal would
    permit the entry of a default judgment if the record contained a
    returned receipt showing acceptance by the defendant or a returned
    envelope showing refusal of the process by the defendant and
    subsequent service and notice by first class mail. However, critics
    of that system of mail service have argued that certified mail is
    not an effective method of providing actual notice to defendants of
    claims against them because signatures may be illegible or may not
    match the name of the defendant, or because it may be difficult to
    determine whether mail has been "unclaimed" or "refused," the
    latter providing the sole basis for a default judgment.
      As you know, in light of these criticisms the Congress enacted
    Public Law 97-227 (H.R. 6663) postponing the effective date of the
    proposed amendments to Rule 4 until October 1, 1983, so as to
    facilitate further review of the problem. This Department opposed
    the delay in the effective date, primarily because the Supreme
    Court's proposed amendments also contained urgently needed
    provisions designed to relieve the United States Marshals of the
    burden of serving summonses and complaints in private civil
    actions. In our view, these necessary relief provisions are readily
    separable from the issues of service by certified mail and the
    propriety of default judgment after service by certified mail which
    the Congress felt warranted additional review.
      During the floor consideration of H.R. 6663 Congressman Edwards
    and other proponents of the delayed effective date pledged to
    expedite the review of the proposed amendments to Rule 4, given the
    need to provide prompt relief for the Marshals Service in the
    service of process area. In this spirit Judiciary Committee staff
    consulted with representatives of this Department, the Judicial
    Conference, and others who had voiced concern about the proposed
    amendments.
      H.R. 7154 is the product of those consultations and accommodated
    the concerns of the Department in a very workable and acceptable
    manner.
      Accordingly, we are satisfied that the provisions of H.R. 7154
    merit the support of all three branches of the Federal Government
    and everyone else who has a stake in the fair and efficient service
    of process in civil actions. We urge prompt consideration of H.R.
    7154 by the Committee.(!1)
      The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there is no
    objection to the submission of this report from the standpoint of
    the Administration's program.
            Sincerely,
                                                  Robert A. McConnell,  
                                             Assistant Attorney General.
    _______

      (!1) In addition to amending Rule 4, we have previously
    recommended: (a) amendments to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 569(b) redefining the
    Marshals traditional role by eliminating the statutory requirement
    that they serve subpoenas, as well as summonses and complaints,
    and; (b) amendments to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1921 changing the manner and
    level in which marshal fees are charged for serving private civil
    process. These legislative changes are embodied in Section 10 of S.
    2567 and the Department's proposed fiscal year 1983 Appropriations
    Authorization bill. If, in the Committee's judgment, efforts to
    incorporate these suggested amendments in H.R. 7154 would in any
    way impede consideration of the bill during the few remaining
    legislative days in the 97th Congress, we would urge that they be
    separately considered early in the 98th Congress.

    H.R. 7154 - FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE AMENDMENTS ACT OF 1982

                                BACKGROUND                            
      The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure set forth the procedures to
    be followed in civil actions and proceedings in United States
    district courts. These rules are usually amended by a process
    established by 28 U.S.C. 2072, often referred to as the "Rules
    Enabling Act". The Rules Enabling Act provides that the Supreme
    Court can propose new rules of "practice and procedure" and
    amendments to existing rules by transmitting them to Congress after
    the start of a regular session but not later than May 1. The rules
    and amendments so proposed take effect 90 days after transmittal
    unless legislation to the contrary is enacted.(!1)
      On April 28, 1982, the Supreme Court transmitted to Congress
    several proposed amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil
    Procedure, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (which govern
    criminal cases and proceedings in Federal courts), and the Rules
    and Forms Governing Proceedings in the United States District
    Courts under sections 2254 and 2255 of Title 28, United States Code
    (which govern habeas corpus proceedings). These amendments were to
    have taken effect on August 1, 1982.
      The amendments to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
    were intended primarily to relieve United States marshals of the
    burden of serving summonses and complaints in private civil
    actions. Appendix II, at 7 (Report of the Committee on Rules of
    Practice and Procedure), 16 (Advisory Committee Note). The
    Committee received numerous complaints that the changes not only
    failed to achieve that goal, but that in the process the changes
    saddled litigators with flawed mail service, deprived litigants of
    the use of effective local procedures for service, and created a
    time limit for service replete with ambiguities that could only be
    resolved by costly litigation. See House Report No. 97-662, at 2-4
    (1982).
      In order to consider these criticisms, Congress enacted Public
    Law 97-227, postponing the effective date of the proposed
    amendments to Rule 4 until October 1, 1983.(!2) Accordingly, in
    order to help shape the policy behind, and the form of, the
    proposed amendments, Congress must enact legislation before October
    1, 1983.(!3)
      With that deadline and purpose in mind, consultations were held
    with representatives of the Judicial Conference, the Department of
    Justice, and others who had voiced concern about the proposed
    amendments. H.R. 7154 is the product of those consultations. The
    bill seeks to effectuate the policy of relieving the Marshals
    Service of the duty of routinely serving summonses and complaints.
    It provides a system of service by mail modeled upon a system found
    to be effective in California, and finally, it makes appropriate
    stylistic, grammatical, and other changes in Rule 4.

                         NEED FOR THE LEGISLATION                     

                             1. CURRENT RULE 4                         
      Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relates to the
    issuance and service of process. Subsection (c) authorizes service
    of process by personnel of the Marshals Service, by a person
    specially appointed by the Court, or "by a person authorized to
    serve process in an action brought in the courts of general
    jurisdiction of the state in which the district court is held or in
    which service is made." Subsection (d) describes how a summons and
    complaint must be served and designates those persons who must be
    served in cases involving specified categories of defendants. Mail
    service is not directly authorized. Subsection (d)(7), however,
    authorizes service under the law of the state in which the district
    court sits upon defendants described in subsections (d)(1) (certain
    individuals) and (d)(3) (organizations). Thus, if state law
    authorizes service by mail of a summons and complaint upon an
    individual or organization described in subsections (d)(1) or (3),
    then subsection (d)(7) authorizes service by mail for United States
    district courts in that state.(!4)

                     2. REDUCING THE ROLE OF MARSHALS                 
      The Supreme Court's proposed modifications of Rule 4 were
    designed to alleviate the burden on the Marshals Service of serving
    summonses and complaints in private civil actions. Appendix II, at
    7 (Report of the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure), 16
    (Advisory Committee Note). While the Committee received no
    complaints about the goal of reducing the role of the Marshals
    Service, the Court's proposals simply failed to achieve that goal.
    See House Report No. 97-662, at 2-3 (1982).
      The Court's proposed Rule 4(c)(2)(B) required the Marshals
    Service to serve summonses and complaints "pursuant to any
    statutory provision expressly providing for service by a United
    States Marshal or his deputy." (!5) One such statutory provision is
    28 U.S.C. 569(b), which compels marshals to "execute all lawful
    writs, process and orders issued under authority of the United
    States, including those of the courts * * *." (emphasis added).
    Thus, any party could have invoked 28 U.S.C. 569(b) to utilize a
    marshal for service of a summons and complaint, thereby thwarting
    the intent of the new subsection to limit the use of marshals. The
    Justice Department acknowledges that the proposed subsection did
    not accomplish its objectives.(!6)
      Had 28 U.S.C. 569(b) been inconsistent with proposed Rule
    4(c)(2)(B), the latter would have nullified the former under 28
    U.S.C. 2072, which provides that "All laws in conflict with such
    rules shall be of no further force or effect after such rules have
    taken effect." Since proposed Rule 4(c)(2)(B) specifically referred
    to statutes such as 28 U.S.C. 569(b), however, the new subsection
    did not conflict with 28 U.S.C. 569(b) and did not, therefore,
    supersede it.
      H.R. 7154 cures this problem and achieves the desired reduction
    in the role of the Marshals Service by authorizing marshals to
    serve summonses and complaints "on behalf of the United States". By
    so doing, H.R. 7154 eliminates the loophole in the Court's proposed
    language and still provides for service by marshals on behalf of
    the Government.(!7)

                              3. MAIL SERVICE                          
      The Supreme Court's proposed subsection (d)(7) and (8)
    authorized, as an alternative to personal service, mail service of
    summonses and complaints on individuals and organizations described
    in subsection (d)(1) and (3), but only through registered or
    certified mail, restricted delivery. Critics of that system of mail
    service argued that registered and certified mail were not
    necessarily effective methods of providing actual notice to
    defendants of claims against them. This was so, they argued,
    because signatures may be illegible or may not match the name of
    the defendant, or because it may be difficult to determine whether
    mail has been "unclaimed" or "refused", the latter apparently
    providing the sole basis for a default judgment.(!8)
      H.R. 7154 provides for a system of service by mail similar to the
    system now used in California. See Cal. Civ. Pro. Sec. 415.30 (West
    1973). Service would be by ordinary mail with a notice and
    acknowledgment of receipt form enclosed. If the defendant returns
    the acknowledgment form to the sender within 20 days of mailing,
    the sender files the return and service is complete. If the
    acknowledgment is not returned within 20 days of mailing, then
    service must be effected through some other means provided for in
    the Rules.
      This system of mail service avoids the notice problems created by
    the registered and certified mail procedures proposed by the
    Supreme Court. If the proper person receives the notice and returns
    the acknowledgment, service is complete. If the proper person does
    not receive the mailed form, or if the proper person receives the
    notice but fails to return the acknowledgment form, another method
    of service authorized by law is required.(!9) In either instance,
    however, the defendant will receive actual notice of the claim. In
    order to encourage defendants to return the acknowledgment form,
    the court can order a defendant who does not return it to pay the
    costs of service unless the defendant can show good cause for the
    failure to return it.

                            4. THE LOCAL OPTION                        
      The Court's proposed amendments to Rule 4 deleted the provision
    in current subsection (d)(7) that authorizes service of a summons
    and complaint upon individuals and organizations "in the manner
    prescribed by the law of the state in which the district court is
    held for the service of summons or other like process upon any such
    defendant in an action brought in the courts of general
    jurisdiction of that state." The Committee received a variety of
    complaints about the deletion of this provision. Those in favor of
    preserving the local option saw no reason to forego systems of
    service that had been successful in achieving effective
    notice.(!10)
      H.R. 7154 carries forward the policy of the current rule and
    permits a party to serve a summons and complaint upon individuals
    and organizations described in Rule 4(d)(1) and (3) in accordance
    with the law of the state in which the district court sits. Thus,
    the bill authorizes four methods of serving a summons and complaint
    on such defendants: (1) service by a nonparty adult (Rule
    4(c)(2)(A)); (2) service by personnel of the Marshals Service, if
    the party qualifies, such as because the party is proceeding in
    forma pauperis (Rule 4(c)(2)(B)); (3) service in any manner
    authorized by the law of the state in which the district court is
    held (Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(i)); or (4) service by regular mail with a
    notice and acknowledgment of receipt form enclosed (Rule
    4(c)(2)(C)(ii)).(!11)

                              5. TIME LIMITS                          
      Rule 4 does not currently provide a time limit within which
    service must be completed. Primarily because United States marshals
    currently effect service of process, no time restriction has been
    deemed necessary. Appendix II, at 18 (Advisory Committee Note).
    Along with the proposed changes to subdivisions (c) and (d) to
    reduce the role of the Marshals Service, however, came new
    subdivision (j), requiring that service of a summons and complaint
    be made within 120 days of the filing of the complaint. If service
    were not accomplished within that time, proposed subdivision (j)
    required that the action "be dismissed as to that defendant without
    prejudice upon motion or upon the court's own initiative". Service
    by mail was deemed made for purposes of subdivision (j) "as of the
    date on which the process was accepted, refused, or returned as
    unclaimed".(!12)
      H.R. 7154 adopts a policy of limiting the time to effect service.
    It provides that if a summons and complaint have not been served
    within 120 days of the filing of the complaint and the plaintiff
    fails to show "good cause" for not completing service within that
    time, then the court must dismiss the action as to the unserved
    defendant. H.R. 7154 ensures that a plaintiff will be notified of
    an attempt to dismiss the action. If dismissal for failure to serve
    is raised by the court upon its own motion, the legislation
    requires that the court provide notice to the plaintiff. If
    dismissal is sought by someone else, Rule 5(a) of the Federal Rules
    of Civil Procedure requires that the motion be served upon the
    plaintiff.
      Like proposed subsection (j), H.R. 7154 provides that a dismissal
    for failure to serve within 120 days shall be "without prejudice".
    Proposed subsection (j) was criticized by some for ambiguity
    because, it was argued, neither the text of subsection (j) nor the
    Advisory Committee Note indicated whether a dismissal without
    prejudice would toll a statute of limitation. See House Report 97-
    662, at 3-4 (1982). The problem would arise when a plaintiff files
    the complaint within the applicable statute of limitation period
    but does not effect service within 120 days. If the statute of
    limitation period expires during that period, and if the
    plaintiff's action is dismissed "without prejudice", can the
    plaintiff refile the complaint and maintain the action? The answer
    depends upon how the statute of limitation is tolled.(!13)
      If the law provides that the statute of limitation is tolled by
    filing and service of the complaint, then a dismissal under H.R.
    7154 for failure to serve within the 120 days would, by the terms
    of the law controlling the tolling, bar the plaintiff from later
    maintaining the cause of action.(!14) If the law provides that the
    statute of limitation is tolled by filing alone, then the status of
    the plaintiff's cause of action turns upon the plaintiff's
    diligence. If the plaintiff has not been diligent, the court will
    dismiss the complaint for failure to serve within 120 days, and the
    plaintiff will be barred from later maintaining the cause of action
    because the statute of limitation has run. A dismissal without
    prejudice does not confer upon the plaintiff any rights that the
    plaintiff does not otherwise possess and leaves a plaintiff whose
    action has been dismissed in the same position as if the action had
    never been filed.(!15) If, on the other hand, the plaintiff has
    made reasonable efforts to effect service, then the plaintiff can
    move under Rule 6(b) to enlarge the time within which to serve or
    can oppose dismissal for failure to serve. A court would
    undoubtedly permit such a plaintiff additional time within which to
    effect service. Thus, a diligent plaintiff can preserve the cause
    of action. This result is consistent with the policy behind the
    time limit for service and with statutes of limitation, both of
    which are designed to encourage prompt movement of civil actions in
    the federal courts.

          6. CONFORMING AND CLARIFYING SUBSECTIONS (D)(4) AND (5)      
      Current subsections (d)(4) and (5) prescribe which persons must
    be served in cases where an action is brought against the United
    States or an officer or agency of the United States. Under
    subsection (d)(4), where the United States is the named defendant,
    service must be made as follows: (1) personal service upon the
    United States attorney, an assistant United States attorney, or a
    designated clerical employee of the United States attorney in the
    district in which the action is brought; (2) registered or
    certified mail service to the Attorney General of the United States
    in Washington, D.C.; and (3) registered or certified mail service
    to the appropriate officer or agency if the action attacks an order
    of that officer or agency but does not name the officer or agency
    as a defendant. Under subsection (d)(5), where an officer or agency
    of the United States is named as a defendant, service must be made
    as in subsection (d)(4), except that personal service upon the
    officer or agency involved is required.(!16)
      The time limit for effecting service in H.R. 7154 would present
    significant difficulty to a plaintiff who has to arrange for
    personal service upon an officer or agency that may be thousands of
    miles away. There is little reason to require different types of
    service when the officer or agency is named as a party, and H.R.
    7154 therefore conforms the manner of service under subsection
    (d)(5) to the manner of service under subsection (d)(4).

                        SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS                    

                                 SECTION 1                             
      Section 1 provides that the short title of the bill is the
    "Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Amendments Act of 1982".

                                 SECTION 2                             
      Section 2 of the bill consists of 7 numbered paragraphs, each
    amending a different part of Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil
    Procedure.
      Paragraph (1) deletes the requirement in present Rule 4(a) that a
    summons be delivered for service to the marshal or other person
    authorized to serve it. As amended by the legislation, Rule 4(a)
    provides that the summons be delivered to "the plaintiff or the
    plaintiff's attorney, who shall be responsible for prompt service
    of the summons and complaint". This change effectuates the policy
    proposed by the Supreme Court. See Appendix II, at  -  (Advisory
    Committee Note).
      Paragraph (2) amends current Rule 4(c), which deals with the
    service of process. New Rule 4(c)(1) requires that all process,
    other than a subpoena or a summons and complaint, be served by the
    Marshals Service or by a person especially appointed for that
    purpose. Thus, the Marshals Service or persons specially appointed
    will continue to serve all process other than subpoenas and
    summonses and complaints, a policy identical to that proposed by
    the Supreme Court. See Appendix II, at 8 (Report of the Judicial
    Conference Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure). The
    service of subpoenas is governed by Rule 45,(!17) and the service
    of summonses and complaints is governed by new Rule 4(c)(2).
      New Rule 4(c)(2)(A) sets forth the general rule that summonses
    and complaints shall be served by someone who is at least 18 years
    old and not a party to the action or proceeding. This is consistent
    with the Court's proposal. Appendix II, at 16 (Advisory Committee
    Note). Subparagraphs (B) and (C) of new Rule 4(c)(2) set forth
    exceptions to this general rule.
      Subparagraph (B) sets forth 3 exceptions to the general rule.
    First, subparagraph (B)(i) requires the Marshals Service (or
    someone specially appointed by the court) to serve summonses and
    complaints on behalf of a party proceeding in forma pauperis or a
    seaman authorized to proceed under 28 U.S.C. 1916. This is
    identical to the Supreme Court's proposal. See Appendix II, at 3
    (text of proposed rule), 16 (Advisory Committee Note). Second,
    subparagraph (B)(ii) requires the Marshals Service (or someone
    specially appointed by the court) to serve a summons and complaint
    when the court orders the marshals to do so in order properly to
    effect service in that particular action.(!18) This, except for
    nonsubstantive changes in phrasing, is identical to the Supreme
    Court's proposal. See Appendix II, at 3 (text of proposed rule), 16
    (Advisory Committee Note).
      Subparagraph (C) of new Rule 4(c)(2) provides 2 exceptions to the
    general rule of service by a nonparty adult. These exceptions apply
    only when the summons and complaint is to be served upon persons
    described in Rule 4(d)(1) (certain individuals) or Rule 4(d)(3)
    (organizations).(!19) First, subparagraph (C)(i) permits service of
    a summons and complaint in a manner authorized by the law of the
    state in which the court sits. This restates the option to follow
    local law currently found in Rule 4(d)(7) and would authorize
    service by mail if the state law so allowed. The method of mail
    service in that instance would, of course, be the method permitted
    by state law.
      Second, subparagraph (C)(ii) permits service of a summons and
    complaint by regular mail. The sender must send to the defendant,
    by first-class mail, postage prepaid, a copy of the summons and
    complaint, together with 2 copies of a notice and acknowledgment of
    receipt of summons and complaint form and a postage prepaid return
    envelope addressed to the sender. If a copy of the notice and
    acknowledgment form is not received by the sender within 20 days
    after the date of mailing, then service must be made under Rule
    4(c)(2)(A) or (B) (i.e., by a nonparty adult or, if the person
    qualifies,(!20) by personnel of the Marshals Service or a person
    specially appointed by the court) in the manner prescribed by Rule
    4(d)(1) or (3) (i.e., personal or substituted service).
      New Rule 4(c)(2)(D) permits a court to penalize a person who
    avoids service by mail. It authorizes the court to order a person
    who does not return the notice and acknowledgment form within 20
    days after mailing to pay the costs of service, unless that person
    can show good cause for failing to return the form. The purpose of
    this provision is to encourage the prompt return of the form so
    that the action can move forward without unnecessary delay.
    Fairness requires that a person who causes another additional and
    unnecessary expense in effecting service ought to reimburse the
    party who was forced to bear the additional expense.
      Subparagraph (E) of rule 4(c)(2) requires that the notice and
    acknowledgment form described in new Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii) be
    executed under oath or affirmation. This provision tracks the
    language of 28 U.S.C. 1746, which permits the use of unsworn
    declarations under penalty of perjury whenever an oath or
    affirmation is required. Statements made under penalty of perjury
    are subject to 18 U.S,C. 1621(2), which provides felony penalties
    for someone who "willfully subscribes as true any material matter
    which he does not believe to be true". The requirement that the
    form be executed under oath or affirmation is intended to encourage
    truthful submissions to the court, as the information contained in
    the form is important to the parties.(!21)
      New Rule 4(c)(3) authorizes the court freely to make special
    appointments to serve summonses and complaints under Rule
    4(c)(2)(B) and all other process under Rule 4(c)(1). This carries
    forward the policy of present Rule 4(c).
      Paragraph (3) of section 2 of the bill makes a non-substantive
    change in the caption of Rule 4(d) in order to reflect more
    accurately the provisions of Rule 4(d). Paragraph (3) also deletes
    a provision on service of a summons and complaint pursuant to state
    law. This provision is redundant in view of new Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(i).
      Paragraph (4) of section 2 of the bill conforms Rule 4(d)(5) to
    present Rule 4(d)(4). Rule 4(d)(5) is amended to provide that
    service upon a named defendant agency or officer of the United
    States shall be made by "sending" a copy of the summons and
    complaint "by registered or certified mail" to the defendant.(!22)
    Rule 4(d)(5) currently provides for service by "delivering" the
    copies to the defendant, but 28 U.S.C. 1391(e) authorizes delivery
    upon a defendant agency or officer outside of the district in which
    the action is brought by means of certified mail. Hence, the change
    is not a marked departure from current practice.
      Paragraph (5) of section 2 of the bill amends the caption of Rule
    4(e) in order to describe subdivision (e) more accurately.
      Paragraph (6) of section 2 of the bill amends Rule 4(g), which
    deals with return of service. Present rule 4(g) is not changed
    except to provide that, if service is made pursuant to the new
    system of mail service (Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii)), the plaintiff or the
    plaintiff's attorney must file with the court the signed
    acknowledgment form returned by the person served.
      Paragraph (7) of section 2 of the bill adds new subsection (j) to
    provide a time limitation for the service of a summons and
    complaint. New Rule 4(j) retains the Supreme Court's requirement
    that a summons and complaint be served within 120 days of the
    filing of the complaint. See Appendix II, at 18 (Advisory Committee
    Note).(!23) The plaintiff must be notified of an effort or
    intention to dismiss the action. This notification is mandated by
    subsection (j) if the dismissal is being raised on the court's own
    initiative and will be provided pursuant to Rule 5 (which requires
    service of motions upon the adverse party) if the dismissal is
    sought by someone else.(!24) The plaintiff may move under Rule 6(b)
    to enlarge the time period. See Appendix II, at 1d. (Advisory
    Committee Note). If service is not made within the time period or
    enlarged time period, however, and if the plaintiff fails to show
    "good cause" for not completing service, then the court must
    dismiss the action as to the unserved defendant. The dismissal is
    "without prejudice". The term "without prejudice" means that the
    dismissal does not constitute an adjudication of the merits of the
    complaint. A dismissal "without prejudice" leaves a plaintiff whose
    action has been dismissed in the position in which that person
    would have been if the action had never been filed.

                                 SECTION 3                             
      Section 3 of the bill amends the Appendix of Forms at the end of
    the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by adding a new form 18A,
    "Notice and Acknowledgment for Service by Mail". This new form is
    required by new Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii), which requires that the notice
    and acknowledgment form used with service by regular mail conform
    substantially to Form 18A.
      Form 18A as set forth in section 3 of the bill is modeled upon a
    form used in California.(!25) It contains 2 parts. The first part
    is a notice to the person being served that tells that person that
    the enclosed summons and complaint is being served pursuant to Rule
    4(c)(2)(C)(ii); advises that person to sign and date the
    acknowledgment form and indicate the authority to receive service
    if the person served is not the party to the action (e.g., the
    person served is an officer of the organization being served); and
    warns that failure to return the form to the sender within 20 days
    may result in the court ordering the party being served to pay the
    expenses involved in effecting service. The notice also warns that
    if the complaint is not responded to within 20 days, a default
    judgment can be entered against the party being served. The notice
    is dated under penalty of perjury by the plaintiff or the
    plaintiff's attorney.(!26)
      The second part of the form contains the acknowledgment of
    receipt of the summons and complaint. The person served must
    declare on this part of the form, under penalty of perjury, the
    date and place of service and the person's authority to receive
    service.

                                 SECTION 4                             
      Section 4 of the bill provides that the changes in Rule 4 made by
    H.R. 7154 will take effect 45 days after enactment, thereby giving
    the bench and bar, as well as other interested persons and
    organizations (such as the Marshals Service), an opportunity to
    prepare to implement the changes made by the legislation. The
    delayed effective date means that service of process issued before
    the effective date will be made in accordance with current Rule 4.
    Accordingly, all process in the hands of the Marshals Service prior
    to the effective date will be served by the Marshals Service under
    the present rule.

                                 SECTION 5                             
      Section 5 of the bill provides that the amendments to Rule 4
    proposed by the Supreme Court (whose effective date was postponed
    by Public Law 97-227) shall not take effect. This is necessary
    because under Public Law 97-227 the proposed amendments will take
    effect on October 1, 1983.

    _______

      (!1) The drafting of the rules and amendments is actually done by
    a committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States. In the
    case of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the initial draft is
    prepared by the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules. The Advisory
    Committee's draft is then reviewed by the Committee on Rules of
    Practice and Procedure, which must give its approval to the draft.
    Any draft approved by that committee is forwarded to the Judicial
    Conference. If the Judicial Conference approves the draft, it
    forwards the draft to the Supreme Court. The Judicial Conference's
    role in the rule-making process is defined by 28 U.S.C. 331.
      For background information about how the Judicial Conference
    committees operate, see Wright, "Procedural Reform: Its Limitation
    and Its Future," 1 Ga.L.Rev. 563, 565-66 (1967) (civil rules);

      (!2) All of the other amendments, including all of the proposed
    amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Rules
    and Forms Governing Proceedings in the United States District
    Courts under sections 2254 and 2255 of Title 28, United States
    Code, took effect on August 1, 1982, as scheduled.
      (!3) The President has urged Congress to act promptly. See
    President's Statement on Signing H.R. 6663 into Law, 18 Weekly
    Comp. of Pres. Doc. 982 (August 2, 1982).
      (!4) Where service of a summons is to be made upon a party who is
    neither an inhabitant of, nor found within, the state where the
    district court sits, subsection (e) authorizes service under a
    state statute or rule of court that provides for service upon such
    a party. This would authorize mail service if the state statute or
    rule of court provided for service by mail.
      (!5) The Court's proposal authorized service by the Marshals
    Service in other situations. This authority, however, was not seen
    as thwarting the underlying policy of limiting the use of marshals.
    See Appendix II, at 16, 17 (Advisory Committee Note).
      (!6) Appendix I, at 2 (letter of Assistant Attorney General
    Robert A. McConnell).
      (!7) The provisions of H.R. 7154 conflict with 28 U.S.C. 569(b)
    because the latter is a broader command to marshals to serve all
    federal court process. As a later statutory enactment, however,
    H.R. 7154 supersedes 28 U.S.C. 569(b), thereby achieving the goal
    of reducing the role of marshals.
      (!8) Proposed Rule 4(d)(8) provided that "Service . . . shall not
    be the basis for the entry of a default or a judgment by default
    unless the record contains a return receipt showing acceptance by
    the defendant or a returned envelope showing refusal of the process
    by the defendant." This provision reflects a desire to preclude
    default judgments on unclaimed mail. See Appendix II, at 7 (Report
    of the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure).
      The interpretation of Rule 4(d)(8) to require a refusal of
    delivery in order to have a basis for a default judgment, while
    undoubtedly the interpretation intended and the interpretation that
    reaches the fairest result, may not be the only possible
    interpretation. Since a default judgment can be entered for
    defendant's failure to respond to the complaint once defendant has
    been served and the time to answer the complaint has run, it can be
    argued that a default judgment can be obtained where the mail was
    unclaimed because proposed subsection (j), which authorized
    dismissal of a complaint not served within 120 days, provided that
    mail service would be deemed made "on the date on which the process
    was accepted, refused, or returned as unclaimed" (emphasis added).
      (!9) See p. 15 infra.
      (!10) Proponents of the California system of mail service, in
    particular, saw no reason to supplant California's proven method of
    mail service with a certified mail service that they believed
    likely to result in default judgments without actual notice to
    defendants. See House Report No. 97-662, at 3 (1982).
      (!11) The parties may, of course, stipulate to service, as is
    frequently done now.
      (!12) While return of the letter as unclaimed was deemed service
    for the purpose of determining whether the plaintiff's action could
    be dismissed, return of the letter as unclaimed was not service for
    the purpose of entry of a default judgment against the defendant.
    See note 8 supra.
      (!13) The law governing the tolling of a statute of limitation
    depends upon the type of civil action involved. In adversity
    action, state law governs tolling. Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446
    U.S. 740 (1980). In Walker, plaintiff had filed his complaint and
    thereby commenced the action under Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of
    Civil Procedure within the statutory period. He did not, however,
    serve the summons and complaint until after the statutory period
    had run. The Court held that state law (which required both filing
    and service within the statutory period) governed, barring
    plaintiff's action.
      In the federal question action, the courts of appeals have
    generally held that Rule 3 governs, so that the filing of the
    complaint tolls a statute of limitation. United States v. Wahl, 538
    F.2d 285 (6th Cir. 1978); Windbrooke Dev. Co. v. Environmental
    Enterprises Inc. of Fla., 524 F.2d 461 (5th Cir. 1975);
    Metropolitan Paving Co. v. International Union of Operating
    Engineers, 439 F.2d 300 (10th Cir. 1971); Moore Co. v. Sid
    Richardson Carbon & Gasoline Co., 347 F.2d 921 (8th Cir.), cert.
    denied, 383 U.S. 925, reh. denied, 384 U.S. 914 (1965); Hoffman v.
    Halden, 268 F.2d 280 (9th Cir. 1959). The continued validity of
    this line of cases, however, must be questioned in light of the
    Walker case, even though the Court in that case expressly reserved
    judgment about federal question actions, see Walker v. Armco Steel
    Corp., 446 U.S. 741, 751 n.11 (1980).
      (!14) The same result obtains even if service occurs within the
    120 day period, if the service occurs after the statute of
    limitation has run.
      (!15) See p. 19 infra.
      (!16) See p. 17 infra.
      (!17) Rule 45(c) provides that "A subpoena may be served by the
    marshal, by his deputy, or by any other person who is not a party
    and is not less than 18 years of age."
      (!18) Some litigators have voiced concern that there may be
    situations in which personal service by someone other than a member
    of the Marshals Service may present a risk of injury to the person
    attempting to make the service. For example, a hostile defendant
    may have a history of injuring persons attempting to serve process.
    Federal judges undoubtedly will consider the risk of harm to
    private persons who would be making personal service when deciding
    whether to order the Marshals Service to make service under Rule
    4(c)(2)(B)(iii).
      (!19) The methods of service authorized by Rule 4(c)(2)(C) may be
    invoked by any person seeking to effect service. Thus, a nonparty
    adult who receives the summons and complaint for service under Rule
    4(c)(1) may serve them personally or by mail in the manner
    authorized by Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii). Similarly, the Marshals Service
    may utilize the mail service authorized by Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii) when
    serving a summons and complaint under Rule 4(c)(2)(B)(i)(iii). When
    serving a summons and complaint under Rule 4(c)(2)(B)(ii), however,
    the Marshals Service must serve in the manner set forth in the
    court's order. If no particular manner of service is specified,
    then the Marshals Service may utilize Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii). It would
    not seem to be appropriate, however, for the Marshals Service to
    utilize Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii) in a situation where a previous attempt
    to serve by mail failed. Thus, it would not seem to be appropriate
    for the Marshals Service to attempt service by regular mail when
    serving a summons and complaint on behalf of a plaintiff who is
    proceeding in forma pauperis if that plaintiff previously attempted
    unsuccessfully to serve the defendant by mail.
      (!20) To obtain service by personnel of the Marshals Service or
    someone specially appointed by the court, a plaintiff who has
    unsuccessfully attempted mail service under Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii)
    must meet the conditions of Rule 4(c)(2)(B) - for example, the
    plaintiff must be proceeding in forma pauperis.
      (!21) For example, the sender must state the date of mailing on
    the form. If the form is not returned to the sender within 20 days
    of that date, then the plaintiff must serve the defendant in
    another manner and the defendant may be liable for the costs of
    such service. Thus, a defendant would suffer the consequences of a
    misstatement about the date of mailing.
      (!22) See p. 12 supra.
      (!23) The 120 day period begins to run upon the filing of each
    complaint. Thus, where a defendant files a cross-claim against the
    plaintiff, the 120 day period begins to run upon the filing of the
    cross-complaint, not upon the filing of the plaintiff's complaint
    initiating the action.
      (!24) The person who may move to dismiss can be the putative
    defendant (i.e., the person named as defendant in the complaint
    filed with the court) or, in multi-party actions, another party to
    the action. (If the putative defendant moves to dismiss and the
    failure to effect service is due to that person's evasion of
    service, a court should not dismiss because the plaintiff has "good
    cause" for not completing service.)

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Purposes of Revision. The general purpose of this revision is to
    facilitate the service of the summons and complaint. The revised
    rule explicitly authorizes a means for service of the summons and
    complaint on any defendant. While the methods of service so
    authorized always provide appropriate notice to persons against
    whom claims are made, effective service under this rule does not
    assure that personal jurisdiction has been established over the
    defendant served.
      First, the revised rule authorizes the use of any means of
    service provided by the law not only of the forum state, but also
    of the state in which a defendant is served, unless the defendant
    is a minor or incompetent.
      Second, the revised rule clarifies and enhances the cost-saving
    practice of securing the assent of the defendant to dispense with
    actual service of the summons and complaint. This practice was
    introduced to the rule in 1983 by an act of Congress authorizing
    "service-by-mail," a procedure that effects economic service with
    cooperation of the defendant. Defendants that magnify costs of
    service by requiring expensive service not necessary to achieve
    full notice of an action brought against them are required to bear
    the wasteful costs. This provision is made available in actions
    against defendants who cannot be served in the districts in which
    the actions are brought.
      Third, the revision reduces the hazard of commencing an action
    against the United States or its officers, agencies, and
    corporations. A party failing to effect service on all the offices
    of the United States as required by the rule is assured adequate
    time to cure defects in service.
      Fourth, the revision calls attention to the important effect of
    the Hague Convention and other treaties bearing on service of
    documents in foreign countries and favors the use of
    internationally agreed means of service. In some respects, these
    treaties have facilitated service in foreign countries but are not
    fully known to the bar.
      Finally, the revised rule extends the reach of federal courts to
    impose jurisdiction over the person of all defendants against whom
    federal law claims are made and who can be constitutionally
    subjected to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.
    The present territorial limits on the effectiveness of service to
    subject a defendant to the jurisdiction of the court over the
    defendant's person are retained for all actions in which there is a
    state in which personal jurisdiction can be asserted consistently
    with state law and the Fourteenth Amendment. A new provision
    enables district courts to exercise jurisdiction, if permissible
    under the Constitution and not precluded by statute, when a federal
    claim is made against a defendant not subject to the jurisdiction
    of any single state.
      The revised rule is reorganized to make its provisions more
    accessible to those not familiar with all of them. Additional
    subdivisions in this rule allow for more captions; several overlaps
    among subdivisions are eliminated; and several disconnected
    provisions are removed, to be relocated in a new Rule 4.1.
      The Caption of the Rule. Prior to this revision, Rule 4 was
    entitled "Process" and applied to the service of not only the
    summons but also other process as well, although these are not
    covered by the revised rule. Service of process in eminent domain
    proceedings is governed by Rule 71A. Service of a subpoena is
    governed by Rule 45, and service of papers such as orders, motions,
    notices, pleadings, and other documents is governed by Rule 5.
      The revised rule is entitled "Summons" and applies only to that
    form of legal process. Unless service of the summons is waived, a
    summons must be served whenever a person is joined as a party
    against whom a claim is made. Those few provisions of the former
    rule which relate specifically to service of process other than a
    summons are relocated in Rule 4.1 in order to simplify the text of
    this rule.
      Subdivision (a). Revised subdivision (a) contains most of the
    language of the former subdivision (b). The second sentence of the
    former subdivision (b) has been stricken, so that the federal court
    summons will be the same in all cases. Few states now employ
    distinctive requirements of form for a summons and the
    applicability of such a requirement in federal court can only serve
    as a trap for an unwary party or attorney. A sentence is added to
    this subdivision authorizing an amendment of a summons. This
    sentence replaces the rarely used former subdivision 4(h). See 4A
    Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 1131 (2d ed.
    1987).
      Subdivision (b). Revised subdivision (b) replaces the former
    subdivision (a). The revised text makes clear that the
    responsibility for filling in the summons falls on the plaintiff,
    not the clerk of the court. If there are multiple defendants, the
    plaintiff may secure issuance of a summons for each defendant, or
    may serve copies of a single original bearing the names of multiple
    defendants if the addressee of the summons is effectively
    identified.
      Subdivision (c). Paragraph (1) of revised subdivision (c) retains
    language from the former subdivision (d)(1). Paragraph (2) retains
    language from the former subdivision (a), and adds an appropriate
    caution regarding the time limit for service set forth in
    subdivision (m).
      The 1983 revision of Rule 4 relieved the marshals' offices of
    much of the burden of serving the summons. Subdivision (c)
    eliminates the requirement for service by the marshal's office in
    actions in which the party seeking service is the United States.
    The United States, like other civil litigants, is now permitted to
    designate any person who is 18 years of age and not a party to
    serve its summons.
      The court remains obligated to appoint a marshal, a deputy, or
    some other person to effect service of a summons in two classes of
    cases specified by statute: actions brought in forma pauperis or by
    a seaman. 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1915, 1916. The court also retains
    discretion to appoint a process server on motion of a party. If a
    law enforcement presence appears to be necessary or advisable to
    keep the peace, the court should appoint a marshal or deputy or
    other official person to make the service. The Department of
    Justice may also call upon the Marshals Service to perform services
    in actions brought by the United States. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 651.
      Subdivision (d). This text is new, but is substantially derived
    from the former subdivisions (c)(2)(C) and (D), added to the rule
    by Congress in 1983. The aims of the provision are to eliminate the
    costs of service of a summons on many parties and to foster
    cooperation among adversaries and counsel. The rule operates to
    impose upon the defendant those costs that could have been avoided
    if the defendant had cooperated reasonably in the manner
    prescribed. This device is useful in dealing with defendants who
    are furtive, who reside in places not easily reached by process
    servers, or who are outside the United States and can be served
    only at substantial and unnecessary expense. Illustratively, there
    is no useful purpose achieved by requiring a plaintiff to comply
    with all the formalities of service in a foreign country, including
    costs of translation, when suing a defendant manufacturer, fluent
    in English, whose products are widely distributed in the United
    States. See Bankston v. Toyota Motor Corp., 889 F.2d 172 (8th Cir.
    1989).
      The former text described this process as service-by-mail. This
    language misled some plaintiffs into thinking that service could be
    effected by mail without the affirmative cooperation of the
    defendant. E.g., Gulley v. Mayo Foundation, 886 F.2d 161 (8th Cir.
    1989). It is more accurate to describe the communication sent to
    the defendant as a request for a waiver of formal service.
      The request for waiver of service may be sent only to defendants
    subject to service under subdivision (e), (f), or (h). The United
    States is not expected to waive service for the reason that its
    mail receiving facilities are inadequate to assure that the notice
    is actually received by the correct person in the Department of
    Justice. The same principle is applied to agencies, corporations,
    and officers of the United States and to other governments and
    entities subject to service under subdivision (j). Moreover, there
    are policy reasons why governmental entities should not be
    confronted with the potential for bearing costs of service in cases
    in which they ultimately prevail. Infants or incompetent persons
    likewise are not called upon to waive service because, due to their
    presumed inability to understand the request and its consequences,
    they must generally be served through fiduciaries.
      It was unclear whether the former rule authorized mailing of a
    request for "acknowledgement of service" to defendants outside the
    forum state. See 1 R. Casad, Jurisdiction in Civil Actions (2d Ed.)
    5-29, 30 (1991) and cases cited. But, as Professor Casad observed,
    there was no reason not to employ this device in an effort to
    obtain service outside the state, and there are many instances in
    which it was in fact so used, with respect both to defendants
    within the United States and to defendants in other countries.
      The opportunity for waiver has distinct advantages to a foreign
    defendant. By waiving service, the defendant can reduce the costs
    that may ultimately be taxed against it if unsuccessful in the
    lawsuit, including the sometimes substantial expense of translation
    that may be wholly unnecessary for defendants fluent in English.
    Moreover, a foreign defendant that waives service is afforded
    substantially more time to defend against the action than if it had
    been formally served: under Rule 12, a defendant ordinarily has
    only 20 days after service in which to file its answer or raise
    objections by motion, but by signing a waiver it is allowed 90 days
    after the date the request for waiver was mailed in which to submit
    its defenses. Because of the additional time needed for mailing and
    the unreliability of some foreign mail services, a period of 60
    days (rather than the 30 days required for domestic transmissions)
    is provided for a return of a waiver sent to a foreign country.
      It is hoped that, since transmission of the notice and waiver
    forms is a private nonjudicial act, does not purport to effect
    service, and is not accompanied by any summons or directive from a
    court, use of the procedure will not offend foreign sovereignties,
    even those that have withheld their assent to formal service by
    mail or have objected to the "service-by-mail" provisions of the
    former rule. Unless the addressee consents, receipt of the request
    under the revised rule does not give rise to any obligation to
    answer the lawsuit, does not provide a basis for default judgment,
    and does not suspend the statute of limitations in those states
    where the period continues to run until service. Nor are there any
    adverse consequences to a foreign defendant, since the provisions
    for shifting the expense of service to a defendant that declines to
    waive service apply only if the plaintiff and defendant are both
    located in the United States.
      With respect to a defendant located in a foreign country like the
    United Kingdom, which accepts documents in English, whose Central
    Authority acts promptly in effecting service, and whose policies
    discourage its residents from waiving formal service, there will be
    little reason for a plaintiff to send the notice and request under
    subdivision (d) rather than use convention methods. On the other
    hand, the procedure offers significant potential benefits to a
    plaintiff when suing a defendant that, though fluent in English, is
    located in a country where, as a condition to formal service under
    a convention, documents must be translated into another language or
    where formal service will be otherwise costly or time-consuming.
      Paragraph (1) is explicit that a timely waiver of service of a
    summons does not prejudice the right of a defendant to object by
    means of a motion authorized by Rule 12(b)(2) to the absence of
    jurisdiction over the defendant's person, or to assert other
    defenses that may be available. The only issues eliminated are
    those involving the sufficiency of the summons or the sufficiency
    of the method by which it is served.
      Paragraph (2) states what the present rule implies: the defendant
    has a duty to avoid costs associated with the service of a summons
    not needed to inform the defendant regarding the commencement of an
    action. The text of the rule also sets forth the requirements for a
    Notice and Request for Waiver sufficient to put the cost-shifting
    provision in place. These requirements are illustrated in Forms 1A
    and 1B, which replace the former Form 18-A.
      Paragraph (2)(A) is explicit that a request for waiver of service
    by a corporate defendant must be addressed to a person qualified to
    receive service. The general mail rooms of large organizations
    cannot be required to identify the appropriate individual recipient
    for an institutional summons.
      Paragraph (2)(B) permits the use of alternatives to the United
    States mails in sending the Notice and Request. While private
    messenger services or electronic communications may be more
    expensive than the mail, they may be equally reliable and on
    occasion more convenient to the parties. Especially with respect to
    transmissions to foreign countries, alternative means may be
    desirable, for in some countries facsimile transmission is the most
    efficient and economical means of communication. If electronic
    means such as facsimile transmission are employed, the sender
    should maintain a record of the transmission to assure proof of
    transmission if receipt is denied, but a party receiving such a
    transmission has a duty to cooperate and cannot avoid liability for
    the resulting cost of formal service if the transmission is
    prevented at the point of receipt.
      A defendant failing to comply with a request for waiver shall be
    given an opportunity to show good cause for the failure, but
    sufficient cause should be rare. It is not a good cause for failure
    to waive service that the claim is unjust or that the court lacks
    jurisdiction. Sufficient cause not to shift the cost of service
    would exist, however, if the defendant did not receive the request
    or was insufficiently literate in English to understand it. It
    should be noted that the provisions for shifting the cost of
    service apply only if the plaintiff and the defendant are both
    located in the United States, and accordingly a foreign defendant
    need not show "good cause" for its failure to waive service.
      Paragraph (3) extends the time for answer if, before being served
    with process, the defendant waives formal service. The extension is
    intended to serve as an inducement to waive service and to assure
    that a defendant will not gain any delay by declining to waive
    service and thereby causing the additional time needed to effect
    service. By waiving service, a defendant is not called upon to
    respond to the complaint until 60 days from the date the notice was
    sent to it - 90 days if the notice was sent to a foreign country -
    rather than within the 20 day period from date of service specified
    in Rule 12.
      Paragraph (4) clarifies the effective date of service when
    service is waived; the provision is needed to resolve an issue
    arising when applicable law requires service of process to toll the
    statute of limitations. E.g., Morse v. Elmira Country Club, 752
    F.2d 35 (2d Cir. 1984). Cf. Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U.S.
    740 (1980).
      The provisions in former subdivision (c)(2)(C)(ii) of this rule
    may have been misleading to some parties. Some plaintiffs, not
    reading the rule carefully, supposed that receipt by the defendant
    of the mailed complaint had the effect both of establishing the
    jurisdiction of the court over the defendant's person and of
    tolling the statute of limitations in actions in which service of
    the summons is required to toll the limitations period. The revised
    rule is clear that, if the waiver is not returned and filed, the
    limitations period under such a law is not tolled and the action
    will not otherwise proceed until formal service of process is
    effected.
      Some state limitations laws may toll an otherwise applicable
    statute at the time when the defendant receives notice of the
    action. Nevertheless, the device of requested waiver of service is
    not suitable if a limitations period which is about to expire is
    not tolled by filing the action. Unless there is ample time, the
    plaintiff should proceed directly to the formal methods for service
    identified in subdivisions (e), (f), or (h).
      The procedure of requesting waiver of service should also not be
    used if the time for service under subdivision (m) will expire
    before the date on which the waiver must be returned. While a
    plaintiff has been allowed additional time for service in that
    situation, e.g., Prather v. Raymond Constr. Co., 570 F. Supp. 278
    (N.D. Ga. 1983), the court could refuse a request for additional
    time unless the defendant appears to have evaded service pursuant
    to subdivision (e) or (h). It may be noted that the presumptive
    time limit for service under subdivision (m) does not apply to
    service in a foreign country.
      Paragraph (5) is a cost-shifting provision retained from the
    former rule. The costs that may be imposed on the defendant could
    include, for example, the cost of the time of a process server
    required to make contact with a defendant residing in a guarded
    apartment house or residential development. The paragraph is
    explicit that the costs of enforcing the cost-shifting provision
    are themselves recoverable from a defendant who fails to return the
    waiver. In the absence of such a provision, the purpose of the rule
    would be frustrated by the cost of its enforcement, which is likely
    to be high in relation to the small benefit secured by the
    plaintiff.
      Some plaintiffs may send a notice and request for waiver and,
    without waiting for return of the waiver, also proceed with efforts
    to effect formal service on the defendant. To discourage this
    practice, the cost-shifting provisions in paragraphs (2) and (5)
    are limited to costs of effecting service incurred after the time
    expires for the defendant to return the waiver. Moreover, by
    returning the waiver within the time allowed and before being
    served with process, a defendant receives the benefit of the longer
    period for responding to the complaint afforded for waivers under
    paragraph (3).
      Subdivision (e). This subdivision replaces former subdivisions
    (c)(2)(C)(i) and (d)(1). It provides a means for service of summons
    on individuals within a judicial district of the United States.
    Together with subdivision (f), it provides for service on persons
    anywhere, subject to constitutional and statutory constraints.
      Service of the summons under this subdivision does not
    conclusively establish the jurisdiction of the court over the
    person of the defendant. A defendant may assert the territorial
    limits of the court's reach set forth in subdivision (k), including
    the constitutional limitations that may be imposed by the Due
    Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
      Paragraph (1) authorizes service in any judicial district in
    conformity with state law. This paragraph sets forth the language
    of former subdivision (c)(2)(C)(i), which authorized the use of the
    law of the state in which the district court sits, but adds as an
    alternative the use of the law of the state in which the service is
    effected.
      Paragraph (2) retains the text of the former subdivision (d)(1)
    and authorizes the use of the familiar methods of personal or abode
    service or service on an authorized agent in any judicial district.
      To conform to these provisions, the former subdivision (e)
    bearing on proceedings against parties not found within the state
    is stricken. Likewise stricken is the first sentence of the former
    subdivision (f), which had restricted the authority of the federal
    process server to the state in which the district court sits.
      Subdivision (f). This subdivision provides for service on
    individuals who are in a foreign country, replacing the former
    subdivision (i) that was added to Rule 4 in 1963. Reflecting the
    pattern of Rule 4 in incorporating state law limitations on the
    exercise of jurisdiction over persons, the former subdivision (i)
    limited service outside the United States to cases in which
    extraterritorial service was authorized by state or federal law.
    The new rule eliminates the requirement of explicit authorization.
    On occasion, service in a foreign country was held to be improper
    for lack of statutory authority. E.g., Martens v. Winder, 341 F.2d
    197 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 937 (1965). This authority,
    however, was found to exist by implication. E.g., SEC v. VTR, Inc.,
    39 F.R.D. 19 (S.D.N.Y. 1966). Given the substantial increase in the
    number of international transactions and events that are the
    subject of litigation in federal courts, it is appropriate to infer
    a general legislative authority to effect service on defendants in
    a foreign country.
      A secondary effect of this provision for foreign service of a
    federal summons is to facilitate the use of federal long-arm law in
    actions brought to enforce the federal law against defendants who
    cannot be served under any state law but who can be
    constitutionally subjected to the jurisdiction of the federal
    court. Such a provision is set forth in paragraph (2) of
    subdivision (k) of this rule, applicable only to persons not
    subject to the territorial jurisdiction of any particular state.
      Paragraph (1) gives effect to the Hague Convention on the Service
    Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents, which entered into
    force for the United States on February 10, 1969. See 28 U.S.C.A.,
    Fed.R.Civ.P. 4 (Supp. 1986). This Convention is an important means
    of dealing with problems of service in a foreign country. See
    generally 1 B. Ristau, International Judicial Assistance Secs. 4-1-
    1 to 4-5-2 (1990). Use of the Convention procedures, when
    available, is mandatory if documents must be transmitted abroad to
    effect service. See Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Schlunk,
    486 U.S. 694 (1988) (noting that voluntary use of these procedures
    may be desirable even when service could constitutionally be
    effected in another manner); J. Weis, The Federal Rules and the
    Hague Conventions: Concerns of Conformity and Comity, 50 U. Pitt.
    L. Rev. 903 (1989). Therefore, this paragraph provides that, when
    service is to be effected outside a judicial district of the United
    States, the methods of service appropriate under an applicable
    treaty shall be employed if available and if the treaty so
    requires.
      The Hague Convention furnishes safeguards against the abridgment
    of rights of parties through inadequate notice. Article 15 provides
    for verification of actual notice or a demonstration that process
    was served by a method prescribed by the internal laws of the
    foreign state before a default judgment may be entered. Article 16
    of the Convention also enables the judge to extend the time for
    appeal after judgment if the defendant shows a lack of adequate
    notice either to defend or to appeal the judgment, or has disclosed
    a prima facie case on the merits.
      The Hague Convention does not specify a time within which a
    foreign country's Central Authority must effect service, but
    Article 15 does provide that alternate methods may be used if a
    Central Authority does not respond within six months. Generally, a
    Central Authority can be expected to respond much more quickly than
    that limit might permit, but there have been occasions when the
    signatory state was dilatory or refused to cooperate for
    substantive reasons. In such cases, resort may be had to the
    provision set forth in subdivision (f)(3).
      Two minor changes in the text reflect the Hague Convention.
    First, the term "letter of request" has been added. Although these
    words are synonymous with "letter rogatory," "letter of request" is
    preferred in modern usage. The provision should not be interpreted
    to authorize use of a letter of request when there is in fact no
    treaty obligation on the receiving country to honor such a request
    from this country or when the United States does not extend
    diplomatic recognition to the foreign nation. Second, the passage
    formerly found in subdivision (i)(1)(B), "when service in either
    case is reasonably calculated to give actual notice," has been
    relocated.
      Paragraph (2) provides alternative methods for use when
    internationally agreed methods are not intended to be exclusive, or
    where there is no international agreement applicable. It contains
    most of the language formerly set forth in subdivision (i) of the
    rule. Service by methods that would violate foreign law is not
    generally authorized. Subparagraphs (A) and (B) prescribe the more
    appropriate methods for conforming to local practice or using a
    local authority. Subparagraph (C) prescribes other methods
    authorized by the former rule.
      Paragraph (3) authorizes the court to approve other methods of
    service not prohibited by international agreements. The Hague
    Convention, for example, authorizes special forms of service in
    cases of urgency if convention methods will not permit service
    within the time required by the circumstances. Other circumstances
    that might justify the use of additional methods include the
    failure of the foreign country's Central Authority to effect
    service within the six-month period provided by the Convention, or
    the refusal of the Central Authority to serve a complaint seeking
    punitive damages or to enforce the antitrust laws of the United
    States. In such cases, the court may direct a special method of
    service not explicitly authorized by international agreement if not
    prohibited by the agreement. Inasmuch as our Constitution requires
    that reasonable notice be given, an earnest effort should be made
    to devise a method of communication that is consistent with due
    process and minimizes offense to foreign law. A court may in some
    instances specially authorize use of ordinary mail. Cf. Levin v.
    Ruby Trading Corp., 248 F. Supp. 537 (S.D.N.Y. 1965).
      Subdivision (g). This subdivision retains the text of former
    subdivision (d)(2). Provision is made for service upon an infant or
    incompetent person in a foreign country.
      Subdivision (h). This subdivision retains the text of former
    subdivision (d)(3), with changes reflecting those made in
    subdivision (e). It also contains the provisions for service on a
    corporation or association in a foreign country, as formerly found
    in subdivision (i).
      Frequent use should be made of the Notice and Request procedure
    set forth in subdivision (d) in actions against corporations. Care
    must be taken, however, to address the request to an individual
    officer or authorized agent of the corporation. It is not effective
    use of the Notice and Request procedure if the mail is sent
    undirected to the mail room of the organization.
      Subdivision (i). This subdivision retains much of the text of
    former subdivisions (d)(4) and (d)(5). Paragraph (1) provides for
    service of a summons on the United States; it amends former
    subdivision (d)(4) to permit the United States attorney to be
    served by registered or certified mail. The rule does not authorize
    the use of the Notice and Request procedure of revised subdivision
    (d) when the United States is the defendant. To assure proper
    handling of mail in the United States attorney's office, the
    authorized mail service must be specifically addressed to the civil
    process clerk of the office of the United States attorney.
      Paragraph (2) replaces former subdivision (d)(5). Paragraph (3)
    saves the plaintiff from the hazard of losing a substantive right
    because of failure to comply with the complex requirements of
    multiple service under this subdivision. That risk has proved to be
    more than nominal. E.g., Whale v. United States, 792 F.2d 951 (9th
    Cir. 1986). This provision should be read in connection with the
    provisions of subdivision (c) of Rule 15 to preclude the loss of
    substantive rights against the United States or its agencies,
    corporations, or officers resulting from a plaintiff's failure to
    correctly identify and serve all the persons who should be named or
    served.
      Subdivision (j). This subdivision retains the text of former
    subdivision (d)(6) without material change. The waiver-of-service
    provision is also inapplicable to actions against governments
    subject to service pursuant to this subdivision.
      The revision adds a new paragraph (1) referring to the statute
    governing service of a summons on a foreign state and its political
    subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities, the Foreign
    Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1608. The caption
    of the subdivision reflects that change.
      Subdivision (k). This subdivision replaces the former subdivision
    (f), with no change in the title. Paragraph (1) retains the
    substance of the former rule in explicitly authorizing the exercise
    of personal jurisdiction over persons who can be reached under
    state long-arm law, the "100-mile bulge" provision added in 1963,
    or the federal interpleader act. Paragraph (1)(D) is new, but
    merely calls attention to federal legislation that may provide for
    nationwide or even world-wide service of process in cases arising
    under particular federal laws. Congress has provided for nationwide
    service of process and full exercise of territorial jurisdiction by
    all district courts with respect to specified federal actions. See
    1 R. Casad, Jurisdiction in Civil Actions (2d Ed.) chap. 5 (1991).
      Paragraph (2) is new. It authorizes the exercise of territorial
    jurisdiction over the person of any defendant against whom is made
    a claim arising under any federal law if that person is subject to
    personal jurisdiction in no state. This addition is a companion to
    the amendments made in revised subdivisions (e) and (f).
      This paragraph corrects a gap in the enforcement of federal law.
    Under the former rule, a problem was presented when the defendant
    was a non-resident of the United States having contacts with the
    United States sufficient to justify the application of United
    States law and to satisfy federal standards of forum selection, but
    having insufficient contact with any single state to support
    jurisdiction under state long-arm legislation or meet the
    requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment limitation on state court
    territorial jurisdiction. In such cases, the defendant was shielded
    from the enforcement of federal law by the fortuity of a favorable
    limitation on the power of state courts, which was incorporated
    into the federal practice by the former rule. In this respect, the
    revision responds to the suggestion of the Supreme Court made in
    Omni Capital Int'l v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., Ltd., 484 U.S. 97, 111
    (1987).
      There remain constitutional limitations on the exercise of
    territorial jurisdiction by federal courts over persons outside the
    United States. These restrictions arise from the Fifth Amendment
    rather than from the Fourteenth Amendment, which limits state-court
    reach and which was incorporated into federal practice by the
    reference to state law in the text of the former subdivision (e)
    that is deleted by this revision. The Fifth Amendment requires that
    any defendant have affiliating contacts with the United States
    sufficient to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction over
    that party. Cf. Wells Fargo & Co. v. Wells Fargo Express Co., 556
    F.2d 406, 418 (9th Cir. 1977). There also may be a further Fifth
    Amendment constraint in that a plaintiff's forum selection might be
    so inconvenient to a defendant that it would be a denial of "fair
    play and substantial justice" required by the due process clause,
    even though the defendant had significant affiliating contacts with
    the United States. See DeJames v. Magnificent Carriers, 654 F.2d
    280, 286 n.3 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1085 (1981).
    Compare World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 293-
    294 (1980); Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites
    de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 702-03 (1982); Burger King Corp. v.
    Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 476-78 (1985); Asahi Metal Indus. v.
    Superior Court of Cal., Solano County, 480 U.S. 102, 108-13 (1987).
    See generally R. Lusardi, Nationwide Service of Process: Due
    Process Limitations on the Power of the Sovereign, 33 Vill. L. Rev.
    1 (1988).
      This provision does not affect the operation of federal venue
    legislation. See generally 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1391. Nor does it affect
    the operation of federal law providing for the change of venue. 28
    U.S.C. Secs. 1404, 1406. The availability of transfer for fairness
    and convenience under Sec. 1404 should preclude most conflicts
    between the full exercise of territorial jurisdiction permitted by
    this rule and the Fifth Amendment requirement of "fair play and
    substantial justice."
      The district court should be especially scrupulous to protect
    aliens who reside in a foreign country from forum selections so
    onerous that injustice could result. "[G]reat care and reserve
    should be exercised when extending our notions of personal
    jurisdiction into the international field." Asahi Metal Indus. v.
    Superior Court of Cal., Solano County, 480 U.S. 102, 115 (1987),
    quoting United States v. First Nat'l City Bank, 379 U.S. 378, 404
    (1965) (Harlan, J., dissenting).
      This narrow extension of the federal reach applies only if a
    claim is made against the defendant under federal law. It does not
    establish personal jurisdiction if the only claims are those
    arising under state law or the law of another country, even though
    there might be diversity or alienage subject matter jurisdiction as
    to such claims. If, however, personal jurisdiction is established
    under this paragraph with respect to a federal claim, then 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 1367(a) provides supplemental jurisdiction over related
    claims against that defendant, subject to the court's discretion to
    decline exercise of that jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1367(c).
      Subdivision (l). This subdivision assembles in one place all the
    provisions of the present rule bearing on proof of service. No
    material change in the rule is effected. The provision that proof
    of service can be amended by leave of court is retained from the
    former subdivision (h). See generally 4A Wright & Miller, Federal
    Practice and Procedure Sec. 1132 (2d ed. 1987).
      Subdivision (m). This subdivision retains much of the language of
    the present subdivision (j).
      The new subdivision explicitly provides that the court shall
    allow additional time if there is good cause for the plaintiff's
    failure to effect service in the prescribed 120 days, and
    authorizes the court to relieve a plaintiff of the consequences of
    an application of this subdivision even if there is no good cause
    shown. Such relief formerly was afforded in some cases, partly in
    reliance on Rule 6(b). Relief may be justified, for example, if the
    applicable statute of limitations would bar the refiled action, or
    if the defendant is evading service or conceals a defect in
    attempted service. E.g., Ditkof v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., 114 F.R.D.
    104 (E.D. Mich. 1987). A specific instance of good cause is set
    forth in paragraph (3) of this rule, which provides for extensions
    if necessary to correct oversights in compliance with the
    requirements of multiple service in actions against the United
    States or its officers, agencies, and corporations. The district
    court should also take care to protect pro se plaintiffs from
    consequences of confusion or delay attending the resolution of an
    in forma pauperis petition. Robinson v. America's Best Contacts &
    Eyeglasses, 876 F.2d 596 (7th Cir. 1989).
      The 1983 revision of this subdivision referred to the "party on
    whose behalf such service was required," rather than to the
    "plaintiff," a term used generically elsewhere in this rule to
    refer to any party initiating a claim against a person who is not a
    party to the action. To simplify the text, the revision returns to
    the usual practice in the rule of referring simply to the plaintiff
    even though its principles apply with equal force to defendants who
    may assert claims against non-parties under Rules 13(h), 14, 19,
    20, or 21.
      Subdivision (n). This subdivision provides for in rem and quasi-
    in-rem jurisdiction. Paragraph (1) incorporates any requirements
    of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1655 or similar provisions bearing on seizures or
    liens.
      Paragraph (2) provides for other uses of quasi-in-rem
    jurisdiction but limits its use to exigent circumstances.
    Provisional remedies may be employed as a means to secure
    jurisdiction over the property of a defendant whose person is not
    within reach of the court, but occasions for the use of this
    provision should be rare, as where the defendant is a fugitive or
    assets are in imminent danger of disappearing. Until 1963, it was
    not possible under Rule 4 to assert jurisdiction in a federal court
    over the property of a defendant not personally served. The 1963
    amendment to subdivision (e) authorized the use of state law
    procedures authorizing seizures of assets as a basis for
    jurisdiction. Given the liberal availability of long-arm
    jurisdiction, the exercise of power quasi-in-rem has become almost
    an anachronism. Circumstances too spare to affiliate the defendant
    to the forum state sufficiently to support long-arm jurisdiction
    over the defendant's person are also inadequate to support seizure
    of the defendant's assets fortuitously found within the state.
    Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186 (1977).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      Paragraph (2)(B) is added to Rule 4(i) to require service on the
    United States when a United States officer or employee is sued in
    an individual capacity for acts or omissions occurring in
    connection with duties performed on behalf of the United States.
    Decided cases provide uncertain guidance on the question whether
    the United States must be served in such actions. See Vaccaro v.
    Dobre, 81 F.3d 854, 856-857 (9th Cir. 1996); Armstrong v. Sears, 33
    F.3d 182, 185-187 (2d Cir. 1994); Ecclesiastical Order of the Ism
    of Am v. Chasin, 845 F.2d 113, 116 (6th Cir. 1988); Light v. Wolf,
    816 F.2d 746 (D.C. Cir. 1987); see also Simpkins v. District of
    Columbia, 108 F.3d 366, 368-369 (D.C. Cir. 1997). Service on the
    United States will help to protect the interest of the individual
    defendant in securing representation by the United States, and will
    expedite the process of determining whether the United States will
    provide representation. It has been understood that the individual
    defendant must be served as an individual defendant, a requirement
    that is made explicit. Invocation of the individual service
    provisions of subdivisions (e), (f), and (g) invokes also the
    waiver-of-service provisions of subdivision (d).
      Paragraph 2(B) reaches service when an officer or employee of the
    United States is sued in an individual capacity "for acts or
    omissions occurring in connection with the performance of duties on
    behalf of the United States." This phrase has been chosen as a
    functional phrase that can be applied without the occasionally
    distracting associations of such phrases as "scope of employment,"
    "color of office," or "arising out of the employment." Many actions
    are brought against individual federal officers or employees of the
    United States for acts or omissions that have no connection
    whatever to their governmental roles. There is no reason to require
    service on the United States in these actions. The connection to
    federal employment that requires service on the United States must
    be determined as a practical matter, considering whether the
    individual defendant has reasonable grounds to look to the United
    States for assistance and whether the United States has reasonable
    grounds for demanding formal notice of the action.
      An action against a former officer or employee of the United
    States is covered by paragraph (2)(B) in the same way as an action
    against a present officer or employee. Termination of the
    relationship between the individual defendant and the United States
    does not reduce the need to serve the United States.
      Paragraph (3) is amended to ensure that failure to serve the
    United States in an action governed by paragraph 2(B) does not
    defeat an action. This protection is adopted because there will be
    cases in which the plaintiff reasonably fails to appreciate the
    need to serve the United States. There is no requirement, however,
    that the plaintiff show that the failure to serve the United States
    was reasonable. A reasonable time to effect service on the United
    States must be allowed after the failure is pointed out. An
    additional change ensures that if the United States or United
    States attorney is served in an action governed by paragraph 2(A),
    additional time is to be allowed even though no officer, employee,
    agency, or corporation of the United States was served.
      GAP Report. The most important changes were made to ensure that
    no one would read the seemingly independent provisions of
    paragraphs 2(A) and 2(B) to mean that service must be made twice
    both on the United States and on the United States employee when
    the employee is sued in both official and individual capacities.
    The word "only" was added in subparagraph (A) and the new phrase
    "whether or not the officer or employee is sued also in an
    individual capacity" was inserted in subparagraph (B).
      Minor changes were made to include "Employees" in the catchline
    for subdivision (i), and to add "or employee" in paragraph 2(A).
    Although it may seem awkward to think of suit against an employee
    in an official capacity, there is no clear definition that
    separates "officers" from "employees" for this purpose. The
    published proposal to amend Rule 12(a)(3) referred to actions
    against an employee sued in an official capacity, and it seemed
    better to make the rules parallel by adding "employee" to Rule
    4(i)(2)(A) than by deleting it from Rule 12(a)(3)(A).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 4 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Rule 4(d)(1)(C) corrects an inadvertent error in former Rule
    4(d)(2)(G). The defendant needs two copies of the waiver form, not
    an extra copy of the notice and request.
      Rule 4(g) changes "infant" to "minor." "Infant" in the present
    rule means "minor." Modern word usage suggests that "minor" will
    better maintain the intended meaning. The same change from "infant"
    to "minor" is made throughout the rules. In addition, subdivision
    (f)(3) is added to the description of methods of service that the
    court may order; the addition ensures the evident intent that the
    court not order service by means prohibited by international
    agreement.
      Rule 4(i)(4) corrects a misleading reference to "the plaintiff"
    in former Rule 4(i)(3). A party other than a plaintiff may need a
    reasonable time to effect service. Rule 4(i)(4) properly covers any
    party.
      Former Rule 4(j)(2) refers to service upon an "other governmental
    organization subject to suit." This is changed to "any other state-
    created governmental organization that is subject to suit." The
    change entrenches the meaning indicated by the caption ("Serving a
    Foreign, State, or Local Government"), and the invocation of state
    law. It excludes any risk that this rule might be read to govern
    service on a federal agency, or other entities not created by state
    law.
      The former provision describing service on interpleader claimants
    [former subd. (k)(1)(C)] is deleted as redundant in light of the
    general provision in (k)(1)(C) recognizing personal jurisdiction
    authorized by a federal statute.

                          AMENDMENT BY PUBLIC LAW                      
      1983 - Subd. (a). Pub. L. 97-462, Sec. 2(1), substituted "deliver
    the summons to the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney, who shall
    be responsible for prompt service of the summons and a copy of the
    complaint" for "deliver it for service to the marshal or to any
    other person authorized by Rule 4(c) to serve it".
      Subd. (c). Pub. L. 97-462, Sec. 2(2), substituted provision with
    subd. heading "Service" for provision with subd. heading "By Whom
    Served" which read: "Service of process shall be made by a United
    States marshal, by his deputy, or by some person specially
    appointed by the court for that purpose, except that a subpoena may
    be served as provided in Rule 45. Special appointments to serve
    process shall be made freely. Service of process may also be made
    by a person authorized to serve process in an action brought in the
    courts of general jurisdiction of the state in which the district
    court is held or in which service is made."
      Subd. (d). Pub. L. 97-462, Sec. 2(3), (4), substituted "Summons
    and Complaint: Person to be Served" for "Summons: Personal Service"
    in subd. heading.
      Subd. (d)(5). Pub. L. 97-462, Sec. 2(4), substituted "sending a
    copy of the summons and of the complaint by registered or certified
    mail" for "delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint".
      Subd. (d)(7). Pub. L. 97-462, Sec. 2(3)(B), struck out par. (7)
    which read: "Upon a defendant of any class referred to in paragraph
    (1) or (3) of this subdivision of this rule, it is also sufficient
    if the summons and complaint are served in the manner prescribed by
    any statute of the United States or in the manner prescribed by the
    law of the state in which the district court is held for the
    service of summons or other like process upon any such defendant in
    an action brought in the courts of general jurisdiction of that
    state.". See subd. (c)(2)(C) of this rule.
      Subd. (e). Pub. L. 97-462, Sec. 2(5), substituted "Summons" for
    "Same" as subd. heading.
      Subd. (g). Pub. L. 97-462, Sec. 2(6), substituted in second
    sentence "deputy United States marshal" and "such person" for "his
    deputy" and "he" and inserted third sentence "If service is made
    under subdivision (c)(2)(C)(ii) of this rule, return shall be made
    by the sender's filing with the court the acknowledgment received
    pursuant to such subdivision.".

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. Process - other than a summons under Rule 4 or a
    subpoena under Rule 45 - must be served by a United States marshal
    or deputy marshal or by a person specially appointed for that
    purpose. It may be served anywhere within the territorial limits of
    the state where the district court is located and, if authorized by
    a federal statute, beyond those limits. Proof of service must be
    made under Rule 4(l).
      (b) Enforcing Orders: Committing for Civil Contempt. An order
    committing a person for civil contempt of a decree or injunction
    issued to enforce federal law may be served and enforced in any
    district. Any other order in a civil-contempt proceeding may be
    served only in the state where the issuing court is located or
    elsewhere in the United States within 100 miles from where the
    order was issued.

      This is a new rule. Its purpose is to separate those few
    provisions of the former Rule 4 bearing on matters other than
    service of a summons to allow greater textual clarity in Rule 4.
    Subdivision (a) contains no new language.
      Subdivision (b) replaces the final clause of the penultimate
    sentence of the former subdivision 4(f), a clause added to the rule
    in 1963. The new rule provides for nationwide service of orders of
    civil commitment enforcing decrees of injunctions issued to compel
    compliance with federal law. The rule makes no change in the
    practice with respect to the enforcement of injunctions or decrees
    not involving the enforcement of federally-created rights.
      Service of process is not required to notify a party of a decree
    or injunction, or of an order that the party show cause why that
    party should not be held in contempt of such an order. With respect
    to a party who has once been served with a summons, the service of
    the decree or injunction itself or of an order to show cause can be
    made pursuant to Rule 5. Thus, for example, an injunction may be
    served on a party through that person's attorney. Chagas v. United
    States, 369 F.2d 643 (5th Cir. 1966). The same is true for service
    of an order to show cause. Waffenschmidt v. Mackay, 763 F.2d 711
    (5th Cir. 1985).
      The new rule does not affect the reach of the court to impose
    criminal contempt sanctions. Nationwide enforcement of federal
    decrees and injunctions is already available with respect to
    criminal contempt: a federal court may effect the arrest of a
    criminal contemnor anywhere in the United States, 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    3041, and a contemnor when arrested may be subject to removal to
    the district in which punishment may be imposed. Fed. R. Crim. P.
    40. Thus, the present law permits criminal contempt enforcement
    against a contemnor wherever that person may be found.
      The effect of the revision is to provide a choice of civil or
    criminal contempt sanctions in those situations to which it
    applies. Contempt proceedings, whether civil or criminal, must be
    brought in the court that was allegedly defied by a contumacious
    act. Ex parte Bradley, 74 U.S. 366 (1869). This is so even if the
    offensive conduct or inaction occurred outside the district of the
    court in which the enforcement proceeding must be conducted. E.g.,
    McCourtney v. United States, 291 Fed. 497 (8th Cir.), cert. denied,
    263 U.S. 714 (1923). For this purpose, the rule as before does not
    distinguish between parties and other persons subject to contempt
    sanctions by reason of their relation or connection to parties.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 4.1 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE II. COMMENCING AN ACTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS, PLEADINGS,
      MOTIONS, AND ORDERS                                     

-HEAD-
    Rule 5. Serving and Filing Pleadings and Other Papers

-STATUTE-
      (a) Service: When Required.
        (1) In General. Unless these rules provide otherwise, each of
      the following papers must be served on every party:
          (A) an order stating that service is required;
          (B) a pleading filed after the original complaint, unless the
        court orders otherwise under Rule 5(c) because there are
        numerous defendants;
          (C) a discovery paper required to be served on a party,
        unless the court orders otherwise;
          (D) a written motion, except one that may be heard ex parte;
        and
          (E) a written notice, appearance, demand, or offer of
        judgment, or any similar paper.

        (2) If a Party Fails to Appear. No service is required on a
      party who is in default for failing to appear. But a pleading
      that asserts a new claim for relief against such a party must be
      served on that party under Rule 4.
        (3) Seizing Property. If an action is begun by seizing property
      and no person is or need be named as a defendant, any service
      required before the filing of an appearance, answer, or claim
      must be made on the person who had custody or possession of the
      property when it was seized.

      (b) Service: How Made.
        (1) Serving an Attorney. If a party is represented by an
      attorney, service under this rule must be made on the attorney
      unless the court orders service on the party.
        (2) Service in General. A paper is served under this rule by:
          (A) handing it to the person;
          (B) leaving it:
            (i) at the person's office with a clerk or other person in
          charge or, if no one is in charge, in a conspicuous place in
          the office; or
            (ii) if the person has no office or the office is closed,
          at the person's dwelling or usual place of abode with someone
          of suitable age and discretion who resides there;

          (C) mailing it to the person's last known address - in which
        event service is complete upon mailing;
          (D) leaving it with the court clerk if the person has no
        known address;
          (E) sending it by electronic means if the person consented in
        writing - in which event service is complete upon transmission,
        but is not effective if the serving party learns that it did
        not reach the person to be served; or
          (F) delivering it by any other means that the person
        consented to in writing - in which event service is complete
        when the person making service delivers it to the agency
        designated to make delivery.

        (3) Using Court Facilities. If a local rule so authorizes, a
      party may use the court's transmission facilities to make service
      under Rule 5(b)(2)(E).

      (c) Serving Numerous Defendants.
        (1) In General. If an action involves an unusually large number
      of defendants, the court may, on motion or on its own, order
      that:
          (A) defendants' pleadings and replies to them need not be
        served on other defendants;
          (B) any crossclaim, counterclaim, avoidance, or affirmative
        defense in those pleadings and replies to them will be treated
        as denied or avoided by all other parties; and
          (C) filing any such pleading and serving it on the plaintiff
        constitutes notice of the pleading to all parties.

        (2) Notifying Parties. A copy of every such order must be
      served on the parties as the court directs.

      (d) Filing.
        (1) Required Filings; Certificate of Service. Any paper after
      the complaint that is required to be served - together with a
      certificate of service - must be filed within a reasonable time
      after service. But disclosures under Rule 26(a)(1) or (2) and the
      following discovery requests and responses must not be filed
      until they are used in the proceeding or the court orders filing:
      depositions, interrogatories, requests for documents or tangible
      things or to permit entry onto land, and requests for admission.
        (2) How Filing Is Made - In General. A paper is filed by
      delivering it:
          (A) to the clerk; or
          (B) to a judge who agrees to accept it for filing, and who
        must then note the filing date on the paper and promptly send
        it to the clerk.

        (3) Electronic Filing, Signing, or Verification. A court may,
      by local rule, allow papers to be filed, signed, or verified by
      electronic means that are consistent with any technical standards
      established by the Judicial Conference of the United States. A
      local rule may require electronic filing only if reasonable
      exceptions are allowed. A paper filed electronically in
      compliance with a local rule is a written paper for purposes of
      these rules.
        (4) Acceptance by the Clerk. The clerk must not refuse to file
      a paper solely because it is not in the form prescribed by these
      rules or by a local rule or practice.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      The words "affected thereby," stricken out by the amendment,
    introduced a problem of interpretation. See 1 Barron & Holtzoff,
    Federal Practice & Procedure 760-61 (Wright ed. 1960). The
    amendment eliminates this difficulty and promotes full exchange of
    information among the parties by requiring service of papers on all
    the parties to the action, except as otherwise provided in the
    rules. See also subdivision (c) of Rule 5. So, for example, a third-
    party defendant is required to serve his answer to the third-party
    complaint not only upon the defendant but also upon the plaintiff.
    See amended Form 22-A and the Advisory Committee's Note thereto.
      As to the method of serving papers upon a party whose address is
    unknown, see Rule 5(b).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1970 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment makes clear that all papers relating to discovery
    which are required to be served on any party must be served on all
    parties, unless the court orders otherwise. The present language
    expressly includes notices and demands, but it is not explicit as
    to answers or responses as provided in Rules 33, 34, and 36.
    Discovery papers may be voluminous or the parties numerous, and the
    court is empowered to vary the requirement if in a given case it
    proves needlessly onerous.
      In actions begun by seizure of property, service will at times
    have to be made before the absent owner of the property has filed
    an appearance. For example, a prompt deposition may be needed in a
    maritime action in rem. See Rules 30(a) and 30(b)(2) and the
    related notes. A provision is added authorizing service on the
    person having custody or possession of the property at the time of
    its seizure.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1980 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (d). By the terms of this rule and Rule 30(f)(1)
    discovery materials must be promptly filed, although it often
    happens that no use is made of the materials after they are filed.
    Because the copies required for filing are an added expense and the
    large volume of discovery filings presents serious problems of
    storage in some districts, the Committee in 1978 first proposed
    that discovery materials not be filed unless on order of the court
    or for use in the proceedings. But such materials are sometimes of
    interest to those who may have no access to them except by a
    requirement of filing, such as members of a class, litigants
    similarly situated, or the public generally. Accordingly, this
    amendment and a change in Rule 30(f)(1) continue the requirement of
    filing but make it subject to an order of the court that discovery
    materials not be filed unless filing is requested by the court or
    is effected by parties who wish to use the materials in the
    proceeding.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (d). This subdivision is amended to require that the
    person making service under the rule certify that service has been
    effected. Such a requirement has generally been imposed by local
    rule.
      Having such information on file may be useful for many purposes,
    including proof of service if an issue arises concerning the
    effectiveness of the service. The certificate will generally
    specify the date as well as the manner of service, but parties
    employing private delivery services may sometimes be unable to
    specify the date of delivery. In the latter circumstance, a
    specification of the date of transmission of the paper to the
    delivery service may be sufficient for the purposes of this rule.
      Subdivision (e). The words "pleading and other" are stricken as
    unnecessary. Pleadings are papers within the meaning of the rule.
    The revision also accommodates the development of the use of
    facsimile transmission for filing.
      Several local district rules have directed the office of the
    clerk to refuse to accept for filing papers not conforming to
    certain requirements of form imposed by local rules or practice.
    This is not a suitable role for the office of the clerk, and the
    practice exposes litigants to the hazards of time bars; for these
    reasons, such rules are proscribed by this revision. The
    enforcement of these rules and of the local rules is a role for a
    judicial officer. A clerk may of course advise a party or counsel
    that a particular instrument is not in proper form, and may be
    directed to so inform the court.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      This is a technical amendment, using the broader language of Rule
    25 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. The district court -
     and the bankruptcy court by virtue of a cross-reference in
    Bankruptcy Rule 7005 - can, by local rule, permit filing not only
    by facsimile transmissions but also by other electronic means,
    subject to standards approved by the Judicial Conference.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1996 AMENDMENT       
      The present Rule 5(e) has authorized filing by facsimile or other
    electronic means on two conditions. The filing must be authorized
    by local rule. Use of this means of filing must be authorized by
    the Judicial Conference of the United States and must be consistent
    with standards established by the Judicial Conference. Attempts to
    develop Judicial Conference standards have demonstrated the value
    of several adjustments in the rule.
      The most significant change discards the requirement that the
    Judicial Conference authorize local electronic filing rules. As
    before, each district may decide for itself whether it has the
    equipment and personnel required to establish electronic filing,
    but a district that wishes to establish electronic filing need no
    longer await Judicial Conference action.
      The role of the Judicial Conference standards is clarified by
    specifying that the standards are to govern technical matters.
    Technical standards can provide nationwide uniformity, enabling
    ready use of electronic filing without pausing to adjust for the
    otherwise inevitable variations among local rules. Judicial
    Conference adoption of technical standards should prove superior to
    specification in these rules. Electronic technology has advanced
    with great speed. The process of adopting Judicial Conference
    standards should prove speedier and more flexible in determining
    the time for the first uniform standards, in adjusting standards at
    appropriate intervals, and in sparing the Supreme Court and
    Congress the need to consider technological details. Until Judicial
    Conference standards are adopted, however, uniformity will occur
    only to the extent that local rules deliberately seek to copy other
    local rules.
      It is anticipated that Judicial Conference standards will govern
    such technical specifications as data formatting, speed of
    transmission, means to transmit copies of supporting documents, and
    security of communication. Perhaps more important, standards must
    be established to assure proper maintenance and integrity of the
    record and to provide appropriate access and retrieval mechanisms.
    Local rules must address these issues until Judicial Conference
    standards are adopted.
      The amended rule also makes clear the equality of filing by
    electronic means with written filings. An electronic filing that
    complies with the local rule satisfies all requirements for filing
    on paper, signature, or verification. An electronic filing that
    otherwise satisfies the requirements of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1746 need
    not be separately made in writing. Public access to electronic
    filings is governed by the same rules as govern written filings.
      The separate reference to filing by facsimile transmission is
    deleted. Facsimile transmission continues to be included as an
    electronic means.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (d). Rule 5(d) is amended to provide that disclosures
    under Rule 26(a)(1) and (2), and discovery requests and responses
    under Rules 30, 31, 33, 34, and 36 must not be filed until they are
    used in the action. "Discovery requests" includes deposition
    notices and "discovery responses" includes objections. The rule
    supersedes and invalidates local rules that forbid, permit, or
    require filing of these materials before they are used in the
    action. The former Rule 26(a)(4) requirement that disclosures under
    Rule 26(a)(1) and (2) be filed has been removed. Disclosures under
    Rule 26(a)(3), however, must be promptly filed as provided in Rule
    26(a)(3). Filings in connection with Rule 35 examinations, which
    involve a motion proceeding when the parties do not agree, are
    unaffected by these amendments.
      Recognizing the costs imposed on parties and courts by required
    filing of discovery materials that are never used in an action,
    Rule 5(d) was amended in 1980 to authorize court orders that excuse
    filing. Since then, many districts have adopted local rules that
    excuse or forbid filing. In 1989 the Judicial Conference Local
    Rules Project concluded that these local rules were inconsistent
    with Rule 5(d), but urged the Advisory Committee to consider
    amending the rule. Local Rules Project at 92 (1989). The Judicial
    Conference of the Ninth Circuit gave the Committee similar advice
    in 1997. The reality of nonfiling reflected in these local rules
    has even been assumed in drafting the national rules. In 1993, Rule
    30(f)(1) was amended to direct that the officer presiding at a
    deposition file it with the court or send it to the attorney who
    arranged for the transcript or recording. The Committee Note
    explained that this alternative to filing was designed for "courts
    which direct that depositions not be automatically filed." Rule
    30(f)(1) has been amended to conform to this change in Rule 5(d).
      Although this amendment is based on widespread experience with
    local rules, and confirms the results directed by these local
    rules, it is designed to supersede and invalidate local rules.
    There is no apparent reason to have different filing rules in
    different districts. Even if districts vary in present capacities
    to store filed materials that are not used in an action, there is
    little reason to continue expending court resources for this
    purpose. These costs and burdens would likely change as parties
    make increased use of audio- and videotaped depositions. Equipment
    to facilitate review and reproduction of such discovery materials
    may prove costly to acquire, maintain, and operate.
      The amended rule provides that discovery materials and
    disclosures under Rule 26(a)(1) and (a)(2) must not be filed until
    they are "used in the proceeding." This phrase is meant to refer to
    proceedings in court. This filing requirement is not triggered by
    "use" of discovery materials in other discovery activities, such as
    depositions. In connection with proceedings in court, however, the
    rule is to be interpreted broadly; any use of discovery materials
    in court in connection with a motion, a pretrial conference under
    Rule 16, or otherwise, should be interpreted as use in the
    proceeding.
      Once discovery or disclosure materials are used in the
    proceeding, the filing requirements of Rule 5(d) should apply to
    them. But because the filing requirement applies only with regard
    to materials that are used, only those parts of voluminous
    materials that are actually used need be filed. Any party would be
    free to file other pertinent portions of materials that are so
    used. See Fed. R. Evid. 106; cf. Rule 32(a)(4). If the parties are
    unduly sparing in their submissions, the court may order further
    filings. By local rule, a court could provide appropriate direction
    regarding the filing of discovery materials, such as depositions,
    that are used in proceedings.
      "Shall" is replaced by "must" under the program to conform
    amended rules to current style conventions when there is no
    ambiguity.
      GAP Report. The Advisory Committee recommends no changes to
    either the amendments to Rule 5(d) or the Committee Note as
    published.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2001 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 5(b) is restyled.
      Rule 5(b)(1) makes it clear that the provision for service on a
    party's attorney applies only to service made under Rules 5(a) and
    77(d). Service under Rules 4, 4.1, 45(b), and 71A(d)(3) - as well
    as rules that invoke those rules - must be made as provided in
    those rules.
      Subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of Rule 5(b)(2) carry forward the
    method-of-service provisions of former Rule 5(b).
      Subparagraph (D) of Rule 5(b)(2) is new. It authorizes service by
    electronic means or any other means, but only if consent is
    obtained from the person served. The consent must be express, and
    cannot be implied from conduct. Early experience with electronic
    filing as authorized by Rule 5(d) is positive, supporting service
    by electronic means as well. Consent is required, however, because
    it is not yet possible to assume universal entry into the world of
    electronic communication. Subparagraph (D) also authorizes service
    by nonelectronic means. The Rule 5(b)(2)(B) provision making mail
    service complete on mailing is extended in subparagraph (D) to make
    service by electronic means complete on transmission; transmission
    is effected when the sender does the last act that must be
    performed by the sender. Service by other agencies is complete on
    delivery to the designated agency.
      Finally, subparagraph (D) authorizes adoption of local rules
    providing for service through the court. Electronic case filing
    systems will come to include the capacity to make service by using
    the court's facilities to transmit all documents filed in the case.
    It may prove most efficient to establish an environment in which a
    party can file with the court, making use of the court's
    transmission facilities to serve the filed paper on all other
    parties. Transmission might be by such means as direct transmission
    of the paper, or by transmission of a notice of filing that
    includes an electronic link for direct access to the paper. Because
    service is under subparagraph (D), consent must be obtained from
    the persons served.
      Consent to service under Rule 5(b)(2)(D) must be in writing,
    which can be provided by electronic means. Parties are encouraged
    to specify the scope and duration of the consent. The specification
    should include at least the persons to whom service should be made,
    the appropriate address or location for such service - such as the
    e-mail address or facsimile machine number, and the format to be
    used for attachments. A district court may establish a registry or
    other facility that allows advance consent to service by specified
    means for future actions.
      Rule 6(e) is amended to allow additional time to respond when
    service is made under Rule 5(b)(2)(D). The additional time does not
    relieve a party who consents to service under Rule 5(b)(2)(D) of
    the responsibilities to monitor the facility designated for
    receiving service and to provide prompt notice of any address
    change.
      Paragraph (3) addresses a question that may arise from a literal
    reading of the provision that service by electronic means is
    complete on transmission. Electronic communication is rapidly
    improving, but lawyers report continuing failures of transmission,
    particularly with respect to attachments. Ordinarily the risk of
    non-receipt falls on the person being served, who has consented to
    this form of service. But the risk should not extend to situations
    in which the person attempting service learns that the attempted
    service in fact did not reach the person to be served. Given actual
    knowledge that the attempt failed, service is not effected. The
    person attempting service must either try again or show
    circumstances that justify dispensing with service.
      Paragraph (3) does not address the similar questions that may
    arise when a person attempting service learns that service by means
    other than electronic means in fact did not reach the person to be
    served. Case law provides few illustrations of circumstances in
    which a person attempting service actually knows that the attempt
    failed but seeks to act as if service had been made. This negative
    history suggests there is no need to address these problems in Rule
    5(b)(3). This silence does not imply any view on these issues, nor
    on the circumstances that justify various forms of judicial action
    even though service has not been made.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments Rule 5(b)(2)(D) was
    changed to require that consent be "in writing."
      Rule 5(b)(3) is new. The published proposal did not address the
    question of failed service in the text of the rule. Instead, the
    Committee Note included this statement: "As with other modes of
    service, however, actual notice that the transmission was not
    received defeats the presumption of receipt that arises from the
    provision that service is complete on transmission. The sender must
    take additional steps to effect service. Service by other agencies
    is complete on delivery to the designated agency." The addition of
    paragraph (3) was prompted by consideration of the draft Appellate
    Rule 25(c) that was prepared for the meeting of the Appellate Rules
    Advisory Committee. This draft provided: "Service by electronic
    means is complete on transmission, unless the party making service
    is notified that the paper was not received." Although Appellate
    Rule 25(c) is being prepared for publication and comment, while
    Civil Rule 5(b) has been published and otherwise is ready to
    recommend for adoption, it seemed desirable to achieve some
    parallel between the two rules.
      The draft Rule 5(b)(3) submitted for consideration by the
    Advisory Committee covered all means of service except for leaving
    a copy with the clerk of the court when the person to be served has
    no known address. It was not limited to electronic service for fear
    that a provision limited to electronic service might generate
    unintended negative implications as to service by other means,
    particularly mail. This concern was strengthened by a small number
    of opinions that say that service by mail is effective, because
    complete on mailing, even when the person making service has prompt
    actual notice that the mail was not delivered. The Advisory
    Committee voted to limit Rule 5(b)(3) to service by electronic
    means because this means of service is relatively new, and seems
    likely to miscarry more frequently than service by post. It was
    suggested during the Advisory Committee meeting that the question
    of negative implication could be addressed in the Committee Note.
    There was little discussion of this possibility. The Committee Note
    submitted above includes a "no negative implications" paragraph
    prepared by the Reporter for consideration by the Standing
    Committee.
      The Advisory Committee did not consider at all a question that
    was framed during the later meeting of the Appellate Rules Advisory
    Committee. As approved by the Advisory Committee, Rule 5(b)(3)
    defeats service by electronic means "if the party making service
    learns that the attempted service did not reach the person to be
    served." It says nothing about the time relevant to learning of the
    failure. The omission may seem glaring. Curing the omission,
    however, requires selection of a time. As revised, proposed
    Appellate Rule 25(c) requires that the party making service learn
    of the failure within three calendar days. The Appellate Rules
    Advisory Committee will have the luxury of public comment and
    another year to consider the desirability of this short period. If
    Civil Rule 5(b) is to be recommended for adoption now, no such
    luxury is available. This issue deserves careful consideration by
    the Standing Committee.
      Several changes are made in the Committee Note. (1) It requires
    that consent "be express, and cannot be implied from conduct." This
    addition reflects a more general concern stimulated by a reported
    ruling that an e-mail address on a firm's letterhead implied
    consent to email service. (2) The paragraph discussing service
    through the court's facilities is expanded by describing
    alternative methods, including an "electronic link." (3) There is a
    new paragraph that states that the requirement of written consent
    can be satisfied by electronic means, and that suggests matters
    that should be addressed by the consent. (4) A paragraph is added
    to note the additional response time provided by amended Rule 6(e).
    (5) The final two paragraphs address newly added Rule 5(b)(3). The
    first explains the rule that electronic service is not effective if
    the person making service learns that it did not reach the person
    to be served. The second paragraph seeks to defeat any negative
    implications that might arise from limiting Rule 5(b)(3) to
    electronic service, not mail, not other means consented to such as
    commercial express service, and not service on another person on
    behalf of the person to be served.

                                 RULE 6(E)                             
      The Advisory Committee recommended that no change be made in
    Civil Rule 6(e) to reflect the provisions of Civil Rule 5(b)(2)(D)
    that, with the consent of the person to be served, would allow
    service by electronic or other means. Absent change, service by
    these means would not affect the time for acting in response to the
    paper served. Comment was requested, however, on the alternative
    that would allow an additional 3 days to respond. The alternative
    Rule 6(e) amendments are cast in a form that permits ready
    incorporation in the Bankruptcy Rules. Several of the comments
    suggest that the added three days should be provided. Electronic
    transmission is not always instantaneous, and may fail for any of a
    number of reasons. It may take three days to arrange for
    transmission in readable form. Providing added time to respond will
    not discourage people from asking for consent to electronic
    transmission, and may encourage people to give consent. The more
    who consent, the quicker will come the improvements that will make
    electronic service ever more attractive. Consistency with the
    Bankruptcy Rules will be a good thing, and the Bankruptcy Rules
    Advisory Committee believes the additional three days should be
    allowed.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      Amended Rule 5(e) acknowledges that many courts have required
    electronic filing by means of a standing order, procedures manual,
    or local rule. These local practices reflect the advantages that
    courts and most litigants realize from electronic filing. Courts
    that mandate electronic filing recognize the need to make
    exceptions when requiring electronic filing imposes a hardship on a
    party. Under amended Rule 5(e), a local rule that requires
    electronic filing must include reasonable exceptions, but Rule 5(e)
    does not define the scope of those exceptions. Experience with the
    local rules that have been adopted and that will emerge will aid in
    drafting new local rules and will facilitate gradual convergence on
    uniform exceptions, whether in local rules or in an amended Rule
    5(e).
      Changes Made after Publication and Comment. This recommendation
    is of a modified version of the proposal as published. The changes
    from the published version limit local rule authority to implement
    a caution stated in the published Committee Note. A local rule that
    requires electronic filing must include reasonable exceptions. This
    change was accomplished by a separate sentence stating that a
    "local rule may require filing by electronic means only if
    reasonable exceptions are allowed." Corresponding changes were made
    in the Committee Note, in collaboration with the Appellate Rules
    Committee. The changes from the published proposal are shown below.
    [Omitted]

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 5 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Rule 5(a)(1)(E) omits the former reference to a designation of
    record on appeal. Appellate Rule 10 is a self-contained provision
    for the record on appeal, and provides for service.
      Former Rule 5(b)(2)(D) literally provided that a local rule may
    authorize use of the court's transmission facilities to make
    service by non-electronic means agreed to by the parties. That was
    not intended. Rule 5(b)(3) restores the intended meaning - court
    transmission facilities can be used only for service by electronic
    means.
      Rule 5(d)(2)(B) provides that "a" judge may accept a paper for
    filing, replacing the reference in former Rule 5(e) to "the" judge.
    Some courts do not assign a designated judge to each case, and it
    may be important to have another judge accept a paper for filing
    even when a case is on the individual docket of a particular judge.
    The ministerial acts of accepting the paper, noting the time, and
    transmitting the paper to the court clerk do not interfere with the
    assigned judge's authority over the action.

    Rule 5.1. Constitutional Challenge to a Statute - Notice,
      Certification, and Intervention

-STATUTE-
      (a) Notice by a Party. A party that files a pleading, written
    motion, or other paper drawing into question the constitutionality
    of a federal or state statute must promptly:
        (1) file a notice of constitutional question stating the
      question and identifying the paper that raises it, if:
          (A) a federal statute is questioned and the parties do not
        include the United States, one of its agencies, or one of its
        officers or employees in an official capacity; or
          (B) a state statute is questioned and the parties do not
        include the state, one of its agencies, or one of its officers
        or employees in an official capacity; and

        (2) serve the notice and paper on the Attorney General of the
      United States if a federal statute is questioned - or on the
      state attorney general if a state statute is questioned - either
      by certified or registered mail or by sending it to an electronic
      address designated by the attorney general for this purpose.

      (b) Certification by the Court. The court must, under 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 2403, certify to the appropriate attorney general that a
    statute has been questioned.
      (c) Intervention; Final Decision on the Merits. Unless the court
    sets a later time, the attorney general may intervene within 60
    days after the notice is filed or after the court certifies the
    challenge, whichever is earlier. Before the time to intervene
    expires, the court may reject the constitutional challenge, but may
    not enter a final judgment holding the statute unconstitutional.
      (d) No Forfeiture. A party's failure to file and serve the
    notice, or the court's failure to certify, does not forfeit a
    constitutional claim or defense that is otherwise timely asserted.

-MISC1-
                      COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006                  
      Rule 5.1 implements 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2403, replacing the final
    three sentences of Rule 24(c). New Rule 5.1 requires a party that
    files a pleading, written motion, or other paper drawing in
    question the constitutionality of a federal or state statute to
    file a notice of constitutional question and serve it on the United
    States Attorney General or state attorney general. The party must
    promptly file and serve the notice of constitutional question. This
    notice requirement supplements the court's duty to certify a
    constitutional challenge to the United States Attorney General or
    state attorney general. The notice of constitutional question will
    ensure that the attorney general is notified of constitutional
    challenges and has an opportunity to exercise the statutory right
    to intervene at the earliest possible point in the litigation. The
    court's certification obligation remains, and is the only notice
    when the constitutionality of a federal or state statute is drawn
    in question by means other than a party's pleading, written motion,
    or other paper.
      Moving the notice and certification provisions from Rule 24(c) to
    a new rule is designed to attract the parties' attention to these
    provisions by locating them in the vicinity of the rules that
    require notice by service and pleading.
      Rule 5.1 goes beyond the requirements of Sec. 2403 and the former
    Rule 24(c) provisions by requiring notice and certification of a
    constitutional challenge to any federal or state statute, not only
    those "affecting the public interest." It is better to assure,
    through notice, that the attorney general is able to determine
    whether to seek intervention on the ground that the act or statute
    affects a public interest. Rule 5.1 refers to a "federal statute,"
    rather than the Sec. 2403 reference to an "Act of Congress," to
    maintain consistency in the Civil Rules vocabulary. In Rule 5.1
    "statute" means any congressional enactment that would qualify as
    an "Act of Congress."
      Unless the court sets a later time, the 60-day period for
    intervention runs from the time a party files a notice of
    constitutional question or from the time the court certifies a
    constitutional challenge, whichever is earlier. Rule 5.1(a) directs
    that a party promptly serve the notice of constitutional question.
    The court may extend the 60-[day] period on its own or on motion.
    One occasion for extension may arise if the court certifies a
    challenge under Sec. 2403 after a party files a notice of
    constitutional question. Pretrial activities may continue without
    interruption during the intervention period, and the court retains
    authority to grant interlocutory relief. The court may reject a
    constitutional challenge to a statute at any time. But the court
    may not enter a final judgment holding a statute unconstitutional
    before the attorney general has responded or the intervention
    period has expired without response. This rule does not displace
    any of the statutory or rule procedures that permit dismissal of
    all or part of an action - including a constitutional challenge -
    at any time, even before service of process.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Rule 5.1 as proposed
    for adoption incorporates several changes from the published draft.
    The changes were made in response to public comments and Advisory
    Committee discussion.
      The Advisory Committee debated at length the question whether the
    party who files a notice of constitutional question should be
    required to serve the notice on the appropriate attorney general.
    The service requirement was retained, but the time for intervention
    was set to run from the earlier of the notice filing or the court's
    certification. The definition of the time to intervene was changed
    in tandem with this change. The published rule directed the court
    to set an intervention time not less than 60 days from the court's
    certification. This was changed to set a 60-day period in the rule
    "[u]nless the court sets a later time." The Committee Note points
    out that the court may extend the 60-day period on its own or on
    motion, and recognizes that an occasion for extension may arise if
    the 60-day period begins with the filing of the notice of
    constitutional question.
      The method of serving the notice of constitutional question set
    by the published rule called for serving the United States Attorney
    General under Civil Rule 4, and for serving a state attorney
    general by certified or registered mail. This proposal has been
    changed to provide service in all cases either by certified or
    registered mail or by sending the Notice to an electronic address
    designated by the attorney general for this purpose.
      The rule proposed for adoption brings into subdivision (c)
    matters that were stated in the published Committee Note but not in
    the rule text. The court may reject a constitutional challenge at
    any time, but may not enter a final judgment holding a statute
    unconstitutional before the time set to intervene expires.
      The published rule would have required notice and certification
    when an officer of the United States or a state brings suit in an
    official capacity. There is no need for notice in such
    circumstances. The words "is sued" were deleted to correct this
    oversight.
      Several style changes were made at the Style Subcommittee's
    suggestion. One change that straddles the line between substance
    and style appears in Rule 5.1(d). The published version adopted the
    language of present Rule 24(c): failure to comply with the Notice
    or certification requirements does not forfeit a constitutional
    "right." This expression is changed to "claim or defense" from
    concern that reference to a "right" may invite confusion of the no-
    forfeiture provision with the merits of the claim or defense that
    is not forfeited.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 5.1 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

-HEAD-
    Rule 5.2. Privacy Protection For Filings Made with the Court

-STATUTE-
      (a) Redacted Filings. Unless the court orders otherwise, in an
    electronic or paper filing with the court that contains an
    individual's social-security number, taxpayer-identification
    number, or birth date, the name of an individual known to be a
    minor, or a financial-account number, a party or nonparty making
    the filing may include only:
        (1) the last four digits of the social-security number and
      taxpayer-identification number;
        (2) the year of the individual's birth;
        (3) the minor's initials; and
        (4) the last four digits of the financial-account number.

      (b) Exemptions from the Redaction Requirement. The redaction
    requirement does not apply to the following:
        (1) a financial-account number that identifies the property
      allegedly subject to forfeiture in a forfeiture proceeding;
        (2) the record of an administrative or agency proceeding;
        (3) the official record of a state-court proceeding;
        (4) the record of a court or tribunal, if that record was not
      subject to the redaction requirement when originally filed;
        (5) a filing covered by Rule 5.2(c) or (d); and
        (6) a pro se filing in an action brought under 28 U.S.C. Secs.
      2241, 2254, or 2255.

      (c) Limitations on Remote Access to Electronic Files; Social-
    Security Appeals and Immigration Cases. Unless the court orders
    otherwise, in an action for benefits under the Social Security Act,
    and in an action or proceeding relating to an order of removal, to
    relief from removal, or to immigration benefits or detention,
    access to an electronic file is authorized as follows:
        (1) the parties and their attorneys may have remote electronic
      access to any part of the case file, including the administrative
      record;
        (2) any other person may have electronic access to the full
      record at the courthouse, but may have remote electronic access
      only to:
          (A) the docket maintained by the court; and
          (B) an opinion, order, judgment, or other disposition of the
        court, but not any other part of the case file or the
        administrative record.

      (d) Filings Made Under Seal. The court may order that a filing be
    made under seal without redaction. The court may later unseal the
    filing or order the person who made the filing to file a redacted
    version for the public record.
      (e) Protective Orders. For good cause, the court may by order in
    a case:
        (1) require redaction of additional information; or
        (2) limit or prohibit a nonparty's remote electronic access to
      a document filed with the court.

      (f) Option for Additional Unredacted Filing Under Seal. A person
    making a redacted filing may also file an unredacted copy under
    seal. The court must retain the unredacted copy as part of the
    record.
      (g) Option for Filing a Reference List. A filing that contains
    redacted information may be filed together with a reference list
    that identifies each item of redacted information and specifies an
    appropriate identifier that uniquely corresponds to each item
    listed. The list must be filed under seal and may be amended as of
    right. Any reference in the case to a listed identifier will be
    construed to refer to the corresponding item of information.
      (h) Waiver of Protection of Identifiers. A person waives the
    protection of Rule 5.2(a) as to the person's own information by
    filing it without redaction and not under seal.

-MISC1-
                      COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007                  
      The rule is adopted in compliance with section 205(c)(3) of the E-
    Government Act of 2002, Public Law 107-347. Section 205(c)(3)
    requires the Supreme Court to prescribe rules "to protect privacy
    and security concerns relating to electronic filing of documents
    and the public availability . . . of documents filed
    electronically." The rule goes further than the E-Government Act in
    regulating paper filings even when they are not converted to
    electronic form. But the number of filings that remain in paper
    form is certain to diminish over time. Most districts scan paper
    filings into the electronic case file, where they become available
    to the public in the same way as documents initially filed in
    electronic form. It is electronic availability, not the form of the
    initial filing, that raises the privacy and security concerns
    addressed in the E-Government Act.
      The rule is derived from and implements the policy adopted by the
    Judicial Conference in September 2001 to address the privacy
    concerns resulting from public access to electronic case files. See
    http://www.privacy.uscourts.gov/Policy.htm. The Judicial Conference
    policy is that documents in case files generally should be made
    available electronically to the same extent they are available at
    the courthouse, provided that certain "personal data identifiers"
    are not included in the public file.
      While providing for the public filing of some information, such
    as the last four digits of an account number, the rule does not
    intend to establish a presumption that this information never could
    or should be protected. For example, it may well be necessary in
    individual cases to prevent remote access by nonparties to any part
    of an account number or social security number. It may also be
    necessary to protect information not covered by the redaction
    requirement - such as driver's license numbers and alien
    registration numbers - in a particular case. In such cases,
    protection may be sought under subdivision (d) or (e). Moreover,
    the Rule does not affect the protection available under other
    rules, such as Civil Rules 16 and 26(c), or under other sources of
    protective authority.
      Parties must remember that any personal information not otherwise
    protected by sealing or redaction will be made available over the
    internet. Counsel should notify clients of this fact so that an
    informed decision may be made on what information is to be included
    in a document filed with the court.
      The clerk is not required to review documents filed with the
    court for compliance with this rule. The responsibility to redact
    filings rests with counsel and the party or nonparty making the
    filing.
      Subdivision (c) provides for limited public access in Social
    Security cases and immigration cases. Those actions are entitled to
    special treatment due to the prevalence of sensitive information
    and the volume of filings. Remote electronic access by nonparties
    is limited to the docket and the written dispositions of the court
    unless the court orders otherwise. The rule contemplates, however,
    that nonparties can obtain full access to the case file at the
    courthouse, including access through the court's public computer
    terminal.
      Subdivision (d) reflects the interplay between redaction and
    filing under seal. It does not limit or expand the judicially
    developed rules that govern sealing. But it does reflect the
    possibility that redaction may provide an alternative to sealing.
      Subdivision (e) provides that the court can by order in a
    particular case for good cause require more extensive redaction
    than otherwise required by the Rule. Nothing in this subdivision is
    intended to affect the limitations on sealing that are otherwise
    applicable to the court.
      Subdivision (f) allows a person who makes a redacted filing to
    file an unredacted document under seal. This provision is derived
    from section 205(c)(3)(iv) of the E-Government Act.
      Subdivision (g) allows the option to file a register of redacted
    information. This provision is derived from section 205(c)(3)(v) of
    the E-Government Act, as amended in 2004. In accordance with the E-
    Government Act, subdivision (g) refers to "redacted" information.
    The term "redacted" is intended to govern a filing that is prepared
    with abbreviated identifiers in the first instance, as well as a
    filing in which a personal identifier is edited after its
    preparation.
      Subdivision (h) allows a person to waive the protections of the
    rule as to that person's own personal information by filing it
    unsealed and in unredacted form. One may wish to waive the
    protection if it is determined that the costs of redaction outweigh
    the benefits to privacy. If a person files an unredacted identifier
    by mistake, that person may seek relief from the court.
      Trial exhibits are subject to the redaction requirements of Rule
    5.2 to the extent they are filed with the court. Trial exhibits
    that are not initially filed with the court must be redacted in
    accordance with the rule if and when they are filed as part of an
    appeal or for other reasons.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. The changes made
    after publication were made in conjunction with the E-Government
    Act Subcommittee and the other Advisory Committees.
      Subdivision (a) was amended to incorporate a suggestion from the
    Federal Magistrate Judges Association that the rule text state that
    the responsibility to redact filings rests on the filer, not the
    court clerk.
      As published, subdivision (b)(6) exempted from redaction all
    filings in habeas corpus proceedings under 28 U.S.C. Secs. 2241,
    2254, or 2255. The exemption is revised to apply only to pro se
    filings. A petitioner represented by counsel, and respondents
    represented by counsel, must redact under Rule 5.2(a).
      Subdivision (e) was published with a standard for protective
    orders, referring to a need to protect private or sensitive
    information not otherwise protected by Rule 5.2(a). This standard
    has been replaced by a general reference to "good cause."

    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE II. COMMENCING AN ACTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS, PLEADINGS,
      MOTIONS, AND ORDERS                                     

-HEAD-
    Rule 6. Computing and Extending Time; Time for Motion Papers

-STATUTE-
      (a) Computing Time. The following rules apply in computing any
    time period specified in these rules, in any local rule or court
    order, or in any statute that does not specify a method of
    computing time.
        (1) Period Stated in Days or a Longer Unit. When the period is
      stated in days or a longer unit of time:
          (A) exclude the day of the event that triggers the period;
          (B) count every day, including intermediate Saturdays,
        Sundays, and legal holidays; and
          (C) include the last day of the period, but if the last day
        is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues
        to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday,
        Sunday, or legal holiday.

        (2) Period Stated in Hours. When the period is stated in hours:
          (A) begin counting immediately on the occurrence of the event
        that triggers the period;
          (B) count every hour, including hours during intermediate
        Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and
          (C) if the period would end on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal
        holiday, the period continues to run until the same time on the
        next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.

        (3) Inaccessibility of the Clerk's Office. Unless the court
      orders otherwise, if the clerk's office is inaccessible:
          (A) on the last day for filing under Rule 6(a)(1), then the
        time for filing is extended to the first accessible day that is
        not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday; or
          (B) during the last hour for filing under Rule 6(a)(2), then
        the time for filing is extended to the same time on the first
        accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal
        holiday.

        (4) "Last Day" Defined. Unless a different time is set by a
      statute, local rule, or court order, the last day ends:
          (A) for electronic filing, at midnight in the court's time
        zone; and
          (B) for filing by other means, when the clerk's office is
        scheduled to close.

        (5) "Next Day" Defined. The "next day" is determined by
      continuing to count forward when the period is measured after an
      event and backward when measured before an event.
        (6) "Legal Holiday" Defined. "Legal holiday" means:
          (A) the day set aside by statute for observing New Year's
        Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday,
        Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day,
        Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, or Christmas Day;
          (B) any day declared a holiday by the President or Congress;
        and
          (C) for periods that are measured after an event, any other
        day declared a holiday by the state where the district court is
        located.

      (b) Extending Time.
        (1) In General. When an act may or must be done within a
      specified time, the court may, for good cause, extend the time:
          (A) with or without motion or notice if the court acts, or if
        a request is made, before the original time or its extension
        expires; or
          (B) on motion made after the time has expired if the party
        failed to act because of excusable neglect.

        (2) Exceptions. A court must not extend the time to act under
      Rules 50(b) and (d), 52(b), 59(b), (d), and (e), and 60(b).

      (c) Motions, Notices of Hearing, and Affidavits.
        (1) In General. A written motion and notice of the hearing must
      be served at least 14 days before the time specified for the
      hearing, with the following exceptions:
          (A) when the motion may be heard ex parte;
          (B) when these rules set a different time; or
          (C) when a court order - which a party may, for good cause,
        apply for ex parte - sets a different time.

        (2) Supporting Affidavit. Any affidavit supporting a motion
      must be served with the motion. Except as Rule 59(c) provides
      otherwise, any opposing affidavit must be served at least 7 days
      before the hearing, unless the court permits service at another
      time.

      (d) Additional Time After Certain Kinds of Service. When a party
    may or must act within a specified time after service and service
    is made under Rule 5(b)(2)(C), (D), (E), or (F), 3 days are added
    after the period would otherwise expire under Rule 6(a).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b). The purpose of the amendment is to clarify the
    finality of judgments. Prior to the advent of the Federal Rules of
    Civil Procedure, the general rule that a court loses jurisdiction
    to disturb its judgments, upon the expiration of the term at which
    they were entered, had long been the classic device which (together
    with the statutory limits on the time for appeal) gave finality to
    judgments. See Note to Rule 73(a). Rule 6(c) abrogates that limit
    on judicial power. That limit was open to many objections, one of
    them being inequality of operation because, under it, the time for
    vacating a judgment rendered early in a term was much longer than
    for a judgment rendered near the end of the term.
      The question to be met under Rule 6(b) is: how far should the
    desire to allow correction of judgments be allowed to postpone
    their finality? The rules contain a number of provisions permitting
    the vacation or modification of judgments on various grounds. Each
    of these rules contains express time limits on the motions for
    granting of relief. Rule 6(b) is a rule of general application
    giving wide discretion to the court to enlarge these time limits or
    revive them after they have expired, the only exceptions stated in
    the original rule being a prohibition against enlarging the time
    specified in Rule 59(b) and (d) for making motions for or granting
    new trials, and a prohibition against enlarging the time fixed by
    law for taking an appeal. It should also be noted that Rule 6(b)
    itself contains no limitation of time within which the court may
    exercise its discretion, and since the expiration of the term does
    not end its power, there is now no time limit on the exercise of
    its discretion under Rule 6(b).
      Decisions of lower federal courts suggest that some of the rules
    containing time limits which may be set aside under Rule 6(b) are
    Rules 25, 50(b), 52(b), 60(b), and 73(g).
      In a number of cases the effect of Rule 6(b) on the time
    limitations of these rules has been considered. Certainly the rule
    is susceptible of the interpretation that the court is given the
    power in its discretion to relieve a party from failure to act
    within the times specified in any of these other rules, with only
    the exceptions stated in Rule 6(b), and in some cases the rule has
    been so construed.
      With regard to Rule 25(a) for substitution, it was held in
    Anderson v. Brady (E.D.Ky. 1941) 4 Fed.Rules Service 25a.1, Case 1,
    and in Anderson v. Yungkau (C.C.A. 6th, 1946) 153 F.(2d) 685, cert.
    granted (1946) 66 S.Ct. 1025, that under Rule 6(b) the court had no
    authority to allow substitution of parties after the expiration of
    the limit fixed in Rule 25(a).
      As to Rules 50(b) for judgments notwithstanding the verdict and
    52(b) for amendment of findings and vacation of judgment, it was
    recognized in Leishman v. Associated Wholesale Electric Co. (1943)
    318 U.S. 203, that Rule 6(b) allowed the district court to enlarge
    the time to make a motion for amended findings and judgment beyond
    the limit expressly fixed in Rule 52(b). See Coca-Cola v. Busch
    (E.D.Pa. 1943) 7 Fed.Rules Service 59b.2, Case 4. Obviously, if the
    time limit in Rule 52(b) could be set aside under Rule 6(b), the
    time limit in Rule 50(b) for granting judgment notwithstanding the
    verdict (and thus vacating the judgment entered "forthwith" on the
    verdict) likewise could be set aside.
      As to Rule 59 on motions for a new trial, it has been settled
    that the time limits in Rule 59(b) and (d) for making motions for
    or granting new trial could not be set aside under Rule 6(b),
    because Rule 6(b) expressly refers to Rule 59, and forbids it. See
    Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Coe (App.D.C. 1943) 136 F.(2d) 771; Jusino
    v. Morales & Tio (C.C.A. 1st, 1944) 139 F.(2d) 946; Coca-Cola Co.
    v. Busch (E.D.Pa. 1943) 7 Fed.Rules Service 59b.2, Case 4; Peterson
    v. Chicago Great Western Ry. Co. (D.Neb. 1943) 7 Fed.Rules Service
    59b.2, Case 1; Leishman v. Associated Wholesale Electric Co. (1943)
    318 U.S. 203.
      As to Rule 60(b) for relief from a judgment, it was held in
    Schram v. O'Connor (E.D.Mich. 1941) 5 Fed.Rules Serv. 6b.31, Case
    1, 2 F.R.D. 192, s. c. 5 Fed.Rules Serv. 6b.31, Case 2, F.R.D. 192,
    that the six-months time limit in original Rule 60(b) for making a
    motion for relief from a judgment for surprise, mistake, or
    excusable neglect could be set aside under Rule 6(b). The contrary
    result was reached in Wallace v. United States (C.C.A.2d, 1944) 142
    F.(2d) 240, cert. den. (1944) 323 U.S. 712; Reed v. South Atlantic
    Steamship Co. of Del. (D.Del. 1942) 6 Fed.Rules Serv. 60b.31, Case
    1.
      As to Rule 73(g), fixing the time for docketing an appeal, it was
    held in Ainsworth v. Gill Glass & Fixture Co. (C.C.A.3d, 1939) 104
    F.(2d) 83, that under Rule 6(b) the district court, upon motion
    made after the expiration of the forty-day period, stated in Rule
    73(g), but before the expiration of the ninety-day period therein
    specified, could permit the docketing of the appeal on a showing of
    excusable neglect. The contrary was held in Mutual Benefit Health &
    Accident Ass'n v. Snyder (C.C.A. 6th, 1940) 109 F.(2d) 469 and in
    Burke v. Canfield (App.D.C. 1940) 111 F.(2d) 526.
      The amendment of Rule 6(b) now proposed is based on the view that
    there should be a definite point where it can be said a judgment is
    final; that the right method of dealing with the problem is to list
    in Rule 6(b) the various other rules whose time limits may not be
    set aside, and then, if the time limit in any of those other rules
    is too short, to amend that other rule to give a longer time. The
    further argument is that Rule 6(c) abolished the long standing
    device to produce finality in judgments through expiration of the
    term, and since that limitation on the jurisdiction of courts to
    set aside their own judgments has been removed by Rule 6(c), some
    other limitation must be substituted or judgments never can be said
    to be final.
      In this connection reference is made to the established rule that
    if a motion for new trial is seasonably made, the mere making or
    pendency of the motion destroys the finality of the judgment, and
    even though the motion is ultimately denied, the full time for
    appeal starts anew from the date of denial. Also, a motion to amend
    the findings under Rule 52(b) has the same effect on the time for
    appeal. Leishman v. Associated Wholesale Electric Co. (1943) 318
    U.S. 203. By the same reasoning a motion for judgment under Rule
    50(b), involving as it does the vacation of a judgment entered
    "forthwith" on the verdict (Rule 58), operates to postpone, until
    an order is made, the running of the time for appeal. The Committee
    believes that the abolition by Rule 6(c) of the old rule that a
    court's power over its judgments ends with the term, requires a
    substitute limitation, and that unless Rule 6(b) is amended to
    prevent enlargement of the times specified in Rules 50(b), 52(b)
    and 60(b), and the limitation as to Rule 59(b) and (d) is retained,
    no one can say when a judgment is final. This is also true with
    regard to proposed Rule 59(e), which authorizes a motion to alter
    or amend a judgment, hence that rule is also included in the
    enumeration in amended Rule 6(b). In consideration of the
    amendment, however, it should be noted that Rule 60(b) is also to
    be amended so as to lengthen the six-months period originally
    prescribed in that rule to one year.
      As to Rule 25 on substitution, while finality is not involved,
    the limit there fixed should be controlling. That rule, as amended,
    gives the court power, upon showing of a reasonable excuse, to
    permit substitution after the expiration of the two-year period.
      As to Rule 73(g), it is believed that the conflict in decisions
    should be resolved and not left to further litigation, and that the
    rule should be listed as one whose limitation may not be set aside
    under Rule 6(b).
      As to Rule 59(c), fixing the time for serving affidavits on
    motion for new trial, it is believed that the court should have
    authority under Rule 6(b) to enlarge the time, because, once the
    motion for new trial is made, the judgment no longer has finality,
    and the extension of time for affidavits thus does not of itself
    disturb finality.
      Other changes proposed in Rule 6(b) are merely clarifying and
    conforming. Thus "request" is substituted for "application" in
    clause (1) because an application is defined as a motion under Rule
    7(b). The phrase "extend the time" is substituted for "enlarge the
    period" because the former is a more suitable expression and
    relates more clearly to both clauses (1) and (2). The final phrase
    in Rule 6(b), "or the period for taking an appeal as provided by
    law", is deleted and a reference to Rule 73(a) inserted, since it
    is proposed to state in that rule the time for appeal to a circuit
    court of appeals, which is the only appeal governed by the Federal
    Rules, and allows an extension of time. See Rule 72.
      Subdivision (c). The purpose of this amendment is to prevent
    reliance upon the continued existence of a term as a source of
    power to disturb the finality of a judgment upon grounds other than
    those stated in these rules. See Hill v. Hawes (1944) 320 U.S. 520;
    Boaz v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York (C.C.A. 8th, 1944) 146
    F.(2d) 321; Bucy v. Nevada Construction Co. (C.C.A. 9th, 1942) 125
    F.(2d) 213.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). This amendment is related to the amendment of
    Rule 77(c) changing the regulation of the days on which the clerk's
    office shall be open.
      The wording of the first sentence of Rule 6(a) is clarified and
    the subdivision is made expressly applicable to computing periods
    of time set forth in local rules.
      Saturday is to be treated in the same way as Sunday or a "legal
    holiday" in that it is not to be included when it falls on the last
    day of a computed period, nor counted as an intermediate day when
    the period is less than 7 days. "Legal holiday" is defined for
    purposes of this subdivision and amended Rule 77(c). Compare the
    definition of "holiday" in 11 U.S.C. Sec. 1(18); also 5 U.S.C. Sec.
    86a; Executive Order No. 10358, "Observance of Holidays," June 9,
    1952, 17 Fed.Reg. 5269. In the light of these changes the last
    sentence of the present subdivision, dealing with half holidays, is
    eliminated.
      With Saturdays and State holidays made "dies non" in certain
    cases by the amended subdivision, computation of the usual 5-day
    notice of motion or the 2-day notice to dissolve or modify a
    temporary restraining order may work out so as to cause
    embarrassing delay in urgent cases. The delay can be obviated by
    applying to the court to shorten the time, see Rules 6(d) and
    65(b).
      Subdivision (b). The prohibition against extending the time for
    taking action under Rule 25 (Substitution of parties) is
    eliminated. The only limitation of time provided for in amended
    Rule 25 is the 90-day period following a suggestion upon the record
    of the death of a party within which to make a motion to substitute
    the proper parties for the deceased party. See Rule 25(a)(1), as
    amended, and the Advisory Committee's Note thereto. It is intended
    that the court shall have discretion to enlarge that period.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1968 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment eliminates the references to Rule 73, which is to
    be abrogated.
      P. L. 88-139, Sec. 1, 77 Stat. 248, approved on October 16, 1963,
    amended 28 U.S.C. Sec. 138 to read as follows: "The district court
    shall not hold formal terms." Thus Rule 6(c) is rendered
    unnecessary, and it is rescinded.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1971 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment adds Columbus Day to the list of legal holidays to
    conform the subdivision to the Act of June 28, 1968, 82 Stat. 250,
    which constituted Columbus Day a legal holiday effective after
    January 1, 1971.
      The Act, which amended Title 5, U.S.C., Sec. 6103(a), changes the
    day on which certain holidays are to be observed. Washington's
    Birthday, Memorial Day and Veterans Day are to be observed on the
    third Monday in February, the last Monday in May and the fourth
    Monday in October, respectively, rather than, as heretofore, on
    February 22, May 30, and November 11, respectively. Columbus Day is
    to be observed on the second Monday in October. New Year's Day,
    Independence Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas continue to be
    observed on the traditional days.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b). The amendment confers finality upon the
    judgments of magistrates by foreclosing enlargement of the time for
    appeal except as provided in new Rule 74(a) (20 day period for
    demonstration of excusable neglect).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1985 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 6(a) is amended to acknowledge that weather conditions or
    other events may render the clerk's office inaccessible one or more
    days. Parties who are obliged to file something with the court
    during that period should not be penalized if they cannot do so.
    The amendment conforms to changes made in Federal Rule of Criminal
    Procedure 45(a), effective August 1, 1982.
      The Rule also is amended to extend the exclusion of intermediate
    Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays to the computation of time
    periods less than 11 days. Under the current version of the Rule,
    parties bringing motions under rules with 10-day periods could have
    as few as 5 working days to prepare their motions. This hardship
    would be especially acute in the case of Rules 50(b) and (c)(2),
    52(b), and 59(b), (d), and (e), which may not be enlarged at the
    discretion of the court. See Rule 6(b). If the exclusion of
    Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays will operate to cause
    excessive delay in urgent cases, the delay can be obviated by
    applying to the court to shorten the time, See Rule 6(b).
      The Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., which becomes a legal
    holiday effective in 1986, has been added to the list of legal
    holidays enumerated in the Rule.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1999 AMENDMENT             
      The reference to Rule 74(a) is stricken from the catalogue of
    time periods that cannot be extended by the district court. The
    change reflects the 1997 abrogation of Rule 74(a).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2001 AMENDMENT             
      The additional three days provided by Rule 6(e) is extended to
    the means of service authorized by the new paragraph (D) added to
    Rule 5(b), including - with the consent of the person served -
    service by electronic or other means. The three-day addition is
    provided as well for service on a person with no known address by
    leaving a copy with the clerk of the court.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. Proposed Rule 6(e)
    is the same as the "alternative proposal" that was published in
    August 1999.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 6(e) is amended to remove any doubt as to the method for
    extending the time to respond after service by mail, leaving with
    the clerk of court, electronic means, or other means consented to
    by the party served. Three days are added after the prescribed
    period otherwise expires under Rule 6(a). Intermediate Saturdays,
    Sundays, and legal holidays are included in counting these added
    three days. If the third day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal
    holiday, the last day to act is the next day that is not a
    Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. The effect of invoking the day
    when the prescribed period would otherwise expire under Rule 6(a)
    can be illustrated by assuming that the thirtieth day of a thirty-
    day period is a Saturday. Under Rule 6(a) the period expires on
    the next day that is not a Sunday or legal holiday. If the
    following Monday is a legal holiday, under Rule 6(a) the period
    expires on Tuesday. Three days are then added - Wednesday,
    Thursday, and Friday as the third and final day to act. If the
    period prescribed expires on a Friday, the three added days are
    Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, which is the third and final day to
    act unless it is a legal holiday. If Monday is a legal holiday, the
    next day that is not a legal holiday is the third and final day to
    act.
      Application of Rule 6(e) to a period that is less than eleven
    days can be illustrated by a paper that is served by mailing on a
    Friday. If ten days are allowed to respond, intermediate Saturdays,
    Sundays, and legal holidays are excluded in determining when the
    period expires under Rule 6(a). If there is no legal holiday, the
    period expires on the Friday two weeks after the paper was mailed.
    The three added Rule 6(e) days are Saturday, Sunday, and Monday,
    which is the third and final day to act unless it is a legal
    holiday. If Monday is a legal holiday, the next day that is not a
    legal holiday is the final day to act.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Changes were made to
    clarify further the method of counting the three days added after
    service under Rule 5(b)(2)(B), (C), or (D).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 6 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a). Subdivision (a) has been amended to simplify and
    clarify the provisions that describe how deadlines are computed.
    Subdivision (a) governs the computation of any time period found in
    these rules, in any local rule or court order, or in any statute
    that does not specify a method of computing time. In accordance
    with Rule 83(a)(1), a local rule may not direct that a deadline be
    computed in a manner inconsistent with subdivision (a).
      The time-computation provisions of subdivision (a) apply only
    when a time period must be computed. They do not apply when a fixed
    time to act is set. The amendments thus carry forward the approach
    taken in Violette v. P.A. Days, Inc., 427 F.3d 1015, 1016 (6th Cir.
    2005) (holding that Civil Rule 6(a) "does not apply to situations
    where the court has established a specific calendar day as a
    deadline"), and reject the contrary holding of In re American
    Healthcare Management, Inc., 900 F.2d 827, 832 (5th Cir. 1990)
    (holding that Bankruptcy Rule 9006(a) governs treatment of date-
    certain deadline set by court order). If, for example, the date
    for filing is "no later than November 1, 2007," subdivision (a)
    does not govern. But if a filing is required to be made "within 10
    days" or "within 72 hours," subdivision (a) describes how that
    deadline is computed.
      Subdivision (a) does not apply when computing a time period set
    by a statute if the statute specifies a method of computing time.
    See, e.g., 2 U.S.C. Sec. 394 (specifying method for computing time
    periods prescribed by certain statutory provisions relating to
    contested elections to the House of Representatives).
      Subdivision (a)(1). New subdivision (a)(1) addresses the
    computation of time periods that are stated in days. It also
    applies to time periods that are stated in weeks, months, or years.
    See, e.g., Rule 60(c)(1). Subdivision (a)(1)(B)'s directive to
    "count every day" is relevant only if the period is stated in days
    (not weeks, months or years).
      Under former Rule 6(a), a period of 11 days or more was computed
    differently than a period of less than 11 days. Intermediate
    Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays were included in computing
    the longer periods, but excluded in computing the shorter periods.
    Former Rule 6(a) thus made computing deadlines unnecessarily
    complicated and led to counterintuitive results. For example, a 10-
    day period and a 14-day period that started on the same day
    usually ended on the same day - and the 10-day period not
    infrequently ended later than the 14-day period. See Miltimore
    Sales, Inc. v. Int'l Rectifier, Inc., 412 F.3d 685, 686 (6th Cir.
    2005).
      Under new subdivision (a)(1), all deadlines stated in days (no
    matter the length) are computed in the same way. The day of the
    event that triggers the deadline is not counted. All other days -
    including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays - are
    counted, with only one exception: If the period ends on a Saturday,
    Sunday, or legal holiday, then the deadline falls on the next day
    that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. An illustration
    is provided below in the discussion of subdivision (a)(5).
    Subdivision (a)(3) addresses filing deadlines that expire on a day
    when the clerk's office is inaccessible.
      Where subdivision (a) formerly referred to the "act, event, or
    default" that triggers the deadline, new subdivision (a) refers
    simply to the "event" that triggers the deadline; this change in
    terminology is adopted for brevity and simplicity, and is not
    intended to change meaning.
      Periods previously expressed as less than 11 days will be
    shortened as a practical matter by the decision to count
    intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays in computing
    all periods. Many of those periods have been lengthened to
    compensate for the change. See, e.g., Rule 14(a)(1).
      Most of the 10-day periods were adjusted to meet the change in
    computation method by setting 14 days as the new period. A 14-day
    period corresponds to the most frequent result of a 10-day period
    under the former computation method - two Saturdays and two Sundays
    were excluded, giving 14 days in all. A 14-day period has an
    additional advantage. The final day falls on the same day of the
    week as the event that triggered the period - the 14th day after a
    Monday, for example, is a Monday. This advantage of using week-long
    periods led to adopting 7-day periods to replace some of the
    periods set at less than 10 days, and 21-day periods to replace 20-
    day periods. Thirty-day and longer periods, however, were
    generally retained without change.
      Subdivision (a)(2). New subdivision (a)(2) addresses the
    computation of time periods that are stated in hours. No such
    deadline currently appears in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
    But some statutes contain deadlines stated in hours, as do some
    court orders issued in expedited proceedings.
      Under subdivision (a)(2), a deadline stated in hours starts to
    run immediately on the occurrence of the event that triggers the
    deadline. The deadline generally ends when the time expires. If,
    however, the time period expires at a specific time (say, 2:17
    p.m.) on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the deadline is
    extended to the same time (2:17 p.m.) on the next day that is not a
    Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Periods stated in hours are not
    to be "rounded up" to the next whole hour. Subdivision (a)(3)
    addresses situations when the clerk's office is inaccessible during
    the last hour before a filing deadline expires.
      Subdivision (a)(2)(B) directs that every hour be counted. Thus,
    for example, a 72-hour period that commences at 10:23 a.m. on
    Friday, November 2, 2007, will run until 9:23 a.m. on Monday,
    November 5; the discrepancy in start and end times in this example
    results from the intervening shift from daylight saving time to
    standard time.
      Subdivision (a)(3). When determining the last day of a filing
    period stated in days or a longer unit of time, a day on which the
    clerk's office is not accessible because of the weather or another
    reason is treated like a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. When
    determining the end of a filing period stated in hours, if the
    clerk's office is inaccessible during the last hour of the filing
    period computed under subdivision (a)(2) then the period is
    extended to the same time on the next day that is not a weekend,
    holiday, or day when the clerk's office is inaccessible.
      Subdivision (a)(3)'s extensions apply "[u]nless the court orders
    otherwise." In some circumstances, the court might not wish a
    period of inaccessibility to trigger a full 24-hour extension; in
    those instances, the court can specify a briefer extension.
      The text of the rule no longer refers to "weather or other
    conditions" as the reason for the inaccessibility of the clerk's
    office. The reference to "weather" was deleted from the text to
    underscore that inaccessibility can occur for reasons unrelated to
    weather, such as an outage of the electronic filing system. Weather
    can still be a reason for inaccessibility of the clerk's office.
    The rule does not attempt to define inaccessibility. Rather, the
    concept will continue to develop through caselaw, see, e.g.,
    William G. Phelps, When Is Office of Clerk of Court Inaccessible
    Due to Weather or Other Conditions for Purpose of Computing Time
    Period for Filing Papers under Rule 6(a) of Federal Rules of Civil
    Procedure, 135 A.L.R. Fed. 259 (1996) (collecting cases). In
    addition, many local provisions address inaccessibility for
    purposes of electronic filing, see, e.g., D. Kan. Rule 5.4.11 ("A
    Filing User whose filing is made untimely as the result of a
    technical failure may seek appropriate relief from the court.").
      Subdivision (a)(4). New subdivision (a)(4) defines the end of the
    last day of a period for purposes of subdivision (a)(1).
    Subdivision (a)(4) does not apply in computing periods stated in
    hours under subdivision (a)(2), and does not apply if a different
    time is set by a statute, local rule, or order in the case. A local
    rule may, for example, address the problems that might arise if a
    single district has clerk's offices in different time zones, or
    provide that papers filed in a drop box after the normal hours of
    the clerk's office are filed as of the day that is date-stamped on
    the papers by a device in the drop box.
      28 U.S.C. Sec. 452 provides that "[a]ll courts of the United
    States shall be deemed always open for the purpose of filing proper
    papers, issuing and returning process, and making motions and
    orders." A corresponding provision exists in Rule 77(a). Some
    courts have held that these provisions permit an after-hours filing
    by handing the papers to an appropriate official. See, e.g.,
    Casalduc v. Diaz, 117 F.2d 915, 917 (1st Cir. 1941). Subdivision
    (a)(4) does not address the effect of the statute on the question
    of after-hours filing; instead, the rule is designed to deal with
    filings in the ordinary course without regard to Section 452.
      Subdivision (a)(5). New subdivision (a)(5) defines the "next" day
    for purposes of subdivisions (a)(1)(C) and (a)(2)(C). The Federal
    Rules of Civil Procedure contain both forward-looking time periods
    and backward-looking time periods. A forward-looking time period
    requires something to be done within a period of time after an
    event. See, e.g., Rule 59(b) (motion for new trial "must be filed
    no later than 28 days after entry of the judgment"). A backward-
    looking time period requires something to be done within a period
    of time before an event. See, e.g., Rule 26(f) (parties must hold
    Rule 26(f) conference "as soon as practicable and in any event at
    least 21 days before a scheduling conference is held or a
    scheduling order is due under Rule 16(b)"). In determining what is
    the "next" day for purposes of subdivisions (a)(1)(C) and
    (a)(2)(C), one should continue counting in the same direction -
    that is, forward when computing a forward-looking period and
    backward when computing a backward-looking period. If, for example,
    a filing is due within 30 days after an event, and the thirtieth
    day falls on Saturday, September 1, 2007, then the filing is due on
    Tuesday, September 4, 2007 (Monday, September 3, is Labor Day). But
    if a filing is due 21 days before an event, and the twenty-first
    day falls on Saturday, September 1, then the filing is due on
    Friday, August 31. If the clerk's office is inaccessible on August
    31, then subdivision (a)(3) extends the filing deadline forward to
    the next accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal
    holiday - no later than Tuesday, September 4.
      Subdivision (a)(6). New subdivision (a)(6) defines "legal
    holiday" for purposes of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
    including the time-computation provisions of subdivision (a).
    Subdivision (a)(6) continues to include within the definition of
    "legal holiday" days that are declared a holiday by the President
    or Congress.
      For forward-counted periods - i.e., periods that are measured
    after an event - subdivision (a)(6)(C) includes certain state
    holidays within the definition of legal holidays. However, state
    legal holidays are not recognized in computing backward-counted
    periods. For both forward- and backward-counted periods, the rule
    thus protects those who may be unsure of the effect of state
    holidays. For forward-counted deadlines, treating state holidays
    the same as federal holidays extends the deadline. Thus, someone
    who thought that the federal courts might be closed on a state
    holiday would be safeguarded against an inadvertent late filing. In
    contrast, for backward-counted deadlines, not giving state holidays
    the treatment of federal holidays allows filing on the state
    holiday itself rather than the day before. Take, for example,
    Monday, April 21, 2008 (Patriot's Day, a legal holiday in the
    relevant state). If a filing is due 14 days after an event, and the
    fourteenth day is April 21, then the filing is due on Tuesday,
    April 22 because Monday, April 21 counts as a legal holiday. But if
    a filing is due 14 days before an event, and the fourteenth day is
    April 21, the filing is due on Monday, April 21; the fact that
    April 21 is a state holiday does not make April 21 a legal holiday
    for purposes of computing this backward-counted deadline. But note
    that if the clerk's office is inaccessible on Monday, April 21,
    then subdivision (a)(3) extends the April 21 filing deadline
    forward to the next accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday
    or legal holiday - no earlier than Tuesday, April 22.
      Changes Made after Publication and Comment. The Standing
    Committee changed Rule 6(a)(6) to exclude state holidays from the
    definition of "legal holiday" for purposes of computing backward-
    counted periods; conforming changes were made to the Committee
    Note.
      [Subdivisions (b) and (c).] The times set in the former rule at 1
    or 5 days have been revised to 7 or 14 days. See the Note to Rule 6
    [above].

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      1. A provision designating pleadings and defining a motion is
    common in the State practice acts. See Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937), ch.
    110, Sec. 156 (Designation and order of pleadings); 2 Minn.Stat.
    (Mason, 1927) Sec. 9246 (Definition of motion); and N.Y.C.P.A.
    (1937) Sec. 113 (Definition of motion). Former Equity Rules 18
    (Pleadings - Technical Forms Abrogated), 29 (Defenses - How
    Presented), and 33 (Testing Sufficiency of Defense) abolished
    technical forms of pleading, demurrers, and pleas, and exceptions
    for insufficiency of an answer.
      2. Note to Subdivision (a). This preserves the substance of
    [former] Equity Rule 31 (Reply - When Required - When Cause at
    Issue). Compare the English practice, English Rules Under the
    Judicature Act (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 23, r.r. 1, 2 (Reply
    to counterclaim; amended, 1933, to be subject to the rules
    applicable to defenses, O. 21). See O. 21, r.r. 1-14; O. 27, r. 13
    (When pleadings deemed denied and put in issue). Under the codes
    the pleadings are generally limited. A reply is sometimes required
    to an affirmative defense in the answer. 1 Colo.Stat.Ann. (1935)
    Sec. 66; Ore.Code Ann. (1930) Secs. 1-614, 1-616. In other
    jurisdictions no reply is necessary to an affirmative defense in

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      This amendment [to subdivision (a)] eliminates any question as to
    whether the compulsory reply, where a counterclaim is pleaded, is a
    reply only to the counterclaim or is a general reply to the answer
    containing the counterclaim. See Commentary, Scope of Reply Where
    Defendant Has Pleaded Counterclaim (1939) 1 Fed.Rules Serv. 672;
    Fort Chartres and Ivy Landing Drainage and Levee District No. Five
    v. Thompson (E.D.Ill. 1945) 8 Fed.Rules Serv. 13.32, Case 1.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      Certain redundant words are eliminated and the subdivision is
    modified to reflect the amendment of Rule 14(a) which in certain
    cases eliminates the requirement of obtaining leave to bring in a
    third-party defendant.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983 AMENDMENT       
      One of the reasons sanctions against improper motion practice
    have been employed infrequently is the lack of clarity of Rule 7.
    That rule has stated only generally that the pleading requirements
    relating to captions, signing, and other matters of form also apply
    to motions and other papers. The addition of Rule 7(b)(3) makes
    explicit the applicability of the signing requirement and the
    sanctions of Rule 11, which have been amplified.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 7 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Former Rule 7(a) stated that "there shall be * * * an answer to a
    cross-claim, if the answer contains a cross-claim * * *." Former
    Rule 12(a)(2) provided more generally that "[a] party served with a
    pleading stating a cross-claim against that party shall serve an
    answer thereto * * *." New Rule 7(a) corrects this inconsistency by
    providing for an answer to a crossclaim.
      For the first time, Rule 7(a)(7) expressly authorizes the court
    to order a reply to a counterclaim answer. A reply may be as useful
    in this setting as a reply to an answer, a third-party answer, or a
    crossclaim answer.
      Former Rule 7(b)(1) stated that the writing requirement is
    fulfilled if the motion is stated in a written notice of hearing.
    This statement was deleted as redundant because a single written
    document can satisfy the writing requirements both for a motion and
    for a Rule 6(c)(1) notice.
      The cross-reference to Rule 11 in former Rule 7(b)(3) is deleted
    as redundant. Rule 11 applies by its own terms. The force and
    application of Rule 11 are not diminished by the deletion.
      Former Rule 7(c) is deleted because it has done its work. If a
    motion or pleading is described as a demurrer, plea, or exception
    for insufficiency, the court will treat the paper as if properly
    captioned.

                      COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002                  
      Rule 7.1 is drawn from Rule 26.1 of the Federal Rules of
    Appellate Procedure, with changes to adapt to the circumstances of
    district courts that dictate different provisions for the time of
    filing, number of copies, and the like. The information required by
    Rule 7.1(a) reflects the "financial interest" standard of Canon
    3C(1)(c) of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges. This
    information will support properly informed disqualification
    decisions in situations that call for automatic disqualification
    under Canon 3C(1)(c). It does not cover all of the circumstances
    that may call for disqualification under the financial interest
    standard, and does not deal at all with other circumstances that
    may call for disqualification.
      Although the disclosures required by Rule 7.1(a) may seem
    limited, they are calculated to reach a majority of the
    circumstances that are likely to call for disqualification on the
    basis of financial information that a judge may not know or
    recollect. Framing a rule that calls for more detailed disclosure
    will be difficult. Unnecessary disclosure requirements place a
    burden on the parties and on courts. Unnecessary disclosure of
    volumes of information may create a risk that a judge will overlook
    the one bit of information that might require disqualification, and
    also may create a risk that unnecessary disqualifications will be
    made rather than attempt to unravel a potentially difficult
    question. It has not been feasible to dictate more detailed
    disclosure requirements in Rule 7.1(a).
      Rule 7.1 does not prohibit local rules that require disclosures
    in addition to those required by Rule 7.1. Developing experience
    with local disclosure practices and advances in electronic
    technology may provide a foundation for adopting more detailed
    disclosure requirements by future amendments of Rule 7.1.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The provisions that
    would require disclosure of additional information that may be
    required by the Judicial Conference have been deleted.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE III. PLEADINGS AND MOTIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 8. General Rules of Pleading

-STATUTE-
      (a) Claim for Relief. A pleading that states a claim for relief
    must contain:
        (1) a short and plain statement of the grounds for the court's
      jurisdiction, unless the court already has jurisdiction and the
      claim needs no new jurisdictional support;
        (2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the
      pleader is entitled to relief; and
        (3) a demand for the relief sought, which may include relief in
      the alternative or different types of relief.

      (b) Defenses; Admissions and Denials.
        (1) In General. In responding to a pleading, a party must:
          (A) state in short and plain terms its defenses to each claim
        asserted against it; and
          (B) admit or deny the allegations asserted against it by an
        opposing party.

        (2) Denials - Responding to the Substance. A denial must fairly
      respond to the substance of the allegation.
        (3) General and Specific Denials. A party that intends in good
      faith to deny all the allegations of a pleading - including the
      jurisdictional grounds - may do so by a general denial. A party
      that does not intend to deny all the allegations must either
      specifically deny designated allegations or generally deny all
      except those specifically admitted.
        (4) Denying Part of an Allegation. A party that intends in good
      faith to deny only part of an allegation must admit the part that
      is true and deny the rest.
        (5) Lacking Knowledge or Information. A party that lacks
      knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the
      truth of an allegation must so state, and the statement has the
      effect of a denial.
        (6) Effect of Failing to Deny. An allegation - other than one
      relating to the amount of damages - is admitted if a responsive
      pleading is required and the allegation is not denied. If a
      responsive pleading is not required, an allegation is considered
      denied or avoided.

      (c) Affirmative Defenses.
        (1) In General. In responding to a pleading, a party must
      affirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense,
      including:
          -- accord and satisfaction;
          -- arbitration and award;
          -- assumption of risk;
          -- contributory negligence;
          -- discharge in bankruptcy;
          -- duress;
          -- estoppel;
          -- failure of consideration;
          -- fraud;
          -- illegality;
          -- injury by fellow servant;
          -- laches;
          -- license;
          -- payment;
          -- release;
          -- res judicata;
          -- statute of frauds;
          -- statute of limitations; and
          -- waiver.

        (2) Mistaken Designation. If a party mistakenly designates a
      defense as a counterclaim, or a counterclaim as a defense, the
      court must, if justice requires, treat the pleading as though it
      were correctly designated, and may impose terms for doing so.

      (d) Pleading to Be Concise and Direct; Alternative Statements;
    Inconsistency.
        (1) In General. Each allegation must be simple, concise, and
      direct. No technical form is required.
        (2) Alternative Statements of a Claim or Defense. A party may
      set out 2 or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively
      or hypothetically, either in a single count or defense or in
      separate ones. If a party makes alternative statements, the
      pleading is sufficient if any one of them is sufficient.
        (3) Inconsistent Claims or Defenses. A party may state as many
      separate claims or defenses as it has, regardless of consistency.

      (e) Construing Pleadings. Pleadings must be construed so as to do
    justice.

    for infringement) and similar statutes.
      2. This rule is, in part, [former] Equity Rule 30 (Answer -

    the Connecticut practice. See Conn.Practice Book (1934) Secs. 107,
    108, and 122; Conn.Gen.Stat. (1930) Secs. 5508-5514. Compare the

    Annual Practice, 1937) O. 19, r.r. 17-20.
      Note to Subdivision (c). This follows substantially English Rules
    Under the Judicature Act (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 19, r. 15
    and N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) Sec. 242, with "surprise" omitted in this
    rule.

    [former] Equity Rule 30 (Answer - Contents - Counterclaim). For the
    second sentence see [former] Equity Rule 31 (Reply - When Required -
     When Cause at Issue). This is similar to English Rules Under the
    Judicature Act (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 19, r.r. 13, 18; and
    to the practice in the States.
      Note to Subdivision (e). This rule is an elaboration upon
    [former] Equity Rule 30 (Answer - Contents - Counterclaim), plus a
    statement of the actual practice under some codes. Compare also

      The language of Rule 8 has been amended as part of the general

    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      The former Rule 8(b) and 8(e) cross-references to Rule 11 are
    deleted as redundant. Rule 11 applies by its own terms. The force
    and application of Rule 11 are not diminished by the deletion.
      Former Rule 8(b) required a pleader denying part of an averment
    to "specify so much of it as is true and material and * * * deny
    only the remainder." "[A]nd material" is deleted to avoid the
    implication that it is proper to deny something that the pleader
    believes to be true but not material.
      Deletion of former Rule 8(e)(2)'s "whether based on legal,
    equitable, or maritime grounds" reflects the parallel deletions in
    Rule 1 and elsewhere. Merger is now successfully accomplished.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. See Note to Rule 1,

    Rule 9. Pleading Special Matters

-STATUTE-
      (a) Capacity or Authority to Sue; Legal Existence.
        (1) In General. Except when required to show that the court has
      jurisdiction, a pleading need not allege:
          (A) a party's capacity to sue or be sued;
          (B) a party's authority to sue or be sued in a representative
        capacity; or
          (C) the legal existence of an organized association of
        persons that is made a party.

        (2) Raising Those Issues. To raise any of those issues, a party
      must do so by a specific denial, which must state any supporting
      facts that are peculiarly within the party's knowledge.

      (b) Fraud or Mistake; Conditions of Mind. In alleging fraud or
    mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances
    constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other
    conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally.
      (c) Conditions Precedent. In pleading conditions precedent, it
    suffices to allege generally that all conditions precedent have
    occurred or been performed. But when denying that a condition
    precedent has occurred or been performed, a party must do so with
    particularity.
      (d) Official Document or Act. In pleading an official document or
    official act, it suffices to allege that the document was legally
    issued or the act legally done.
      (e) Judgment. In pleading a judgment or decision of a domestic or
    foreign court, a judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal, or a board or
    officer, it suffices to plead the judgment or decision without
    showing jurisdiction to render it.
      (f) Time and Place. An allegation of time or place is material
    when testing the sufficiency of a pleading.
      (g) Special Damages. If an item of special damage is claimed, it
    must be specifically stated.
      (h) Admiralty or Maritime Claim.
        (1) How Designated. If a claim for relief is within the
      admiralty or maritime jurisdiction and also within the court's
      subject-matter jurisdiction on some other ground, the pleading
      may designate the claim as an admiralty or maritime claim for
      purposes of Rules 14(c), 38(e), and 82 and the Supplemental Rules
      for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture Actions. A
      claim cognizable only in the admiralty or maritime jurisdiction
      is an admiralty or maritime claim for those purposes, whether or
      not so designated.
        (2) Designation for Appeal. A case that includes an admiralty
      or maritime claim within this subdivision (h) is an admiralty
      case within 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(a)(3).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      Certain distinctive features of the admiralty practice must be
    preserved for what are now suits in admiralty. This raises the
    question: After unification, when a single form of action is
    established, how will the counterpart of the present suit in
    admiralty be identifiable? In part the question is easily answered.
    Some claims for relief can only be suits in admiralty, either
    because the admiralty jurisdiction is exclusive or because no
    nonmaritime ground of federal jurisdiction exists. Many claims,
    however, are cognizable by the district courts whether asserted in
    admiralty or in a civil action, assuming the existence of a
    nonmaritime ground of jurisdiction. Thus at present the pleader has
    power to determine procedural consequences by the way in which he
    exercises the classic privilege given by the saving-to-suitors
    clause (28 U.S.C. Sec. 1333) or by equivalent statutory provisions.
    For example, a longshoreman's claim for personal injuries suffered
    by reason of the unseaworthiness of a vessel may be asserted in a
    suit in admiralty or, if diversity of citizenship exists, in a
    civil action. One of the important procedural consequences is that
    in the civil action either party may demand a jury trial, while in
    the suit in admiralty there is no right to jury trial except as
    provided by statute.
      It is no part of the purpose of unification to inject a right to
    jury trial into those admiralty cases in which that right is not
    provided by statute. Similarly as will be more specifically noted
    below, there is no disposition to change the present law as to
    interlocutory appeals in admiralty, or as to the venue of suits in
    admiralty; and, of course, there is no disposition to inject into
    the civil practice as it now is the distinctively maritime remedies
    (maritime attachment and garnishment, actions in rem, possessory,
    petitory and partition actions and limitation of liability). The
    unified rules must therefore provide some device for preserving the
    present power of the pleader to determine whether these
    historically maritime procedures shall be applicable to his claim
    or not; the pleader must be afforded some means of designating his
    claim as the counterpart of the present suit in admiralty, where
    its character as such is not clear.
      The problem is different from the similar one concerning the
    identification of claims that were formerly suits in equity. While
    that problem is not free from complexities, it is broadly true that
    the modern counterpart of the suit in equity is distinguishable
    from the former action at law by the character of the relief
    sought. This mode of identification is possible in only a limited
    category of admiralty cases. In large numbers of cases the relief
    sought in admiralty is simple money damages, indistinguishable from
    the remedy afforded by the common law. This is true, for example,
    in the case of the longshoreman's action for personal injuries
    stated above. After unification has abolished the distinction
    between civil actions and suits in admiralty, the complaint in such
    an action would be almost completely ambiguous as to the pleader's
    intentions regarding the procedure invoked. The allegation of
    diversity of citizenship might be regarded as a clue indicating an
    intention to proceed as at present under the saving-to-suitors
    clause; but this, too, would be ambiguous if there were also
    reference to the admiralty jurisdiction, and the pleader ought not
    be required to forego mention of all available jurisdictional
    grounds.
      Other methods of solving the problem were carefully explored, but
    the Advisory Committee concluded that the preferable solution is to
    allow the pleader who now has power to determine procedural
    consequences by filing a suit in admiralty to exercise that power
    under unification, for the limited instances in which procedural
    differences will remain, by a simple statement in his pleading to
    the effect that the claim is an admiralty or maritime claim.
      The choice made by the pleader in identifying or in failing to
    identify his claim as an admiralty or maritime claim is not an
    irrevocable election. The rule provides that the amendment of a
    pleading to add or withdraw an identifying statement is subject to
    the principles of Rule 15.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1968 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment eliminates the reference to Rule 73 which is to be
    abrogated and transfers to Rule 9(h) the substance of Subsection
    (h) of Rule 73 which preserved the right to an interlocutory appeal
    in admiralty cases which is provided by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(a)(3).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1970 AMENDMENT       
      The reference to Rule 26(a) is deleted, in light of the transfer
    of that subdivision to Rule 30(a) and the elimination of the de
    bene esse procedure therefrom. See the Advisory Committee's note to
    Rule 30(a).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       
      Section 1292(a)(3) of the Judicial Code provides for appeal from
    "[i]nterlocutory decrees of * * * district courts * * * determining
    the rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty cases in
    which appeals from final decrees are allowed."
      Rule 9(h) was added in 1966 with the unification of civil and
    admiralty procedure. Civil Rule 73(h) was amended at the same time
    to provide that the Sec. 1292(a)(3) reference "to admiralty cases
    shall be construed to mean admiralty and maritime claims within the
    meaning of Rule 9(h)." This provision was transferred to Rule 9(h)
    when the Appellate Rules were adopted.
      A single case can include both admiralty or maritime claims and
    nonadmiralty claims or parties. This combination reveals an
    ambiguity in the statement in present Rule 9(h) that an admiralty
    "claim" is an admiralty "case." An order "determining the rights
    and liabilities of the parties" within the meaning of Sec.
    1292(a)(3) may resolve only a nonadmiralty claim, or may
    simultaneously resolve interdependent admiralty and nonadmiralty
    claims. Can appeal be taken as to the nonadmiralty matter, because
    it is part of a case that includes an admiralty claim, or is appeal
    limited to the admiralty claim?
      The courts of appeals have not achieved full uniformity in
    applying the Sec. 1292(a)(3) requirement that an order "determin[e]
    the rights and liabilities of the parties." It is common to assert
    that the statute should be construed narrowly, under the general
    policy that exceptions to the final judgment rule should be
    construed narrowly. This policy would suggest that the ambiguity
    should be resolved by limiting the interlocutory appeal right to
    orders that determine the rights and liabilities of the parties to
    an admiralty claim.
      A broader view is chosen by this amendment for two reasons. The
    statute applies to admiralty "cases," and may itself provide for
    appeal from an order that disposes of a nonadmiralty claim that is
    joined in a single case with an admiralty claim. Although a rule of
    court may help to clarify and implement a statutory grant of
    jurisdiction, the line is not always clear between permissible
    implementation and impermissible withdrawal of jurisdiction. In
    addition, so long as an order truly disposes of the rights and
    liabilities of the parties within the meaning of Sec. 1292(a)(3),
    it may prove important to permit appeal as to the nonadmiralty
    claim. Disposition of the nonadmiralty claim, for example, may make
    it unnecessary to consider the admiralty claim and have the same
    effect on the case and parties as disposition of the admiralty
    claim. Or the admiralty and nonadmiralty claims may be
    interdependent. An illustration is provided by Roco Carriers, Ltd.
    v. M/V Nurnberg Express, 899 F.2d 1292 (2d Cir. 1990). Claims for
    losses of ocean shipments were made against two defendants, one
    subject to admiralty jurisdiction and the other not. Summary
    judgment was granted in favor of the admiralty defendant and
    against the nonadmiralty defendant. The nonadmiralty defendant's
    appeal was accepted, with the explanation that the determination of
    its liability was "integrally linked with the determination of non-
    liability" of the admiralty defendant, and that "section
    1292(a)(3) is not limited to admiralty claims; instead, it refers
    to admiralty cases." 899 F.2d at 1297. The advantages of permitting
    appeal by the nonadmiralty defendant would be particularly clear if
    the plaintiff had appealed the summary judgment in favor of the
    admiralty defendant.
      It must be emphasized that this amendment does not rest on any
    particular assumptions as to the meaning of the Sec. 1292(a)(3)
    provision that limits interlocutory appeal to orders that determine
    the rights and liabilities of the parties. It simply reflects the
    conclusion that so long as the case involves an admiralty claim and
    an order otherwise meets statutory requirements, the opportunity to
    appeal should not turn on the circumstance that the order does - or
    does not - dispose of an admiralty claim. No attempt is made to
    invoke the authority conferred by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(e) to provide
    by rule for appeal of an interlocutory decision that is not
    otherwise provided for by other subsections of Sec. 1292.

      Rule 15 governs pleading amendments of its own force. The former
    redundant statement that Rule 15 governs an amendment that adds or
    withdraws a Rule 9(h) designation as an admiralty or maritime claim
    is deleted. The elimination of paragraph (2) means that "(3)" will
    be redesignated as "(2)" in Style Rule 9(h).

-EXPCITE-
    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE III. PLEADINGS AND MOTIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 11. Signing Pleadings, Motions, and Other Papers;
      Representations to the Court; Sanctions

-STATUTE-
      (a) Signature. Every pleading, written motion, and other paper
    must be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney's
    name - or by a party personally if the party is unrepresented. The
    paper must state the signer's address, e-mail address, and
    telephone number. Unless a rule or statute specifically states
    otherwise, a pleading need not be verified or accompanied by an
    affidavit. The court must strike an unsigned paper unless the
    omission is promptly corrected after being called to the attorney's
    or party's attention.
      (b) Representations to the Court. By presenting to the court a
    pleading, written motion, or other paper - whether by signing,
    filing, submitting, or later advocating it - an attorney or
    unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the person's
    knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry
    reasonable under the circumstances:
        (1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as
      to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the
      cost of litigation;
        (2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are
      warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for
      extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for
      establishing new law;
        (3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if
      specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support
      after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or
      discovery; and
        (4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the
      evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based
      on belief or a lack of information.

      (c) Sanctions.
        (1) In General. If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity
      to respond, the court determines that Rule 11(b) has been
      violated, the court may impose an appropriate sanction on any
      attorney, law firm, or party that violated the rule or is
      responsible for the violation. Absent exceptional circumstances,
      a law firm must be held jointly responsible for a violation
      committed by its partner, associate, or employee.
        (2) Motion for Sanctions. A motion for sanctions must be made
      separately from any other motion and must describe the specific
      conduct that allegedly violates Rule 11(b). The motion must be
      served under Rule 5, but it must not be filed or be presented to
      the court if the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, or
      denial is withdrawn or appropriately corrected within 21 days
      after service or within another time the court sets. If
      warranted, the court may award to the prevailing party the
      reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred for the
      motion.
        (3) On the Court's Initiative. On its own, the court may order
      an attorney, law firm, or party to show cause why conduct
      specifically described in the order has not violated Rule 11(b).
        (4) Nature of a Sanction. A sanction imposed under this rule
      must be limited to what suffices to deter repetition of the
      conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated. The
      sanction may include nonmonetary directives; an order to pay a
      penalty into court; or, if imposed on motion and warranted for
      effective deterrence, an order directing payment to the movant of
      part or all of the reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses
      directly resulting from the violation.
        (5) Limitations on Monetary Sanctions. The court must not
      impose a monetary sanction:
          (A) against a represented party for violating Rule 11(b)(2);
        or
          (B) on its own, unless it issued the show-cause order under
        Rule 11(c)(3) before voluntary dismissal or settlement of the
        claims made by or against the party that is, or whose attorneys
        are, to be sanctioned.

        (6) Requirements for an Order. An order imposing a sanction
      must describe the sanctioned conduct and explain the basis for
      the sanction.

      (d) Inapplicability to Discovery. This rule does not apply to
    disclosures and discovery requests, responses, objections, and
    motions under Rules 26 through 37.

    69 F.2d 294 (C.C.A. 3d, 1934).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983 AMENDMENT       
      Since its original promulgation, Rule 11 has provided for the
    striking of pleadings and the imposition of disciplinary sanctions
    to check abuses in the signing of pleadings. Its provisions have
    always applied to motions and other papers by virtue of
    incorporation by reference in Rule 7(b)(2). The amendment and the
    addition of Rule 7(b)(3) expressly confirms this applicability.
      Experience shows that in practice Rule 11 has not been effective
    in deterring abuses. See 6 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and
    Procedure: Civil Sec. 1334 (1971). There has been considerable
    confusion as to (1) the circumstances that should trigger striking
    a pleading or motion or taking disciplinary action, (2) the
    standard of conduct expected of attorneys who sign pleadings and
    motions, and (3) the range of available and appropriate sanctions.
    See Rodes, Ripple & Mooney, Sanctions Imposable for Violations of
    the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 64-65, Federal Judicial Center
    (1981). The new language is intended to reduce the reluctance of
    courts to impose sanctions, see Moore, Federal Practice &#182;
    7.05, at 1547, by emphasizing the responsibilities of the attorney
    and reenforcing those obligations by the imposition of sanctions.
      The amended rule attempts to deal with the problem by building
    upon and expanding the equitable doctrine permitting the court to
    award expenses, including attorney's fees, to a litigant whose
    opponent acts in bad faith in instituting or conducting litigation.
    See, e.g., Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752, (1980);
    Hall v. Cole, 412 U.S. 1, 5 (1973). Greater attention by the
    district courts to pleading and motion abuses and the imposition of
    sanctions when appropriate, should discourage dilatory or abusive
    tactics and help to streamline the litigation process by lessening
    frivolous claims or defenses.
      The expanded nature of the lawyer's certification in the fifth
    sentence of amended Rule 11 recognizes that the litigation process
    may be abused for purposes other than delay. See, e.g., Browning
    Debenture Holders' Committee v. DASA Corp., 560 F.2d 1078 (2d Cir.
    1977).
      The words "good ground to support" the pleading in the original
    rule were interpreted to have both factual and legal elements. See,
    e.g., Heart Disease Research Foundation v. General Motors Corp., 15
    Fed.R.Serv. 2d 1517, 1519 (S.D.N.Y. 1972). They have been replaced
    by a standard of conduct that is more focused.
      The new language stresses the need for some prefiling inquiry
    into both the facts and the law to satisfy the affirmative duty
    imposed by the rule. The standard is one of reasonableness under
    the circumstances. See Kinee v. Abraham Lincoln Fed. Sav. & Loan
    Ass'n, 365 F.Supp. 975 (E.D.Pa. 1973). This standard is more
    stringent than the original good-faith formula and thus it is
    expected that a greater range of circumstances will trigger its
    violation. See Nemeroff v. Abelson, 620 F.2d 339 (2d Cir. 1980).
      The rule is not intended to chill an attorney's enthusiasm or
    creativity in pursuing factual or legal theories. The court is
    expected to avoid using the wisdom of hindsight and should test the
    signer's conduct by inquiring what was reasonable to believe at the
    time the pleading, motion, or other paper was submitted. Thus, what
    constitutes a reasonable inquiry may depend on such factors as how
    much time for investigation was available to the signer; whether he
    had to rely on a client for information as to the facts underlying
    the pleading, motion, or other paper; whether the pleading, motion,
    or other paper was based on a plausible view of the law; or whether
    he depended on forwarding counsel or another member of the bar.
      The rule does not require a party or an attorney to disclose
    privileged communications or work product in order to show that the
    signing of the pleading, motion, or other paper is substantially
    justified. The provisions of Rule 26(c), including appropriate
    orders after in camera inspection by the court, remain available to
    protect a party claiming privilege or work product protection.
      Amended Rule 11 continues to apply to anyone who signs a
    pleading, motion, or other paper. Although the standard is the same
    for unrepresented parties, who are obliged themselves to sign the
    pleadings, the court has sufficient discretion to take account of
    the special circumstances that often arise in pro se situations.
    See Haines v. Kerner 404 U.S. 519 (1972).
      The provision in the original rule for striking pleadings and
    motions as sham and false has been deleted. The passage has rarely
    been utilized, and decisions thereunder have tended to confuse the
    issue of attorney honesty with the merits of the action. See
    generally Risinger, Honesty in Pleading and its Enforcement: Some
    "Striking" Problems with Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, 61 Minn.L.Rev. 1
    (1976). Motions under this provision generally present issues
    better dealt with under Rules 8, 12, or 56. See Murchison v. Kirby,
    27 F.R.D. 14 (S.D.N.Y. 1961); 5 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice
    and Procedure: Civil Sec. 1334 (1969).
      The former reference to the inclusion of scandalous or indecent
    matter, which is itself strong indication that an improper purpose
    underlies the pleading, motion, or other paper, also has been
    deleted as unnecessary. Such matter may be stricken under Rule
    12(f) as well as dealt with under the more general language of
    amended Rule 11.
      The text of the amended rule seeks to dispel apprehensions that
    efforts to obtain enforcement will be fruitless by insuring that
    the rule will be applied when properly invoked. The word
    "sanctions" in the caption, for example, stresses a deterrent
    orientation in dealing with improper pleadings, motions or other
    papers. This corresponds to the approach in imposing sanctions for
    discovery abuses. See National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey
    Club, 427 U.S. 639 (1976) (per curiam). And the words "shall
    impose" in the last sentence focus the court's attention on the
    need to impose sanctions for pleading and motion abuses. The court,
    however, retains the necessary flexibility to deal appropriately
    with violations of the rule. It has discretion to tailor sanctions
    to the particular facts of the case, with which it should be well
    acquainted.
      The reference in the former text to wilfullness as a prerequisite
    to disciplinary action has been deleted. However, in considering
    the nature and severity of the sanctions to be imposed, the court
    should take account of the state of the attorney's or party's
    actual or presumed knowledge when the pleading or other paper was
    signed. Thus, for example, when a party is not represented by
    counsel, the absence of legal advice is an appropriate factor to be
    considered.
      Courts currently appear to believe they may impose sanctions on
    their own motion. See North American Trading Corp. v. Zale Corp.,
    73 F.R.D. 293 (S.D.N.Y. 1979). Authority to do so has been made
    explicit in order to overcome the traditional reluctance of courts
    to intervene unless requested by one of the parties. The detection
    and punishment of a violation of the signing requirement,
    encouraged by the amended rule, is part of the court's
    responsibility for securing the system's effective operation.
      If the duty imposed by the rule is violated, the court should
    have the discretion to impose sanctions on either the attorney, the
    party the signing attorney represents, or both, or on an
    unrepresented party who signed the pleading, and the new rule so
    provides. Although Rule 11 has been silent on the point, courts
    have claimed the power to impose sanctions on an attorney
    personally, either by imposing costs or employing the contempt
    technique. See 5 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure:
    Civil Sec. 1334 (1969); 2A Moore, Federal Practice &#182; 11.02, at
    2104 n.8. This power has been used infrequently. The amended rule
    should eliminate any doubt as to the propriety of assessing
    sanctions against the attorney.
      Even though it is the attorney whose signature violates the rule,
    it may be appropriate under the circumstances of the case to impose
    a sanction on the client. See Browning Debenture Holders' Committee
    v. DASA Corp., supra. This modification brings Rule 11 in line with
    practice under Rule 37, which allows sanctions for abuses during
    discovery to be imposed upon the party, the attorney, or both.
      A party seeking sanctions should give notice to the court and the
    offending party promptly upon discovering a basis for doing so. The
    time when sanctions are to be imposed rests in the discretion of
    the trial judge. However, it is anticipated that in the case of
    pleadings the sanctions issue under Rule 11 normally will be
    determined at the end of the litigation, and in the case of motions
    at the time when the motion is decided or shortly thereafter. The
    procedure obviously must comport with due process requirements. The
    particular format to be followed should depend on the circumstances
    of the situation and the severity of the sanction under
    consideration. In many situations the judge's participation in the
    proceedings provides him with full knowledge of the relevant facts
    and little further inquiry will be necessary.
      To assure that the efficiencies achieved through more effective
    operation of the pleading regimen will not be offset by the cost of
    satellite litigation over the imposition of sanctions, the court
    must to the extent possible limit the scope of sanction proceedings
    to the record. Thus, discovery should be conducted only by leave of
    the court, and then only in extraordinary circumstances.
      Although the encompassing reference to "other papers" in new Rule
    11 literally includes discovery papers, the certification
    requirement in that context is governed by proposed new Rule 26(g).
    Discovery motions, however, fall within the ambit of Rule 11.

      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Purpose of revision. This revision is intended to remedy problems
    that have arisen in the interpretation and application of the 1983
    revision of the rule. For empirical examination of experience under
    the 1983 rule, see, e.g., New York State Bar Committee on Federal
    Courts, Sanctions and Attorneys' Fees (1987); T. Willging, The Rule
    11 Sanctioning Process (1989); American Judicature Society, Report
    of the Third Circuit Task Force on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
    11 (S. Burbank ed., 1989); E. Wiggins, T. Willging, and D.
    Stienstra, Report on Rule 11 (Federal Judicial Center 1991). For
    book-length analyses of the case law, see G. Joseph, Sanctions: The
    Federal Law of Litigation Abuse (1989); J. Solovy, The Federal Law
    of Sanctions (1991); G. Vairo, Rule 11 Sanctions: Case Law
    Perspectives and Preventive Measures (1991).
      The rule retains the principle that attorneys and pro se
    litigants have an obligation to the court to refrain from conduct
    that frustrates the aims of Rule 1. The revision broadens the scope
    of this obligation, but places greater constraints on the
    imposition of sanctions and should reduce the number of motions for
    sanctions presented to the court. New subdivision (d) removes from
    the ambit of this rule all discovery requests, responses,
    objections, and motions subject to the provisions of Rule 26
    through 37.
      Subdivision (a). Retained in this subdivision are the provisions
    requiring signatures on pleadings, written motions, and other
    papers. Unsigned papers are to be received by the Clerk, but then
    are to be stricken if the omission of the signature is not
    corrected promptly after being called to the attention of the
    attorney or pro se litigant. Correction can be made by signing the
    paper on file or by submitting a duplicate that contains the
    signature. A court may require by local rule that papers contain
    additional identifying information regarding the parties or
    attorneys, such as telephone numbers to facilitate facsimile
    transmissions, though, as for omission of a signature, the paper
    should not be rejected for failure to provide such information.
      The sentence in the former rule relating to the effect of answers
    under oath is no longer needed and has been eliminated. The
    provision in the former rule that signing a paper constitutes a
    certificate that it has been read by the signer also has been
    eliminated as unnecessary. The obligations imposed under
    subdivision (b) obviously require that a pleading, written motion,
    or other paper be read before it is filed or submitted to the
    court.
      Subdivisions (b) and (c). These subdivisions restate the
    provisions requiring attorneys and pro se litigants to conduct a
    reasonable inquiry into the law and facts before signing pleadings,
    written motions, and other documents, and prescribing sanctions for
    violation of these obligations. The revision in part expands the
    responsibilities of litigants to the court, while providing greater
    constraints and flexibility in dealing with infractions of the
    rule. The rule continues to require litigants to "stop-and-think"
    before initially making legal or factual contentions. It also,
    however, emphasizes the duty of candor by subjecting litigants to
    potential sanctions for insisting upon a position after it is no
    longer tenable and by generally providing protection against
    sanctions if they withdraw or correct contentions after a potential
    violation is called to their attention.
      The rule applies only to assertions contained in papers filed
    with or submitted to the court. It does not cover matters arising
    for the first time during oral presentations to the court, when
    counsel may make statements that would not have been made if there
    had been more time for study and reflection. However, a litigant's
    obligations with respect to the contents of these papers are not
    measured solely as of the time they are filed with or submitted to
    the court, but include reaffirming to the court and advocating
    positions contained in those pleadings and motions after learning
    that they cease to have any merit. For example, an attorney who
    during a pretrial conference insists on a claim or defense should
    be viewed as "presenting to the court" that contention and would be
    subject to the obligations of subdivision (b) measured as of that
    time. Similarly, if after a notice of removal is filed, a party
    urges in federal court the allegations of a pleading filed in state
    court (whether as claims, defenses, or in disputes regarding
    removal or remand), it would be viewed as "presenting" - and hence
    certifying to the district court under Rule 11 - those allegations.
      The certification with respect to allegations and other factual
    contentions is revised in recognition that sometimes a litigant may
    have good reason to believe that a fact is true or false but may
    need discovery, formal or informal, from opposing parties or third
    persons to gather and confirm the evidentiary basis for the
    allegation. Tolerance of factual contentions in initial pleadings
    by plaintiffs or defendants when specifically identified as made on
    information and belief does not relieve litigants from the
    obligation to conduct an appropriate investigation into the facts
    that is reasonable under the circumstances; it is not a license to
    join parties, make claims, or present defenses without any factual
    basis or justification. Moreover, if evidentiary support is not
    obtained after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation
    or discovery, the party has a duty under the rule not to persist
    with that contention. Subdivision (b) does not require a formal
    amendment to pleadings for which evidentiary support is not
    obtained, but rather calls upon a litigant not thereafter to
    advocate such claims or defenses.
      The certification is that there is (or likely will be)
    "evidentiary support" for the allegation, not that the party will
    prevail with respect to its contention regarding the fact. That
    summary judgment is rendered against a party does not necessarily
    mean, for purposes of this certification, that it had no
    evidentiary support for its position. On the other hand, if a party
    has evidence with respect to a contention that would suffice to
    defeat a motion for summary judgment based thereon, it would have
    sufficient "evidentiary support" for purposes of Rule 11.
      Denials of factual contentions involve somewhat different
    considerations. Often, of course, a denial is premised upon the
    existence of evidence contradicting the alleged fact. At other
    times a denial is permissible because, after an appropriate
    investigation, a party has no information concerning the matter or,
    indeed, has a reasonable basis for doubting the credibility of the
    only evidence relevant to the matter. A party should not deny an
    allegation it knows to be true; but it is not required, simply
    because it lacks contradictory evidence, to admit an allegation
    that it believes is not true.
      The changes in subdivisions (b)(3) and (b)(4) will serve to
    equalize the burden of the rule upon plaintiffs and defendants, who
    under Rule 8(b) are in effect allowed to deny allegations by
    stating that from their initial investigation they lack sufficient
    information to form a belief as to the truth of the allegation. If,
    after further investigation or discovery, a denial is no longer
    warranted, the defendant should not continue to insist on that
    denial. While sometimes helpful, formal amendment of the pleadings
    to withdraw an allegation or denial is not required by subdivision
    (b).
      Arguments for extensions, modifications, or reversals of existing
    law or for creation of new law do not violate subdivision (b)(2)
    provided they are "nonfrivolous." This establishes an objective
    standard, intended to eliminate any "empty-head pure-heart"
    justification for patently frivolous arguments. However, the extent
    to which a litigant has researched the issues and found some
    support for its theories even in minority opinions, in law review
    articles, or through consultation with other attorneys should
    certainly be taken into account in determining whether paragraph
    (2) has been violated. Although arguments for a change of law are
    not required to be specifically so identified, a contention that is
    so identified should be viewed with greater tolerance under the
    rule.
      The court has available a variety of possible sanctions to impose
    for violations, such as striking the offending paper; issuing an
    admonition, reprimand, or censure; requiring participation in
    seminars or other educational programs; ordering a fine payable to
    the court; referring the matter to disciplinary authorities (or, in
    the case of government attorneys, to the Attorney General,
    Inspector General, or agency head), etc. See Manual for Complex
    Litigation, Second, Sec. 42.3. The rule does not attempt to
    enumerate the factors a court should consider in deciding whether
    to impose a sanction or what sanctions would be appropriate in the
    circumstances; but, for emphasis, it does specifically note that a
    sanction may be nonmonetary as well as monetary. Whether the
    improper conduct was willful, or negligent; whether it was part of
    a pattern of activity, or an isolated event; whether it infected
    the entire pleading, or only one particular count or defense;
    whether the person has engaged in similar conduct in other
    litigation; whether it was intended to injure; what effect it had
    on the litigation process in time or expense; whether the
    responsible person is trained in the law; what amount, given the
    financial resources of the responsible person, is needed to deter
    that person from repetition in the same case; what amount is needed
    to deter similar activity by other litigants: all of these may in a
    particular case be proper considerations. The court has significant
    discretion in determining what sanctions, if any, should be imposed
    for a violation, subject to the principle that the sanctions should
    not be more severe than reasonably necessary to deter repetition of
    the conduct by the offending person or comparable conduct by
    similarly situated persons.
      Since the purpose of Rule 11 sanctions is to deter rather than to
    compensate, the rule provides that, if a monetary sanction is
    imposed, it should ordinarily be paid into court as a penalty.
    However, under unusual circumstances, particularly for
    [subdivision] (b)(1) violations, deterrence may be ineffective
    unless the sanction not only requires the person violating the rule
    to make a monetary payment, but also directs that some or all of
    this payment be made to those injured by the violation.
    Accordingly, the rule authorizes the court, if requested in a
    motion and if so warranted, to award attorney's fees to another
    party. Any such award to another party, however, should not exceed
    the expenses and attorneys' fees for the services directly and
    unavoidably caused by the violation of the certification
    requirement. If, for example, a wholly unsupportable count were
    included in a multi-count complaint or counterclaim for the purpose
    of needlessly increasing the cost of litigation to an impecunious
    adversary, any award of expenses should be limited to those
    directly caused by inclusion of the improper count, and not those
    resulting from the filing of the complaint or answer itself. The
    award should not provide compensation for services that could have
    been avoided by an earlier disclosure of evidence or an earlier
    challenge to the groundless claims or defenses. Moreover, partial
    reimbursement of fees may constitute a sufficient deterrent with
    respect to violations by persons having modest financial resources.
    In cases brought under statutes providing for fees to be awarded to
    prevailing parties, the court should not employ cost-shifting under
    this rule in a manner that would be inconsistent with the standards
    that govern the statutory award of fees, such as stated in
    Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412 (1978).
      The sanction should be imposed on the persons - whether
    attorneys, law firms, or parties - who have violated the rule or
    who may be determined to be responsible for the violation. The
    person signing, filing, submitting, or advocating a document has a
    nondelegable responsibility to the court, and in most situations is
    the person to be sanctioned for a violation. Absent exceptional
    circumstances, a law firm is to be held also responsible when, as a
    result of a motion under subdivision (c)(1)(A), one of its
    partners, associates, or employees is determined to have violated
    the rule. Since such a motion may be filed only if the offending
    paper is not withdrawn or corrected within 21 days after service of
    the motion, it is appropriate that the law firm ordinarily be
    viewed as jointly responsible under established principles of
    agency. This provision is designed to remove the restrictions of
    the former rule. Cf. Pavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Entertainment
    Group, 493 U.S. 120 (1989) (1983 version of Rule 11 does not permit
    sanctions against law firm of attorney signing groundless
    complaint).
      The revision permits the court to consider whether other
    attorneys in the firm, co-counsel, other law firms, or the party
    itself should be held accountable for their part in causing a
    violation. When appropriate, the court can make an additional
    inquiry in order to determine whether the sanction should be
    imposed on such persons, firms, or parties either in addition to
    or, in unusual circumstances, instead of the person actually making
    the presentation to the court. For example, such an inquiry may be
    appropriate in cases involving governmental agencies or other
    institutional parties that frequently impose substantial
    restrictions on the discretion of individual attorneys employed by
    it.
      Sanctions that involve monetary awards (such as a fine or an
    award of attorney's fees) may not be imposed on a represented party
    for causing a violation of subdivision (b)(2), involving frivolous
    contentions of law. Monetary responsibility for such violations is
    more properly placed solely on the party's attorneys. With this
    limitation, the rule should not be subject to attack under the
    Rules Enabling Act. See Willy v. Coastal Corp., __ U.S. __ (1992);
    Business Guides, Inc. v. Chromatic Communications Enter. Inc., __
    U.S. __ (1991). This restriction does not limit the court's power
    to impose sanctions or remedial orders that may have collateral
    financial consequences upon a party, such as dismissal of a claim,
    preclusion of a defense, or preparation of amended pleadings.
      Explicit provision is made for litigants to be provided notice of
    the alleged violation and an opportunity to respond before
    sanctions are imposed. Whether the matter should be decided solely
    on the basis of written submissions or should be scheduled for oral
    argument (or, indeed, for evidentiary presentation) will depend on
    the circumstances. If the court imposes a sanction, it must, unless
    waived, indicate its reasons in a written order or on the record;
    the court should not ordinarily have to explain its denial of a
    motion for sanctions. Whether a violation has occurred and what
    sanctions, if any, to impose for a violation are matters committed
    to the discretion of the trial court; accordingly, as under current
    law, the standard for appellate review of these decisions will be
    for abuse of discretion. See Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496
    U.S. 384 (1990) (noting, however, that an abuse would be
    established if the court based its ruling on an erroneous view of
    the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence).
      The revision leaves for resolution on a case-by-case basis,
    considering the particular circumstances involved, the question as
    to when a motion for violation of Rule 11 should be served and
    when, if filed, it should be decided. Ordinarily the motion should
    be served promptly after the inappropriate paper is filed, and, if
    delayed too long, may be viewed as untimely. In other
    circumstances, it should not be served until the other party has
    had a reasonable opportunity for discovery. Given the "safe harbor"
    provisions discussed below, a party cannot delay serving its Rule
    11 motion until conclusion of the case (or judicial rejection of
    the offending contention).
      Rule 11 motions should not be made or threatened for minor,
    inconsequential violations of the standards prescribed by
    subdivision (b). They should not be employed as a discovery device
    or to test the legal sufficiency or efficacy of allegations in the
    pleadings; other motions are available for those purposes. Nor
    should Rule 11 motions be prepared to emphasize the merits of a
    party's position, to exact an unjust settlement, to intimidate an
    adversary into withdrawing contentions that are fairly debatable,
    to increase the costs of litigation, to create a conflict of
    interest between attorney and client, or to seek disclosure of
    matters otherwise protected by the attorney-client privilege or the
    work-product doctrine. As under the prior rule, the court may defer
    its ruling (or its decision as to the identity of the persons to be
    sanctioned) until final resolution of the case in order to avoid
    immediate conflicts of interest and to reduce the disruption
    created if a disclosure of attorney-client communications is needed
    to determine whether a violation occurred or to identify the person
    responsible for the violation.
      The rule provides that requests for sanctions must be made as a
    separate motion, i.e., not simply included as an additional prayer
    for relief contained in another motion. The motion for sanctions is
    not, however, to be filed until at least 21 days (or such other
    period as the court may set) after being served. If, during this
    period, the alleged violation is corrected, as by withdrawing
    (whether formally or informally) some allegation or contention, the
    motion should not be filed with the court. These provisions are
    intended to provide a type of "safe harbor" against motions under
    Rule 11 in that a party will not be subject to sanctions on the
    basis of another party's motion unless, after receiving the motion,
    it refuses to withdraw that position or to acknowledge candidly
    that it does not currently have evidence to support a specified
    allegation. Under the former rule, parties were sometimes reluctant
    to abandon a questionable contention lest that be viewed as
    evidence of a violation of Rule 11; under the revision, the timely
    withdrawal of a contention will protect a party against a motion
    for sanctions.
      To stress the seriousness of a motion for sanctions and to define
    precisely the conduct claimed to violate the rule, the revision
    provides that the "safe harbor" period begins to run only upon
    service of the motion. In most cases, however, counsel should be
    expected to give informal notice to the other party, whether in
    person or by a telephone call or letter, of a potential violation
    before proceeding to prepare and serve a Rule 11 motion.
      As under former Rule 11, the filing of a motion for sanctions is
    itself subject to the requirements of the rule and can lead to
    sanctions. However, service of a cross motion under Rule 11 should
    rarely be needed since under the revision the court may award to
    the person who prevails on a motion under Rule 11 - whether the
    movant or the target of the motion - reasonable expenses, including
    attorney's fees, incurred in presenting or opposing the motion.
      The power of the court to act on its own initiative is retained,
    but with the condition that this be done through a show cause
    order. This procedure provides the person with notice and an
    opportunity to respond. The revision provides that a monetary
    sanction imposed after a court-initiated show cause order be
    limited to a penalty payable to the court and that it be imposed
    only if the show cause order is issued before any voluntary
    dismissal or an agreement of the parties to settle the claims made
    by or against the litigant. Parties settling a case should not be
    subsequently faced with an unexpected order from the court leading
    to monetary sanctions that might have affected their willingness to
    settle or voluntarily dismiss a case. Since show cause orders will
    ordinarily be issued only in situations that are akin to a contempt
    of court, the rule does not provide a "safe harbor" to a litigant
    for withdrawing a claim, defense, etc., after a show cause order
    has been issued on the court's own initiative. Such corrective
    action, however, should be taken into account in deciding what - if
    any - sanction to impose if, after consideration of the litigant's
    response, the court concludes that a violation has occurred.
      Subdivision (d). Rules 26(g) and 37 establish certification
    standards and sanctions that apply to discovery disclosures,
    requests, responses, objections, and motions. It is appropriate
    that Rules 26 through 37, which are specially designed for the
    discovery process, govern such documents and conduct rather than
    the more general provisions of Rule 11. Subdivision (d) has been
    added to accomplish this result.
      Rule 11 is not the exclusive source for control of improper
    presentations of claims, defenses, or contentions. It does not
    supplant statutes permitting awards of attorney's fees to
    prevailing parties or alter the principles governing such awards.
    It does not inhibit the court in punishing for contempt, in
    exercising its inherent powers, or in imposing sanctions, awarding
    expenses, or directing remedial action authorized under other rules
    or under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1927. See Chambers v. NASCO, __ U.S. __
    (1991). Chambers cautions, however, against reliance upon inherent
    powers if appropriate sanctions can be imposed under provisions
    such as Rule 11, and the procedures specified in Rule 11 - notice,
    opportunity to respond, and findings - should ordinarily be
    employed when imposing a sanction under the court's inherent
    powers. Finally, it should be noted that Rule 11 does not preclude
    a party from initiating an independent action for malicious
    prosecution or abuse of process.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 11 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

          (A) A defendant must serve an answer:
            (i) within 21 days after being served with the summons and
          complaint; or
            (ii) if it has timely waived service under Rule 4(d),
          within 60 days after the request for a waiver was sent, or
          within 90 days after it was sent to the defendant outside any
          judicial district of the United States.

          (B) A party must serve an answer to a counterclaim or
        crossclaim within 21 days after being served with the pleading
        that states the counterclaim or crossclaim.
          (C) A party must serve a reply to an answer within 21 days
        after being served with an order to reply, unless the order
        specifies a different time.

        (2) United States and Its Agencies, Officers, or Employees Sued
      in an Official Capacity. The United States, a United States
      agency, or a United States officer or employee sued only in an
      official capacity must serve an answer to a complaint,
      counterclaim, or crossclaim within 60 days after service on the
      United States attorney.
        (3) United States Officers or Employees Sued in an Individual
      Capacity. A United States officer or employee sued in an
      individual capacity for an act or omission occurring in
      connection with duties performed on the United States' behalf
      must serve an answer to a complaint, counterclaim, or crossclaim
      within 60 days after service on the officer or employee or
      service on the United States attorney, whichever is later.
        (4) Effect of a Motion. Unless the court sets a different time,
      serving a motion under this rule alters these periods as follows:
          (A) if the court denies the motion or postpones its
        disposition until trial, the responsive pleading must be served
        within 14 days after notice of the court's action; or
          (B) if the court grants a motion for a more definite
        statement, the responsive pleading must be served within 14
        days after the more definite statement is served.

      (b) How to Present Defenses. Every defense to a claim for relief
    in any pleading must be asserted in the responsive pleading if one
    is required. But a party may assert the following defenses by
    motion:
        (1) lack of subject-matter jurisdiction;
        (2) lack of personal jurisdiction;
        (3) improper venue;
        (4) insufficient process;
        (5) insufficient service of process;
        (6) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted;
      and
        (7) failure to join a party under Rule 19.

      A motion asserting any of these defenses must be made before
      pleading if a responsive pleading is allowed. If a pleading sets
      out a claim for relief that does not require a responsive
      pleading, an opposing party may assert at trial any defense to
      that claim. No defense or objection is waived by joining it with
      one or more other defenses or objections in a responsive pleading
      or in a motion.

      (c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. After the pleadings are
    closed - but early enough not to delay trial - a party may move for
    judgment on the pleadings.
      (d) Result of Presenting Matters Outside the Pleadings. If, on a
    motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings
    are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be
    treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56. All parties must
    be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that
    is pertinent to the motion.
      (e) Motion for a More Definite Statement. A party may move for a
    more definite statement of a pleading to which a responsive
    pleading is allowed but which is so vague or ambiguous that the
    party cannot reasonably prepare a response. The motion must be made
    before filing a responsive pleading and must point out the defects
    complained of and the details desired. If the court orders a more
    definite statement and the order is not obeyed within 14 days after
    notice of the order or within the time the court sets, the court
    may strike the pleading or issue any other appropriate order.
      (f) Motion to Strike. The court may strike from a pleading an
    insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or
    scandalous matter. The court may act:
        (1) on its own; or
        (2) on motion made by a party either before responding to the
      pleading or, if a response is not allowed, within 21 days after
      being served with the pleading.

      (g) Joining Motions.
        (1) Right to Join. A motion under this rule may be joined with
      any other motion allowed by this rule.
        (2) Limitation on Further Motions. Except as provided in Rule
      12(h)(2) or (3), a party that makes a motion under this rule must
      not make another motion under this rule raising a defense or
      objection that was available to the party but omitted from its
      earlier motion.

      (h) Waiving and Preserving Certain Defenses.
        (1) When Some Are Waived. A party waives any defense listed in
      Rule 12(b)(2)-(5) by:
          (A) omitting it from a motion in the circumstances described
        in Rule 12(g)(2); or
          (B) failing to either:
            (i) make it by motion under this rule; or
            (ii) include it in a responsive pleading or in an amendment
          allowed by Rule 15(a)(1) as a matter of course.

        (2) When to Raise Others. Failure to state a claim upon which
      relief can be granted, to join a person required by Rule 19(b),
      or to state a legal defense to a claim may be raised:
          (A) in any pleading allowed or ordered under Rule 7(a);
          (B) by a motion under Rule 12(c); or
          (C) at trial.

        (3) Lack of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction. If the court
      determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction,
      the court must dismiss the action.

      (i) Hearing Before Trial. If a party so moves, any defense listed
    in Rule 12(b)(1)-(7) - whether made in a pleading or by motion -
    and a motion under Rule 12(c) must be heard and decided before
    trial unless the court orders a deferral until trial.

      2. U.S.C., Title 28, Sec. 763 [now 547] (Petition in action
    against United States; service; appearance by district attorney)
    provides that the United States as a defendant shall have 60 days
    within which to answer or otherwise defend. This and other statutes
    which provide 60 days for the United States or an officer or agency
    thereof to answer or otherwise defend are continued by this rule.
    Insofar as any statutes not excepted in Rule 81 provide a different
    time for a defendant to defend, such statutes are modified. See
    U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Sec. 45 (District courts; practice and
    procedure in certain cases under the interstate commerce laws) (30
    days).
      3. Compare the last sentence of [former] Equity Rule 29 (Defenses
    - How Presented) and N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) Sec. 283. See Rule 15(a) for
    time within which to plead to an amended pleading.

      2. For provisions authorizing defenses to be made in the answer
    or reply see English Rules Under the Judicature Act (The Annual
    Practice, 1937) O. 25, r.r. 1-4; 1 Miss.Code Ann. (1930) Secs. 378,
    379. Compare [former] Equity Rule 29 (Defenses - How Presented);
    U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Sec. 45 (District Courts; practice and
    procedure in certain cases under the interstate commerce laws).
    U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Sec. 45, substantially continued by this
    rule, provides: "No replication need be filed to the answer, and
    objections to the sufficiency of the petition or answer as not
    setting forth a cause of action or defense must be taken at the
    final hearing or by motion to dismiss the petition based on said
    grounds, which motion may be made at any time before answer is
    filed." Compare Calif.Code Civ.Proc. (Deering, 1937) Sec. 433; 4
    Nev.Comp.Laws (Hillyer, 1929) Sec. 8600. For provisions that the
    defendant may demur and answer at the same time, see Calif.Code
    Civ.Proc. (Deering, 1937) Sec. 431; 4 Nev.Comp.Laws (Hillyer, 1929)
    Sec. 8598.
      3. [Former] Equity Rule 29 (Defenses - How Presented) abolished
    demurrers and provided that defenses in point of law arising on the
    face of the bill should be made by motion to dismiss or in the
    answer, with further provision that every such point of law going
    to the whole or material part of the cause or causes stated might
    be called up and disposed of before final hearing "at the
    discretion of the court." Likewise many state practices have
    abolished the demurrer, or retain it only to attack substantial and
    not formal defects. See 6 Tenn.Code Ann. (Williams, 1934) Sec.
    8784; Ala.Code Ann. (Michie, 1928) Sec. 9479; 2 Mass.Gen.Laws

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). Various minor alterations in language have been
    made to improve the statement of the rule. All references to bills
    of particulars have been stricken in accordance with changes made
    in subdivision (e).
      Subdivision (b). The addition of defense (7), "failure to join an
    indispensable party", cures an omission in the rules, which are
    silent as to the mode of raising such failure. See Commentary,
    Manner of Raising Objection of Non-Joinder of Indispensable Party
    (1940) 2 Fed.Rules Serv. 658 and (1942) 5 Fed.Rules Serv. 820. In
    one case, United States v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (E.D.Pa.
    1941) 36 F.Supp. 399, the failure to join an indispensable party
    was raised under Rule 12(c).
      Rule 12(b)(6), permitting a motion to dismiss for failure of the
    complaint to state a claim on which relief can be granted, is
    substantially the same as the old demurrer for failure of a
    pleading to state a cause of action. Some courts have held that as
    the rule by its terms refers to statements in the complaint,
    extraneous matter on affidavits, depositions or otherwise, may not
    be introduced in support of the motion, or to resist it. On the
    other hand, in many cases the district courts have permitted the
    introduction of such material. When these cases have reached
    circuit courts of appeals in situations where the extraneous
    material so received shows that there is no genuine issue as to any
    material question of fact and that on the undisputed facts as
    disclosed by the affidavits or depositions, one party or the other
    is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the circuit courts,
    properly enough, have been reluctant to dispose of the case merely
    on the face of the pleading, and in the interest of prompt
    disposition of the action have made a final disposition of it. In
    dealing with such situations the Second Circuit has made the sound
    suggestion that whatever its label or original basis, the motion
    may be treated as a motion for summary judgment and disposed of as
    such. Samara v. United States (C.C.A.2d, 1942) 129 F.(2d) 594,
    cert. den. (1942) 317 U.S. 686; Boro Hall Corp. v. General Motors
    Corp. (C.C.A.2d, 1942) 124 F.(2d) 822, cert. den. (1943) 317 U.S.
    695. See also Kithcart v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (C.C.A.8th,
    1945) 150 F.(2d) 997, aff'g 62 F.Supp. 93.
      It has also been suggested that this practice could be justified
    on the ground that the federal rules permit "speaking" motions. The
    Committee entertains the view that on motion under Rule 12(b)(6) to
    dismiss for failure of the complaint to state a good claim, the
    trial court should have authority to permit the introduction of
    extraneous matter, such as may be offered on a motion for summary
    judgment, and if it does not exclude such matter the motion should
    then be treated as a motion for summary judgment and disposed of in
    the manner and on the conditions stated in Rule 56 relating to
    summary judgments, and, of course, in such a situation, when the
    case reaches the circuit court of appeals, that court should treat
    the motion in the same way. The Committee believes that such
    practice, however, should be tied to the summary judgment rule. The
    term "speaking motion" is not mentioned in the rules, and if there
    is such a thing its limitations are undefined. Where extraneous
    matter is received, by tying further proceedings to the summary
    judgment rule the courts have a definite basis in the rules for
    disposing of the motion.
      The Committee emphasizes particularly the fact that the summary
    judgment rule does not permit a case to be disposed of by judgment
    on the merits on affidavits, which disclose a conflict on a
    material issue of fact, and unless this practice is tied to the
    summary judgment rule, the extent to which a court, on the
    introduction of such extraneous matter, may resolve questions of
    fact on conflicting proof would be left uncertain.
      The decisions dealing with this general situation may be
    generally grouped as follows: (1) cases dealing with the use of
    affidavits and other extraneous material on motions; (2) cases
    reversing judgments to prevent final determination on mere pleading
    allegations alone.
      Under group (1) are: Boro Hall Corp. v. General Motors Corp.

    Assurance Society of Montgomery, Ala. (1943) 320 U.S. 238.
      The addition at the end of subdivision (b) makes it clear that on
    a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) extraneous material may not be
    considered if the court excludes it, but that if the court does not
    exclude such material the motion shall be treated as a motion for
    summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56. It will
    also be observed that if a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) is thus
    converted into a summary judgment motion, the amendment insures
    that both parties shall be given a reasonable opportunity to submit
    affidavits and extraneous proofs to avoid taking a party by
    surprise through the conversion of the motion into a motion for
    summary judgment. In this manner and to this extent the amendment
    regularizes the practice above described. As the courts are already
    dealing with cases in this way, the effect of this amendment is
    really only to define the practice carefully and apply the
    requirements of the summary judgment rule in the disposition of the
    motion.
      Subdivision (c). The sentence appended to subdivision (c)
    performs the same function and is grounded on the same reasons as
    the corresponding sentence added in subdivision (b).
      Subdivision (d). The change here was made necessary because of
    the addition of defense (7) in subdivision (b).
      Subdivision (e). References in this subdivision to a bill of
    particulars have been deleted, and the motion provided for is
    confined to one for a more definite statement, to be obtained only
    in cases where the movant cannot reasonably be required to frame an
    answer or other responsive pleading to the pleading in question.
    With respect to preparations for trial, the party is properly
    relegated to the various methods of examination and discovery
    provided in the rules for that purpose. Slusher v. Jones (E.D.Ky.

    8 Fed.Rules Serv. 12e.231, Case 1 (". . . most courts . . .
    conclude that the definiteness required is only such as will be
    sufficient for the party to prepare responsive pleadings").
    Accordingly, the reference to the 20 day time limit has also been
    eliminated, since the purpose of this present provision is to state
    a time period where the motion for a bill is made for the purpose
    of preparing for trial.
      Rule 12(e) as originally drawn has been the subject of more
    judicial rulings than any other part of the rules, and has been
    much criticized by commentators, judges and members of the bar. See
    general discussion and cases cited in 1 Moore's Federal Practice
    (1938), Cum.Supplement Sec. 12.07, under "Page 657"; also,
    Holtzoff, New Federal Procedure and the Courts (1940) 35-41. And
    compare vote of Second Circuit Conference of Circuit and District
    Judges (June 1940) recommending the abolition of the bill of
    particulars; Sun Valley Mfg. Co. v. Mylish (E.D.Pa. 1944) 8
    Fed.Rules Serv. 12e.231, Case 6 ("Our experience . . . has
    demonstrated not only that 'the office of the bill of particulars
    is fast becoming obsolete' . . . but that in view of the adequate
    discovery procedure available under the Rules, motions for bills of
    particulars should be abolished altogether."); Walling v. American
    Steamship Co. (W.D.N.Y. 1945) 4 F.R.D. 355, 8 Fed.Rules Serv.
    12e.244, Case 8 (". . . the adoption of the rule was ill advised.
    It has led to confusion, duplication and delay.") The tendency of
    some courts freely to grant extended bills of particulars has
    served to neutralize any helpful benefits derived from Rule 8, and
    has overlooked the intended use of the rules on depositions and
    discovery. The words "or to prepare for trial" - eliminated by the
    proposed amendment - have sometimes been seized upon as grounds for
    compulsory statement in the opposing pleading of all the details
    which the movant would have to meet at the trial. On the other
    hand, many courts have in effect read these words out of the rule.

    courts have never favored that portion of the rules which undertook
    to justify a motion of this kind for the purpose of aiding counsel
    in preparing his case for trial.").
      Subdivision (f). This amendment affords a specific method of
    raising the insufficiency of a defense, a matter which has troubled
    some courts, although attack has been permitted in one way or
    another. See Dysart v. Remington-Rand, Inc. (D.Conn. 1939) 31

      Subdivision (g). The change in title conforms with the companion
    provision in subdivision (h).
      The alteration of the "except" clause requires that other than
    provided in subdivision (h) a party who resorts to a motion to
    raise defenses specified in the rule, must include in one motion
    all that are then available to him. Under the original rule
    defenses which could be raised by motion were divided into two
    groups which could be the subjects of two successive motions.
      Subdivision (h). The addition of the phrase relating to
    indispensable parties is one of necessity.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      This amendment conforms to the amendment of Rule 4(e). See also
    the Advisory Committee's Note to amended Rule 4(b).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b)(7). The terminology of this subdivision is
    changed to accord with the amendment of Rule 19. See the Advisory
    Committee's Note to Rule 19, as amended, especially the third
    paragraph therein before the caption "Subdivision (c)."
      Subdivision (g). Subdivision (g) has forbidden a defendant who
    makes a preanswer motion under this rule from making a further
    motion presenting any defense or objection which was available to
    him at the time he made the first motion and which he could have
    included, but did not in fact include therein. Thus if the
    defendant moves before answer to dismiss the complaint for failure
    to state a claim, he is barred from making a further motion
    presenting the defense of improper venue, if that defense was
    available to him when he made his original motion. Amended
    subdivision (g) is to the same effect. This required consolidation
    of defenses and objections in a Rule 12 motion is salutary in that
    it works against piecemeal consideration of a case. For exceptions
    to the requirement of consolidation, see the last clause of
    subdivision (g), referring to new subdivision (h)(2).
      Subdivision (h). The question has arisen whether an omitted
    defense which cannot be made the basis of a second motion may
    nevertheless be pleaded in the answer. Subdivision (h) called for
    waiver of "* * * defenses and objections which he [defendant] does
    not present * * * by motion * * * or, if he has made no motion, in
    his answer * * *." If the clause "if he has made no motion," was
    read literally, it seemed that the omitted defense was waived and
    could not be pleaded in the answer. On the other hand, the clause
    might be read as adding nothing of substance to the preceding
    words; in that event it appeared that a defense was not waived by
    reason of being omitted from the motion and might be set up in the
    answer. The decisions were divided. Favoring waiver, see Keefe v.
    Derounian, 6 F.R.D. 11 (N.D.Ill. 1946); Elbinger v. Precision Metal
    Workers Corp., 18 F.R.D. 467 (E.D.Wis. 1956); see also Rensing v.
    Turner Aviation Corp., 166 F.Supp. 790 (N.D.Ill. 1958); P.
    Beiersdorf & Co. v. Duke Laboratories, Inc., 10 F.R.D. 282
    (S.D.N.Y. 1950); Neset v. Christensen, 92 F.Supp. 78 (E.D.N.Y.
    1950). Opposing waiver, see Phillips v. Baker, 121 F.2d 752 (9th
    Cir. 1941); Crum v. Graham, 32 F.R.D. 173 (D.Mont. 1963)
    (regretfully following the Phillips case); see also Birnbaum v.
    Birrell, 9 F.R.D. 72 (S.D.N.Y. 1948); Johnson v. Joseph Schlitz
    Brewing Co., 33 F.Supp. 176 (E.D.Tenn. 1940); cf. Carter v.
    American Bus Lines, Inc., 22 F.R.D. 323 (D.Neb. 1958).
      Amended subdivision (h)(1)(A) eliminates the ambiguity and states
    that certain specified defenses which were available to a party
    when he made a preanswer motion, but which he omitted from the
    motion, are waived. The specified defenses are lack of jurisdiction
    over the person, improper venue, insufficiency of process, and
    insufficiency of service of process (see Rule 12(b)(2)-(5)). A
    party who by motion invites the court to pass upon a threshold
    defense should bring forward all the specified defenses he then has
    and thus allow the court to do a reasonably complete job. The
    waiver reinforces the policy of subdivision (g) forbidding
    successive motions.
      By amended subdivision (h)(1)(B), the specified defenses, even if
    not waived by the operation of (A), are waived by the failure to
    raise them by a motion under Rule 12 or in the responsive pleading
    or any amendment thereof to which the party is entitled as a matter
    of course. The specified defenses are of such a character that they
    should not be delayed and brought up for the first time by means of
    an application to the court to amend the responsive pleading.
      Since the language of the subdivisions is made clear, the party
    is put on fair notice of the effect of his actions and omissions
    and can guard himself against unintended waiver. It is to be noted
    that while the defenses specified in subdivision (h)(1) are subject
    to waiver as there provided, the more substantial defenses of
    failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, failure
    to join a party indispensable under Rule 19, and failure to state a
    legal defense to a claim (see Rule 12(b)(6), (7), (f)), as well as
    the defense of lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter (see
    Rule 12(b)(1)), are expressly preserved against waiver by amended
    subdivision (h)(2) and (3).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is divided into paragraphs for greater clarity,
    and paragraph (1)(B) is added to reflect amendments to Rule 4.
    Consistent with Rule 4(d)(3), a defendant that timely waives
    service is allowed 60 days from the date the request was mailed in
    which to respond to the complaint, with an additional 30 days
    afforded if the request was sent out of the country. Service is
    timely waived if the waiver is returned within the time specified
    in the request (30 days after the request was mailed, or 60 days if
    mailed out of the country) and before being formally served with
    process. Sometimes a plaintiff may attempt to serve a defendant
    with process while also sending the defendant a request for waiver
    of service; if the defendant executes the waiver of service within
    the time specified and before being served with process, it should
    have the longer time to respond afforded by waiving service.
      The date of sending the request is to be inserted by the
    plaintiff on the face of the request for waiver and on the waiver
    itself. This date is used to measure the return day for the waiver
    form, so that the plaintiff can know on a day certain whether
    formal service of process will be necessary; it is also a useful
    date to measure the time for answer when service is waived. The
    defendant who returns the waiver is given additional time for
    answer in order to assure that it loses nothing by waiving service
    of process.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 12(a)(3)(B) is added to complement the addition of Rule
    4(i)(2)(B). The purposes that underlie the requirement that service
    be made on the United States in an action that asserts individual
    liability of a United States officer or employee for acts occurring
    in connection with the performance of duties on behalf of the
    United States also require that the time to answer be extended to
    60 days. Time is needed for the United States to determine whether
    to provide representation to the defendant officer or employee. If
    the United States provides representation, the need for an extended
    answer period is the same as in actions against the United States,
    a United States agency, or a United States officer sued in an
    official capacity.
      An action against a former officer or employee of the United
    States is covered by subparagraph (3)(B) in the same way as an
    action against a present officer or employee. Termination of the
    relationship between the individual defendant and the United States
    does not reduce the need for additional time to answer.
      GAP Report. No changes are recommended for Rule 12 as published.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 12 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Former Rule 12(a)(4)(A) referred to an order that postpones
    disposition of a motion "until the trial on the merits." Rule
    12(a)(4) now refers to postponing disposition "until trial." The
    new expression avoids the ambiguity that inheres in "trial on the
    merits," which may become confusing when there is a separate trial
    of a single issue or another event different from a single all-
    encompassing trial.

    revised to 14 or 21 days. See the Note to Rule 6.

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE III. PLEADINGS AND MOTIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 13. Counterclaim and Crossclaim

-STATUTE-
      (a) Compulsory Counterclaim.
        (1) In General. A pleading must state as a counterclaim any
      claim that - at the time of its service - the pleader has against
      an opposing party if the claim:
          (A) arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the
        subject matter of the opposing party's claim; and
          (B) does not require adding another party over whom the court
        cannot acquire jurisdiction.

        (2) Exceptions. The pleader need not state the claim if:
          (A) when the action was commenced, the claim was the subject
        of another pending action; or
          (B) the opposing party sued on its claim by attachment or
        other process that did not establish personal jurisdiction over
        the pleader on that claim, and the pleader does not assert any
        counterclaim under this rule.

      (b) Permissive Counterclaim. A pleading may state as a
    counterclaim against an opposing party any claim that is not
    compulsory.
      (c) Relief Sought in a Counterclaim. A counterclaim need not
    diminish or defeat the recovery sought by the opposing party. It
    may request relief that exceeds in amount or differs in kind from
    the relief sought by the opposing party.
      (d) Counterclaim Against the United States. These rules do not
    expand the right to assert a counterclaim - or to claim a credit -
    against the United States or a United States officer or agency.
      (e) Counterclaim Maturing or Acquired After Pleading. The court
    may permit a party to file a supplemental pleading asserting a
    counterclaim that matured or was acquired by the party after
    serving an earlier pleading.
      (f) [Abrogated.]
      (g) Crossclaim Against a Coparty. A pleading may state as a
    crossclaim any claim by one party against a coparty if the claim
    arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject
    matter of the original action or of a counterclaim, or if the claim
    relates to any property that is the subject matter of the original
    action. The crossclaim may include a claim that the coparty is or
    may be liable to the crossclaimant for all or part of a claim
    asserted in the action against the crossclaimant.
      (h) Joining Additional Parties. Rules 19 and 20 govern the
    addition of a person as a party to a counterclaim or crossclaim.
      (i) Separate Trials; Separate Judgments. If the court orders
    separate trials under Rule 42(b), it may enter judgment on a
    counterclaim or crossclaim under Rule 54(b) when it has
    jurisdiction to do so, even if the opposing party's claims have
    been dismissed or otherwise resolved.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      1. This is substantially [former] Equity Rule 30 (Answer -
    Contents - Counterclaim), broadened to include legal as well as
    equitable counterclaims.
      2. Compare the English practice, English Rules Under the
    Judicature Act (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 19, r.r. 2 and 3, and
    O. 21, r.r. 10 - 17; Beddall v. Maitland, L.R. 17 Ch.Div. 174, 181,
    182 (1881).
      3. Certain States have also adopted almost unrestricted
    provisions concerning both the subject matter of and the parties to
    a counterclaim. This seems to be the modern tendency. Ark.Civ.Code
    (Crawford, 1934) Secs. 117 (as amended) and 118; N.J.Comp.Stat. (2
    Cum.Supp. 1911-1924), N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) Secs. 262, 266, 267 (all as
    amended, Laws of 1936, ch. 324), 268, 269, and 271; Wis.Stat.
    (1935) Sec. 263.14 (1)(c).
      4. Most codes do not expressly provide for a counterclaim in the
    reply. Clark, Code Pleading (1928), p. 486. Ky.Codes (Carroll,
    1932) Civ.Pract. Sec. 98 does provide, however, for such
    counterclaim.
      5. The provisions of this rule respecting counterclaims are
    subject to Rule 82 (Jurisdiction and Venue Unaffected). For a
    discussion of Federal jurisdiction and venue in regard to
    counterclaims and cross-claims, see Shulman and Jaegerman, Some
    Jurisdictional Limitations in Federal Procedure (1936), 45 Yale
    L.J. 393, 410 et seq.
      6. This rule does not affect such statutes of the United States
    as U.S.C., Title 28, Sec. 41(1) [now 1332, 1345, 1359] (United
    States as plaintiff; civil suits at common law and in equity),
    relating to assigned claims in actions based on diversity of
    citizenship.
      7. If the action proceeds to judgment without the interposition
    of a counterclaim as required by subdivision (a) of this rule, the
    counterclaim is barred. See American Mills Co. v. American Surety
    Co., 260 U.S. 360 (1922); Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. v.
    National Electric Signalling Co., 206 Fed. 295 (E.D.N.Y., 1913);
    Hopkins, Federal Equity Rules (8th ed., 1933), p. 213; Simkins,
    Federal Practice (1934), p. 663
      8. For allowance of credits against the United States see U.S.C.,
    Title 26, Secs. 1672-1673 [see 7442] (Suits for refunds of internal
    revenue taxes - limitations); U.S.C., Title 28, Secs. 774 [now
    2406] (Suits by United States against individuals; credits),
    [former] 775 (Suits under postal laws; credits); U.S.C., Title 31,
    Sec. 227 [now 3728] (Offsets against judgments and claims against
    United States).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The use of the word "filing" was inadvertent.
    The word "serving" conforms with subdivision (e) and with usage
    generally throughout the rules.
      The removal of the phrase "not the subject of a pending action"
    and the addition of the new clause at the end of the subdivision is
    designed to eliminate the ambiguity noted in Prudential Insurance
    Co. of America v. Saxe (App.D.C. 1943) 134 F.(2d) 16, 33-34, cert.
    den. (1943) 319 U.S. 745. The rewording of the subdivision in this
    respect insures against an undesirable possibility presented under
    the original rule whereby a party having a claim which would be the
    subject of a compulsory counterclaim could avoid stating it as such
    by bringing an independent action in another court after the
    commencement of the federal action but before serving his pleading
    in the federal action.
      Subdivision (g). The amendment is to care for a situation such as
    where a second mortgagee is made defendant in a foreclosure
    proceeding and wishes to file a cross-complaint against the
    mortgagor in order to secure a personal judgment for the
    indebtedness and foreclose his lien. A claim of this sort by the
    second mortgagee may not necessarily arise out of the transaction
    or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action
    under the terms of Rule 13(g).
      Subdivision (h). The change clarifies the interdependence of
    Rules 13(i) and 54(b).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      When a defendant, if he desires to defend his interest in
    property, is obliged to come in and litigate in a court to whose
    jurisdiction he could not ordinarily be subjected, fairness
    suggests that he should not be required to assert counterclaims,
    but should rather be permitted to do so at his election. If,
    however, he does elect to assert a counterclaim, it seems fair to
    require him to assert any other which is compulsory within the
    meaning of Rule 13(a). Clause (2), added by amendment to Rule
    13(a), carries out this idea. It will apply to various cases
    described in Rule 4(e), as amended, where service is effected
    through attachment or other process by which the court does not
    acquire jurisdiction to render a personal judgment against the
    defendant. Clause (2) will also apply to actions commenced in State
    courts jurisdictionally grounded on attachment or the like, and
    removed to the Federal courts.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 13(h), dealing with the joinder of additional parties to a
    counterclaim or cross-claim, has partaken of some of the textual
    difficulties of Rule 19 on necessary joinder of parties. See
    Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 19, as amended; cf. 3 Moore's
    Federal Practice, Par. 13.39 (2d ed. 1963), and Supp. thereto; 1A
    Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 399 (Wright
    ed. 1960). Rule 13(h) has also been inadequate in failing to call
    attention to the fact that a party pleading a counterclaim or cross-
    claim may join additional persons when the conditions for
    permissive joinder of parties under Rule 20 are satisfied.
      The amendment of Rule 13(h) supplies the latter omission by
    expressly referring to Rule 20, as amended, and also incorporates
    by direct reference the revised criteria and procedures of Rule 19,
    as amended. Hereafter, for the purpose of determining who must or
    may be joined as additional parties to a counterclaim or cross-
    claim, the party pleading the claim is to be regarded as a
    plaintiff and the additional parties as plaintiffs or defendants as
    the case may be, and amended Rules 19 and 20 are to be applied in
    the usual fashion. See also Rules 13(a) (compulsory counterclaims)
    and 22 (interpleader).
      The amendment of Rule 13(h), like the amendment of Rule 19, does
    not attempt to regulate Federal jurisdiction or venue. See Rule 82.
    It should be noted, however, that in some situations the decisional
    law has recognized "ancillary" Federal jurisdiction over
    counterclaims and cross-claims and "ancillary" venue as to parties
    to these claims.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 13 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      The meaning of former Rule 13(b) is better expressed by deleting
    "not arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the
    subject matter of the opposing party's claim." Both as a matter of
    intended meaning and current practice, a party may state as a
    permissive counterclaim a claim that does grow out of the same
    transaction or occurrence as an opposing party's claim even though
    one of the exceptions in Rule 13(a) means the claim is not a
    compulsory counterclaim.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 13(f) is deleted as largely redundant and potentially
    misleading. An amendment to add a counterclaim will be governed by
    Rule 15. Rule 15(a)(1) permits some amendments to be made as a
    matter of course or with the opposing party's written consent. When
    the court's leave is required, the reasons described in Rule 13(f)
    for permitting amendment of a pleading to add an omitted
    counterclaim sound different from the general amendment standard in
    Rule 15(a)(2), but seem to be administered - as they should be -
    according to the same standard directing that leave should be
    freely given when justice so requires. The independent existence of
    Rule 13(f) has, however, created some uncertainty as to the
    availability of relation back of the amendment under Rule 15(c).
    See 6 C. Wright, A. Miller & M. Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure:
    Civil 2d, Sec. 1430 (1990). Deletion of Rule 13(f) ensures that
    relation back is governed by the tests that apply to all other
    pleading amendments.

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE III. PLEADINGS AND MOTIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 14. Third-Party Practice

-STATUTE-
      (a) When a Defending Party May Bring in a Third Party.
        (1) Timing of the Summons and Complaint. A defending party may,
      as third-party plaintiff, serve a summons and complaint on a
      nonparty who is or may be liable to it for all or part of the
      claim against it. But the third-party plaintiff must, by motion,
      obtain the court's leave if it files the third-party complaint
      more than 14 days after serving its original answer.
        (2) Third-Party Defendant's Claims and Defenses. The person
      served with the summons and third-party complaint - the "third-
      party defendant":
          (A) must assert any defense against the third-party
        plaintiff's claim under Rule 12;
          (B) must assert any counterclaim against the third-party
        plaintiff under Rule 13(a), and may assert any counterclaim
        against the third-party plaintiff under Rule 13(b) or any
        crossclaim against another third-party defendant under Rule
        13(g);
          (C) may assert against the plaintiff any defense that the
        third-party plaintiff has to the plaintiff's claim; and
          (D) may also assert against the plaintiff any claim arising
        out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter
        of the plaintiff's claim against the third-party plaintiff.

        (3) Plaintiff's Claims Against a Third-Party Defendant. The
      plaintiff may assert against the third-party defendant any claim
      arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject
      matter of the plaintiff's claim against the third-party
      plaintiff. The third-party defendant must then assert any defense
      under Rule 12 and any counterclaim under Rule 13(a), and may
      assert any counterclaim under Rule 13(b) or any crossclaim under
      Rule 13(g).
        (4) Motion to Strike, Sever, or Try Separately. Any party may
      move to strike the third-party claim, to sever it, or to try it
      separately.
        (5) Third-Party Defendant's Claim Against a Nonparty. A third-
      party defendant may proceed under this rule against a nonparty
      who is or may be liable to the third-party defendant for all or
      part of any claim against it.
        (6) Third-Party Complaint In Rem. If it is within the admiralty
      or maritime jurisdiction, a third-party complaint may be in rem.
      In that event, a reference in this rule to the "summons" includes
      the warrant of arrest, and a reference to the defendant or third-
      party plaintiff includes, when appropriate, a person who asserts
      a right under Supplemental Rule C(6)(a)(i) in the property
      arrested.

      (b) When a Plaintiff May Bring in a Third Party. When a claim is
    asserted against a plaintiff, the plaintiff may bring in a third
    party if this rule would allow a defendant to do so.
      (c) Admiralty or Maritime Claim.
        (1) Scope of Impleader. If a plaintiff asserts an admiralty or
      maritime claim under Rule 9(h), the defendant or a person who
      asserts a right under Supplemental Rule C(6)(a)(i) may, as a
      third-party plaintiff, bring in a third-party defendant who may
      be wholly or partly liable - either to the plaintiff or to the
      third-party plaintiff -  for remedy over, contribution, or
      otherwise on account of the same transaction, occurrence, or
      series of transactions or occurrences.
        (2) Defending Against a Demand for Judgment for the Plaintiff.
      The third-party plaintiff may demand judgment in the plaintiff's
      favor against the third-party defendant. In that event, the third-
      party defendant must defend under Rule 12 against the
      plaintiff's claim as well as the third-party plaintiff's claim;
      and the action proceeds as if the plaintiff had sued both the
      third-party defendant and the third-party plaintiff.

      Third-party impleader is in some aspects a modern innovation in
    law and equity although well known in admiralty. Because of its
    many advantages a liberal procedure with respect to it has
    developed in England, in the Federal admiralty courts, and in some
    American State jurisdictions. See English Rules Under the
    Judicature Act (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 16A, r.r. 1-13;
    United States Supreme Court Admiralty Rules (1920), Rule 56 (Right
    to Bring in Party Jointly Liable); Pa.Stat.Ann. (Purdon, 1936)
    Title 12, Sec. 141; Wis.Stat. (1935) Secs. 260.19, 260.20;
    N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) Secs. 193 (2), 211(a). Compare La.Code Pract.
    (Dart, 1932) Secs. 378-388. For the practice in Texas as developed
    by judicial decision, see Lottman v. Cuilla, 288 S.W. 123, 126
    (Tex., 1926). For a treatment of this subject see Gregory,
    Legislative Loss Distribution in Negligence Actions (1936); Shulman
    and Jaegerman, Some Jurisdictional Limitations on Federal Procedure
    (1936), 45 Yale L.J. 393, 417, et seq.
      Third-party impleader under the conformity act has been applied
    in actions at law in the Federal courts. Lowry and Co., Inc., v.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      The provisions in Rule 14(a) which relate to the impleading of a
    third party who is or may be liable to the plaintiff have been
    deleted by the proposed amendment. It has been held that under Rule
    14(a) the plaintiff need not amend his complaint to state a claim
    against such third party if he does not wish to do so. Satink v.
    Holland Township (D.N.J. 1940) 31 F.Supp. 229, noted (1940) 88

    (D.D.C. 1939) 26 F.Supp. 715; Carbola Chemical Co., Inc. v. Trundle

    Inc. v. Automobile Ins. Co. of Hartford, Conn. v. Providence
    Washington Ins. Co. (N.D.Ohio 1945) 8 Fed.Rules Serv. 14a.513, Case
    3. In Delano v. Ives (E.D.Pa. 1941) 40 F.Supp. 672, the court said:
    ". . . the weight of authority is to the effect that a defendant
    cannot compel the plaintiff, who has sued him, to sue also a third
    party whom he does not wish to sue, by tendering in a third party
    complaint the third party as an additional defendant directly
    liable to the plaintiff." Thus impleader here amounts to no more
    than a mere offer of a party to the plaintiff, and if he rejects
    it, the attempt is a time-consuming futility. See Satink v. Holland
    Township, supra; Malkin v. Arundel Corp. (D.Md. 1941) 36 F.Supp.
    948; also Koenigsberger, Suggestions for Changes in the Federal
    Rules of Civil Procedure, (1941) 4 Fed.Rules Serv. 1010. But cf.
    Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co.
    (M.D.Ga. 1943) 52 F.Supp. 177. Moreover, in any case where the
    plaintiff could not have joined the third party originally because
    of jurisdictional limitations such as lack of diversity of
    citizenship, the majority view is that any attempt by the plaintiff
    to amend his complaint and assert a claim against the impleaded
    third party would be unavailing. Hoskie v. Prudential Ins. Co. of
    America v. Lorrac Real Estate Corp. (E.D.N.Y. 1941) 39 F.Supp. 305;

    Chicago v. Maryland Casualty Co. (C.C.A.7th, 1942) 132 F.(2d) 850,
    853. Contra: Sklar v. Hayes v. Singer (E.D.Pa. 1941) 4 Fed.Rules
    Serv. 14a.511, Case 2, 1 F.R.D. 594. Discussion of the problem will
    be found in Commentary, Amendment of Plaintiff's Pleading to Assert
    Claim Against Third-Party Defendant (1942) 5 Fed.Rules Serv. 811;
    Commentary, Federal Jurisdiction in Third-Party Practice (1943) 6
    Fed.Rules Serv. 766; Holtzoff, Some Problems Under Federal Third-
    Party Practice (1941) 3 La.L.Rev. 408, 419-420; 1. Moore's Federal
    Practice (1938) Cum.Supplement Sec. 14.08. For these reasons
    therefore, the words "or to the plaintiff" in the first sentence of
    subdivision (a) have been removed by the amendment; and in
    conformance therewith the words "the plaintiff" in the second
    sentence of the subdivision, and the words "or to the third-party
    plaintiff" in the concluding sentence thereof have likewise been
    eliminated.
      The third sentence of Rule 14(a) has been expanded to clarify the
    right of the third-party defendant to assert any defenses which the
    third-party plaintiff may have to the plaintiff's claim. This
    protects the impleaded third-party defendant where the third-party
    plaintiff fails or neglects to assert a proper defense to the
    plaintiff's action. A new sentence has also been inserted giving
    the third-party defendant the right to assert directly against the
    original plaintiff any claim arising out of the transaction or
    occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim
    against the third-party plaintiff. This permits all claims arising
    out of the same transaction or occurrence to be heard and
    determined in the same action. See Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v.
    United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. (M.D.Ga. 1943) 52 F.Supp.
    177. Accordingly, the next to the last sentence of subdivision (a)
    has also been revised to make clear that the plaintiff may, if he
    desires, assert directly against the third-party defendant either
    by amendment or by a new pleading any claim he may have against him
    arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject
    matter of the plaintiff's claim against the third-party plaintiff.
    In such a case, the third-party defendant then is entitled to
    assert the defenses, counterclaims and cross-claims provided in
    Rules 12 and 13.
      The sentence reading "The third-party defendant is bound by the
    adjudication of the third-party plaintiff's liability to the
    plaintiff, as well as of his own to the plaintiff, or to the third-
    party plaintiff" has been stricken from Rule 14(a), not to change
    the law, but because the sentence states a rule of substantive law
    which is not within the scope of a procedural rule. It is not the
    purpose of the rules to state the effect of a judgment.
      The elimination of the words "the third-party plaintiff, or any
    other party" from the second sentence of Rule 14(a), together with
    the insertion of the new phrases therein, are not changes of
    substance but are merely for the purpose of clarification.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      Under the amendment of the initial sentences of the subdivision,
    a defendant as a third-party plaintiff may freely and without leave
    of court bring in a third-party defendant if he files the third-
    party complaint not later than 10 days after he serves his
    original answer. When the impleader comes so early in the case,
    there is little value in requiring a preliminary ruling by the
    court on the propriety of the impleader.
      After the third-party defendant is brought in, the court has
    discretion to strike the third-party claim if it is obviously
    unmeritorious and can only delay or prejudice the disposition of
    the plaintiff's claim, or to sever the third-party claim or accord
    it separate trial if confusion or prejudice would otherwise result.
    This discretion, applicable not merely to the cases covered by the
    amendment where the third-party defendant is brought in without
    leave, but to all impleaders under the rule, is emphasized in the
    next-to-last sentence of the subdivision, added by amendment.
      In dispensing with leave of court for an impleader filed not
    later than 10 days after serving the answer, but retaining the
    leave requirement for impleaders sought to be effected thereafter,
    the amended subdivision takes a moderate position on the lines
    urged by some commentators, see Note, 43 Minn.L.Rev. 115 (1958);
    cf. Pa.R.Civ.P. 2252-53 (60 days after service on the defendant);
    Minn.R.Civ.P. 14.01 (45 days). Other commentators would dispense
    with the requirement of leave regardless of the time when impleader
    is effected, and would rely on subsequent action by the court to
    dismiss the impleader if it would unduly delay or complicate the
    litigation or would be otherwise objectionable. See 1A Barron &
    Holtzoff, Federal Practice & Procedure 649-50 (Wright ed. 1960);
    Comment, 58 Colum.L.Rev. 532, 546 (1958); cf. N.Y.Civ.Prac. Act
    Sec. 193-a; Me.R.Civ.P. 14. The amended subdivision preserves the
    value of a preliminary screening, through the leave procedure, of
    impleaders attempted after the 10-day period.
      The amendment applies also when an impleader is initiated by a
    third-party defendant against a person who may be liable to him, as
    provided in the last sentence of the subdivision.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 14 was modeled on Admiralty Rule 56. An important feature of
    Admiralty Rule 56 was that it allowed impleader not only of a
    person who might be liable to the defendant by way of remedy over,
    but also of any person who might be liable to the plaintiff. The
    importance of this provision was that the defendant was entitled to
    insist that the plaintiff proceed to judgment against the third-
    party defendant. In certain cases this was a valuable
    implementation of a substantive right. For example, in a case of
    ship collision where a finding of mutual fault is possible, one
    ship- owner, if sued alone, faces the prospect of an absolute
    judgment for the full amount of the damage suffered by an innocent
    third party; but if he can implead the owner of the other vessel,
    and if mutual fault is found, the judgment against the original
    defendant will be in the first instance only for a moiety of the
    damages; liability for the remainder will be conditioned on the
    plaintiff's inability to collect from the third-party defendant.
      This feature was originally incorporated in Rule 14, but was
    eliminated by the amendment of 1946, so that under the amended rule
    a third party could not be impleaded on the basis that he might be
    liable to the plaintiff. One of the reasons for the amendment was
    that the Civil Rule, unlike the Admiralty Rule, did not require the
    plaintiff to go to judgment against the third-party defendant.
    Another reason was that where jurisdiction depended on diversity of
    citizenship the impleader of an adversary having the same
    citizenship as the plaintiff was not considered possible.
      Retention of the admiralty practice in those cases that will be
    counterparts of a suit in admiralty is clearly desirable.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivisions (a) and (c) are amended to reflect revisions in
    Supplemental Rule C(6).
      GAP Report. Rule B(1)(a) was modified by moving "in an in
    personam action" out of paragraph (a) and into the first line of
    subdivision (1). This change makes it clear that all paragraphs of
    subdivision (1) apply when attachment is sought in an in personam
    action. Rule B(1)(d) was modified by changing the requirement that
    the clerk deliver the summons and process to the person or
    organization authorized to serve it. The new form requires only
    that the summons and process be delivered, not that the clerk
    effect the delivery. This change conforms to present practice in
    some districts and will facilitate rapid service. It matches the
    spirit of Civil Rule 4(b), which directs the clerk to issue the
    summons "to the plaintiff for service on the defendant." A parallel
    change is made in Rule C(3)(b).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 14 is amended to conform to changes in designating the
    paragraphs of Supplemental Rule C(6).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 14 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Former Rule 14 twice refers to counterclaims under Rule 13. In
    each case, the operation of Rule 13(a) depends on the state of the
    action at the time the pleading is filed. If plaintiff and third-
    party defendant have become opposing parties because one has made
    a claim for relief against the other, Rule 13(a) requires assertion
    of any counterclaim that grows out of the transaction or occurrence
    that is the subject matter of that claim. Rules 14(a)(2)(B) and
    (a)(3) reflect the distinction between compulsory and permissive
    counterclaims.
      A plaintiff should be on equal footing with the defendant in
    making third-party claims, whether the claim against the plaintiff
    is asserted as a counterclaim or as another form of claim. The
    limit imposed by the former reference to "counterclaim" is deleted.

      The time set in the former rule at 10 days has been revised to 14
    days. See the Note to Rule 6.

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE III. PLEADINGS AND MOTIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 15. Amended and Supplemental Pleadings

-STATUTE-
      (a) Amendments Before Trial.
        (1) Amending as a Matter of Course. A party may amend its
      pleading once as a matter of course within:
          (A) 21 days after serving it, or
          (B) if the pleading is one to which a responsive pleading is
        required, 21 days after service of a responsive pleading or 21
        days after service of a motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f),
        whichever is earlier.

        (2) Other Amendments. In all other cases, a party may amend its
      pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or the
      court's leave. The court should freely give leave when justice so
      requires.
        (3) Time to Respond. Unless the court orders otherwise, any
      required response to an amended pleading must be made within the
      time remaining to respond to the original pleading or within 14
      days after service of the amended pleading, whichever is later.

      (b) Amendments During and After Trial.
        (1) Based on an Objection at Trial. If, at trial, a party
      objects that evidence is not within the issues raised in the
      pleadings, the court may permit the pleadings to be amended. The
      court should freely permit an amendment when doing so will aid in
      presenting the merits and the objecting party fails to satisfy
      the court that the evidence would prejudice that party's action
      or defense on the merits. The court may grant a continuance to
      enable the objecting party to meet the evidence.
        (2) For Issues Tried by Consent. When an issue not raised by
      the pleadings is tried by the parties' express or implied
      consent, it must be treated in all respects as if raised in the
      pleadings. A party may move - at any time, even after judgment -
      to amend the pleadings to conform them to the evidence and to
      raise an unpleaded issue. But failure to amend does not affect
      the result of the trial of that issue.

      (c) Relation Back of Amendments.
        (1) When an Amendment Relates Back. An amendment to a pleading
      relates back to the date of the original pleading when:
          (A) the law that provides the applicable statute of
        limitations allows relation back;
          (B) the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out
        of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out - or
        attempted to be set out - in the original pleading; or
          (C) the amendment changes the party or the naming of the
        party against whom a claim is asserted, if Rule 15(c)(1)(B) is
        satisfied and if, within the period provided by Rule 4(m) for
        serving the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in
        by amendment:
            (i) received such notice of the action that it will not be
          prejudiced in defending on the merits; and
            (ii) knew or should have known that the action would have
          been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the
          proper party's identity.

        (2) Notice to the United States. When the United States or a
      United States officer or agency is added as a defendant by
      amendment, the notice requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i) and
      (ii) are satisfied if, during the stated period, process was
      delivered or mailed to the United States attorney or the United
      States attorney's designee, to the Attorney General of the United
      States, or to the officer or agency.

      (d) Supplemental Pleadings. On motion and reasonable notice, the
    court may, on just terms, permit a party to serve a supplemental
    pleading setting out any transaction, occurrence, or event that
    happened after the date of the pleading to be supplemented. The
    court may permit supplementation even though the original pleading
    is defective in stating a claim or defense. The court may order
    that the opposing party plead to the supplemental pleading within a
    specified time.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 15(d) is intended to give the court broad discretion in
    allowing a supplemental pleading. However, some cases, opposed by
    other cases and criticized by the commentators, have taken the
    rigid and formalistic view that where the original complaint fails
    to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, leave to serve a
    supplemental complaint must be denied. See Bonner v. Elizabeth
    Arden, Inc., 177 F.2d 703 (2d Cir. 1949); Bowles v. Senderowitz, 65
    F.Supp. 548 (E.D.Pa.), rev'd on other grounds, 158 F.2d 435 (3d
    Cir. 1946), cert. denied, Senderowitz v. Fleming, 330 U.S. 848, 67
    S.Ct. 1091, 91 L.Ed. 1292 (1947); cf. LaSalle Nat. Bank v. 222 East
    Chestnut St. Corp., 267 F.2d 247 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 361 U.S.
    836, 80 S.Ct. 88, 4 L.Ed.2d 77 (1959). But see Camilla Cotton Oil
    Co. v. Spencer Kellogg & Sons, 257 F.2d 162 (5th Cir. 1958); Genuth
    v. National Biscuit Co., 81 F.Supp. 213 (S.D.N.Y. 1948), app.
    dism., 177 F.2d 962 (2d Cir. 1949); 3 Moore's Federal Practice
    &#182; 15.01 [5] (Supp. 1960); 1A Barron & Holtzoff, Federal
    Practice & Procedure 820-21 (Wright ed. 1960). Thus plaintiffs have
    sometimes been needlessly remitted to the difficulties of
    commencing a new action even though events occurring after the
    commencement of the original action have made clear the right to
    relief.
      Under the amendment the court has discretion to permit a
    supplemental pleading despite the fact that the original pleading
    is defective. As in other situations where a supplemental pleading
    is offered, the court is to determine in the light of the
    particular circumstances whether filing should be permitted, and if
    so, upon what terms. The amendment does not attempt to deal with
    such questions as the relation of the statute of limitations to
    supplemental pleadings, the operation of the doctrine of laches, or
    the availability of other defenses. All these questions are for
    decision in accordance with the principles applicable to
    supplemental pleadings generally. Cf. Blau v. Lamb, 191 F.Supp. 906
    (S.D.N.Y. 1961); Lendonsol Amusement Corp. v. B. & Q. Assoc., Inc.,
    23 F.R.Serv. 15d. 3, Case 1 (D.Mass. 1957).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 15(c) is amplified to state more clearly when an amendment
    of a pleading changing the party against whom a claim is asserted
    (including an amendment to correct a misnomer or misdescription of
    a defendant) shall "relate back" to the date of the original
    pleading.
      The problem has arisen most acutely in certain actions by private
    parties against officers or agencies of the United States. Thus an
    individual denied social security benefits by the Secretary of
    Health, Education, and Welfare may secure review of the decision by
    bringing a civil action against that officer within sixty days. 42
    U.S.C. Sec. 405(g) (Supp. III, 1962). In several recent cases the
    claimants instituted timely action but mistakenly named as
    defendant the United States, the Department of HEW, the "Federal
    Security Administration" (a nonexistent agency), and a Secretary
    who had retired from the office nineteen days before. Discovering
    their mistakes, the claimants moved to amend their complaints to
    name the proper defendant; by this time the statutory sixty-day
    period had expired. The motions were denied on the ground that the
    amendment "would amount to the commencement of a new proceeding and
    would not relate back in time so as to avoid the statutory
    provision * * * that suit be brought within sixty days * * *" Cohn
    v. Federal Security Adm., 199 F.Supp. 884, 885 (W.D.N.Y. 1961); see
    also Cunningham v. United States, 199 F.Supp. 541 (W.D.Mo. 1958);
    Hall v. Department of HEW, 199 F.Supp. 833 (S.D.Tex. 1960);
    Sandridge v. Folsom, Secretary of HEW, 200 F.Supp. 25 (M.D.Tenn.
    1959). [The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare has
    approved certain ameliorative regulations under 42 U.S.C. Sec.
    405(g). See 29 Fed.Reg. 8209 (June 30, 1964); Jacoby, The Effect of
    Recent Changes in the Law of "Nonstatutory" Judicial Review, 53
    Geo.L.J. 19, 42-43 (1964); see also Simmons v. United States Dept.
    HEW, 328 F.2d 86 (3d Cir. 1964).]
      Analysis in terms of "new proceeding" is traceable to Davis v. L.
    L. Cohen & Co., 268 U.S. 638 (1925), and Mellon v. Arkansas Land &
    Lumber Co., 275 U.S. 460 (1928), but those cases antedate the
    adoption of the Rules which import different criteria for
    determining when an amendment is to "relate back". As lower courts
    have continued to rely on the Davis and Mellon cases despite the
    contrary intent of the Rules, clarification of Rule 15(c) is
    considered advisable.
      Relation back is intimately connected with the policy of the
    statute of limitations. The policy of the statute limiting the time
    for suit against the Secretary of HEW would not have been offended
    by allowing relation back in the situations described above. For
    the government was put on notice of the claim within the stated
    period - in the particular instances, by means of the initial
    delivery of process to a responsible government official (see Rule
    4(d)(4) and (5). In these circumstances, characterization of the
    amendment as a new proceeding is not responsive to the realty, but
    is merely question-begging; and to deny relation back is to defeat
    unjustly the claimant's opportunity to prove his case. See the full
    discussion by Byse, Suing the "Wrong" Defendant in Judicial Review
    of Federal Administrative Action: Proposals for Reform, 77
    Harv.L.Rev. 40 (1963); see also Ill.Civ.P.Act Sec. 46(4).
      Much the same question arises in other types of actions against
    the government (see Byse, supra, at 45 n. 15). In actions between
    private parties, the problem of relation back of amendments
    changing defendants has generally been better handled by the
    courts, but incorrect criteria have sometimes been applied, leading
    sporadically to doubtful results. See 1A Barron & Holtzoff, Federal
    Practice & Procedure Sec. 451 (Wright ed. 1960); 1 id. Sec. 186
    (1960); 2 id. Sec. 543 (1961); 3 Moore's Federal Practice, par.
    15.15 (Cum.Supp. 1962); Annot., Change in Party After Statute of
    Limitations Has Run, 8 A.L.R.2d 6 (1949). Rule 15(c) has been
    amplified to provide a general solution. An amendment changing the
    party against whom a claim is asserted relates back if the
    amendment satisfies the usual condition of Rule 15(c) of "arising
    out of the conduct * * * set forth * * * in the original pleading,"
    and if, within the applicable limitations period, the party brought
    in by amendment, first, received such notice of the institution of
    the action - the notice need not be formal - that he would not be
    prejudiced in defending the action, and, second, knew or should
    have known that the action would have been brought against him
    initially had there not been a mistake concerning the identity of
    the proper party. Revised Rule 15(c) goes on to provide
    specifically in the government cases that the first and second
    requirements are satisfied when the government has been notified in
    the manner there described (see Rule 4(d)(4) and (5). As applied to
    the government cases, revised Rule 15(c) further advances the
    objectives of the 1961 amendment of Rule 25(d) (substitution of
    public officers).
      The relation back of amendments changing plaintiffs is not
    expressly treated in revised Rule 15(c) since the problem is
    generally easier. Again the chief consideration of policy is that
    of the statute of limitations, and the attitude taken in revised
    Rule 15(c) toward change of defendants extends by analogy to
    amendments changing plaintiffs. Also relevant is the amendment of
    Rule 17(a) (real party in interest). To avoid forfeitures of just
    claims, revised Rule 17(a) would provide that no action shall be
    dismissed on the ground that it is not prosecuted in the name of
    the real party in interest until a reasonable time has been allowed
    for correction of the defect in the manner there stated.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      The rule has been revised to prevent parties against whom claims
    are made from taking unjust advantage of otherwise inconsequential
    pleading errors to sustain a limitations defense.
      Paragraph (c)(1). This provision is new. It is intended to make
    it clear that the rule does not apply to preclude any relation back
    that may be permitted under the applicable limitations law.
    Generally, the applicable limitations law will be state law. If
    federal jurisdiction is based on the citizenship of the parties,
    the primary reference is the law of the state in which the district
    court sits. Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U.S. 740 (1980). If
    federal jurisdiction is based on a federal question, the reference
    may be to the law of the state governing relations between the
    parties. E.g., Board of Regents v. Tomanio, 446 U.S. 478 (1980). In
    some circumstances, the controlling limitations law may be federal
    law. E.g., West v. Conrail, Inc., 107 S.Ct. 1538 (1987). Cf.
    Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U.S. 1 (1987); Stewart
    Organization v. Ricoh, 108 S.Ct. 2239 (1988). Whatever may be the
    controlling body of limitations law, if that law affords a more
    forgiving principle of relation back than the one provided in this
    rule, it should be available to save the claim. Accord, Marshall v.
    Mulrenin, 508 F.2d 39 (1st cir. 1974). If Schiavone v. Fortune, 106
    S.Ct. 2379 (1986) implies the contrary, this paragraph is intended
    to make a material change in the rule.
      Paragraph (c)(3). This paragraph has been revised to change the
    result in Schiavone v. Fortune, supra, with respect to the problem
    of a misnamed defendant. An intended defendant who is notified of
    an action within the period allowed by Rule 4(m) for service of a
    summons and complaint may not under the revised rule defeat the
    action on account of a defect in the pleading with respect to the
    defendant's name, provided that the requirements of clauses (A) and
    (B) have been met. If the notice requirement is met within the Rule
    4(m) period, a complaint may be amended at any time to correct a
    formal defect such as a misnomer or misidentification. On the basis
    of the text of the former rule, the Court reached a result in
    Schiavone v. Fortune that was inconsistent with the liberal
    pleading practices secured by Rule 8. See Bauer, Schiavone: An Un-
    Fortune-ate Illustration of the Supreme Court's Role as
    Interpreter of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 63 NOTRE DAME
    L. REV. 720 (1988); Brussack, Outrageous Fortune: The Case for
    Amending Rule 15(c) Again, 61 S. CAL. L. REV. 671 (1988); Lewis,
    The Excessive History of Federal Rule 15(c) and Its Lessons for
    Civil Rules Revision, 86 MICH. L. REV. 1507 (1987).
      In allowing a name-correcting amendment within the time allowed
    by Rule 4(m), this rule allows not only the 120 days specified in
    that rule, but also any additional time resulting from any
    extension ordered by the court pursuant to that rule, as may be
    granted, for example, if the defendant is a fugitive from service
    of the summons.
      This revision, together with the revision of Rule 4(i) with
    respect to the failure of a plaintiff in an action against the
    United States to effect timely service on all the appropriate
    officials, is intended to produce results contrary to those reached
    in Gardner v. Gartman, 880 F.2d 797 (4th cir. 1989), Rys v. U.S.
    Postal Service, 886 F.2d 443 (1st cir. 1989), Martin's Food &
    Liquor, Inc. v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, 14 F.R.S.3d 86 (N.D.
    Ill. 1988). But cf. Montgomery v. United States Postal Service, 867
    F.2d 900 (5th cir. 1989), Warren v. Department of the Army, 867
    F.2d 1156 (8th cir. 1989); Miles v. Department of the Army, 881

    881 F.2d 1018 (11th cir. 1989).

           CONGRESSIONAL MODIFICATION OF PROPOSED 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Section 11(a) of Pub. L. 102-198 [set out as a note under section
    2074 of this title] provided that Rule 15(c)(3) of the Federal
    Rules of Civil Procedure as transmitted to Congress by the Supreme
    Court to become effective on Dec. 1, 1991, is amended. See 1991
    Amendment note below.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment conforms the cross reference to Rule 4 to the
    revision of that rule.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 15 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Former Rule 15(c)(3)(A) called for notice of the "institution" of
    the action. Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i) omits the reference to
    "institution" as potentially confusing. What counts is that the
    party to be brought in have notice of the existence of the action,
    whether or not the notice includes details as to its "institution."

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 15(a)(1) is amended to make three changes in the time
    allowed to make one amendment as a matter of course.
      Former Rule 15(a) addressed amendment of a pleading to which a
    responsive pleading is required by distinguishing between the means
    used to challenge the pleading. Serving a responsive pleading
    terminated the right to amend. Serving a motion attacking the
    pleading did not terminate the right to amend, because a motion is
    not a "pleading" as defined in Rule 7. The right to amend survived
    beyond decision of the motion unless the decision expressly cut off
    the right to amend.
      The distinction drawn in former Rule 15(a) is changed in two
    ways. First, the right to amend once as a matter of course
    terminates 21 days after service of a motion under Rule 12(b), (e),
    or (f). This provision will force the pleader to consider carefully
    and promptly the wisdom of amending to meet the arguments in the
    motion. A responsive amendment may avoid the need to decide the
    motion or reduce the number of issues to be decided, and will
    expedite determination of issues that otherwise might be raised
    seriatim. It also should advance other pretrial proceedings.
      Second, the right to amend once as a matter of course is no
    longer terminated by service of a responsive pleading. The
    responsive pleading may point out issues that the original pleader
    had not considered and persuade the pleader that amendment is wise.
    Just as amendment was permitted by former Rule 15(a) in response to
    a motion, so the amended rule permits one amendment as a matter of
    course in response to a responsive pleading. The right is subject
    to the same 21-day limit as the right to amend in response to a
    motion.
      The 21-day periods to amend once as a matter of course after
    service of a responsive pleading or after service of a designated
    motion are not cumulative. If a responsive pleading is served after
    one of the designated motions is served, for example, there is no
    new 21-day period.
      Finally, amended Rule 15(a)(1) extends from 20 to 21 days the
    period to amend a pleading to which no responsive pleading is
    allowed and omits the provision that cuts off the right if the
    action is on the trial calendar. Rule 40 no longer refers to a
    trial calendar, and many courts have abandoned formal trial
    calendars. It is more effective to rely on scheduling orders or
    other pretrial directions to establish time limits for amendment in
    the few situations that otherwise might allow one amendment as a
    matter of course at a time that would disrupt trial preparations.
    Leave to amend still can be sought under Rule 15(a)(2), or at and
    after trial under Rule 15(b).
      Abrogation of Rule 13(f) establishes Rule 15 as the sole rule
    governing amendment of a pleading to add a counterclaim.
      Amended Rule 15(a)(3) extends from 10 to 14 days the period to
    respond to an amended pleading.

                          AMENDMENT BY PUBLIC LAW                      
      1991 - Subd. (c)(3). Pub. L. 102-198 substituted "Rule 4(j)" for
    "Rule 4(m)".

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE III. PLEADINGS AND MOTIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 16. Pretrial Conferences; Scheduling; Management

-STATUTE-
      (a) Purposes of a Pretrial Conference. In any action, the court
    may order the attorneys and any unrepresented parties to appear for
    one or more pretrial conferences for such purposes as:
        (1) expediting disposition of the action;
        (2) establishing early and continuing control so that the case
      will not be protracted because of lack of management;
        (3) discouraging wasteful pretrial activities;
        (4) improving the quality of the trial through more thorough
      preparation; and
        (5) facilitating settlement.

      (b) Scheduling.
        (1) Scheduling Order. Except in categories of actions exempted
      by local rule, the district judge - or a magistrate judge when
      authorized by local rule - must issue a scheduling order:
          (A) after receiving the parties' report under Rule 26(f); or
          (B) after consulting with the parties' attorneys and any
        unrepresented parties at a scheduling conference or by
        telephone, mail, or other means.

        (2) Time to Issue. The judge must issue the scheduling order as
      soon as practicable, but in any event within the earlier of 120
      days after any defendant has been served with the complaint or 90
      days after any defendant has appeared.
        (3) Contents of the Order.
          (A) Required Contents. The scheduling order must limit the
        time to join other parties, amend the pleadings, complete
        discovery, and file motions.
          (B) Permitted Contents. The scheduling order may:
            (i) modify the timing of disclosures under Rules 26(a) and
          26(e)(1);
            (ii) modify the extent of discovery;
            (iii) provide for disclosure or discovery of electronically
          stored information;
            (iv) include any agreements the parties reach for asserting
          claims of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation
          material after information is produced;
            (v) set dates for pretrial conferences and for trial; and
            (vi) include other appropriate matters.

        (4) Modifying a Schedule. A schedule may be modified only for
      good cause and with the judge's consent.

      (c) Attendance and Matters for Consideration at a Pretrial
    Conference.
        (1) Attendance. A represented party must authorize at least one
      of its attorneys to make stipulations and admissions about all
      matters that can reasonably be anticipated for discussion at a
      pretrial conference. If appropriate, the court may require that a
      party or its representative be present or reasonably available by
      other means to consider possible settlement.
        (2) Matters for Consideration. At any pretrial conference, the
      court may consider and take appropriate action on the following
      matters:
          (A) formulating and simplifying the issues, and eliminating
        frivolous claims or defenses;
          (B) amending the pleadings if necessary or desirable;
          (C) obtaining admissions and stipulations about facts and
        documents to avoid unnecessary proof, and ruling in advance on
        the admissibility of evidence;
          (D) avoiding unnecessary proof and cumulative evidence, and
        limiting the use of testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence
        702;
          (E) determining the appropriateness and timing of summary
        adjudication under Rule 56;
          (F) controlling and scheduling discovery, including orders
        affecting disclosures and discovery under Rule 26 and Rules 29
        through 37;
          (G) identifying witnesses and documents, scheduling the
        filing and exchange of any pretrial briefs, and setting dates
        for further conferences and for trial;
          (H) referring matters to a magistrate judge or a master;
          (I) settling the case and using special procedures to assist
        in resolving the dispute when authorized by statute or local
        rule;
          (J) determining the form and content of the pretrial order;
          (K) disposing of pending motions;
          (L) adopting special procedures for managing potentially
        difficult or protracted actions that may involve complex
        issues, multiple parties, difficult legal questions, or unusual
        proof problems;
          (M) ordering a separate trial under Rule 42(b) of a claim,
        counterclaim, crossclaim, third-party claim, or particular
        issue;
          (N) ordering the presentation of evidence early in the trial
        on a manageable issue that might, on the evidence, be the basis
        for a judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a) or a
        judgment on partial findings under Rule 52(c);
          (O) establishing a reasonable limit on the time allowed to
        present evidence; and
          (P) facilitating in other ways the just, speedy, and
        inexpensive disposition of the action.

      (d) Pretrial Orders. After any conference under this rule, the
    court should issue an order reciting the action taken. This order
    controls the course of the action unless the court modifies it.
      (e) Final Pretrial Conference and Orders. The court may hold a
    final pretrial conference to formulate a trial plan, including a
    plan to facilitate the admission of evidence. The conference must
    be held as close to the start of trial as is reasonable, and must
    be attended by at least one attorney who will conduct the trial for
    each party and by any unrepresented party. The court may modify the
    order issued after a final pretrial conference only to prevent
    manifest injustice.
      (f) Sanctions.
        (1) In General. On motion or on its own, the court may issue
      any just orders, including those authorized by Rule
      37(b)(2)(A)(ii)-(vii), if a party or its attorney:
          (A) fails to appear at a scheduling or other pretrial
        conference;
          (B) is substantially unprepared to participate - or does not
        participate in good faith - in the conference; or
          (C) fails to obey a scheduling or other pretrial order.

        (2) Imposing Fees and Costs. Instead of or in addition to any
      other sanction, the court must order the party, its attorney, or
      both to pay the reasonable expenses - including attorney's fees -
      incurred because of any noncompliance with this rule, unless the
      noncompliance was substantially justified or other circumstances
      make an award of expenses unjust.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983 AMENDMENT       

                               INTRODUCTION                           
      Rule 16 has not been amended since the Federal Rules were
    promulgated in 1938. In many respects, the rule has been a success.
    For example, there is evidence that pretrial conferences may
    improve the quality of justice rendered in the federal courts by
    sharpening the preparation and presentation of cases, tending to
    eliminate trial surprise, and improving, as well as facilitating,
    the settlement process. See 6 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and
    Procedure: Civil Sec. 1522 (1971). However, in other respects
    particularly with regard to case management, the rule has not
    always been as helpful as it might have been. Thus there has been a
    widespread feeling that amendment is necessary to encourage
    pretrial management that meets the needs of modern litigation. See
    Report of the National Commission for the Review of Antitrust Laws
    and Procedures (1979).
      Major criticism of Rule 16 has centered on the fact that its
    application can result in over-regulation of some cases and under-
    regulation of others. In simple, run-of-the-mill cases, attorneys
    have found pretrial requirements burdensome. It is claimed that
    over-administration leads to a series of mini-trials that result in
    a waste of an attorney's time and needless expense to a client.
    Pollack, Pretrial Procedures More Effectively Handled, 65 F.R.D.
    475 (1974). This is especially likely to be true when pretrial
    proceedings occur long before trial. At the other end of the
    spectrum, the discretionary character of Rule 16 and its
    orientation toward a single conference late in the pretrial process
    has led to under-administration of complex or protracted cases.
    Without judicial guidance beginning shortly after institution,
    these cases often become mired in discovery.
      Four sources of criticism of pretrial have been identified.
    First, conferences often are seen as a mere exchange of legalistic
    contentions without any real analysis of the particular case.
    Second, the result frequently is nothing but a formal agreement on
    minutiae. Third, the conferences are seen as unnecessary and time-
    consuming in cases that will be settled before trial. Fourth, the
    meetings can be ceremonial and ritualistic, having little effect on
    the trial and being of minimal value, particularly when the
    attorneys attending the sessions are not the ones who will try the
    case or lack authority to enter into binding stipulations. See
    generally McCargo v. Hedrick, 545 F.2d 393 (4th Cir. 1976);
    Pollack, Pretrial Procedures More Effectively Handled, 65 F.R.D.
    475 (1974); Rosenberg, The Pretrial Conference and Effective
    Justice 45 (1964).
      There also have been difficulties with the pretrial orders that
    issue following Rule 16 conferences. When an order is entered far
    in advance of trial, some issues may not be properly formulated.
    Counsel naturally are cautious and often try to preserve as many
    options as possible. If the judge who tries the case did not
    conduct the conference, he could find it difficult to determine
    exactly what was agreed to at the conference. But any insistence on
    a detailed order may be too burdensome, depending on the nature or
    posture of the case.
      Given the significant changes in federal civil litigation since
    1938 that are not reflected in Rule 16, it has been extensively
    rewritten and expanded to meet the challenges of modern litigation.
    Empirical studies reveal that when a trial judge intervenes
    personally at an early stage to assume judicial control over a case
    and to schedule dates for completion by the parties of the
    principal pretrial steps, the case is disposed of by settlement or
    trial more efficiently and with less cost and delay than when the
    parties are left to their own devices. Flanders, Case Management
    and Court Management in United States District Courts 17, Federal
    Judicial Center (1977). Thus, the rule mandates a pretrial
    scheduling order. However, although scheduling and pretrial
    conferences are encouraged in appropriate cases, they are not
    mandated.

                                DISCUSSION                            
      Subdivision (a); Pretrial Conferences; Objectives. The amended
    rule makes scheduling and case management an express goal of
    pretrial procedure. This is done in Rule 16(a) by shifting the
    emphasis away from a conference focused solely on the trial and
    toward a process of judicial management that embraces the entire
    pretrial phase, especially motions and discovery. In addition, the
    amendment explicitly recognizes some of the objectives of pretrial
    conferences and the powers that many courts already have assumed.
    Rule 16 thus will be a more accurate reflection of actual practice.
      Subdivision (b); Scheduling and Planning. The most significant
    change in Rule 16 is the mandatory scheduling order described in
    Rule 16(b), which is based in part on Wisconsin Civil Procedure
    Rule 802.10. The idea of scheduling orders is not new. It has been
    used by many federal courts. See, e.g., Southern District of
    Indiana, Local Rule 19.
      Although a mandatory scheduling order encourages the court to
    become involved in case management early in the litigation, it
    represents a degree of judicial involvement that is not warranted
    in many cases. Thus, subdivision (b) permits each district court to
    promulgate a local rule under Rule 83 exempting certain categories
    of cases in which the burdens of scheduling orders exceed the
    administrative efficiencies that would be gained. See Eastern
    District of Virginia, Local Rule 12(1). Logical candidates for this
    treatment include social security disability matters, habeas corpus
    petitions, forfeitures, and reviews of certain administrative
    actions.
      A scheduling conference may be requested either by the judge, a
    magistrate when authorized by district court rule, or a party
    within 120 days after the summons and complaint are filed. If a
    scheduling conference is not arranged within that time and the case
    is not exempted by local rule, a scheduling order must be issued
    under Rule 16(b), after some communication with the parties, which
    may be by telephone or mail rather than in person. The use of the
    term "judge" in subdivision (b) reflects the Advisory Committee's
    judgment that is it preferable that this task should be handled by
    a district judge rather than a magistrate, except when the
    magistrate is acting under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(c). While personal
    supervision by the trial judge is preferred, the rule, in
    recognition of the impracticality or difficulty of complying with
    such a requirement in some districts, authorizes a district by
    local rule to delegate the duties to a magistrate. In order to
    formulate a practicable scheduling order, the judge, or a
    magistrate when authorized by district court rule, and attorneys
    are required to develop a timetable for the matters listed in Rule
    16(b)(1)-(3). As indicated in Rule 16(b)(4)-(5), the order may also
    deal with a wide range of other matters. The rule is phrased
    permissively as to clauses (4) and (5), however, because scheduling
    these items at an early point may not be feasible or appropriate.
    Even though subdivision (b) relates only to scheduling, there is no
    reason why some of the procedural matters listed in Rule 16(c)
    cannot be addressed at the same time, at least when a scheduling
    conference is held.
      Item (1) assures that at some point both the parties and the
    pleadings will be fixed, by setting a time within which joinder of
    parties shall be completed and the pleadings amended.
      Item (2) requires setting time limits for interposing various
    motions that otherwise might be used as stalling techniques.
      Item (3) deals with the problem of procrastination and delay by
    attorneys in a context in which scheduling is especially important -
     discovery. Scheduling the completion of discovery can serve some
    of the same functions as the conference described in Rule 26(f).
      Item (4) refers to setting dates for conferences and for trial.
    Scheduling multiple pretrial conferences may well be desirable if
    the case is complex and the court believes that a more elaborate
    pretrial structure, such as that described in the Manual for
    Complex Litigation, should be employed. On the other hand, only one
    pretrial conference may be necessary in an uncomplicated case.
      As long as the case is not exempted by local rule, the court must
    issue a written scheduling order even if no scheduling conference
    is called. The order, like pretrial orders under the former rule
    and those under new Rule 16(c), normally will "control the
    subsequent course of the action." See Rule 16(e). After
    consultation with the attorneys for the parties and any
    unrepresented parties - a formal motion is not necessary - the
    court may modify the schedule on a showing of good cause if it
    cannot reasonably be met despite the diligence of the party seeking
    the extension. Since the scheduling order is entered early in the
    litigation, this standard seems more appropriate than a "manifest
    injustice" or "substantial hardship" test. Otherwise, a fear that
    extensions will not be granted may encourage counsel to request the
    longest possible periods for completing pleading, joinder, and
    discovery. Moreover, changes in the court's calendar sometimes will
    oblige the judge or magistrate when authorized by district court
    rule to modify the scheduling order.
      The district courts undoubtedly will develop several prototype
    scheduling orders for different types of cases. In addition, when
    no formal conference is held, the court may obtain scheduling
    information by telephone, mail, or otherwise. In many instances
    this will result in a scheduling order better suited to the
    individual case than a standard order, without taking the time that
    would be required by a formal conference.
      Rule 16(b) assures that the judge will take some early control
    over the litigation, even when its character does not warrant
    holding a scheduling conference. Despite the fact that the process
    of preparing a scheduling order does not always bring the attorneys
    and judge together, the fixing of time limits serves
      to stimulate litigants to narrow the areas of inquiry and
      advocacy to those they believe are truly relevant and material.
      Time limits not only compress the amount of time for litigation,
      they should also reduce the amount of resources invested in
      litigation. Litigants are forced to establish discovery
      priorities and thus to do the most important work first.
    Report of the National Commission for the Review of Antitrust Laws
    and Procedures 28 (1979).
      Thus, except in exempted cases, the judge or a magistrate when
    authorized by district court rule will have taken some action in
    every case within 120 days after the complaint is filed that
    notifies the attorneys that the case will be moving toward trial.
    Subdivision (b) is reenforced by subdivision (f), which makes it
    clear that the sanctions for violating a scheduling order are the
    same as those for violating a pretrial order.
      Subdivision (c); Subjects to be Discussed at Pretrial
    Conferences. This subdivision expands upon the list of things that
    may be discussed at a pretrial conference that appeared in original
    Rule 16. The intention is to encourage better planning and
    management of litigation. Increased judicial control during the
    pretrial process accelerates the processing and termination of
    cases. Flanders, Case Management and Court Management in United
    States District Courts, Federal Judicial Center (1977). See also
    Report of the National Commission for the Review of Antitrust Laws
    and Procedures (1979).
      The reference in Rule 16(c)(1) to "formulation" is intended to
    clarify and confirm the court's power to identify the litigable
    issues. It has been added in the hope of promoting efficiency and
    conserving judicial resources by identifying the real issues prior
    to trial, thereby saving time and expense for everyone. See
    generally Meadow Gold Prods. Co. v. Wright, 278 F.2d 867 (D.C. Cir.
    1960). The notion is emphasized by expressly authorizing the
    elimination of frivolous claims or defenses at a pretrial
    conference. There is no reason to require that this await a formal
    motion for summary judgment. Nor is there any reason for the court
    to wait for the parties to initiate the process called for in Rule
    16(c)(1).
      The timing of any attempt at issue formulation is a matter of
    judicial discretion. In relatively simple cases it may not be
    necessary or may take the form of a stipulation between counsel or
    a request by the court that counsel work together to draft a
    proposed order.
      Counsel bear a substantial responsibility for assisting the court
    in identifying the factual issues worthy of trial. If counsel fail
    to identify an issue for the court, the right to have the issue
    tried is waived. Although an order specifying the issues is
    intended to be binding, it may be amended at trial to avoid
    manifest injustice. See Rule 16(e). However, the rule's
    effectiveness depends on the court employing its discretion
    sparingly.
      Clause (6) acknowledges the widespread availability and use of
    magistrates. The corresponding provision in the original rule
    referred only to masters and limited the function of the reference
    to the making of "findings to be used as evidence" in a case to be
    tried to a jury. The new text is not limited and broadens the
    potential use of a magistrate to that permitted by the Magistrate's
    Act.
      Clause (7) explicitly recognizes that it has become commonplace
    to discuss settlement at pretrial conferences. Since it obviously
    eases crowded court dockets and results in savings to the litigants
    and the judicial system, settlement should be facilitated at as
    early a stage of the litigation as possible. Although it is not the
    purpose of Rule 16(b)(7) to impose settlement negotiations on
    unwilling litigants, it is believed that providing a neutral forum
    for discussing the subject might foster it. See Moore's Federal
    Practice &#182; 16.17; 6 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and
    Procedure: Civil Sec. 1522 (1971). For instance, a judge to whom a
    case has been assigned may arrange, on his own motion or a at a
    party's request, to have settlement conferences handled by another
    member of the court or by a magistrate. The rule does not make
    settlement conferences mandatory because they would be a waste of
    time in many cases. See Flanders, Case Management and Court
    Management in the United States District Courts, 39, Federal
    Judicial Center (1977). Requests for a conference from a party
    indicating a willingness to talk settlement normally should be
    honored, unless thought to be frivolous or dilatory.
      A settlement conference is appropriate at any time. It may be
    held in conjunction with a pretrial or discovery conference,
    although various objectives of pretrial management, such as moving
    the case toward trial, may not always be compatible with settlement
    negotiations, and thus a separate settlement conference may be
    desirable. See 6 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure:
    Civil Sec. 1522, at p. 751 (1971).
      In addition to settlement, Rule 16(c)(7) refers to exploring the
    use of procedures other than litigation to resolve the dispute.
    This includes urging the litigants to employ adjudicatory
    techniques outside the courthouse. See, for example, the experiment
    described in Green, Marks & Olson, Settling Large Case Litigation:
    An Alternative Approach, 11 Loyola of L.A. L.Rev. 493 (1978).
      Rule 16(c)(10) authorizes the use of special pretrial procedures
    to expedite the adjudication of potentially difficult or protracted
    cases. Some district courts obviously have done so for many years.
    See Rubin, The Managed Calendar: Some Pragmatic Suggestions About
    Achieving the Just, Speedy and Inexpensive Determination of Civil
    Cases in Federal Courts, 4 Just. Sys. J. 135 (1976). Clause 10
    provides an explicit authorization for such procedures and
    encourages their use. No particular techniques have been described;
    the Committee felt that flexibility and experience are the keys to
    efficient management of complex cases. Extensive guidance is
    offered in such documents as the Manual for Complex Litigation.
      The rule simply identifies characteristics that make a case a
    strong candidate for special treatment. The four mentioned are
    illustrative, not exhaustive, and overlap to some degree. But
    experience has shown that one or more of them will be present in
    every protracted or difficult case and it seems desirable to set
    them out. See Kendig, Procedures for Management of Non-Routine
    Cases, 3 Hofstra L.Rev. 701 (1975).
      The last sentence of subdivision (c) is new. See Wisconsin Civil
    Procedure Rule 802.11(2). It has been added to meet one of the
    criticisms of the present practice described earlier and insure
    proper preconference preparation so that the meeting is more than a
    ceremonial or ritualistic event. The reference to "authority" is
    not intended to insist upon the ability to settle the litigation.
    Nor should the rule be read to encourage the judge conducting the
    conference to compel attorneys to enter into stipulations or to
    make admissions that they consider to be unreasonable, that touch
    on matters that could not normally have been anticipated to arise
    at the conference, or on subjects of a dimension that normally
    require prior consultation with and approval from the client.
      Subdivision (d); Final Pretrial Conference. This provision has
    been added to make it clear that the time between any final
    pretrial conference (which in a simple case may be the only
    pretrial conference) and trail should be as short as possible to be
    certain that the litigants make substantial progress with the case
    and avoid the inefficiency of having that preparation repeated when
    there is a delay between the last pretrial conference and trial. An
    optimum time of 10 days to two weeks has been suggested by one
    federal judge. Rubin, The Managed Calendar: Some Pragmatic
    Suggestions About Achieving the Just, Speedy and Inexpensive
    Determination of Civil Cases in Federal Courts, 4 Just. Sys. J.
    135, 141 (1976). The Committee, however, concluded that it would be
    inappropriate to fix a precise time in the rule, given the numerous
    variables that could bear on the matter. Thus the timing has been
    left to the court's discretion.
      At least one of the attorneys who will conduct the trial for each
    party must be present at the final pretrial conference. At this
    late date there should be no doubt as to which attorney or
    attorneys this will be. Since the agreements and stipulations made
    at this final conference will control the trial, the presence of
    lawyers who will be involved in it is especially useful to assist
    the judge in structuring the case, and to lead to a more effective
    trial.
      Subdivision (e); Pretrial Orders. Rule 16(e) does not
    substantially change the portion of the original rule dealing with
    pretrial orders. The purpose of an order is to guide the course of
    the litigation and the language of the original rule making that
    clear has been retained. No compelling reason has been found for
    major revision, especially since this portion of the rule has been
    interpreted and clarified by over forty years of judicial decisions
    with comparatively little difficulty. See 6 Wright & Miller,
    Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil Secs. 1521-30 (1971). Changes
    in language therefore have been kept to a minimum to avoid
    confusion.
      Since the amended rule encourages more extensive pretrial
    management than did the original, two or more conferences may be
    held in many cases. The language of Rule 16(e) recognizes this
    possibility and the corresponding need to issue more than one
    pretrial order in a single case.
      Once formulated, pretrial orders should not be changed lightly;
    but total inflexibility is undesirable. See, e.g., Clark v.
    Pennsylvania R.R. Co., 328 F.2d 591 (2d Cir. 1964). The exact words
    used to describe the standard for amending the pretrial order
    probably are less important than the meaning given them in
    practice. By not imposing any limitation on the ability to modify a
    pretrial order, the rule reflects the reality that in any process
    of continuous management what is done at one conference may have to
    be altered at the next. In the case of the final pretrial order,
    however, a more stringent standard is called for and the words "to
    prevent manifest injustice," which appeared in the original rule,
    have been retained. They have the virtue of familiarity and
    adequately describe the restraint the trial judge should exercise.
      Many local rules make the plaintiff's attorney responsible for
    drafting a proposed pretrial order, either before or after the
    conference. Others allow the court to appoint any of the attorneys
    to perform the task, and others leave it to the court. See Note,
    Pretrial Conference: A Critical Examination of Local Rules Adopted
    by Federal District Courts, 64 Va.L.Rev. 467 (1978). Rule 16 has
    never addressed this matter. Since there is no consensus about
    which method of drafting the order works best and there is no
    reason to believe that nationwide uniformity is needed, the rule
    has been left silent on the point. See Handbook for Effective
    Pretrial Procedure, 37 F.R.D. 225 (1964).
      Subdivision (f); Sanctions. Original Rule 16 did not mention the
    sanctions that might be imposed for failing to comply with the
    rule. However, courts have not hesitated to enforce it by
    appropriate measures. See, e.g., Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U.S.
    628 (1962) (district court's dismissal under Rule 41(b) after
    plaintiff's attorney failed to appear at a pretrial conference
    upheld); Admiral Theatre Corp. v. Douglas Theatre, 585 F.2d 877
    (8th Cir. 1978) (district court has discretion to exclude exhibits
    or refuse to permit the testimony of a witness not listed prior to
    trial in contravention of its pretrial order).
      To reflect that existing practice, and to obviate dependence upon
    Rule 41(b) or the court's inherent power to regulate litigation,
    cf. Societe Internationale Pour Participations Industrielles et
    Commerciales, S.A. v. Rogers, 357 U.S. 197 (1958), Rule 16(f)
    expressly provides for imposing sanctions on disobedient or
    recalcitrant parties, their attorneys, or both in four types of
    situations. Rodes, Ripple & Mooney, Sanctions Imposable for
    Violations of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 65-67, 80-84,
    Federal Judicial Center (1981). Furthermore, explicit reference to
    sanctions reenforces the rule's intention to encourage forceful
    judicial management.
      Rule 16(f) incorporates portions of Rule 37(b)(2), which
    prescribes sanctions for failing to make discovery. This should
    facilitate application of Rule 16(f), since courts and lawyers
    already are familiar with the Rule 37 standards. Among the
    sanctions authorized by the new subdivision are: preclusion order,
    striking a pleading, staying the proceeding, default judgment,
    contempt, and charging a party, his attorney, or both with the
    expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by noncompliance. The
    contempt sanction, however, is only available for a violation of a
    court order. The references in Rule 16(f) are not exhaustive.
      As is true under Rule 37(b)(2), the imposition of sanctions may
    be sought by either the court or a party. In addition, the court
    has discretion to impose whichever sanction it feels is appropriate
    under the circumstances. Its action is reviewable under the abuse-
    of-discretion standard. See National Hockey League v. Metropolitan
    Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U.S. 639 (1976).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b). One purpose of this amendment is to provide a
    more appropriate deadline for the initial scheduling order required
    by the rule. The former rule directed that the order be entered
    within 120 days from the filing of the complaint. This requirement
    has created problems because Rule 4(m) allows 120 days for service
    and ordinarily at least one defendant should be available to
    participate in the process of formulating the scheduling order. The
    revision provides that the order is to be entered within 90 days
    after the date a defendant first appears (whether by answer or by a
    motion under Rule 12) or, if earlier (as may occur in some actions
    against the United States or if service is waived under Rule 4),
    within 120 days after service of the complaint on a defendant. The
    longer time provided by the revision is not intended to encourage
    unnecessary delays in entering the scheduling order. Indeed, in
    most cases the order can and should be entered at a much earlier
    date. Rather, the additional time is intended to alleviate problems
    in multi-defendant cases and should ordinarily be adequate to
    enable participation by all defendants initially named in the
    action.
      In many cases the scheduling order can and should be entered
    before this deadline. However, when setting a scheduling
    conference, the court should take into account the effect this
    setting will have in establishing deadlines for the parties to meet
    under revised Rule 26(f) and to exchange information under revised
    Rule 26(a)(1). While the parties are expected to stipulate to
    additional time for making their disclosures when warranted by the
    circumstances, a scheduling conference held before defendants have
    had time to learn much about the case may result in diminishing the
    value of the Rule 26(f) meeting, the parties' proposed discovery
    plan, and indeed the conference itself.
      New paragraph (4) has been added to highlight that it will
    frequently be desirable for the scheduling order to include
    provisions relating to the timing of disclosures under Rule 26(a).
    While the initial disclosures required by Rule 26(a)(1) will
    ordinarily have been made before entry of the scheduling order, the
    timing and sequence for disclosure of expert testimony and of the
    witnesses and exhibits to be used at trial should be tailored to
    the circumstances of the case and is a matter that should be
    considered at the initial scheduling conference. Similarly, the
    scheduling order might contain provisions modifying the extent of
    discovery (e.g., number and length of depositions) otherwise
    permitted under these rules or by a local rule.
      The report from the attorneys concerning their meeting and
    proposed discovery plan, as required by revised Rule 26(f), should
    be submitted to the court before the scheduling order is entered.
    Their proposals, particularly regarding matters on which they
    agree, should be of substantial value to the court in setting the
    timing and limitations on discovery and should reduce the time of
    the court needed to conduct a meaningful conference under Rule
    16(b). As under the prior rule, while a scheduling order is
    mandated, a scheduling conference is not. However, in view of the
    benefits to be derived from the litigants and a judicial officer
    meeting in person, a Rule 16(b) conference should, to the extent
    practicable, be held in all cases that will involve discovery.
      This subdivision, as well as subdivision (c)(8), also is revised
    to reflect the new title of United States Magistrate Judges
    pursuant to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990.
      Subdivision (c). The primary purposes of the changes in
    subdivision (c) are to call attention to the opportunities for
    structuring of trial under Rules 42, 50, and 52 and to eliminate
    questions that have occasionally been raised regarding the
    authority of the court to make appropriate orders designed either
    to facilitate settlement or to provide for an efficient and
    economical trial. The prefatory language of this subdivision is
    revised to clarify the court's power to enter appropriate orders at
    a conference notwithstanding the objection of a party. Of course
    settlement is dependent upon agreement by the parties and, indeed,
    a conference is most effective and productive when the parties
    participate in a spirit of cooperation and mindful of their
    responsibilities under Rule 1.
      Paragraph (4) is revised to clarify that in advance of trial the
    court may address the need for, and possible limitations on, the
    use of expert testimony under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of
    Evidence. Even when proposed expert testimony might be admissible
    under the standards of Rules 403 and 702 of the evidence rules, the
    court may preclude or limit such testimony if the cost to the
    litigants - which may include the cost to adversaries of securing
    testimony on the same subjects by other experts - would be unduly
    expensive given the needs of the case and the other evidence
    available at trial.
      Paragraph (5) is added (and the remaining paragraphs renumbered)
    in recognition that use of Rule 56 to avoid or reduce the scope of
    trial is a topic that can, and often should, be considered at a
    pretrial conference. Renumbered paragraph (11) enables the court to
    rule on pending motions for summary adjudication that are ripe for
    decision at the time of the conference. Often, however, the
    potential use of Rule 56 is a matter that arises from discussions
    during a conference. The court may then call for motions to be
    filed.
      Paragraph (6) is added to emphasize that a major objective of
    pretrial conferences should be to consider appropriate controls on
    the extent and timing of discovery. In many cases the court should
    also specify the times and sequence for disclosure of written
    reports from experts under revised Rule 26(a)(2)(B) and perhaps
    direct changes in the types of experts from whom written reports
    are required. Consideration should also be given to possible
    changes in the timing or form of the disclosure of trial witnesses
    and documents under Rule 26(a)(3).
      Paragraph (9) is revised to describe more accurately the various
    procedures that, in addition to traditional settlement conferences,
    may be helpful in settling litigation. Even if a case cannot
    immediately be settled, the judge and attorneys can explore
    possible use of alternative procedures such as mini-trials, summary
    jury trials, mediation, neutral evaluation, and nonbinding
    arbitration that can lead to consensual resolution of the dispute
    without a full trial on the merits. The rule acknowledges the
    presence of statutes and local rules or plans that may authorize
    use of some of these procedures even when not agreed to by the
    parties. See 28 U.S.C. Secs. 473(a)(6), 473(b)(4), 651-58; Section
    104(b)(2), Pub. L. 101-650. The rule does not attempt to resolve
    questions as to the extent a court would be authorized to require
    such proceedings as an exercise of its inherent powers.
      The amendment of paragraph (9) should be read in conjunction with
    the sentence added to the end of subdivision (c), authorizing the
    court to direct that, in appropriate cases, a responsible
    representative of the parties be present or available by telephone
    during a conference in order to discuss possible settlement of the
    case. The sentence refers to participation by a party or its
    representative. Whether this would be the individual party, an
    officer of a corporate party, a representative from an insurance
    carrier, or someone else would depend on the circumstances.
    Particularly in litigation in which governmental agencies or large
    amounts of money are involved, there may be no one with on-the-spot
    settlement authority, and the most that should be expected is
    access to a person who would have a major role in submitting a
    recommendation to the body or board with ultimate decision-making
    responsibility. The selection of the appropriate representative
    should ordinarily be left to the party and its counsel. Finally, it
    should be noted that the unwillingness of a party to be available,
    even by telephone, for a settlement conference may be a clear
    signal that the time and expense involved in pursuing settlement is
    likely to be unproductive and that personal participation by the
    parties should not be required.
      The explicit authorization in the rule to require personal
    participation in the manner stated is not intended to limit the
    reasonable exercise of the court's inherent powers, e.g., G.
    Heileman Brewing Co. v. Joseph Oat Corp., 871 F.2d 648 (7th Cir.
    1989), or its power to require party participation under the Civil
    Justice Reform Act of 1990. See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 473(b)(5) (civil
    justice expense and delay reduction plans adopted by district
    courts may include requirement that representatives "with authority
    to bind [parties] in settlement discussions" be available during
    settlement conferences).
      New paragraphs (13) and (14) are added to call attention to the
    opportunities for structuring of trial under Rule 42 and under
    revised Rules 50 and 52.
      Paragraph (15) is also new. It supplements the power of the court
    to limit the extent of evidence under Rules 403 and 611(a) of the
    Federal Rules of Evidence, which typically would be invoked as a
    result of developments during trial. Limits on the length of trial
    established at a conference in advance of trial can provide the
    parties with a better opportunity to determine priorities and
    exercise selectivity in presenting evidence than when limits are
    imposed during trial. Any such limits must be reasonable under the
    circumstances, and ordinarily the court should impose them only
    after receiving appropriate submissions from the parties outlining
    the nature of the testimony expected to be presented through
    various witnesses, and the expected duration of direct and cross-
    examination.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      The amendment to Rule 16(b) is designed to alert the court to the
    possible need to address the handling of discovery of
    electronically stored information early in the litigation if such
    discovery is expected to occur. Rule 26(f) is amended to direct the
    parties to discuss discovery of electronically stored information
    if such discovery is contemplated in the action. Form 35 is amended
    to call for a report to the court about the results of this
    discussion. In many instances, the court's involvement early in the
    litigation will help avoid difficulties that might otherwise arise.
      Rule 16(b) is also amended to include among the topics that may
    be addressed in the scheduling order any agreements that the
    parties reach to facilitate discovery by minimizing the risk of
    waiver of privilege or work-product protection. Rule 26(f) is
    amended to add to the discovery plan the parties' proposal for the
    court to enter a case-management or other order adopting such an
    agreement. The parties may agree to various arrangements. For
    example, they may agree to initial provision of requested materials
    without waiver of privilege or protection to enable the party
    seeking production to designate the materials desired or protection
    for actual production, with the privilege review of only those
    materials to follow. Alternatively, they may agree that if
    privileged or protected information is inadvertently produced, the
    producing party may by timely notice assert the privilege or
    protection and obtain return of the materials without waiver. Other
    arrangements are possible. In most circumstances, a party who
    receives information under such an arrangement cannot assert that
    production of the information waived a claim of privilege or of
    protection as trial-preparation material.
      An order that includes the parties' agreement may be helpful in
    avoiding delay and excessive cost in discovery. See Manual for
    Complex Litigation (4th) Sec. 11.446. Rule 16(b)(6) recognizes the
    propriety of including such agreements in the court's order. The
    rule does not provide the court with authority to enter such a case-
    management or other order without party agreement, or limit the
    court's authority to act on motion.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. This recommendation
    is of a modified version of the proposal as published. Subdivision
    (b)(6) was modified to eliminate the references to "adopting"
    agreements for "protection against waiving" privilege. It was
    feared that these words might seem to promise greater protection
    than can be assured. In keeping with changes to Rule 26(b)(5)(B),
    subdivision (b)(6) was expanded to include agreements for asserting
    claims of protection as trial-preparation materials. The Committee
    Note was revised to reflect the changes in the rule text.
      The proposed changes from the published rule are set out below.
    [Omitted]

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 16 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      When a party or its representative is not present, it is enough
    to be reasonably available by any suitable means, whether telephone
    or other communication device.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. See Note to Rule 1,

      join, or be substituted into the action. After ratification,
      joinder, or substitution, the action proceeds as if it had been
      originally commenced by the real party in interest.

      (b) Capacity to Sue or Be Sued. Capacity to sue or be sued is
    determined as follows:
        (1) for an individual who is not acting in a representative
      capacity, by the law of the individual's domicile;
        (2) for a corporation, by the law under which it was organized;
      and
        (3) for all other parties, by the law of the state where the
      court is located, except that:
          (A) a partnership or other unincorporated association with no
        such capacity under that state's law may sue or be sued in its
        common name to enforce a substantive right existing under the
        United States Constitution or laws; and
          (B) 28 U.S.C. Secs. 754 and 959(a) govern the capacity of a
        receiver appointed by a United States court to sue or be sued
        in a United States court.

      (c) Minor or Incompetent Person.
        (1) With a Representative. The following representatives may
      sue or defend on behalf of a minor or an incompetent person:
          (A) a general guardian;
          (B) a committee;
          (C) a conservator; or
          (D) a like fiduciary.

        (2) Without a Representative. A minor or an incompetent person
      who does not have a duly appointed representative may sue by a
      next friend or by a guardian ad litem. The court must appoint a
      guardian ad litem - or issue another appropriate order - to
      protect a minor or incompetent person who is unrepresented in an
      action.

      (d) Public Officer's Title and Name. A public officer who sues or
    is sued in an official capacity may be designated by official title
    rather than by name, but the court may order that the officer's
    name be added.

    associations, as declared in the case last cited above. Compare
    Moffat Tunnel League v. United States, 289 U.S. 113 (1933). See
    note to Rule 23, clause (1).

    by or Against Incompetents) with slight additions. Compare the more
    detailed English provisions, English Rules Under the Judicature Act
    (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 16, r.r. 16-21.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      The new matter [in subdivision (b)] makes clear the controlling
    character of Rule 66 regarding suits by or against a federal
    receiver in a federal court.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1948 AMENDMENT       
      Since the statute states the capacity of a federal receiver to
    sue or be sued, a repetitive statement in the rule is confusing and
    undesirable.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      The minor change in the text of the rule is designed to make it
    clear that the specific instances enumerated are not exceptions to,
    but illustrations of, the rule. These illustrations, of course,
    carry no negative implication to the effect that there are not
    other instances of recognition as the real party in interest of one
    whose standing as such may be in doubt. The enumeration is simply
    of cases in which there might be substantial doubt as to the issue
    but for the specific enumeration. There are other potentially
    arguable cases that are not excluded by the enumeration. For
    example, the enumeration states that the promisee in a contract for
    the benefit of a third party may sue as real party in interest; it
    does not say, because it is obvious, that the third-party
    beneficiary may sue (when the applicable law gives him that right.)
      The rule adds to the illustrative list of real parties in
    interest a bailee - meaning, of course, a bailee suing on behalf of
    the bailor with respect to the property bailed. (When the possessor
    of property other than the owner sues for an invasion of the
    possessory interest he is the real party in interest.) The word
    "bailee" is added primarily to preserve the admiralty practice
    whereby the owner of a vessel as bailee of the cargo, or the master
    of the vessel as bailee of both vessel and cargo, sues for damage
    to either property interest or both. But there is no reason to
    limit such a provision to maritime situations. The owner of a
    warehouse in which household furniture is stored is equally
    entitled to sue on behalf of the numerous owners of the furniture
    stored. Cf. Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501 (1947).
      The provision that no action shall be dismissed on the ground
    that it is not prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest
    until a reasonable time has been allowed, after the objection has
    been raised, for ratification, substitution, etc., is added simply
    in the interests of justice. In its origin the rule concerning the
    real party in interest was permissive in purpose: it was designed
    to allow an assignee to sue in his own name. That having been
    accomplished, the modern function of the rule in its negative
    aspect is simply to protect the defendant against a subsequent
    action by the party actually entitled to recover, and to insure
    generally that the judgment will have its proper effect as res
    judicata.
      This provision keeps pace with the law as it is actually
    developing. Modern decisions are inclined to be lenient when an
    honest mistake has been made in choosing the party in whose name
    the action is to be filed - in both maritime and nonmaritime cases.
    See Levinson v. Deupree, 345 U.S. 648 (1953); Link Aviation, Inc.
    v. Downs, 325 F.2d 613 (D.C.Cir. 1963). The provision should not be
    misunderstood or distorted. It is intended to prevent forfeiture
    when determination of the proper party to sue is difficult or when
    an understandable mistake has been made. It does not mean, for
    example, that, following an airplane crash in which all aboard were
    killed, an action may be filed in the name of John Doe (a
    fictitious person), as personal representative of Richard Roe
    (another fictitious person), in the hope that at a later time the
    attorney filing the action may substitute the real name of the real
    personal representative of a real victim, and have the benefit of
    suspension of the limitation period. It does not even mean, when an
    action is filed by the personal representative of John Smith, of
    Buffalo, in the good faith belief that he was aboard the flight,
    that upon discovery that Smith is alive and well, having missed the
    fatal flight, the representative of James Brown, of San Francisco,
    an actual victim, can be substituted to take advantage of the
    suspension of the limitation period. It is, in cases of this sort,
    intended to insure against forfeiture and injustice - in short, to
    codify in broad terms the salutary principle of Levinson v.
    Deupree, 345 U.S. 648 (1953), and Link Aviation, Inc. v. Downs, 325
    F.2d 613 (D.C.Cir. 1963).

    Rule 18. Joinder of Claims

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. A party asserting a claim, counterclaim,
    crossclaim, or third-party claim may join, as independent or
    alternative claims, as many claims as it has against an opposing
    party.
      (b) Joinder of Contingent Claims. A party may join two claims
    even though one of them is contingent on the disposition of the
    other; but the court may grant relief only in accordance with the
    parties' relative substantive rights. In particular, a plaintiff
    may state a claim for money and a claim to set aside a conveyance
    that is fraudulent as to that plaintiff, without first obtaining a
    judgment for the money.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      Note to Subdivision (a). 1. Recent development, both in code and
    common law states, has been toward unlimited joinder of actions.
    See Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937) ch. 110, Sec. 168; N.J.S.A. 2:27-37, as
    modified by N.J.Sup.Ct.Rules, Rule 21, 2 N.J.Misc. 1208 (1924);
    N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) Sec. 258 as amended by Laws of 1935, ch. 339.
      2. This provision for joinder of actions has been patterned upon
    [former] Equity Rule 26 (Joinder of Causes of Action) and broadened
    to include multiple parties. Compare the English practice, English
    Rules Under the Judicature Act (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 18,
    r.r. 1-9 (noting rules 1 and 6). The earlier American codes set
    forth classes of joinder, following the now abandoned New York
    rule. See N.Y.C.P.A. Sec. 258 before amended in 1935; Compare
    Kan.Gen.Stat.Ann. (1935) Sec. 60-601; Wis.Stat. (1935) Sec. 263.04
    for the more liberal practice.
      3. The provisions of this rule for the joinder of claims are
    subject to Rule 82 (Jurisdiction and Venue Unaffected). For the
    jurisdictional aspects of joinder of claims, see Shulman and
    Jaegerman, Some Jurisdictional Limitations on Federal Procedure
    (1936), 45 Yale L.J. 393, 397-410. For separate trials of joined
    claims, see Rule 42(b).
      Note to Subdivision (b). This rule is inserted to make it clear
    that in a single action a party should be accorded all the relief
    to which he is entitled regardless of whether it is legal or
    equitable or both. This necessarily includes a deficiency judgment
    in foreclosure actions formerly provided for in [former] Equity
    Rule 10 (Decree for Deficiency in Foreclosures, Etc.). In respect
    to fraudulent conveyances the rule changes the former rule
    requiring a prior judgment against the owner (Braun v. American
    Laundry Mach. Co., 56 F.(2d) 197 (S.D.N.Y. 1932)) to conform to the
    provisions of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, Secs. 9 and
    10. See McLaughlin, Application of the Uniform Fraudulent
    Conveyance Act, 46 Harv.L.Rev. 404, 444 (1933).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      The Rules "proceed upon the theory that no inconvenience can
    result from the joinder of any two or more matters in the
    pleadings, but only from trying two or more matters together which
    have little or nothing in common." Sunderland, The New Federal
    Rules, 45 W.Va.L.Q. 5, 13 (1938); see Clark, Code Pleading 58 (2d
    ed. 1947). Accordingly, Rule 18(a) has permitted a party to plead
    multiple claims of all types against an opposing party, subject to
    the court's power to direct an appropriate procedure for trying the
    claims. See Rules 42(b), 20(b), 21.
      The liberal policy regarding joinder of claims in the pleadings
    extends to cases with multiple parties. However, the language used
    in the second sentence of Rule 18(a) - "if the requirements of
    Rules 19 [necessary joinder of parties], 20 [permissive joinder of
    parties], and 22 [interpleader] are satisfied" - has led some
    courts to infer that the rules regulating joinder of parties are
    intended to carry back to Rule 18(a) and to impose some special
    limits on joinder of claims in multiparty cases. In particular,
    Rule 20(a) has been read as restricting the operation of Rule 18(a)
    in certain situations in which a number of parties have been
    permissively joined in an action. In Federal Housing Admr. v.
    Christianson, 26 F.Supp. 419 (D.Conn. 1939), the indorsee of two
    notes sued the three comakers of one note, and sought to join in
    the action a count on a second note which had been made by two of
    the three defendants. There was no doubt about the propriety of the
    joinder of the three parties defendant, for a right to relief was
    being asserted against all three defendants which arose out of a
    single "transaction" (the first note) and a question of fact or law
    "common" to all three defendants would arise in the action. See the
    text of Rule 20(a). The court, however, refused to allow the
    joinder of the count on the second note, on the ground that this
    right to relief, assumed to arise from a distinct transaction, did
    not involve a question common to all the defendants but only two of
    them. For analysis of the Christianson case and other authorities,
    see 2 Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice & Procedure, Sec. 533.1
    (Wright ed. 1961); 3 Moore's Federal Practice, par. 18.04[3] (2d
    ed. 1963).
      If the court's view is followed, it becomes necessary to enter at
    the pleading stage into speculations about the exact relation
    between the claim sought to be joined against fewer than all the
    defendants properly joined in the action, and the claims asserted
    against all the defendants. Cf. Wright, Joinder of Claims and
    Parties Under Modern Pleading Rules, 36 Minn.L.Rev. 580, 605-06
    (1952). Thus if it could be found in the Christianson situation
    that the claim on the second note arose out of the same transaction
    as the claim on the first or out of a transaction forming part of a
    "series," and that any question of fact or law with respect to the
    second note also arose with regard to the first, it would be held
    that the claim on the second note could be joined in the complaint.
    See 2 Barron & Holtzoff, supra, at 199; see also id. at 198 n.
    60.4; cf. 3 Moore's Federal Practice, supra, at 1811. Such pleading
    niceties provide a basis for delaying and wasteful maneuver. It is
    more compatible with the design of the Rules to allow the claim to
    be joined in the pleading, leaving the question of possible
    separate trial of that claim to be later decided. See 2 Barron &
    Holtzoff, supra, Sec. 533.1; Wright, supra, 36 Minn.L.Rev. at 604-
    11; Developments in the Law - Multiparty Litigation in the Federal
    Courts, 71 Harv. 874, 970-71 (1958); Commentary, Relation Between
    Joinder of Parties and Joinder of Claims, 5 F.R.Serv. 822 (1942).
    It is instructive to note that the court in the Christianson case,
    while holding that the claim on the second note could not be joined
    as a matter of pleading, held open the possibility that both claims
    would later be consolidated for trial under Rule 42(a). See 26
    F.Supp. 419.
      Rule 18(a) is now amended not only to overcome the Christianson
    decision and similar authority, but also to state clearly as a
    comprehensive proposition, that a party asserting a claim (an
    original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim)
    may join as many claims as he has against an opposing party. See
    Noland Co., Inc. v. Graver Tank & Mfg. Co., 301 F.2d 43, 49-51 (4th
    Cir. 1962); but cf. C. W. Humphrey Co. v. Security Alum. Co., 31
    F.R.D. 41 (E.D.Mich. 1962) This permitted joinder of claims is not
    affected by the fact that there are multiple parties in the action.
    The joinder of parties is governed by other rules operating
    independently.
      It is emphasized that amended Rule 18(a) deals only with
    pleading. As already indicated, a claim properly joined as a matter
    of pleading need not be proceeded with together with the other
    claim if fairness or convenience justifies separate treatment.
      Amended Rule 18(a), like the rule prior to amendment, does not
    purport to deal with questions of jurisdiction or venue which may
    arise with respect to claims properly joined as a matter of
    pleading. See Rule 82.
      See also the amendment of Rule 20(a) and the Advisory Committee's
    Note thereto.
      Free joinder of claims and remedies is one of the basic purposes
    of unification of the admiralty and civil procedure. The amendment
    accordingly provides for the inclusion in the rule of maritime
    claims as well as those which are legal and equitable in character.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 18 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Modification of the obscure former reference to a claim
    "heretofore cognizable only after another claim has been prosecuted
    to a conclusion" avoids any uncertainty whether Rule 18(b)'s
    meaning is fixed by retrospective inquiry from some particular
    date.

    TITLE IV. PARTIES

-HEAD-
    Rule 19. Required Joinder of Parties

-STATUTE-
      (a) Persons Required to Be Joined if Feasible.
        (1) Required Party. A person who is subject to service of
      process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of subject-
      matter jurisdiction must be joined as a party if:
          (A) in that person's absence, the court cannot accord
        complete relief among existing parties; or
          (B) that person claims an interest relating to the subject of
        the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in
        the person's absence may:
            (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's
          ability to protect the interest; or
            (ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk
          of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent
          obligations because of the interest.

        (2) Joinder by Court Order. If a person has not been joined as
      required, the court must order that the person be made a party. A
      person who refuses to join as a plaintiff may be made either a
      defendant or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff.
        (3) Venue. If a joined party objects to venue and the joinder
      would make venue improper, the court must dismiss that party.

      (b) When Joinder Is Not Feasible. If a person who is required to
    be joined if feasible cannot be joined, the court must determine
    whether, in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed
    among the existing parties or should be dismissed. The factors for
    the court to consider include:
        (1) the extent to which a judgment rendered in the person's
      absence might prejudice that person or the existing parties;
        (2) the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or
      avoided by:
          (A) protective provisions in the judgment;
          (B) shaping the relief; or
          (C) other measures;

        (3) whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence would
      be adequate; and
        (4) whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the
      action were dismissed for nonjoinder.

      (c) Pleading the Reasons for Nonjoinder. When asserting a claim
    for relief, a party must state:
        (1) the name, if known, of any person who is required to be
      joined if feasible but is not joined; and
        (2) the reasons for not joining that person.

      (d) Exception for Class Actions. This rule is subject to Rule 23.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       

                          GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS                      
      Whenever feasible, the persons materially interested in the
    subject of an action - see the more detailed description of these
    persons in the discussion of new subdivision (a) below - should be
    joined as parties so that they may be heard and a complete
    disposition made. When this comprehensive joinder cannot be
    accomplished - a situation which may be encountered in Federal
    courts because of limitations on service of process, subject matter
    jurisdiction, and venue - the case should be examined pragmatically
    and a choice made between the alternatives of proceeding with the
    action in the absence of particular interested persons, and
    dismissing the action.
      Even if the court is mistaken in its decision to proceed in the
    absence of an interested person, it does not by that token deprive
    itself of the power to adjudicate as between the parties already
    before it through proper service of process. But the court can make
    a legally binding adjudication only between the parties actually
    joined in the action. It is true that an adjudication between the
    parties before the court may on occasion adversely affect the
    absent person as a practical matter, or leave a party exposed to a
    later inconsistent recovery by the absent person. These are factors
    which should be considered in deciding whether the action should
    proceed, or should rather be dismissed; but they do not themselves
    negate the court's power to adjudicate as between the parties who
    have been joined.

                       DEFECTS IN THE ORIGINAL RULE                   
      The foregoing propositions were well understood in the older
    equity practice, see Hazard, Indispensable Party: The Historical
    Origin of a Procedural Phantom, 61 Colum.L.Rev. 1254 (1961), and
    Rule 19 could be and often was applied in consonance with them. But
    experience showed that the rule was defective in its phrasing and
    did not point clearly to the proper basis of decision.
      Textual defects. - (1) The expression "persons * * * who ought to
    be parties if complete relief is to be accorded between those
    already parties," appearing in original subdivision (b), was
    apparently intended as a description of the persons whom it would
    be desirable to join in the action, all questions of feasibility of
    joinder being put to one side; but it was not adequately
    descriptive of those persons.
      (2) The word "Indispensable," appearing in original subdivision
    (b), was apparently intended as an inclusive reference to the
    interested persons in whose absence it would be advisable, all
    factors having been considered, to dismiss the action. Yet the
    sentence implied that there might be interested persons, not
    "indispensable." in whose absence the action ought also to be
    dismissed. Further, it seemed at least superficially plausible to
    equate the word "indispensable" with the expression "having a joint
    interest," appearing in subdivision (a). See United States v.
    Washington Inst. of Tech., Inc., 138 F.2d 25, 26 (3d Cir. 1943);
    cf. Chidester v. City of Newark, 162 F.2d 598 (3d Cir. 1947). But
    persons holding an interest technically "joint" are not always so
    related to an action that it would be unwise to proceed without
    joining all of them, whereas persons holding an interest not
    technically "joint" may have this relation to an action. See Reed,
    Compulsory Joinder of Parties in Civil Actions, 55 Mich.L.Rev. 327,
    356 ff., 483 (1957).
      (3) The use of "indispensable" and "joint interest" in the
    context of original Rule 19 directed attention to the technical or
    abstract character of the rights or obligations of the persons
    whose joinder was in question, and correspondingly distracted
    attention from the pragmatic considerations which should be
    controlling.
      (4) The original rule, in dealing with the feasibility of joining
    a person as a party to the action, besides referring to whether the
    person was "subject to the jurisdiction of the court as to both
    service of process and venue," spoke of whether the person could be
    made a party "without depriving the court of jurisdiction of the
    parties before it." The second quoted expression used
    "jurisdiction" in the sense of the competence of the court over the
    subject matter of the action, and in this sense the expression was
    apt. However, by a familiar confusion, the expression seems to have
    suggested to some that the absence from the lawsuit of a person who
    was "indispensable" or "who ought to be [a] part[y]" itself
    deprived the court of the power to adjudicate as between the
    parties already joined. See Samuel Goldwyn, Inc. v. United Artists
    Corp., 113 F.2d 703, 707 (3d Cir. 1940); McArthur v. Rosenbaum Co.
    of Pittsburgh, 180 F.2d 617, 621 (3d Cir. 1949); cf. Calcote v.
    Texas Pac. Coal & Oil Co., 157 F.2d 216 (5th Cir. 1946), cert.
    denied, 329 U.S. 782 (1946), noted in 56 Yale L.J. 1088 (1947);
    Reed, supra, 55 Mich.L.Rev. at 332-34.
      Failure to point to correct basis of decision. The original rule
    did not state affirmatively what factors were relevant in deciding
    whether the action should proceed or be dismissed when joinder of
    interested persons was infeasible. In some instances courts did not
    undertake the relevant inquiry or were misled by the "jurisdiction"
    fallacy. In other instances there was undue preoccupation with
    abstract classifications of rights or obligations, as against
    consideration of the particular consequences of proceeding with the
    action and the ways by which these consequences might be
    ameliorated by the shaping of final relief or other precautions.
      Although these difficulties cannot be said to have been general
    analysis of the cases showed that there was good reason for
    attempting to strengthen the rule. The literature also indicated
    how the rule should be reformed. See Reed, supra (discussion of the
    important case of Shields v. Barrow, 17 How. (58 U.S.) 130 (1854),
    appears at 55 Mich.L.Rev., p. 340 ff.); Hazard, supra; N.Y.

    1957, No. 6(b), pp. 28, 233; N.Y. Judicial Council, Twelfth
    Ann.Rep., Legis.Doc. 1946, No. 17, p. 163; Joint Comm. on Michigan

    Rules, R. 205 (effective Jan. 1, 1963); N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law & Rules,

                             THE AMENDED RULE                         
      New subdivision (a) defines the persons whose joinder in the
    action is desirable. Clause (1) stresses the desirability of
    joining those persons in whose absence the court would be obliged
    to grant partial or "hollow" rather than complete relief to the
    parties before the court. The interests that are being furthered
    here are not only those of the parties, but also that of the public
    in avoiding repeated lawsuits on the same essential subject matter.
    Clause (2)(i) recognizes the importance of protecting the person
    whose joinder is in question against the practical prejudice to him
    which may arise through a disposition of the action in his absence.
    Clause (2)(ii) recognizes the need for considering whether a party
    may be left, after the adjudication, in a position where a person
    not joined can subject him to a double or otherwise inconsistent
    liability. See Reed, supra, 55 Mich.L.Rev. at 330, 338; Note,
    supra, 65 Harv.L.Rev. at 1052-57; Developments in the Law, supra,
    71 Harv.L.Rev. at 881-85.
      The subdivision (a) definition of persons to be joined is not
    couched in terms of the abstract nature of their interests -
    "joint," "united," "separable," or the like. See N.Y. Temporary
    Comm. on Courts, First Preliminary Report, supra; Developments in
    the Law, supra, at 880. It should be noted particularly, however,
    that the description is not at variance with the settled
    authorities holding that a tortfeasor with the usual "joint-and-
    several" liability is merely a permissive party to an action
    against another with like liability. See 3 Moore's Federal Practice
    2153 (2d ed. 1963); 2 Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice &
    Procedure Sec. 513.8 (Wright ed. 1961). Joinder of these
    tortfeasors continues to be regulated by Rule 20; compare Rule 14
    on third-party practice.
      If a person as described in subdivision (a)(1)(2) is amenable to
    service of process and his joinder would not deprive the court of
    jurisdiction in the sense of competence over the action, he should
    be joined as a party; and if he has not been joined, the court
    should order him to be brought into the action. If a party joined
    has a valid objection to the venue and chooses to assert it, he
    will be dismissed from the action.
      Subdivision (b). - When a person as described in subdivision
    (a)(1)-(2) cannot be made a party, the court is to determine
    whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed
    among the parties already before it, or should be dismissed. That
    this decision is to be made in the light of pragmatic
    considerations has often been acknowledged by the courts. See Roos
    v. Texas Co., 23 F.2d 171 (2d Cir. 1927), cert. denied, 277 U.S.
    587 (1928); Niles-Bement-Pond Co. v. Iron Moulders, Union, 254 U.S.
    77, 80 (1920). The subdivision sets out four relevant
    considerations drawn from the experience revealed in the decided
    cases. The factors are to a certain extent overlapping, and they
    are not intended to exclude other considerations which may be
    applicable in particular situations.
      The first factor brings in a consideration of what a judgment in
    the action would mean to the absentee. Would the absentee be
    adversely affected in a practical sense, and if so, would the
    prejudice be immediate and serious, or remote and minor? The
    possible collateral consequences of the judgment upon the parties
    already joined are also to be appraised. Would any party be exposed
    to a fresh action by the absentee, and if so, how serious is the
    threat? See the elaborate discussion in Reed, supra; cf. A. L.
    Smith Iron Co. v. Dickson, 141 F.2d 3 (2d Cir. 1944); Caldwell Mfg.
    Co. v. Unique Balance Co., 18 F.R.D. 258 (S.D.N.Y. 1955).
      The second factor calls attention to the measures by which
    prejudice may be averted or lessened. The "shaping of relief" is a
    familiar expedient to this end. See, e.g., the award of money
    damages in lieu of specific relief where the latter might affect an
    absentee adversely. Ward v. Deavers, 203 F.2d 72 (D.C.Cir. 1953);
    Miller & Lux, Inc. v. Nickel, 141 F.Supp. 41 (N.D.Calif. 1956). On
    the use of "protective provisions," see Roos v. Texas Co., supra;
    Atwood v. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Co., 275 Fed. 513, 519 (1st Cir.
    1921), cert. denied, 257 U.S. 661 (1922); cf. Stumpf v. Fidelity
    Gas Co., 294 F.2d 886 (9th Cir. 1961); and the general statement in
    National Licorice Co. v. Labor Board, 309 U.S. 350, 363 (1940).
      Sometimes the party is himself able to take measures to avoid
    prejudice. Thus a defendant faced with a prospect of a second suit
    by an absentee may be in a position to bring the latter into the
    action by defensive interpleader. See Hudson v. Newell, 172 F.2d
    848, 852 mod., 176 F.2d 546 (5th Cir. 1949); Gauss v. Kirk, 198
    F.2d 83, 86 (D.C.Cir. 1952); Abel v. Brayton Flying Service, Inc.,
    248 F.2d 713, 716 (5th Cir. 1957) (suggestion of possibility of
    counterclaim under Rule 13(h)); cf. Parker Rust-Proof Co. v.
    Western Union Tel. Co., 105 F.2d 976 (2d Cir. 1939) cert. denied,
    308 U.S. 597 (1939). See also the absentee may sometimes be able to
    avert prejudice to himself by voluntarily appearing in the action
    or intervening on an ancillary basis. See Developments in the Law,
    supra, 71 Harv.L.Rev. at 882; Annot., Intervention or Subsequent
    Joinder of Parties as Affecting Jurisdiction of Federal Court Based
    on Diversity of Citizenship, 134 A.L.R. 335 (1941); Johnson v.
    Middleton, 175 F.2d 535 (7th Cir. 1949); Kentucky Nat. Gas Corp. v.
    Duggins, 165 F.2d 1011 (6th Cir. 1948); McComb v. McCormack, 159
    F.2d 219 (5th Cir. 1947). The court should consider whether this,
    in turn, would impose undue hardship on the absentee. (For the
    possibility of the court's informing an absentee of the pendency of
    the action, see comment under subdivision (c) below.)
      The third factor - whether an "adequate" judgment can be rendered
    in the absence of a given person - calls attention to the extent of
    the relief that can be accorded among the parties joined. It meshes
    with the other factors, especially the "shaping of relief"
    mentioned under the second factor. Cf. Kroese v. General Steel
    Castings Corp., 179 F.2d 760 (3d Cir. 1949), cert. denied, 339 U.S.
    983 (1950).
      The fourth factor, looking to the practical effects of a
    dismissal, indicates that the court should consider whether there
    is any assurance that the plaintiff, if dismissed, could sue
    effectively in another forum where better joinder would be
    possible. See Fitzgerald v. Haynes, 241 F.2d 417, 420 (3d Cir.
    1957); Fouke v. Schenewerk, 197 F.2d 234, 236 (5th Cir. 1952); cf.
    Warfield v. Marks, 190 F.2d 178 (5th Cir. 1951).
      The subdivision uses the word "indispensable" only in a
    conclusory sense, that is, a person is "regarded as indispensable"
    when he cannot be made a party and, upon consideration of the
    factors above mention, it is determined that in his absence it
    would be preferable to dismiss the action, rather than to retain
    it.
      A person may be added as a party at any stage of the action on
    motion or on the court's initiative (see Rule 21); and a motion to
    dismiss, on the ground that a person has not been joined and
    justice requires that the action should not proceed in his absence,
    may be made as late as the trial on the merits (see Rule 12(h)(2),
    as amended; cf. Rule 12(b)(7), as amended). However, when the
    moving party is seeking dismissal in order to protect himself
    against a later suit by the absent person (subdivision (a)(2)(ii)),
    and is not seeking vicariously to protect the absent person against
    a prejudicial judgment (subdivision (a)(2)(i)), his undue delay in
    making the motion can properly be counted against him as a reason
    for denying the motion. A joinder question should be decided with
    reasonable promptness, but decision may properly be deferred if
    adequate information is not available at the time. Thus the
    relationship of an absent person to the action, and the practical
    effects of an adjudication upon him and others, may not be
    sufficiently revealed at the pleading stage; in such a case it
    would be appropriate to defer decision until the action was further
    advanced. Cf. Rule 12(d).
      The amended rule makes no special provision for the problem
    arising in suits against subordinate Federal officials where it has
    often been set up as a defense that some superior officer must be
    joined. Frequently this defense has been accompanied by or
    intermingled with defenses of sovereign community or lack of
    consent of the United States to suit. So far as the issue of
    joinder can be isolated from the rest, the new subdivision seems
    better adapted to handle it than the predecessor provision. See the
    discussion in Johnson v. Kirkland, 290 F.2d 440, 446-47 (5th Cir.
    1961) (stressing the practical orientation of the decisions);
    Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U.S. 48, 54 (1955). Recent
    legislation, P.L. 87-748, 76 Stat. 744, approved October 5, 1962,
    adding Secs. 1361, 1391(e) to Title 28, U.S.C., vests original
    jurisdiction in the District Courts over actions in the nature of
    mandamus to compel officials of the United States to perform their
    legal duties, and extends the range of service of process and
    liberalizes venue in these actions. If, then, it is found that a
    particular official should be joined in the action, the legislation
    will make it easy to bring him in.
      Subdivision (c) parallels the predecessor subdivision (c) of Rule
    19. In some situations it may be desirable to advise a person who
    has not been joined of the fact that the action is pending, and in
    particular cases the court in its discretion may itself convey this
    information by directing a letter or other informal notice to the
    absentee.
      Subdivision (d) repeats the exception contained in the first
    clause of the predecessor subdivision (a).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 19 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Former Rule 19(b) described the conclusion that an action should
    be dismissed for inability to join a Rule 19(a) party by carrying
    forward traditional terminology: "the absent person being thus
    regarded as indispensable." "Indispensable" was used only to
    express a conclusion reached by applying the tests of Rule 19(b).
    It has been discarded as redundant.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Persons Who May Join or Be Joined.
        (1) Plaintiffs. Persons may join in one action as plaintiffs
      if:
          (A) they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or in
        the alternative with respect to or arising out of the same
        transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or
        occurrences; and
          (B) any question of law or fact common to all plaintiffs will
        arise in the action.

        (2) Defendants. Persons - as well as a vessel, cargo, or other
      property subject to admiralty process in rem - may be joined in
      one action as defendants if:
          (A) any right to relief is asserted against them jointly,
        severally, or in the alternative with respect to or arising out
        of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions
        or occurrences; and
          (B) any question of law or fact common to all defendants will
        arise in the action.

        (3) Extent of Relief. Neither a plaintiff nor a defendant need
      be interested in obtaining or defending against all the relief
      demanded. The court may grant judgment to one or more plaintiffs
      according to their rights, and against one or more defendants
      according to their liabilities.

      (b) Protective Measures. The court may issue orders - including
    an order for separate trials - to protect a party against
    embarrassment, delay, expense, or other prejudice that arises from
    including a person against whom the party asserts no claim and who
    asserts no claim against the party.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      The provisions for joinder here stated are in substance the
    provisions found in England, California, Illinois, New Jersey, and
    New York. They represent only a moderate expansion of the present
    federal equity practice to cover both law and equity actions.
      With this rule compare also [former] Equity Rules 26 (Joinder of
    Causes of Action), 37 (Parties Generally - Intervention), 40
    (Nominal Parties), and 42 (Joint and Several Demands).
      The provisions of this rule for the joinder of parties are
    subject to Rule 82 (Jurisdiction and Venue Unaffected).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      See the amendment of Rule 18(a) and the Advisory Committee's Note
    thereto. It has been thought that a lack of clarity in the
    antecedent of the word "them," as it appeared in two places in Rule
    20(a), contributed to the view, taken by some courts, that this
    rule limited the joinder of claims in certain situations of
    permissive party joinder. Although the amendment of Rule 18(a)
    should make clear that this view is untenable, it has been
    considered advisable to amend Rule 20(a) to eliminate any
    ambiguity. See 2 Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice & Procedure
    202 (Wright Ed. 1961).
      A basic purpose of unification of admiralty and civil procedure
    is to reduce barriers to joinder; hence the reference to "any
    vessel," etc.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 20 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

      Misjoinder of parties is not a ground for dismissing an action.

-HEAD-
    Rule 22. Interpleader

-STATUTE-
      (a) Grounds.
        (1) By a Plaintiff. Persons with claims that may expose a
      plaintiff to double or multiple liability may be joined as
      defendants and required to interplead. Joinder for interpleader
      is proper even though:
          (A) the claims of the several claimants, or the titles on
        which their claims depend, lack a common origin or are adverse
        and independent rather than identical; or
          (B) the plaintiff denies liability in whole or in part to any
        or all of the claimants.

        (2) By a Defendant. A defendant exposed to similar liability
      may seek interpleader through a crossclaim or counterclaim.

      (b) Relation to Other Rules and Statutes. This rule supplements -
    and does not limit - the joinder of parties allowed by Rule 20. The
    remedy this rule provides is in addition to - and does not
    supersede or limit - the remedy provided by 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1335,
    1397, and 2361. An action under those statutes must be conducted
    under these rules.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      The first paragraph provides for interpleader relief along the
    newer and more liberal lines of joinder in the alternative. It
    avoids the confusion and restrictions that developed around actions
    of strict interpleader and actions in the nature of interpleader.
    Compare John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Kegan et al.,
    (D.C.Md., 1938) [22 F.Supp. 326]. It does not change the rules on
    service of process, jurisdiction, and venue, as established by
    judicial decision.
      The second paragraph allows an action to be brought under the
    recent interpleader statute when applicable. By this paragraph all
    remedies under the statute are continued, but the manner of
    obtaining them is in accordance with these rules. For temporary
    restraining orders and preliminary injunctions under this statute,
    see Rule 65(e).
      This rule substantially continues such statutory provisions as
    U.S.C., Title 38, Sec. 445 [now 1984] (Actions on claims;
    jurisdiction; parties; procedure; limitation; witnesses;
    definitions) (actions upon veterans' contracts of insurance with
    the United States), providing for interpleader by the United States
    where it acknowledges indebtedness under a contract of insurance
    with the United States; U.S.C., Title 49, Sec. 97 [now 80110(e)]
    (Interpleader of conflicting claimants) (by carrier which has
    issued bill of lading). See Chafee, The Federal Interpleader Act of
    1936: I and II (1936), 45 Yale L.J. 963, 1161.

      The amendment substitutes the present statutory reference.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT

-EXPCITE-
    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE IV. PARTIES

-HEAD-
    Rule 23. Class Actions

-STATUTE-
      (a) Prerequisites. One or more members of a class may sue or be
    sued as representative parties on behalf of all members only if:
        (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is
      impracticable;
        (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class;
        (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are
      typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and
        (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately
      protect the interests of the class.

      (b) Types of Class Actions. A class action may be maintained if
    Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if:
        (1) prosecuting separate actions by or against individual class
      members would create a risk of:
          (A) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to
        individual class members that would establish incompatible
        standards of conduct for the party opposing the class; or
          (B) adjudications with respect to individual class members
        that, as a practical matter, would be dispositive of the
        interests of the other members not parties to the individual
        adjudications or would substantially impair or impede their
        ability to protect their interests;

        (2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on
      grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final
      injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is
      appropriate respecting the class as a whole; or
        (3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to
      class members predominate over any questions affecting only
      individual members, and that a class action is superior to other
      available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the
      controversy. The matters pertinent to these findings include:
          (A) the class members' interests in individually controlling
        the prosecution or defense of separate actions;
          (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the
        controversy already begun by or against class members;
          (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the
        litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and
          (D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action.

      (c) Certification Order; Notice to Class Members; Judgment;
    Issues Classes; Subclasses.
        (1) Certification Order.
          (A) Time to Issue. At an early practicable time after a
        person sues or is sued as a class representative, the court
        must determine by order whether to certify the action as a
        class action.
          (B) Defining the Class; Appointing Class Counsel. An order
        that certifies a class action must define the class and the
        class claims, issues, or defenses, and must appoint class
        counsel under Rule 23(g).
          (C) Altering or Amending the Order. An order that grants or
        denies class certification may be altered or amended before
        final judgment.

        (2) Notice.
          (A) For (b)(1) or (b)(2) Classes. For any class certified
        under Rule 23(b)(1) or (b)(2), the court may direct appropriate
        notice to the class.
          (B) For (b)(3) Classes. For any class certified under Rule
        23(b)(3), the court must direct to class members the best
        notice that is practicable under the circumstances, including
        individual notice to all members who can be identified through
        reasonable effort. The notice must clearly and concisely state
        in plain, easily understood language:
            (i) the nature of the action;
            (ii) the definition of the class certified;
            (iii) the class claims, issues, or defenses;
            (iv) that a class member may enter an appearance through an
          attorney if the member so desires;
            (v) that the court will exclude from the class any member
          who requests exclusion;
            (vi) the time and manner for requesting exclusion; and
            (vii) the binding effect of a class judgment on members
          under Rule 23(c)(3).

        (3) Judgment. Whether or not favorable to the class, the
      judgment in a class action must:
          (A) for any class certified under Rule 23(b)(1) or (b)(2),
        include and describe those whom the court finds to be class
        members; and
          (B) for any class certified under Rule 23(b)(3), include and
        specify or describe those to whom the Rule 23(c)(2) notice was
        directed, who have not requested exclusion, and whom the court
        finds to be class members.

        (4) Particular Issues. When appropriate, an action may be
      brought or maintained as a class action with respect to
      particular issues.
        (5) Subclasses. When appropriate, a class may be divided into
      subclasses that are each treated as a class under this rule.

      (d) Conducting the Action.
        (1) In General. In conducting an action under this rule, the
      court may issue orders that:
          (A) determine the course of proceedings or prescribe measures
        to prevent undue repetition or complication in presenting
        evidence or argument;
          (B) require - to protect class members and fairly conduct the
        action - giving appropriate notice to some or all class members
        of:
            (i) any step in the action;
            (ii) the proposed extent of the judgment; or
            (iii) the members' opportunity to signify whether they
          consider the representation fair and adequate, to intervene
          and present claims or defenses, or to otherwise come into the
          action;

          (C) impose conditions on the representative parties or on
        intervenors;
          (D) require that the pleadings be amended to eliminate
        allegations about representation of absent persons and that the
        action proceed accordingly; or
          (E) deal with similar procedural matters.

        (2) Combining and Amending Orders. An order under Rule 23(d)(1)
      may be altered or amended from time to time and may be combined
      with an order under Rule 16.

      (e) Settlement, Voluntary Dismissal, or Compromise. The claims,
    issues, or defenses of a certified class may be settled,
    voluntarily dismissed, or compromised only with the court's
    approval. The following procedures apply to a proposed settlement,
    voluntary dismissal, or compromise:
        (1) The court must direct notice in a reasonable manner to all
      class members who would be bound by the proposal.
        (2) If the proposal would bind class members, the court may
      approve it only after a hearing and on finding that it is fair,
      reasonable, and adequate.
        (3) The parties seeking approval must file a statement
      identifying any agreement made in connection with the proposal.
        (4) If the class action was previously certified under Rule
      23(b)(3), the court may refuse to approve a settlement unless it
      affords a new opportunity to request exclusion to individual
      class members who had an earlier opportunity to request exclusion
      but did not do so.
        (5) Any class member may object to the proposal if it requires
      court approval under this subdivision (e); the objection may be
      withdrawn only with the court's approval.

      (f) Appeals. A court of appeals may permit an appeal from an
    order granting or denying class-action certification under this
    rule if a petition for permission to appeal is filed with the
    circuit clerk within 14 days after the order is entered. An appeal
    does not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district
    judge or the court of appeals so orders.
      (g) Class Counsel.
        (1) Appointing Class Counsel. Unless a statute provides
      otherwise, a court that certifies a class must appoint class
      counsel. In appointing class counsel, the court:
          (A) must consider:
            (i) the work counsel has done in identifying or
          investigating potential claims in the action;
            (ii) counsel's experience in handling class actions, other
          complex litigation, and the types of claims asserted in the
          action;
            (iii) counsel's knowledge of the applicable law; and
            (iv) the resources that counsel will commit to representing
          the class;

          (B) may consider any other matter pertinent to counsel's
        ability to fairly and adequately represent the interests of the
        class;
          (C) may order potential class counsel to provide information
        on any subject pertinent to the appointment and to propose
        terms for attorney's fees and nontaxable costs;
          (D) may include in the appointing order provisions about the
        award of attorney's fees or nontaxable costs under Rule 23(h);
        and
          (E) may make further orders in connection with the
        appointment.

        (2) Standard for Appointing Class Counsel. When one applicant
      seeks appointment as class counsel, the court may appoint that
      applicant only if the applicant is adequate under Rule 23(g)(1)
      and (4). If more than one adequate applicant seeks appointment,
      the court must appoint the applicant best able to represent the
      interests of the class.
        (3) Interim Counsel. The court may designate interim counsel to
      act on behalf of a putative class before determining whether to
      certify the action as a class action.
        (4) Duty of Class Counsel. Class counsel must fairly and
      adequately represent the interests of the class.

      (h) Attorney's Fees and Nontaxable Costs. In a certified class
    action, the court may award reasonable attorney's fees and
    nontaxable costs that are authorized by law or by the parties'
    agreement. The following procedures apply:
        (1) A claim for an award must be made by motion under Rule
      54(d)(2), subject to the provisions of this subdivision (h), at a
      time the court sets. Notice of the motion must be served on all
      parties and, for motions by class counsel, directed to class
      members in a reasonable manner.
        (2) A class member, or a party from whom payment is sought, may
      object to the motion.
        (3) The court may hold a hearing and must find the facts and
      state its legal conclusions under Rule 52(a).
        (4) The court may refer issues related to the amount of the
      award to a special master or a magistrate judge, as provided in
      Rule 54(d)(2)(D).

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      Note to Subdivision (a). This is a substantial restatement of
    [former] Equity Rule 38 (Representatives of Class) as that rule has
    been construed. It applies to all actions, whether formerly
    denominated legal or equitable. For a general analysis of class
    actions, effect of judgment, and requisites of jurisdiction see
    Moore, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: Some Problems Raised by
    the Preliminary Draft, 25 Georgetown L.J. 551, 570 et seq. (1937);
    Moore and Cohn, Federal Class Actions, 32 Ill.L.Rev. 307 (1937);
    Moore and Cohn, Federal Class Actions - Jurisdiction and Effect of
    Judgment, 32 Ill.L.Rev. 555 - 567 (1938); Lesar, Class Suits and
    the Federal Rules, 22 Minn.L.Rev. 34 (1937); cf. Arnold and James,
    Cases on Trials, Judgments and Appeals (1936) 175; and see Blume,
    Jurisdictional Amount in Representative Suits, 15 Minn.L.Rev. 501
    (1931).
      The general test of [former] Equity Rule 38 (Representatives of
    Class) that the question should be "one of common or general
    interest to many persons constituting a class so numerous as to
    make it impracticable to bring them all before the court," is a
    common test. For states which require the two elements of a common
    or general interest and numerous persons, as provided for in
    [former] Equity Rule 38, see Del.Ch.Rule 113; Fla.Comp.Gen.Laws
    Ann. (Supp., 1936) Sec. 4918 (7); Georgia Code (1933) Sec. 37-1002,
    and see English Rules Under the Judicature Act (The Annual
    Practice, 1937) O. 16, r. 9. For statutory provisions providing for
    class actions when the question is one of common or general
    interest or when the parties are numerous, see Ala.Code Ann.
    (Michie, 1928) Sec. 5701; 2 Ind.Stat.Ann. (Burns, 1933) Sec. 2-220;
    N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) Sec. 195; Wis.Stat. (1935) Sec. 260.12. These
    statutes have, however, been uniformly construed as though phrased
    in the conjunctive. See Garfein v. Stiglitz, 260 Ky. 430, 86
    S.W.(2d) 155 (1935). The rule adopts the test of [former] Equity
    Rule 38, but defines what constitutes a "common or general
    interest". Compare with code provisions which make the action
    dependent upon the propriety of joinder of the parties. See Blume,
    The "Common Questions" Principle in the Code Provision for
    Representative Suits, 30 Mich.L.Rev. 878 (1932). For discussion of
    what constitutes "numerous persons" see Wheaton, Representative
    Suits Involving Numerous Litigants, 19 Corn.L.Q. 399 (1934); Note,
    36 Harv.L.Rev. 89 (1922).
      Clause (1), Joint, Common, or Secondary Right. This clause is
    illustrated in actions brought by or against representatives of an
    unincorporated association. See Oster v. Brotherhood of Locomotive
    Firemen and Enginemen, 271 Pa. 419, 114 Atl. 377 (1921); Pickett v.
    Walsh, 192 Mass. 572, 78 N.E. 753, 6 L.R.A. (N.S.) 1067 (1906);
    Colt v. Hicks, 97 Ind.App. 177, 179 N.E. 335 (1932). Compare Rule
    17(b) as to when an unincorporated association has capacity to sue

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b), relating to secondary actions by shareholders,
    provides among other things, that in, such an action the
    complainant "shall aver (1) that the plaintiff was a shareholder at
    the time of the transaction of which he complains or that his share
    thereafter devolved on him by operation of law . . ."
      As a result of the decision in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S.
    64 (decided April 25, 1938, after this rule was promulgated by the
    Supreme Court, though before it took effect) a question has arisen
    as to whether the provision above quoted deals with a matter of
    substantive right or is a matter of procedure. If it is a matter of
    substantive law or right, then under Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins clause
    (1) may not be validly applied in cases pending in states whose
    local law permits a shareholder to maintain such actions, although
    not a shareholder at the time of the transactions complained of.
    The Advisory Committee, believing the question should be settled in
    the courts, proposes no change in Rule 23 but thinks rather that
    the situation should be explained in an appropriate note.
      The rule has a long history. In Hawes v. Oakland (1882) 104 U.S.
    450, the Court held that a shareholder could not maintain such an
    action unless he owned shares at the time of the transactions
    complained of, or unless they devolved on him by operation of law.
    At that time the decision in Swift v. Tyson (1842) 16 Peters 1, was
    the law, and the federal courts considered themselves free to
    establish their own principles of equity jurisprudence, so the
    Court was not in 1882 and has not been, until Erie R. Co. v.
    Tompkins in 1938, concerned with the question whether Hawes v.
    Oakland dealt with substantive right or procedure.
      Following the decision in Hawes v. Oakland, and at the same term,
    the Court, to implement its decision, adopted [former] Equity Rule
    94, which contained the same provision above quoted from Rule 23
    F.R.C.P. The provision in [former] Equity Rule 94 was later
    embodied in [former] Equity Rule 27, of which the present Rule 23
    is substantially a copy.
      In City of Quincy v. Steel (1887) 120 U.S. 241, 245, the Court
    referring to Hawes v. Oakland said: "In order to give effect to the
    principles there laid down, this Court at that term adopted Rule 94
    of the rules of practice for courts of equity of the United
    States."
      Some other cases dealing with [former] Equity Rules 94 or 27
    prior to the decision in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins are Dimpfel v.
    Ohio & Miss. R. R. (1884) 110 U.S. 209; Illinois Central R. Co. v.
    Adams (1901) 180 U.S. 28, 34; Venner v. Great Northern Ry. (1908)
    209 U.S. 24, 30; Jacobson v. General Motors Corp. (S.D.N.Y. 1938)
    22 F.Supp. 255, 257. These cases generally treat Hawes v. Oakland
    as establishing a "principle" of equity, or as dealing not with
    jurisdiction but with the "right" to maintain an action, or have
    said that the defense under the equity rule is analogous to the
    defense that the plaintiff has no "title" and results in a
    dismissal "for want of equity."
      Those state decisions which held that a shareholder acquiring
    stock after the event may maintain a derivative action are founded
    on the view that it is a right belonging to the shareholder at the
    time of the transaction and which passes as a right to the
    subsequent purchaser. See Pollitz v. Gould (1911) 202 N.Y. 11.
      The first case arising after the decision in Erie R. Co. v.
    Tompkins, in which this problem was involved, was Summers v. Hearst
    (S.D.N.Y. 1938) 23 F.Supp. 986. It concerned [former] Equity Rule
    27, as Federal Rule 23 was not then in effect. In a well considered
    opinion Judge Leibell reviewed the decisions and said: "The federal
    cases that discuss this section of Rule 27 support the view that it
    states a principle of substantive law." He quoted Pollitz v. Gould
    (1911) 202 N.Y. 11, as saying that the United States Supreme Court
    "seems to have been more concerned with establishing this rule as
    one of practice than of substantive law" but that "whether it be
    regarded as establishing a principle of law or a rule of practice,
    this authority has been subsequently followed in the United States
    courts."
      He then concluded that, although the federal decisions treat the
    equity rule as "stating a principle of substantive law", if
    [former] "Equity Rule 27 is to be modified or revoked in view of
    Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, it is not the province of this Court to
    suggest it, much less impliedly to follow that course by
    disregarding the mandatory provisions of the Rule."
      Some other federal decisions since 1938 touch the question.
      In Piccard v. Sperry Corporation (S.D.N.Y. 1941) 36 F.Supp. 1006,
    1009-10, affirmed without opinion (C.C.A.2d, 1941) 120 F.(2d) 328,
    a shareholder, not such at the time of the transactions complained
    of, sought to intervene. The court held an intervenor was as much
    subject to Rule 23 as an original plaintiff; and that the
    requirement of Rule 23(b) was "a matter of practice," not
    substance, and applied in New York where the state law was
    otherwise, despite Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins. In York v. Guaranty
    Trust Co. of New York (C.C.A.2d, 1944) 143 F.(2d) 503, rev'd on
    other grounds (1945) 65 S.Ct. 1464, the court said: "Restrictions
    on the bringing of stockholders' actions, such as those imposed by
    F.R.C.P. 23(b) or other state statutes are procedural," citing the
    Piccard and other cases.
      In Gallup v. Caldwell (C.C.A.3d, 1941) 120 F.(2d) 90, 95, arising
    in New Jersey, the point was raised but not decided, the court
    saying that it was not satisfied that the then New Jersey rule
    differed from Rule 23(b), and that "under the circumstances the
    proper course was to follow Rule 23(b)."
      In Mullins v. De Soto Securities Co. (W.D.La. 1942) 45 F.Supp.
    871, 878, the point was not decided, because the court found the
    Louisiana rule to be the same as that stated in Rule 23(b).
      In Toebelman v. Missouri-Kansas Pipe Line Co. (D.Del. 1941) 41
    F.Supp. 334, 340, the court dealt only with another part of Rule
    23(b), relating to prior demands on the stockholders and did not
    discuss Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, or its effect on the rule.
      In Perrott v. United States Banking Corp. (D.Del. 1944) 53
    F.Supp. 953, it appeared that the Delaware law does not require the
    plaintiff to have owned shares at the time of the transaction
    complained of. The court sustained Rule 23(b), after discussion of
    the authorities, saying:
      "It seems to me the rule does not go beyond procedure. * * *
    Simply because a particular plaintiff cannot qualify as a proper
    party to maintain such an action does not destroy or even whittle
    at the cause of action. The cause of action exists until a
    qualified plaintiff can get it started in a federal court."
      In Bankers Nat. Corp. v. Barr (S.D.N.Y. 1945) 9 Fed.Rules Serv.
    23b.11, Case 1, the court held Rule 23(b) to be one of procedure,
    but that whether the plaintiff was a stockholder was a substantive
    question to be settled by state law.
      The New York rule, as stated in Pollitz v. Gould, supra, has been
    altered by an act of the New York Legislature (Chapter 667, Laws of
    1944, effective April 9, 1944, General Corporation Law, Sec. 61)
    which provides that "in any action brought by a shareholder in the
    right of a . . . corporation, it must appear that the plaintiff was
    a stockholder at the time of the transaction of which he complains,
    or that his stock thereafter devolved upon him by operation of
    law." At the same time a further and separate provision was
    enacted, requiring under certain circumstances the giving of
    security for reasonable expenses and attorney's fees, to which
    security the corporation in whose right the action is brought and
    the defendants therein may have recourse. (Chapter 668, Laws of
    1944, effective April 9, 1944, General Corporation Law, Sec. 61-b.)
    These provisions are aimed at so-called "strike" stockholders'
    suits and their attendant abuses. Shielcrawt v. Moffett (Ct.App.
    1945) 294 N.Y. 180, 61 N.E.(2d) 435, rev'g 51 N.Y.S.(2d) 188, aff'g
    49 N.Y.S.(2d) 64; Noel Associates, Inc. v. Merrill (Sup.Ct. 1944)
    184 Misc. 646, 53 N.Y.S.(2d) 143.
      Insofar as Sec. 61 is concerned, it has been held that the
    section is procedural in nature. Klum v. Clinton Trust Co. (Sup.Ct.
    1944) 183 Misc. 340, 48 N.Y.S.(2d) 267; Noel Associates, Inc. v.
    Merrill, supra. In the latter case the court pointed out that "The
    1944 amendment to Section 61 rejected the rule laid down in the
    Pollitz case and substituted, in place thereof, in its precise
    language, the rule which has long prevailed in the Federal Courts
    and which is now Rule 23(b) . . ." There is, nevertheless, a
    difference of opinion regarding the application of the statute to
    pending actions. See Klum v. Clinton Trust Co., supra (applicable);
    Noel Associates, Inc. v. Merrill, supra (inapplicable).
      With respect to Sec. 61-b, which may be regarded as a separate
    problem (Noel Associates, Inc. v. Merrill, supra), it has been held
    that even though the statute is procedural in nature - a matter not
    definitely decided - the Legislature evinced no intent that the
    provision should apply to actions pending when it became effective.
    Shielcrawt v. Moffett, supra. As to actions instituted after the
    effective date of the legislation, the constitutionality of Sec. 61-
    b is in dispute. See Wolf v. Atkinson (Sup.Ct. 1944) 182 Misc.
    675, 49 N.Y.S.(2d) 703 (constitutional); Citron v. Mangel Stores
    Corp. (Sup.Ct. 1944)  -  Misc.  - , 50 N.Y.S.(2d) 416
    (unconstitutional); Zlinkoff, The American Investor and the
    Constitutionality of Section 61-B of the New York General
    Corporation Law (1945) 54 Yale L.J. 352.
      New Jersey also enacted a statute, similar to Chapters 667 and
    668 of the New York law. See P.L. 1945, Ch. 131, R.S.Cum.Supp. 14:3-
    15. The New Jersey provision similar to Chapter 668 (Sec. 61-b)
    differs, however, in that it specifically applies retroactively. It
    has been held that this provision is procedural and hence will not
    govern a pending action brought against a New Jersey corporation in
    the New York courts. Shielcrawt v. Moffett (Sup.Ct.N.Y. 1945) 184
    Misc. 1074, 56 N.Y.S.(2d) 134.
      See also generally, 2 Moore's Federal Practice (1938) 2250-2253,
    and Cum.Supplement Sec. 23.05.
      The decisions here discussed show that the question is a
    debatable one, and that there is respectable authority for either
    view, with a recent trend towards the view that Rule 23(b)(1) is
    procedural. There is reason to say that the question is one which
    should not be decided by the Supreme Court ex parte, but left to
    await a judicial decision in a litigated case, and that in the
    light of the material in this note, the only inference to be drawn
    from a failure to amend Rule 23(b) would be that the question is
    postponed to await a litigated case.
      The Advisory Committee is unanimously of the opinion that this
    course should be followed.
      If, however, the final conclusion is that the rule deals with a
    matter of substantive right, then the rule should be amended by
    adding a provision that Rule 23(b)(1) does not apply in
    jurisdictions where state law permits a shareholder to maintain a
    secondary action, although he was not a shareholder at the time of
    the transactions of which he complains.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      Difficulties with the original rule. The categories of class
    actions in the original rule were defined in terms of the abstract
    nature of the rights involved: the so-called "true" category was
    defined as involving "joint, common, or secondary rights"; the
    "hybrid" category, as involving "several" rights related to
    "specific property"; the "spurious" category, as involving
    "several" rights affected by a common question and related to
    common relief. It was thought that the definitions accurately
    described the situations amendable to the class-suit device, and
    also would indicate the proper extent of the judgment in each
    category, which would in turn help to determine the res judicata
    effect of the judgment if questioned in a later action. Thus the
    judgments in "true" and "hybrid" class actions would extend to the
    class (although in somewhat different ways); the judgment in a
    "spurious" class action would extend only to the parties including
    intervenors. See Moore, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: Some
    Problems Raised by the Preliminary Draft, 25 Geo.L.J. 551, 570-76
    (1937).
      In practice, the terms "joint," "common," etc., which were used
    as the basis of the Rule 23 classification proved obscure and
    uncertain. See Chaffee, Some Problems of Equity 245-46, 256-57
    (1950); Kalven & Rosenfield, The Contemporary Function of the Class
    Suit, 8 U. of Chi.L.Rev. 684, 707 & n. 73 (1941); Keeffe, Levy &
    Donovan, Lee Defeats Ben Hur, 33 Corn.L.Q. 327, 329-36 (1948);
    Developments in the Law: Multiparty Litigation in the Federal
    Courts, 71 Harv.L.Rev. 874, 931 (1958); Advisory Committee's Note
    to Rule 19, as amended. The courts had considerable difficulty with
    these terms. See, e.g., Gullo v. Veterans' Coop. H. Assn., 13
    F.R.D. 11 (D.D.C. 1952); Shipley v. Pittsburgh & L. E. R. Co., 70
    F.Supp. 870 (W.D.Pa. 1947); Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp.,
    27 F.Supp. 763 (E.D.Pa. 1939), rev'd, 108 F.2d 51 (3d Cir. 1939),
    rev'd, 311 U.S. 282 (1940), on remand, 39 F.Supp. 592 (E.D.Pa.
    1941), rev'd sub nom. Pennsylvania Co. for Ins. on Lives v.
    Deckert, 123 F.2d 979 (3d Cir. 1941) (see Chafee, supra, at 264-
    65).
      Nor did the rule provide an adequate guide to the proper extent
    of the judgments in class actions. First, we find instances of the
    courts classifying actions as "true" or intimating that the
    judgments would be decisive for the class where these results
    seemed appropriate but were reached by dint of depriving the word
    "several" of coherent meaning. See, e.g., System Federation No. 91
    v. Reed, 180 F.2d 991 (6th Cir. 1950); Wilson v. City of Paducah,
    100 F.Supp. 116 (W.D.Ky. 1951); Citizens Banking Co. v. Monticello
    State Bank, 143 F.2d 261 (8th Cir. 1944); Redmond v. Commerce Trust
    Co., 144 F.2d 140 (8th Cir. 1944), cert. denied, 323 U.S. 776
    (1944); United States v. American Optical Co., 97 F.Supp. 66
    (N.D.Ill. 1951); National Hairdressers' & C. Assn. v. Philad. Co.,
    34 F.Supp. 264 (D.Del. 1940); 41 F.Supp. 701 (D.Del. 1940), aff'd
    mem., 129 F.2d 1020 (3d Cir. 1942). Second, we find cases
    classified by the courts as "spurious" in which, on a realistic
    view, it would seem fitting for the judgments to extend to the
    class. See, e.g., Knapp v. Bankers Sec. Corp., 17 F.R.D. 245
    (E.D.Pa. 1954); aff'd 230 F.2d 717 (3d Cir. 1956); Giesecke v.
    Denver Tramway Corp., 81 F.Supp. 957 (D.Del. 1949); York v.
    Guaranty Trust Co., 143 F.2d 503 (2d Cir. 1944), rev'd on grounds
    not here relevant, 326 U.S. 90 (1945) (see Chafee, supra, at 208);
    cf. Webster Eisenlohr, Inc. v. Kalodner, 145 F.2d 316, 320 (3d Cir.
    1944), cert. denied, 325 U.S. 807 (1945). But cf. the early
    decisions, Duke of Bedford v. Ellis [1901], A.C. 1; Sheffield
    Waterworks v. Yeomans, L.R. 2 Ch.App. 8 (1866); Brown v. Vermuden,
    1 Ch.Cas. 272, 22 Eng.Rep. 796 (1676).
      The "spurious" action envisaged by original Rule 23 was in any
    event an anomaly because, although denominated a "class" action and
    pleaded as such, it was supposed not to adjudicate the rights or
    liabilities of any person not a party. It was believed to be an
    advantage of the "spurious" category that it would invite decisions
    that a member of the "class" could, like a member of the class in a
    "true" or "hybrid" action, intervene on an ancillary basis without
    being required to show an independent basis of Federal
    jurisdiction, and have the benefit of the date of the commencement
    of the action for purposes of the statute of limitations. See 3
    Moore's Federal Practice, pars. 23.10[1], 23.12 (2d ed. 1963).
    These results were attained in some instances but not in others. On
    the statute of limitations, see Union Carbide & Carbon Corp. v.
    Nisley, 300 F.2d 561 (10th Cir. 1961), pet. cert. dism., 371 U.S.
    801 (1963); but cf. P. W. Husserl, Inc. v. Newman, 25 F.R.D. 264
    (S.D.N.Y. 1960); Athas v. Day, 161 F.Supp. 916 (D.Colo. 1958). On
    ancillary intervention, see Amen v. Black, 234 F.2d 12 (10th Cir.
    1956), cert. granted, 352 U.S. 888 (1956), dism. on stip., 355 U.S.
    600 (1958); but. cf. Wagner v. Kemper, 13 F.R.D. 128 (W.D.Mo.
    1952). The results, however, can hardly depend upon the mere
    appearance of a "spurious" category in the rule; they should turn
    no more basic considerations. See discussion of subdivision (c)(1)
    below.
      Finally, the original rule did not squarely address itself to the
    question of the measures that might be taken during the course of
    the action to assure procedural fairness, particularly giving
    notice to members of the class, which may in turn be related in
    some instances to the extension of the judgment to the class. See
    Chafee, supra, at 230-31; Keeffe, Levy & Donovan, supra;
    Developments in the Law, supra, 71 Harv.L.Rev. at 937-38; Note,

    23.04; N.Dak.R.Civ.P. 23(d).
      The amended rule describes in more practical terms the occasions
    for maintaining class actions; provides that all class actions
    maintained to the end as such will result in judgments including
    those whom the court finds to be members of the class, whether or
    not the judgment is favorable to the class; and refers to the
    measures which can be taken to assure the fair conduct of these
    actions.
      Subdivision (a) states the prerequisites for maintaining any
    class action in terms of the numerousness of the class making
    joinder of the members impracticable, the existence of questions
    common to the class, and the desired qualifications of the
    representative parties. See Weinstein, Revision of Procedure; Some
    Problems in Class Actions, 9 Buffalo L.Rev. 433, 458-59 (1960); 2
    Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice & Procedure Sec. 562, at 265,
    Sec. 572, at 351-52 (Wright ed. 1961). These are necessary but not
    sufficient conditions for a class action. See, e.g., Giordano v.
    Radio Corp. of Am., 183 F.2d 558, 560 (3d Cir. 1950); Zachman v.
    Erwin, 186 F.Supp. 681 (S.D.Tex. 1959); Baim & Blank, Inc. v.
    Warren Connelly Co., Inc., 19 F.R.D. 108 (S.D.N.Y. 1956).
    Subdivision (b) describes the additional elements which in varying
    situations justify the use of a class action.
      Subdivision (b)(1). The difficulties which would be likely to
    arise if resort were had to separate actions by or against the
    individual members of the class here furnish the reasons for, and
    the principal key to, the propriety and value of utilizing the
    class-action device. The considerations stated under clauses (A)
    and (B) are comparable to certain of the elements which define the
    persons whose joinder in an action is desirable as stated in Rule
    19(a), as amended. See amended Rule 19(a)(2)(i) and (ii), and the
    Advisory Committee's Note thereto; Hazard, Indispensable Party; The
    Historical Origin of a Procedural Phantom, 61 Colum.L.Rev. 1254,
    1259-60 (1961); cf. 3 Moore, supra, par. 23.08, at 3435.
      Clause (A): One person may have rights against, or be under
    duties toward, numerous persons constituting a class, and be so
    positioned that conflicting or varying adjudications in lawsuits
    with individual members of the class might establish incompatible
    standards to govern his conduct. The class action device can be
    used effectively to obviate the actual or virtual dilemma which
    would thus confront the party opposing the class. The matter has
    been stated thus: "The felt necessity for a class action is
    greatest when the courts are called upon to order or sanction the
    alteration of the status quo in circumstances such that a large
    number of persons are in a position to call on a single person to
    alter the status quo, or to complain if it is altered, and the
    possibility exists that [the] actor might be called upon to act in
    inconsistent ways." Louisell & Hazard, Pleading and Procedure;
    State and Federal 719 (1962); see Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v.
    Cauble, 255 U.S. 356, 366-67 (1921). To illustrate: Separate
    actions by individuals against a municipality to declare a bond
    issue invalid or condition or limit it, to prevent or limit the
    making of a particular appropriation or to compel or invalidate an
    assessment, might create a risk of inconsistent or varying
    determinations. In the same way, individual litigations of the
    rights and duties of riparian owners, or of landowners' rights and
    duties respecting a claimed nuisance, could create a possibility of
    incompatible adjudications. Actions by or against a class provide a
    ready and fair means of achieving unitary adjudication. See
    Maricopa County Mun. Water Con. Dist. v. Looney, 219 F.2d 529 (9th
    Cir. 1955); Rank v. Krug, 142 F.Supp. 1, 154-59 (S.D.Calif. 1956),
    on app., State of California v. Rank, 293 F.2d 340, 348 (9th Cir.
    1961); Gart v. Cole, 263 F.2d 244 (2d Cir. 1959), cert. denied 359
    U.S. 978 (1959); cf. Martinez v. Maverick Cty. Water Con. & Imp.
    Dist., 219 F.2d 666 (5th Cir. 1955); 3 Moore, supra, par. 23.11[2],
    at 3458-59.
      Clause (B): This clause takes in situations where the judgment in
    a nonclass action by or against an individual member of the class,
    while not technically concluding the other members, might do so as
    a practical matter. The vice of an individual actions would lie in
    the fact that the other members of the class, thus practically
    concluded, would have had no representation in the lawsuit. In an
    action by policy holders against a fraternal benefit association
    attacking a financial reorganization of the society, it would
    hardly have been practical, if indeed it would have been possible,
    to confine the effects of a validation of the reorganization to the
    individual plaintiffs. Consequently a class action was called for
    with adequate representation of all members of the class. See
    Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble, 255 U.S. 356 (1921); Waybright
    v. Columbian Mut. Life Ins. Co., 30 F.Supp. 885 (W.D.Tenn. 1939);
    cf. Smith v. Swormstedt, 16 How. (57 U.S.) 288 (1853). For much the
    same reason actions by shareholders to compel the declaration of a
    dividend the proper recognition and handling of redemption or pre-
    emption rights, or the like (or actions by the corporation for
    corresponding declarations of rights), should ordinarily be
    conducted as class actions, although the matter has been much
    obscured by the insistence that each shareholder has an individual
    claim. See Knapp v. Bankers Securities Corp., 17 F.R.D. 245
    (E.D.Pa. 1954), aff'd, 230 F.2d 717 (3d Cir. 1956); Giesecke v.
    Denver Tramway Corp., 81 F.Supp. 957 (D.Del. 1949); Zahn v.
    Transamerica Corp., 162 F.2d 36 (3d Cir. 1947); Speed v.
    Transamerica Corp., 100 F.Supp. 461 (D.Del. 1951); Sobel v.
    Whittier Corp., 95 F.Supp. 643 (E.D.Mich. 1951), app. dism., 195
    F.2d 361 (6th Cir. 1952); Goldberg v. Whittier Corp., 111 F.Supp.
    382 (E.D.Mich. 1953); Dann v. Studebaker-Packard Corp., 288 F.2d
    201 (6th Cir. 1961); Edgerton v. Armour & Co.,94 F.Supp. 549
    (S.D.Calif. 1950); Ames v. Mengel Co., 190 F.2d 344 (2d Cir. 1951).
    (These shareholders' actions are to be distinguished from
    derivative actions by shareholders dealt with in new Rule 23.1).
    The same reasoning applies to an action which charges a breach of
    trust by an indenture trustee or other fiduciary similarly
    affecting the members of a large class of security holders or other
    beneficiaries, and which requires an accounting or like measures to
    restore the subject of the trust. See Bosenberg v. Chicago T. & T.
    Co., 128 F.2d 245 (7th Cir. 1942); Citizens Banking Co. v.
    Monticello State Bank, 143 F.2d 261 (8th Cir. 1944); Redmond v.
    Commerce Trust Co., 144 F.2d 140 (8th Cir. 1944), cert. denied, 323
    U.S. 776 (1944); cf. York v. Guaranty Trust Co., 143 F.2d 503 (2d
    Cir. 1944), rev'd on grounds not here relevant, 326 U.S. 99 (1945).
      In various situations an adjudication as to one or more members
    of the class will necessarily or probably have an adverse practical
    effect on the interests of other members who should therefore be
    represented in the lawsuit. This is plainly the case when claims
    are made by numerous persons against a fund insufficient to satisfy
    all claims. A class action by or against representative members to
    settle the validity of the claims as a whole, or in groups,
    followed by separate proof of the amount of each valid claim and
    proportionate distribution of the fund, meets the problem. Cf.
    Dickinson v. Burnham, 197 F.2d 973 (2d Cir. 1952), cert. denied,
    344 U.S. 875 (1952); 3 Moore, supra, at par. 23.09. The same
    reasoning applies to an action by a creditor to set aside a
    fraudulent conveyance by the debtor and to appropriate the property
    to his claim, when the debtor's assets are insufficient to pay all
    creditors' claims. See Hefferman v. Bennett & Armour, 110
    Cal.App.2d 564, 243 P.2d 846 (1952); cf. City & County of San
    Francisco v. Market Street Ry., 95 Cal.App.2d 648, 213 P.2d 780
    (1950). Similar problems, however, can arise in the absence of a
    fund either present or potential. A negative or mandatory
    injunction secured by one of a numerous class may disable the
    opposing party from performing claimed duties toward the other
    members of the class or materially affect his ability to do so. An
    adjudication as to movie "clearances and runs" nominally affecting
    only one exhibitor would often have practical effects on all the
    exhibitors in the same territorial area. Cf. United States v.
    Paramount Pictures, Inc., 66 F.Supp. 323, 341-46 (S.D.N.Y. 1946);
    334 U.S. 131, 144-48 (1948). Assuming a sufficiently numerous class
    of exhibitors, a class action would be advisable. (Here
    representation of subclasses of exhibitors could become necessary;
    see subdivision (c)(3)(B).)
      Subdivision (b)(2). This subdivision is intended to reach
    situations where a party has taken action or refused to take action
    with respect to a class, and final relief of an injunctive nature
    or of a corresponding declaratory nature, settling the legality of
    the behavior with respect to the class as a whole, is appropriate.
    Declaratory relief "corresponds" to injunctive relief when as a
    practical matter it affords injunctive relief or serves as a basis
    for later injunctive relief. The subdivision does not extend to
    cases in which the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or
    predominantly to money damages. Action or inaction is directed to a
    class within the meaning of this subdivision even if it has taken
    effect or is threatened only as to one or a few members of the
    class, provided it is based on grounds which have general
    application to the class.
      Illustrative are various actions in the civil-rights field where
    a party is charged with discriminating unlawfully against a class,
    usually one whose members are incapable of specific enumeration.
    See Potts v. Flax, 313 F.2d 284 (5th Cir. 1963); Bailey v.
    Patterson, 323 F.2d 201 (5th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 972
    (1964); Brunson v. Board of Trustees of School District No. 1,
    Clarendon City, S.C., 311 F.2d 107 (4th Cir. 1962), cert. denied,
    373 U.S. 933 (1963); Green v. School Bd. of Roanoke, Va., 304 F.2d
    118 (4th Cir. 1962); Orleans Parish School Bd. v. Bush, 242 F.2d
    156 (5th Cir. 1957), cert. denied, 354 U.S. 921 (1957); Mannings v.
    Board of Public Inst. of Hillsborough County, Fla., 277 F.2d 370
    (5th Cir. 1960); Northcross v. Board of Ed. of City of Memphis, 302
    F.2d 818 (6th Cir. 1962), cert. denied 370 U.S. 944 (1962); Frasier
    v. Board of Trustees of Univ. of N.C., 134 F.Supp. 589 (M.D.N.C.
    1955, 3-judge court), aff'd, 350 U.S. 979 (1956). Subdivision
    (b)(2) is not limited to civil-rights cases. Thus an action looking
    to specific or declaratory relief could be brought by a numerous
    class of purchasers, say retailers of a given description, against
    a seller alleged to have undertaken to sell to that class at prices
    higher than those set for other purchasers, say retailers of
    another description, when the applicable law forbids such a pricing
    differential. So also a patentee of a machine, charged with selling
    or licensing the machine on condition that purchasers or licensees
    also purchase or obtain licenses to use an ancillary unpatented
    machine, could be sued on a class basis by a numerous group of
    purchasers or licensees, or by a numerous group of competing
    sellers or licensors of the unpatented machine, to test the
    legality of the "tying" condition.
      Subdivision (b)(3). In the situations to which this subdivision
    relates, class-action treatment is not as clearly called for as in
    those described above, but it may nevertheless be convenient and
    desirable depending upon the particular facts. Subdivision (b)(3)
    encompasses those cases in which a class action would achieve
    economies of time, effort, and expense, and promote, uniformity of
    decision as to persons similarly situated, without sacrificing
    procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results.
    Cf. Chafee, supra, at 201.
      The court is required to find, as a condition of holding that a
    class action may be maintained under this subdivision, that the
    questions common to the class predominate over the questions
    affecting individual members. It is only where this predominance
    exists that economies can be achieved by means of the class-action
    device. In this view, a fraud perpetrated on numerous persons by
    the use of similar misrepresentations may be an appealing situation
    for a class action, and it may remain so despite the need, if
    liability is found, for separate determination of the damages
    suffered by individuals within the class. On the other hand,
    although having some common core, a fraud case may be unsuited for
    treatment as a class action if there was material variation in the
    representation made or in the kinds or degrees of reliance by the
    persons to whom they were addressed. See Oppenheimer v. F. J. Young
    & Co., Inc., 144 F.2d 387 (2d Cir. 1944); Miller v. National City
    Bank of N.Y., 166 F.2d 723 (2d Cir. 1948); and for like problems in
    other contexts, see Hughes v. Encyclopaedia Brittanica, 199 F.2d
    295 (7th Cir. 1952); Sturgeon v. Great Lakes Steel Corp., 143 F.2d
    819 (6th Cir. 1944). A "mass accident" resulting in injuries to
    numerous persons is ordinarily not appropriate for a class action
    because of the likelihood that significant questions, not only of
    damages but of liability and defenses of liability, would be
    present, affecting the individuals in different ways. In these
    circumstances an action conducted nominally as a class action would
    degenerate in practice into multiple lawsuits separately tried. See
    Pennsylvania R.R. v. United States, 111 F.Supp. 80 (D.N.J. 1953);
    cf. Weinstein, supra, 9 Buffalo L.Rev. at 469. Private damage
    claims by numerous individuals arising out of concerted antitrust
    violations may or may not involve predominating common questions.
    See Union Carbide & Carbon Corp. v. Nisley, 300 F.2d 561 (10th Cir.
    1961), pet. cert. dism., 371 U.S. 801 (1963); cf. Weeks v. Bareco
    Oil Co., 125 F.2d 84 (7th Cir. 1941); Kainz v. Anheuser-Busch,
    Inc., 194 F.2d 737 (7th Cir. 1952); Hess v. Anderson, Clayton &
    Co., 20 F.R.D. 466 (S.D.Calif. 1957).
      That common questions predominate is not itself sufficient to
    justify a class action under subdivision (b)(3), for another method
    of handling the litigious situation may be available which has
    greater practical advantages. Thus one or more actions agreed to by
    the parties as test or model actions may be preferable to a class
    action; or it may prove feasible and preferable to consolidate
    actions. Cf. Weinstein, supra, 9 Buffalo L.Rev. at 438-54. Even
    when a number of separate actions are proceeding simultaneously,
    experience shows that the burdens on the parties and the courts can
    sometimes be reduced by arrangements for avoiding repetitious
    discovery or the like. Currently the Coordinating Committee on
    Multiple Litigation in the United States District Courts (a
    subcommittee of the Committee on Trial Practice and Technique of
    the Judicial Conference of the United States) is charged with
    developing methods for expediting such massive litigation. To
    reinforce the point that the court with the aid of the parties
    ought to assess the relative advantages of alternative procedures
    for handling the total controversy, subdivision (b)(3) requires, as
    a further condition of maintaining the class action, that the court
    shall find that that procedure is "superior" to the others in the
    particular circumstances.
      Factors (A)-(D) are listed, non-exhaustively, as pertinent to the
    findings. The court is to consider the interests of individual
    members of the class in controlling their own litigations and
    carrying them on as they see fit. See Weeks v. Bareco Oil Co., 125
    F.2d 84, 88-90, 93-94 (7th Cir. 1941) (anti-trust action); see also
    Pentland v. Dravo Corp., 152 F.2d 851 (3d Cir. 1945), and Chaffee,
    supra, at 273-75, regarding policy of Fair Labor Standards Act of
    1938, Sec. 16(b), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 216(b), prior to amendment by
    Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, Sec. 5(a). [The present provisions of
    29 U.S.C. Sec. 216(b) are not intended to be affected by Rule 23,
    as amended.]
      In this connection the court should inform itself of any
    litigation actually pending by or against the individuals. The
    interests of individuals in conducting separate lawsuits may be so
    strong as to call for denial of a class action. On the other hand,
    these interests may be theoretic rather than practical; the class
    may have a high degree of cohesion and prosecution of the action
    through representatives would be quite unobjectionable, or the
    amounts at stake for individuals may be so small that separate
    suits would be impracticable. The burden that separate suits would
    impose on the party opposing the class, or upon the court
    calendars, may also fairly be considered. (See the discussion,
    under subdivision (c)(2) below, of the right of members to be
    excluded from the class upon their request.)
      Also pertinent is the question of the desirability of
    concentrating the trial of the claims in the particular forum by
    means of a class action, in contrast to allowing the claims to be
    litigated separately in forums to which they would ordinarily be
    brought. Finally, the court should consider the problems of
    management which are likely to arise in the conduct of a class
    action.
      Subdivision (c)(1). In order to give clear definition to the
    action, this provision requires the court to determine, as early in
    the proceedings as may be practicable, whether an action brought as
    a class action is to be so maintained. The determination depends in
    each case on satisfaction of the terms of subdivision (a) and the
    relevant provisions of subdivision (b).
      An order embodying a determination can be conditional; the court
    may rule, for example, that a class action may be maintained only
    if the representation is improved through intervention of
    additional parties of a stated type. A determination once made can
    be altered or amended before the decision on the merits if, upon
    fuller development of the facts, the original determination appears
    unsound. A negative determination means that the action should be
    stripped of its character as a class action. See subdivision
    (d)(4). Although an action thus becomes a nonclass action, the
    court may still be receptive to interventions before the decision
    on the merits so that the litigation may cover as many interests as
    can be conveniently handled; the questions whether the intervenors
    in the nonclass action shall be permitted to claim "ancillary"
    jurisdiction or the benefit of the date of the commencement of the
    action for purposes of the statute of limitations are to be decided
    by reference to the laws governing jurisdiction and limitations as
    they apply in particular contexts.
      Whether the court should require notice to be given to members of
    the class of its intention to make a determination, or of the order
    embodying it, is left to the court's discretion under subdivision
    (d)(2).
      Subdivision (c)(2) makes special provision for class actions
    maintained under subdivision (b)(3). As noted in the discussion of
    the latter subdivision, the interests of the individuals in
    pursuing their own litigations may be so strong here as to warrant
    denial of a class action altogether. Even when a class action is
    maintained under subdivision (b)(3), this individual interest is
    respected. Thus the court is required to direct notice to the
    members of the class of the right of each member to be excluded
    from the class upon his request. A member who does not request
    exclusion may, if he wishes, enter an appearance in the action
    through his counsel; whether or not he does so, the judgment in the
    action will embrace him.
      The notice setting forth the alternatives open to the members of
    the class, is to be the best practicable under the circumstances,
    and shall include individual notice to the members who can be
    identified through reasonable effort. (For further discussion of
    this notice, see the statement under subdivision (d)(2) below.)
      Subdivision (c)(3). The judgment in a class action maintained as
    such to the end will embrace the class, that is, in a class action
    under subdivision (b)(1) or (b)(2), those found by the court to be
    class members; in a class action under subdivision (b)(3), those to
    whom the notice prescribed by subdivision (c)(2) was directed,
    excepting those who requested exclusion or who are ultimately found
    by the court not to be members of the class. The judgment has this
    scope whether it is favorable or unfavorable to the class. In a
    (b)(1) or (b)(2) action the judgment "describes" the members of the
    class, but need not specify the individual members; in a (b)(3)
    action the judgment "specifies" the individual members who have
    been identified and described the others.
      Compare subdivision (c)(4) as to actions conducted as class
    actions only with respect to particular issues. Where the class-
    action character of the lawsuit is based solely on the existence
    of a "limited fund," the judgment, while extending to all claims of
    class members against the fund, has ordinarily left unaffected the
    personal claims of nonappearing members against the debtor. See 3
    Moore, supra, par. 23.11[4].
      Hitherto, in a few actions conducted as "spurious" class actions
    and thus nominally designed to extend only to parties and others
    intervening before the determination of liability, courts have held
    or intimated that class members might be permitted to intervene
    after a decision on the merits favorable to their interests, in
    order to secure the benefits of the decision for themselves,
    although they would presumably be unaffected by an unfavorable
    decision. See, as to the propriety of this so-called "one-way"
    intervention in "spurious" actions, the conflicting views expressed
    in Union Carbide & Carbon Corp. v. Nisley, 300 F.2d 561 (10th Cir.
    1961), pet. cert. dism., 371 U.S. 801 (1963); York v. Guaranty
    Trust Co., 143 F.2d 503, 529 (2d Cir. 1944), rev'd on grounds not

    7 F.R.D. 24, 28-29 (W.D.Mo. 1947); Abram v. San Joaquin Cotton Oil
    Co., 46 F.Supp. 969, 976-77 (S.D.Calif. 1942); Chaffee, supra, at
    280, 285; 3 Moore, supra, par. 23.12, at 3476. Under proposed
    subdivision (c)(3), one-way intervention is excluded; the action
    will have been early determined to be a class or nonclass action,
    and in the former case the judgment, whether or not favorable, will
    include the class, as above stated.
      Although thus declaring that the judgment in a class action
    includes the class, as defined, subdivision (c)(3) does not disturb
    the recognized principle that the court conducting the action
    cannot predetermine the res judicata effect of the judgment; this
    can be tested only in a subsequent action. See Restatement,
    Judgments Sec. 86, comment (h), Sec. 116 (1942). The court,
    however, in framing the judgment in any suit brought as a class
    action, must decide what its extent or coverage shall be, and if
    the matter is carefully considered, questions of res judicata are
    less likely to be raised at a later time and if raised will be more
    satisfactorily answered. See Chafee, supra, at 294; Weinstein,
    supra, 9 Buffalo L.Rev. at 460.
      Subdivision (c)(4). This provision recognizes that an action may
    be maintained as a class action as to particular issues only. For
    example, in a fraud or similar case the action may retain its
    "class" character only through the adjudication of liability to the
    class; the members of the class may thereafter be required to come
    in individually and prove the amounts of their respective claims.
      Two or more classes may be represented in a single action. Where
    a class is found to include subclasses divergent in interest, the
    class may be divided correspondingly, and each subclass treated as
    a class.
      Subdivision (d) is concerned with the fair and efficient conduct
    of the action and lists some types of orders which may be
    appropriate.
      The court should consider how the proceedings are to be arranged
    in sequence, and what measures should be taken to simplify the
    proof and argument. See subdivision (d)(1). The orders resulting
    from this consideration, like the others referred to in subdivision
    (d), may be combined with a pretrial order under Rule 16, and are
    subject to modification as the case proceeds.
      Subdivision (d)(2) sets out a non-exhaustive list of possible
    occasions for orders requiring notice to the class. Such notice is
    not a novel conception. For example, in "limited fund" cases,
    members of the class have been notified to present individual
    claims after the basic class decision. Notice has gone to members
    of a class so that they might express any opposition to the
    representation, see United States v. American Optical Co., 97
    F.Supp. 66 (N.D.Ill. 1951), and 1950-51 CCH Trade Cases 64573-74
    (par. 62869); cf. Weeks v. Bareco Oil Co., 125 F.2d 84, 94 (7th
    Cir. 1941), and notice may encourage interventions to improve the
    representation of the class. Cf. Oppenheimer v. F. J. Young & Co.,
    144 F.2d 387 (2d Cir. 1944). Notice has been used to poll members
    on a proposed modification of a consent decree. See record in Sam
    Fox Publishing Co. v. United States, 366 U.S. 683 (1961).
      Subdivision (d)(2) does not require notice at any stage, but
    rather calls attention to its availability and invokes the court's
    discretion. In the degree that there is cohesiveness or unity in
    the class and the representation is effective, the need for notice
    to the class will tend toward a minimum. These indicators suggest
    that notice under subdivision (d)(2) may be particularly useful and
    advisable in certain class actions maintained under subdivision
    (b)(3), for example, to permit members of the class to object to
    the representation. Indeed, under subdivision (c)(2), notice must
    be ordered, and is not merely discretionary, to give the members in
    a subdivision (b)(3) class action an opportunity to secure
    exclusion from the class. This mandatory notice pursuant to
    subdivision (c)(2), together with any discretionary notice which
    the court may find it advisable to give under subdivision (d)(2),
    is designed to fulfill requirements of due process to which the
    class action procedure is of course subject. See Hansberry v. Lee,
    311 U.S. 32 (1940); Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co.,
    339 U.S. 306 (1950); cf. Dickinson v. Burnham, 197 F.2d 973, 979
    (2d Cir. 1952), and studies cited at 979 n. 4; see also All
    American Airways, Inc. v. Elderd, 209 F.2d 247, 249 (2d Cir. 1954);
    Gart v. Cole, 263 F.2d 244, 248-49 (2d Cir. 1959), cert. denied,
    359 U.S. 978 (1959).
      Notice to members of the class, whenever employed under amended
    Rule 23, should be accommodated to the particular purpose but need
    not comply with the formalities for service of process. See Chafee,
    supra, at 230-31; Brendle v. Smith, 7 F.R.D. 119 (S.D.N.Y. 1946).
    The fact that notice is given at one stage of the action does not
    mean that it must be given at subsequent stages. Notice is
    available fundamentally "for the protection of the members of the
    class or otherwise for the fair conduct of the action" and should
    not be used merely as a device for the undesirable solicitation of
    claims. See the discussion in Cherner v. Transitron Electronic
    Corp., 201 F.Supp. 934 (D.Mass. 1962); Hormel v. United States, 17
    F.R.D. 303 (S.D.N.Y. 1955).
      In appropriate cases the court should notify interested
    government agencies of the pendency of the action or of particular
    steps therein.
      Subdivision (d)(3) reflects the possibility of conditioning the
    maintenance of a class action, e.g., on the strengthening of the
    representation, see subdivision (c)(1) above; and recognizes that
    the imposition of conditions on intervenors may be required for the
    proper and efficient conduct of the action.
      As to orders under subdivision (d)(4), see subdivision (c)(1)
    above.
      Subdivision (e) requires approval of the court, after notice, for
    the dismissal or compromise of any class action.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1998 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (f). This permissive interlocutory appeal provision
    is adopted under the power conferred by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(e).
    Appeal from an order granting or denying class certification is
    permitted in the sole discretion of the court of appeals. No other
    type of Rule 23 order is covered by this provision. The court of
    appeals is given unfettered discretion whether to permit the
    appeal, akin to the discretion exercised by the Supreme Court in
    acting on a petition for certiorari. This discretion suggests an
    analogy to the provision in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(b) for permissive
    appeal on certification by a district court. Subdivision (f),
    however, departs from the Sec. 1292(b) model in two significant
    ways. It does not require that the district court certify the
    certification ruling for appeal, although the district court often
    can assist the parties and court of appeals by offering advice on
    the desirability of appeal. And it does not include the potentially
    limiting requirements of Sec. 1292(b) that the district court order
    "involve[] a controlling question of law as to which there is
    substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate
    appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate
    termination of the litigation."
      The courts of appeals will develop standards for granting review
    that reflect the changing areas of uncertainty in class litigation.
    The Federal Judicial Center study supports the view that many suits
    with class-action allegations present familiar and almost routine
    issues that are no more worthy of immediate appeal than many other
    interlocutory rulings. Yet several concerns justify expansion of
    present opportunities to appeal. An order denying certification may
    confront the plaintiff with a situation in which the only sure path
    to appellate review is by proceeding to final judgment on the
    merits of an individual claim that, standing alone, is far smaller
    than the costs of litigation. An order granting certification, on
    the other hand, may force a defendant to settle rather than incur
    the costs of defending a class action and run the risk of
    potentially ruinous liability. These concerns can be met at low
    cost by establishing in the court of appeals a discretionary power
    to grant interlocutory review in cases that show appeal-worthy
    certification issues.
      Permission to appeal may be granted or denied on the basis of any
    consideration that the court of appeals finds persuasive.
    Permission is most likely to be granted when the certification
    decision turns on a novel or unsettled question of law, or when, as
    a practical matter, the decision on certification is likely
    dispositive of the litigation.
      The district court, having worked through the certification
    decision, often will be able to provide cogent advice on the
    factors that bear on the decision whether to permit appeal. This
    advice can be particularly valuable if the certification decision
    is tentative. Even as to a firm certification decision, a statement
    of reasons bearing on the probable benefits and costs of immediate
    appeal can help focus the court of appeals decision, and may
    persuade the disappointed party that an attempt to appeal would be
    fruitless.
      The 10-day period for seeking permission to appeal is designed to
    reduce the risk that attempted appeals will disrupt continuing
    proceedings. It is expected that the courts of appeals will act
    quickly in making the preliminary determination whether to permit
    appeal. Permission to appeal does not stay trial court proceedings.
    A stay should be sought first from the trial court. If the trial
    court refuses a stay, its action and any explanation of its views
    should weigh heavily with the court of appeals.
      Appellate Rule 5 has been modified to establish the procedure for
    petitioning for leave to appeal under subdivision (f).
      Changes Made after Publication (GAP Report). No changes were made
    in the text of Rule 23(f) as published.
      Several changes were made in the published Committee Note. (1)
    References to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(b) interlocutory appeals were
    revised to dispel any implication that the restrictive elements of
    Sec. 1292(b) should be read in to Rule 23(f). New emphasis was
    placed on court of appeals discretion by making explicit the
    analogy to certiorari discretion. (2) Suggestions that the new
    procedure is a "modest" expansion of appeal opportunities, to be
    applied with "restraint," and that permission "almost always will
    be denied when the certification decision turns on case-specific
    matters of fact and district court discretion," were deleted. It
    was thought better simply to observe that courts of appeals will
    develop standards "that reflect the changing areas of uncertainty
    in class litigation."

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) is amended in several respects.
    The requirement that the court determine whether to certify a class
    "as soon as practicable after commencement of an action" is
    replaced by requiring determination "at an early practicable time."
    The notice provisions are substantially revised.
      Paragraph (1). Subdivision (c)(1)(A) is changed to require that
    the determination whether to certify a class be made "at an early
    practicable time." The "as soon as practicable" exaction neither
    reflects prevailing practice nor captures the many valid reasons
    that may justify deferring the initial certification decision. See
    Willging, Hooper & Niemic, Empirical Study of Class Actions in Four
    Federal District Courts: Final Report to the Advisory Committee on
    Civil Rules 26-36 (Federal Judicial Center 1996).
      Time may be needed to gather information necessary to make the
    certification decision. Although an evaluation of the probable
    outcome on the merits is not properly part of the certification
    decision, discovery in aid of the certification decision often
    includes information required to identify the nature of the issues
    that actually will be presented at trial. In this sense it is
    appropriate to conduct controlled discovery into the "merits,"
    limited to those aspects relevant to making the certification
    decision on an informed basis. Active judicial supervision may be
    required to achieve the most effective balance that expedites an
    informed certification determination without forcing an artificial
    and ultimately wasteful division between "certification discovery"
    and "merits discovery." A critical need is to determine how the
    case will be tried. An increasing number of courts require a party
    requesting class certification to present a "trial plan" that
    describes the issues likely to be presented at trial and tests
    whether they are susceptible of class-wide proof. See Manual For
    Complex Litigation Third, Sec. 21.213, p. 44; Sec. 30.11, p. 214;
    Sec. 30.12, p. 215.
      Other considerations may affect the timing of the certification
    decision. The party opposing the class may prefer to win dismissal
    or summary judgment as to the individual plaintiffs without
    certification and without binding the class that might have been
    certified. Time may be needed to explore designation of class
    counsel under Rule 23(g), recognizing that in many cases the need
    to progress toward the certification determination may require
    designation of interim counsel under Rule 23(g)(2)(A).
      Although many circumstances may justify deferring the
    certification decision, active management may be necessary to
    ensure that the certification decision is not unjustifiably
    delayed.
      Subdivision (c)(1)(C) reflects two amendments. The provision that
    a class certification "may be conditional" is deleted. A court that
    is not satisfied that the requirements of Rule 23 have been met
    should refuse certification until they have been met. The provision
    that permits alteration or amendment of an order granting or
    denying class certification is amended to set the cut-off point at
    final judgment rather than "the decision on the merits." This
    change avoids the possible ambiguity in referring to "the decision
    on the merits." Following a determination of liability, for
    example, proceedings to define the remedy may demonstrate the need
    to amend the class definition or subdivide the class. In this
    setting the final judgment concept is pragmatic. It is not the same
    as the concept used for appeal purposes, but it should be flexible,
    particularly in protracted litigation.
      The authority to amend an order under Rule 23(c)(1) before final
    judgment does not restore the practice of "one-way intervention"
    that was rejected by the 1966 revision of Rule 23. A determination
    of liability after certification, however, may show a need to amend
    the class definition. Decertification may be warranted after
    further proceedings.
      If the definition of a class certified under Rule 23(b)(3) is
    altered to include members who have not been afforded notice and an
    opportunity to request exclusion, notice - including an opportunity
    to request exclusion - must be directed to the new class members
    under Rule 23(c)(2)(B).
      Paragraph (2). The first change made in Rule 23(c)(2) is to call
    attention to the court's authority - already established in part by
    Rule 23(d)(2) - to direct notice of certification to a Rule
    23(b)(1) or (b)(2) class. The present rule expressly requires
    notice only in actions certified under Rule 23(b)(3). Members of
    classes certified under Rules 23(b)(1) or (b)(2) have interests
    that may deserve protection by notice.
      The authority to direct notice to class members in a (b)(1) or
    (b)(2) class action should be exercised with care. For several
    reasons, there may be less need for notice than in a (b)(3) class
    action. There is no right to request exclusion from a (b)(1) or
    (b)(2) class. The characteristics of the class may reduce the need
    for formal notice. The cost of providing notice, moreover, could
    easily cripple actions that do not seek damages. The court may
    decide not to direct notice after balancing the risk that notice
    costs may deter the pursuit of class relief against the benefits of
    notice.
      When the court does direct certification notice in a (b)(1) or
    (b)(2) class action, the discretion and flexibility established by
    subdivision (c)(2)(A) extend to the method of giving notice. Notice
    facilitates the opportunity to participate. Notice calculated to
    reach a significant number of class members often will protect the
    interests of all. Informal methods may prove effective. A simple
    posting in a place visited by many class members, directing
    attention to a source of more detailed information, may suffice.
    The court should consider the costs of notice in relation to the
    probable reach of inexpensive methods.
      If a Rule 23(b)(3) class is certified in conjunction with a
    (b)(2) class, the (c)(2)(B) notice requirements must be satisfied
    as to the (b)(3) class.
      The direction that class-certification notice be couched in
    plain, easily understood language is a reminder of the need to work
    unremittingly at the difficult task of communicating with class
    members. It is difficult to provide information about most class
    actions that is both accurate and easily understood by class
    members who are not themselves lawyers. Factual uncertainty, legal
    complexity, and the complication of class-action procedure raise
    the barriers high. The Federal Judicial Center has created
    illustrative clear-notice forms that provide a helpful starting
    point for actions similar to those described in the forms.
      Subdivision (e). Subdivision (e) is amended to strengthen the
    process of reviewing proposed class-action settlements. Settlement
    may be a desirable means of resolving a class action. But court
    review and approval are essential to assure adequate representation
    of class members who have not participated in shaping the
    settlement.
      Paragraph (1). Subdivision (e)(1)(A) expressly recognizes the
    power of a class representative to settle class claims, issues, or
    defenses.
      Rule 23(e)(1)(A) resolves the ambiguity in former Rule 23(e)'s
    reference to dismissal or compromise of "a class action." That
    language could be - and at times was - read to require court
    approval of settlements with putative class representatives that
    resolved only individual claims. See Manual for Complex Litigation
    Third, Sec. 30.41. The new rule requires approval only if the
    claims, issues, or defenses of a certified class are resolved by a
    settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise.
      Subdivision (e)(1)(B) carries forward the notice requirement of
    present Rule 23(e) when the settlement binds the class through
    claim or issue preclusion; notice is not required when the
    settlement binds only the individual class representatives. Notice
    of a settlement binding on the class is required either when the
    settlement follows class certification or when the decisions on
    certification and settlement proceed simultaneously.
      Reasonable settlement notice may require individual notice in the
    manner required by Rule 23(c)(2)(B) for certification notice to a
    Rule 23(b)(3) class. Individual notice is appropriate, for example,
    if class members are required to take action - such as filing
    claims - to participate in the judgment, or if the court orders a
    settlement opt-out opportunity under Rule 23(e)(3).
      Subdivision (e)(1)(C) confirms and mandates the already common
    practice of holding hearings as part of the process of approving
    settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise that would bind
    members of a class.
      Subdivision (e)(1)(C) states the standard for approving a
    proposed settlement that would bind class members. The settlement
    must be fair, reasonable, and adequate. A helpful review of many
    factors that may deserve consideration is provided by In re:
    Prudential Ins. Co. America Sales Practice Litigation Agent
    Actions, 148 F.3d 283, 316-324 (3d Cir. 1998). Further guidance can
    be found in the Manual for Complex Litigation.
      The court must make findings that support the conclusion that the
    settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. The findings must be
    set out in sufficient detail to explain to class members and the
    appellate court the factors that bear on applying the standard.
      Settlement review also may provide an occasion to review the
    cogency of the initial class definition. The terms of the
    settlement themselves, or objections, may reveal divergent
    interests of class members and demonstrate the need to redefine the
    class or to designate subclasses. Redefinition of a class certified
    under Rule 23(b)(3) may require notice to new class members under
    Rule 23(c)(2)(B). See Rule 23(c)(1)(C).
      Paragraph (2). Subdivision (e)(2) requires parties seeking
    approval of a settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise under
    Rule 23(e)(1) to file a statement identifying any agreement made in
    connection with the settlement. This provision does not change the
    basic requirement that the parties disclose all terms of the
    settlement or compromise that the court must approve under Rule
    23(e)(1). It aims instead at related undertakings that, although
    seemingly separate, may have influenced the terms of the settlement
    by trading away possible advantages for the class in return for
    advantages for others. Doubts should be resolved in favor of
    identification.
      Further inquiry into the agreements identified by the parties
    should not become the occasion for discovery by the parties or
    objectors. The court may direct the parties to provide to the court
    or other parties a summary or copy of the full terms of any
    agreement identified by the parties. The court also may direct the
    parties to provide a summary or copy of any agreement not
    identified by the parties that the court considers relevant to its
    review of a proposed settlement. In exercising discretion under
    this rule, the court may act in steps, calling first for a summary
    of any agreement that may have affected the settlement and then for
    a complete version if the summary does not provide an adequate
    basis for review. A direction to disclose a summary or copy of an
    agreement may raise concerns of confidentiality. Some agreements
    may include information that merits protection against general
    disclosure. And the court must provide an opportunity to claim work-
    product or other protections.
      Paragraph (3). Subdivision (e)(3) authorizes the court to refuse
    to approve a settlement unless the settlement affords class members
    a new opportunity to request exclusion from a class certified under
    Rule 23(b)(3) after settlement terms are known. An agreement by the
    parties themselves to permit class members to elect exclusion at
    this point by the settlement agreement may be one factor supporting
    approval of the settlement. Often there is an opportunity to opt
    out at this point because the class is certified and settlement is
    reached in circumstances that lead to simultaneous notice of
    certification and notice of settlement. In these cases, the basic
    opportunity to elect exclusion applies without further
    complication. In some cases, particularly if settlement appears
    imminent at the time of certification, it may be possible to
    achieve equivalent protection by deferring notice and the
    opportunity to elect exclusion until actual settlement terms are
    known. This approach avoids the cost and potential confusion of
    providing two notices and makes the single notice more meaningful.
    But notice should not be delayed unduly after certification in the
    hope of settlement.
      Rule 23(e)(3) authorizes the court to refuse to approve a
    settlement unless the settlement affords a new opportunity to elect
    exclusion in a case that settles after a certification decision if
    the earlier opportunity to elect exclusion provided with the
    certification notice has expired by the time of the settlement
    notice. A decision to remain in the class is likely to be more
    carefully considered and is better informed when settlement terms
    are known.
      The opportunity to request exclusion from a proposed settlement
    is limited to members of a (b)(3) class. Exclusion may be requested
    only by individual class members; no class member may purport to
    opt out other class members by way of another class action.
      The decision whether to approve a settlement that does not allow
    a new opportunity to elect exclusion is confided to the court's
    discretion. The court may make this decision before directing
    notice to the class under Rule 23(e)(1)(B) or after the Rule
    23(e)(1)(C) hearing. Many factors may influence the court's
    decision. Among these are changes in the information available to
    class members since expiration of the first opportunity to request
    exclusion, and the nature of the individual class members' claims.
      The terms set for permitting a new opportunity to elect exclusion
    from the proposed settlement of a Rule 23(b)(3) class action may
    address concerns of potential misuse. The court might direct, for
    example, that class members who elect exclusion are bound by
    rulings on the merits made before the settlement was proposed for
    approval. Still other terms or conditions may be appropriate.
      Paragraph (4). Subdivision (e)(4) confirms the right of class
    members to object to a proposed settlement, voluntary dismissal, or
    compromise. The right is defined in relation to a disposition that,
    because it would bind the class, requires court approval under
    subdivision (e)(1)(C).
      Subdivision (e)(4)(B) requires court approval for withdrawal of
    objections made under subdivision (e)(4)(A). Review follows
    automatically if the objections are withdrawn on terms that lead to
    modification of the settlement with the class. Review also is
    required if the objector formally withdraws the objections. If the
    objector simply abandons pursuit of the objection, the court may
    inquire into the circumstances.
      Approval under paragraph (4)(B) may be given or denied with
    little need for further inquiry if the objection and the
    disposition go only to a protest that the individual treatment
    afforded the objector under the proposed settlement is unfair
    because of factors that distinguish the objector from other class
    members. Different considerations may apply if the objector has
    protested that the proposed settlement is not fair, reasonable, or
    adequate on grounds that apply generally to a class or subclass.
    Such objections, which purport to represent class-wide interests,
    may augment the opportunity for obstruction or delay. If such
    objections are surrendered on terms that do not affect the class
    settlement or the objector's participation in the class settlement,
    the court often can approve withdrawal of the objections without
    elaborate inquiry.
      Once an objector appeals, control of the proceeding lies in the
    court of appeals. The court of appeals may undertake review and
    approval of a settlement with the objector, perhaps as part of
    appeal settlement procedures, or may remand to the district court
    to take advantage of the district court's familiarity with the
    action and settlement.
      Subdivision (g). Subdivision (g) is new. It responds to the
    reality that the selection and activity of class counsel are often
    critically important to the successful handling of a class action.
    Until now, courts have scrutinized proposed class counsel as well
    as the class representative under Rule 23(a)(4). This experience
    has recognized the importance of judicial evaluation of the
    proposed lawyer for the class, and this new subdivision builds on
    that experience rather than introducing an entirely new element
    into the class certification process. Rule 23(a)(4) will continue
    to call for scrutiny of the proposed class representative, while
    this subdivision will guide the court in assessing proposed class
    counsel as part of the certification decision. This subdivision
    recognizes the importance of class counsel, states the obligation
    to represent the interests of the class, and provides a framework
    for selection of class counsel. The procedure and standards for
    appointment vary depending on whether there are multiple applicants
    to be class counsel. The new subdivision also provides a method by
    which the court may make directions from the outset about the
    potential fee award to class counsel in the event the action is
    successful.
      Paragraph (1) sets out the basic requirement that class counsel
    be appointed if a class is certified and articulates the obligation
    of class counsel to represent the interests of the class, as
    opposed to the potentially conflicting interests of individual
    class members. It also sets out the factors the court should
    consider in assessing proposed class counsel.
      Paragraph (1)(A) requires that the court appoint class counsel to
    represent the class. Class counsel must be appointed for all
    classes, including each subclass that the court certifies to
    represent divergent interests.
      Paragraph (1)(A) does not apply if "a statute provides
    otherwise." This recognizes that provisions of the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104-67, 109
    Stat. 737 (1995) (codified in various sections of 15 U.S.C.),
    contain directives that bear on selection of a lead plaintiff and
    the retention of counsel. This subdivision does not purport to
    supersede or to affect the interpretation of those provisions, or
    any similar provisions of other legislation.
      Paragraph 1(B) recognizes that the primary responsibility of
    class counsel, resulting from appointment as class counsel, is to
    represent the best interests of the class. The rule thus
    establishes the obligation of class counsel, an obligation that may
    be different from the customary obligations of counsel to
    individual clients. Appointment as class counsel means that the
    primary obligation of counsel is to the class rather than to any
    individual members of it. The class representatives do not have an
    unfettered right to "fire" class counsel. In the same vein, the
    class representatives cannot command class counsel to accept or
    reject a settlement proposal. To the contrary, class counsel must
    determine whether seeking the court's approval of a settlement
    would be in the best interests of the class as a whole.
      Paragraph (1)(C) articulates the basic responsibility of the
    court to appoint class counsel who will provide the adequate
    representation called for by paragraph (1)(B). It identifies
    criteria that must be considered and invites the court to consider
    any other pertinent matters. Although couched in terms of the
    court's duty, the listing also informs counsel seeking appointment
    about the topics that should be addressed in an application for
    appointment or in the motion for class certification.
      The court may direct potential class counsel to provide
    additional information about the topics mentioned in paragraph
    (1)(C) or about any other relevant topic. For example, the court
    may direct applicants to inform the court concerning any agreements
    about a prospective award of attorney fees or nontaxable costs, as
    such agreements may sometimes be significant in the selection of
    class counsel. The court might also direct that potential class
    counsel indicate how parallel litigation might be coordinated or
    consolidated with the action before the court.
      The court may also direct counsel to propose terms for a
    potential award of attorney fees and nontaxable costs. Attorney fee
    awards are an important feature of class action practice, and
    attention to this subject from the outset may often be a productive
    technique. Paragraph (2)(C) therefore authorizes the court to
    provide directions about attorney fees and costs when appointing
    class counsel. Because there will be numerous class actions in
    which this information is not likely to be useful, the court need
    not consider it in all class actions.
      Some information relevant to class counsel appointment may
    involve matters that include adversary preparation in a way that
    should be shielded from disclosure to other parties. An appropriate
    protective order may be necessary to preserve confidentiality.
      In evaluating prospective class counsel, the court should weigh
    all pertinent factors. No single factor should necessarily be
    determinative in a given case. For example, the resources counsel
    will commit to the case must be appropriate to its needs, but the
    court should be careful not to limit consideration to lawyers with
    the greatest resources.
      If, after review of all applicants, the court concludes that none
    would be satisfactory class counsel, it may deny class
    certification, reject all applications, recommend that an
    application be modified, invite new applications, or make any other
    appropriate order regarding selection and appointment of class
    counsel.
      Paragraph (2). This paragraph sets out the procedure that should
    be followed in appointing class counsel. Although it affords
    substantial flexibility, it provides the framework for appointment
    of class counsel in all class actions. For counsel who filed the
    action, the materials submitted in support of the motion for class
    certification may suffice to justify appointment so long as the
    information described in paragraph (g)(1)(C) is included. If there
    are other applicants, they ordinarily would file a formal
    application detailing their suitability for the position.
      In a plaintiff class action the court usually would appoint as
    class counsel only an attorney or attorneys who have sought
    appointment. Different considerations may apply in defendant class
    actions.
      The rule states that the court should appoint "class counsel." In
    many instances, the applicant will be an individual attorney. In
    other cases, however, an entire firm, or perhaps numerous attorneys
    who are not otherwise affiliated but are collaborating on the
    action will apply. No rule of thumb exists to determine when such
    arrangements are appropriate; the court should be alert to the need
    for adequate staffing of the case, but also to the risk of
    overstaffing or an ungainly counsel structure.
      Paragraph (2)(A) authorizes the court to designate interim
    counsel during the pre-certification period if necessary to protect
    the interests of the putative class. Rule 23(c)(1)(B) directs that
    the order certifying the class include appointment of class
    counsel. Before class certification, however, it will usually be
    important for an attorney to take action to prepare for the
    certification decision. The amendment to Rule 23(c)(1) recognizes
    that some discovery is often necessary for that determination. It
    also may be important to make or respond to motions before
    certification. Settlement may be discussed before certification.
    Ordinarily, such work is handled by the lawyer who filed the
    action. In some cases, however, there may be rivalry or uncertainty
    that makes formal designation of interim counsel appropriate. Rule
    23(g)(2)(A) authorizes the court to designate interim counsel to
    act on behalf of the putative class before the certification
    decision is made. Failure to make the formal designation does not
    prevent the attorney who filed the action from proceeding in it.
    Whether or not formally designated interim counsel, an attorney who
    acts on behalf of the class before certification must act in the
    best interests of the class as a whole. For example, an attorney
    who negotiates a pre-certification settlement must seek a
    settlement that is fair, reasonable, and adequate for the class.
      Rule 23(c)(1) provides that the court should decide whether to
    certify the class "at an early practicable time," and directs that
    class counsel should be appointed in the order certifying the
    class. In some cases, it may be appropriate for the court to allow
    a reasonable period after commencement of the action for filing
    applications to serve as class counsel. The primary ground for
    deferring appointment would be that there is reason to anticipate
    competing applications to serve as class counsel. Examples might
    include instances in which more than one class action has been
    filed, or in which other attorneys have filed individual actions on
    behalf of putative class members. The purpose of facilitating
    competing applications in such a case is to afford the best
    possible representation for the class. Another possible reason for
    deferring appointment would be that the initial applicant was found
    inadequate, but it seems appropriate to permit additional
    applications rather than deny class certification.
      Paragraph (2)(B) states the basic standard the court should use
    in deciding whether to certify the class and appoint class counsel
    in the single applicant situation - that the applicant be able to
    provide the representation called for by paragraph (1)(B) in light
    of the factors identified in paragraph (1)(C).
      If there are multiple adequate applicants, paragraph (2)(B)
    directs the court to select the class counsel best able to
    represent the interests of the class. This decision should also be
    made using the factors outlined in paragraph (1)(C), but in the
    multiple applicant situation the court is to go beyond scrutinizing
    the adequacy of counsel and make a comparison of the strengths of
    the various applicants. As with the decision whether to appoint the
    sole applicant for the position, no single factor should be
    dispositive in selecting class counsel in cases in which there are
    multiple applicants. The fact that a given attorney filed the
    instant action, for example, might not weigh heavily in the
    decision if that lawyer had not done significant work identifying
    or investigating claims. Depending on the nature of the case, one
    important consideration might be the applicant's existing attorney-
    client relationship with the proposed class representative.
      Paragraph (2)(C) builds on the appointment process by authorizing
    the court to include provisions regarding attorney fees in the
    order appointing class counsel. Courts may find it desirable to
    adopt guidelines for fees or nontaxable costs, or to direct class
    counsel to report to the court at regular intervals on the efforts
    undertaken in the action, to facilitate the court's later
    determination of a reasonable attorney fee.
      Subdivision (h). Subdivision (h) is new. Fee awards are a
    powerful influence on the way attorneys initiate, develop, and
    conclude class actions. Class action attorney fee awards have
    heretofore been handled, along with all other attorney fee awards,
    under Rule 54(d)(2), but that rule is not addressed to the
    particular concerns of class actions. This subdivision is designed
    to work in tandem with new subdivision (g) on appointment of class
    counsel, which may afford an opportunity for the court to provide
    an early framework for an eventual fee award, or for monitoring the
    work of class counsel during the pendency of the action.
      Subdivision (h) applies to "an action certified as a class
    action." This includes cases in which there is a simultaneous
    proposal for class certification and settlement even though
    technically the class may not be certified unless the court
    approves the settlement pursuant to review under Rule 23(e). When a
    settlement is proposed for Rule 23(e) approval, either after
    certification or with a request for certification, notice to class
    members about class counsel's fee motion would ordinarily accompany
    the notice to the class about the settlement proposal itself.
      This subdivision does not undertake to create new grounds for an
    award of attorney fees or nontaxable costs. Instead, it applies
    when such awards are authorized by law or by agreement of the
    parties. Against that background, it provides a format for all
    awards of attorney fees and nontaxable costs in connection with a
    class action, not only the award to class counsel. In some
    situations, there may be a basis for making an award to other
    counsel whose work produced a beneficial result for the class, such
    as attorneys who acted for the class before certification but were
    not appointed class counsel, or attorneys who represented objectors
    to a proposed settlement under Rule 23(e) or to the fee motion of
    class counsel. Other situations in which fee awards are authorized
    by law or by agreement of the parties may exist.
      This subdivision authorizes an award of "reasonable" attorney
    fees and nontaxable costs. This is the customary term for
    measurement of fee awards in cases in which counsel may obtain an
    award of fees under the "common fund" theory that applies in many
    class actions, and is used in many fee-shifting statutes. Depending
    on the circumstances, courts have approached the determination of
    what is reasonable in different ways. In particular, there is some
    variation among courts about whether in "common fund" cases the
    court should use the lodestar or a percentage method of determining
    what fee is reasonable. The rule does not attempt to resolve the
    question whether the lodestar or percentage approach should be
    viewed as preferable.
      Active judicial involvement in measuring fee awards is singularly
    important to the proper operation of the class-action process.
    Continued reliance on caselaw development of fee-award measures
    does not diminish the court's responsibility. In a class action,
    the district court must ensure that the amount and mode of payment
    of attorney fees are fair and proper whether the fees come from a
    common fund or are otherwise paid. Even in the absence of
    objections, the court bears this responsibility.
      Courts discharging this responsibility have looked to a variety
    of factors. One fundamental focus is the result actually achieved
    for class members, a basic consideration in any case in which fees
    are sought on the basis of a benefit achieved for class members.
    The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 explicitly
    makes this factor a cap for a fee award in actions to which it
    applies. See 15 U.S.C. Secs. 77z-1(a)(6); 78u-4(a)(6) (fee award
    should not exceed a "reasonable percentage of the amount of any
    damages and prejudgment interest actually paid to the class"). For
    a percentage approach to fee measurement, results achieved is the
    basic starting point.
      In many instances, the court may need to proceed with care in
    assessing the value conferred on class members. Settlement regimes
    that provide for future payments, for example, may not result in
    significant actual payments to class members. In this connection,
    the court may need to scrutinize the manner and operation of any
    applicable claims procedure. In some cases, it may be appropriate
    to defer some portion of the fee award until actual payouts to
    class members are known. Settlements involving nonmonetary
    provisions for class members also deserve careful scrutiny to
    ensure that these provisions have actual value to the class. On
    occasion the court's Rule 23(e) review will provide a solid basis
    for this sort of evaluation, but in any event it is also important
    to assessing the fee award for the class.
      At the same time, it is important to recognize that in some class
    actions the monetary relief obtained is not the sole determinant of
    an appropriate attorney fees award. Cf. Blanchard v. Bergeron, 489
    U.S. 87, 95 (1989) (cautioning in an individual case against an
    "undesirable emphasis" on "the importance of the recovery of
    damages in civil rights litigation" that might "shortchange efforts
    to seek effective injunctive or declaratory relief").
      Any directions or orders made by the court in connection with
    appointing class counsel under Rule 23(g) should weigh heavily in
    making a fee award under this subdivision.
      Courts have also given weight to agreements among the parties
    regarding the fee motion, and to agreements between class counsel
    and others about the fees claimed by the motion. Rule 54(d)(2)(B)
    provides: "If directed by the court, the motion shall also disclose
    the terms of any agreement with respect to fees to be paid for the
    services for which claim is made." The agreement by a settling
    party not to oppose a fee application up to a certain amount, for
    example, is worthy of consideration, but the court remains
    responsible to determine a reasonable fee. "Side agreements"
    regarding fees provide at least perspective pertinent to an
    appropriate fee award.
      In addition, courts may take account of the fees charged by class
    counsel or other attorneys for representing individual claimants or
    objectors in the case. In determining a fee for class counsel, the
    court's objective is to ensure an overall fee that is fair for
    counsel and equitable within the class. In some circumstances
    individual fee agreements between class counsel and class members
    might have provisions inconsistent with those goals, and the court
    might determine that adjustments in the class fee award were
    necessary as a result.
      Finally, it is important to scrutinize separately the application
    for an award covering nontaxable costs. If costs were addressed in
    the order appointing class counsel, those directives should be a
    presumptive starting point in determining what is an appropriate
    award.
      Paragraph (1). Any claim for an award of attorney fees must be
    sought by motion under Rule 54(d)(2), which invokes the provisions
    for timing of appeal in Rule 58 and Appellate Rule 4. Owing to the
    distinctive features of class action fee motions, however, the
    provisions of this subdivision control disposition of fee motions
    in class actions, while Rule 54(d)(2) applies to matters not
    addressed in this subdivision.
      The court should direct when the fee motion must be filed. For
    motions by class counsel in cases subject to court review of a
    proposed settlement under Rule 23(e), it would be important to
    require the filing of at least the initial motion in time for
    inclusion of information about the motion in the notice to the
    class about the proposed settlement that is required by Rule 23(e).
    In cases litigated to judgment, the court might also order class
    counsel's motion to be filed promptly so that notice to the class
    under this subdivision (h) can be given.
      Besides service of the motion on all parties, notice of class
    counsel's motion for attorney fees must be "directed to the class
    in a reasonable manner." Because members of the class have an
    interest in the arrangements for payment of class counsel whether
    that payment comes from the class fund or is made directly by
    another party, notice is required in all instances. In cases in
    which settlement approval is contemplated under Rule 23(e), notice
    of class counsel's fee motion should be combined with notice of the
    proposed settlement, and the provision regarding notice to the
    class is parallel to the requirements for notice under Rule 23(e).
    In adjudicated class actions, the court may calibrate the notice to
    avoid undue expense.
      Paragraph (2). A class member and any party from whom payment is
    sought may object to the fee motion. Other parties - for example,
    nonsettling defendants - may not object because they lack a
    sufficient interest in the amount the court awards. The rule does
    not specify a time limit for making an objection. In setting the
    date objections are due, the court should provide sufficient time
    after the full fee motion is on file to enable potential objectors
    to examine the motion.
      The court may allow an objector discovery relevant to the
    objections. In determining whether to allow discovery, the court
    should weigh the need for the information against the cost and
    delay that would attend discovery. See Rule 26(b)(2). One factor in
    determining whether to authorize discovery is the completeness of
    the material submitted in support of the fee motion, which depends
    in part on the fee measurement standard applicable to the case. If
    the motion provides thorough information, the burden should be on
    the objector to justify discovery to obtain further information.
      Paragraph (3). Whether or not there are formal objections, the
    court must determine whether a fee award is justified and, if so,
    set a reasonable fee. The rule does not require a formal hearing in
    all cases. The form and extent of a hearing depend on the
    circumstances of the case. The rule does require findings and
    conclusions under Rule 52(a).
      Paragraph (4). By incorporating Rule 54(d)(2), this provision
    gives the court broad authority to obtain assistance in determining
    the appropriate amount to award. In deciding whether to direct
    submission of such questions to a special master or magistrate
    judge, the court should give appropriate consideration to the cost
    and delay that such a process might entail.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Rule 23(c)(1)(B) is
    changed to incorporate the counsel-appointment provisions of Rule
    23(g). The statement of the method and time for requesting
    exclusion from a (b)(3) class has been moved to the notice of
    certification provision in Rule 23(c)(2)(B).
      Rule 23(c)(1)(C) is changed by deleting all references to
    "conditional" certification.
      Rule 23(c)(2)(A) is changed by deleting the requirement that
    class members be notified of certification of a (b)(1) or (b)(2)
    class. The new version provides only that the court may direct
    appropriate notice to the class.
      Rule 23(c)(2)(B) is revised to require that the notice of class
    certification define the certified class in terms identical to the
    terms used in (c)(1)(B), and to incorporate the statement
    transferred from (c)(1)(B) on "when and how members may elect to be
    excluded."
      Rule 23(e)(1) is revised to delete the requirement that the
    parties must win court approval for a precertification dismissal or
    settlement.
      Rule 23(e)(2) is revised to change the provision that the court
    may direct the parties to file a copy or summary of any agreement
    or understanding made in connection with a proposed settlement. The
    new provision directs the parties to a proposed settlement to
    identify any agreement made in connection with the settlement.
      Rule 23(e)(3) is proposed in a restyled form of the second
    version proposed for publication.
      Rule 23(e)(4)(B) is restyled.
      Rule 23(g)(1)(C) is a transposition of criteria for appointing
    class counsel that was published as Rule 23(g)(2)(B). The criteria
    are rearranged, and expanded to include consideration of experience
    in handling claims of the type asserted in the action and of
    counsel's knowledge of the applicable law.
      Rule 23(g)(2)(A) is a new provision for designation of interim
    counsel to act on behalf of a putative class before a certification
    determination is made.
      Rule 23(g)(2)(B) is revised to point up the differences between
    appointment of class counsel when there is only one applicant and
    when there are competing applicants. When there is only one
    applicant the court must determine that the applicant is able to
    fairly and adequately represent class interests. When there is more
    than one applicant the court must appoint the applicant best able
    to represent class interests.
      Rule 23(h) is changed to require that notice of an attorney-fee
    motion by class counsel be "directed to class members," rather than
    "given to all class members."

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 23 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Amended Rule 23(d)(2) carries forward the provisions of former
    Rule 23(d) that recognize two separate propositions. First, a Rule
    23(d) order may be combined with a pretrial order under Rule 16.
    Second, the standard for amending the Rule 23(d) order continues to
    be the more open-ended standard for amending Rule 23(d) orders, not
    the more exacting standard for amending Rule 16 orders.
      As part of the general restyling, intensifiers that provide
    emphasis but add no meaning are consistently deleted. Amended Rule
    23(f) omits as redundant the explicit reference to court of appeals
    discretion in deciding whether to permit an interlocutory appeal.
    The omission does not in any way limit the unfettered discretion
    established by the original rule.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The time set in the former rule at 10 days has been revised to 14
    days. See the Note to Rule 6.

    corporation or association may properly assert but has failed to
    enforce. The derivative action may not be maintained if it appears
    that the plaintiff does not fairly and adequately represent the
    interests of shareholders or members who are similarly situated in
    enforcing the right of the corporation or association.
      (b) Pleading Requirements. The complaint must be verified and
    must:
        (1) allege that the plaintiff was a shareholder or member at
      the time of the transaction complained of, or that the
      plaintiff's share or membership later devolved on it by operation
      of law;
        (2) allege that the action is not a collusive one to confer
      jurisdiction that the court would otherwise lack; and
        (3) state with particularity:
          (A) any effort by the plaintiff to obtain the desired action
        from the directors or comparable authority and, if necessary,
        from the shareholders or members; and
          (B) the reasons for not obtaining the action or not making
        the effort.

      (c) Settlement, Dismissal, and Compromise. A derivative action
    may be settled, voluntarily dismissed, or compromised only with the
    court's approval. Notice of a proposed settlement, voluntary
    dismissal, or compromise must be given to shareholders or members
    in the manner that the court orders.

      A derivative action by a shareholder of a corporation or by a
    member of an unincorporated association has distinctive aspects
    which require the special provisions set forth in the new rule. The

-STATUTE-
      This rule applies to an action brought by or against the members
    of an unincorporated association as a class by naming certain
    members as representative parties. The action may be maintained
    only if it appears that those parties will fairly and adequately
    protect the interests of the association and its members. In
    conducting the action, the court may issue any appropriate orders
    corresponding with those in Rule 23(d), and the procedure for
    settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise must correspond with
    the procedure in Rule 23(e).

      Although an action by or against representatives of the
    membership of an unincorporated association has often been viewed
    as a class action, the real or main purpose of this
    characterization has been to give "entity treatment" to the
    association when for formal reasons it cannot sue or be sued as a
    jural person under Rule 17(b). See Louisell & Hazard, Pleading and
    Procedure: State and Federal 718 (1962); 3 Moore's Federal

-HEAD-
    Rule 24. Intervention

-STATUTE-
      (a) Intervention of Right. On timely motion, the court must
    permit anyone to intervene who:
        (1) is given an unconditional right to intervene by a federal
      statute; or
        (2) claims an interest relating to the property or transaction
      that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that
      disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or
      impede the movant's ability to protect its interest, unless
      existing parties adequately represent that interest.

      (b) Permissive Intervention.
        (1) In General. On timely motion, the court may permit anyone
      to intervene who:
          (A) is given a conditional right to intervene by a federal
        statute; or
          (B) has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a
        common question of law or fact.

        (2) By a Government Officer or Agency. On timely motion, the
      court may permit a federal or state governmental officer or
      agency to intervene if a party's claim or defense is based on:
          (A) a statute or executive order administered by the officer
        or agency; or
          (B) any regulation, order, requirement, or agreement issued
        or made under the statute or executive order.

        (3) Delay or Prejudice. In exercising its discretion, the court
      must consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or
      prejudice the adjudication of the original parties' rights.

      (c) Notice and Pleading Required. A motion to intervene must be
    served on the parties as provided in Rule 5. The motion must state
    the grounds for intervention and be accompanied by a pleading that
    sets out the claim or defense for which intervention is sought.

      The right to intervene given by the following and similar
    statutes is preserved, but the procedure for its assertion is
    governed by this rule:

    U.S.C., Title 28:

     Sec. 45a [now 2323] (Special attorneys; participation by
          Interstate Commerce Commission; intervention) (in certain
          cases under interstate commerce laws)
     Sec. 48 [now 2322] (Suits to be against United States;
          intervention by United States)
     Sec. 401 [now 2403] (Intervention by United States;
          constitutionality of Federal statute)

    U.S.C., Title 40:

     Sec. 276a-2(b) [now 3144] (Bonds of contractors for public
          buildings or works; rights of persons furnishing labor and
          materials).

      Compare with the last sentence of [former] Equity Rule 37
    (Parties Generally - Intervention). This rule amplifies and
    restates the present federal practice at law and in equity. For the
    practice in admiralty see Admiralty Rules 34 (How Third Party May
    Intervene) and 42 (Claims Against Proceeds in Registry). See
    generally Moore and Levi, Federal Intervention: I The Right to
    Intervene and Reorganization (1936), 45 Yale L.J. 565. Under the
    codes two types of intervention are provided, one for the recovery
    of specific real or personal property (2 Ohio Gen.Code Ann. (Page,
    1926) Sec. 11263; Wyo.Rev.Stat.Ann. (Courtright, 1931) Sec. 89-
    522), and the other allowing intervention generally when the
    applicant has an interest in the matter in litigation (1
    Colo.Stat.Ann. (1935) Code Civ.Proc. Sec. 22; La.Code Pract. (Dart,
    1932) Arts. 389-394; Utah Rev.Stat.Ann. (1933) Sec. 104-3-24). The
    English intervention practice is based upon various rules and
    decisions and falls into the two categories of absolute right and
    discretionary right. For the absolute right see English Rules Under
    the Judicature Act (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 12, r. 24
    (admiralty), r. 25 (land), r. 23 (probate); O. 57, r. 12
    (execution); J. A. (1925) Secs. 181, 182, 183(2) (divorce); In re
    Metropolitan Amalgamated Estates, Ltd., (1912) 2 Ch. 497
    (receivership); Wilson v. Church, 9 Ch.D. 552 (1878)
    (representative action). For the discretionary right see O. 16, r.
    11 (nonjoinder) and Re Fowler, 142 L. T. Jo. 94 (Ch. 1916),
    Vavasseur v. Krupp, 9 Ch.D. 351 (1878) (persons out of the
    jurisdiction).

      Note. Subdivision (a). The addition to subdivision (a)(3) covers
    the situation where property may be in the actual custody of some
    other officer or agency - such as the Secretary of the Treasury -
    but the control and disposition of the property is lodged in the
    court wherein the action is pending.
      Subdivision (b). The addition in subdivision (b) permits the
    intervention of governmental officers or agencies in proper cases
    and thus avoids exclusionary constructions of the rule. For an
    example of the latter, see Matter of Bender Body Co. (Ref.Ohio
    1941) 47 F.Supp. 224, aff'd as moot (N.D.Ohio 1942) 47 F.Supp. 224,
    234, holding that the Administrator of the Office of Price
    Administration, then acting under the authority of an Executive
    Order of the President, could not intervene in a bankruptcy
    proceeding to protest the sale of assets above ceiling prices.
    Compare, however, Securities and Exchange Commission v. United
    States Realty & Improvement Co. (1940) 310 U.S. 434, where
    permissive intervention of the Commission to protect the public
    interest in an arrangement proceeding under Chapter XI of the
    Bankruptcy Act was upheld. See also dissenting opinion in
    Securities and Exchange Commission v. Long Island Lighting Co.
    (C.C.A.2d, 1945) 148 F.(2d) 252, judgment vacated as moot and case
    remanded with direction to dismiss complaint (1945) 325 U.S. 833.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1948 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment substitutes the present statutory reference.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      This amendment conforms to the amendment of Rule 5(a). See the
    Advisory Committee's Note to that amendment.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      In attempting to overcome certain difficulties which have arisen
    in the application of present Rule 24(a)(2) and (3), this amendment
    draws upon the revision of the related Rules 19 (joinder of persons
    needed for just adjudication) and 23 (class actions), and the
    reasoning underlying that revision.
      Rule 24(a)(3) as amended in 1948 provided for intervention of
    right where the applicant established that he would be adversely
    affected by the distribution or disposition of property involved in
    an action to which he had not been made a party. Significantly,
    some decided cases virtually disregarded the language of this
    provision. Thus Professor Moore states: "The concept of a fund has
    been applied so loosely that it is possible for a court to find a
    fund in almost any in personam action." 4 Moore's Federal Practice,
    par. 24.09[3], at 55 (2d ed. 1962), and see, e.g., Formulabs, Inc.
    v. Hartley Pen Co., 275 F.2d 52 (9th Cir. 1960). This development
    was quite natural, for Rule 24(a)(3) was unduly restricted. If an
    absentee would be substantially affected in a practical sense by
    the determination made in an action, he should, as a general rule,
    be entitled to intervene, and his right to do so should not depend
    on whether there is a fund to be distributed or otherwise disposed
    of. Intervention of right is here seen to be a kind of counterpart
    to Rule 19(a)(2)(i) on joinder of persons needed for a just
    adjudication: where, upon motion of a party in an action, an
    absentee should be joined so that he may protect his interest which
    as a practical matter may be substantially impaired by the
    disposition of the action, he ought to have a right to intervene in
    the action on his own motion. See Louisell & Hazard, Pleading and
    Procedure: State and Federal 749-50 (1962).
      The general purpose of original Rule 24(a)(2) was to entitle an
    absentee, purportedly represented by a party, to intervene in the
    action if he could establish with fair probability that the
    representation was inadequate. Thus, where an action is being
    prosecuted or defended by a trustee, a beneficiary of the trust
    should have a right to intervene if he can show that the trustee's
    representation of his interest probably is inadequate; similarly a
    member of a class should have the right to intervene in a class
    action if he can show the inadequacy of the representation of his
    interest by the representative parties before the court.
      Original Rule 24(a)(2), however, made it a condition of
    intervention that "the applicant is or may be bound by a judgment
    in the action," and this created difficulties with intervention in
    class actions. If the "bound" language was read literally in the
    sense of res judicata, it could defeat intervention in some
    meritorious cases. A member of a class to whom a judgment in a
    class action extended by its terms (see Rule 23(c)(3), as amended)
    might be entitled to show in a later action, when the judgment in
    the class action was claimed to operate as res judicata against
    him, that the "representative" in the class action had not in fact
    adequately represented him. If he could make this showing, the
    class-action judgment might be held not to bind him. See Hansberry
    v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32 (1940). If a class member sought to intervene
    in the class action proper, while it was still pending, on grounds
    of inadequacy of representation, he could be met with the argument:
    if the representation was in fact inadequate, he would not be
    "bound" by the judgment when it was subsequently asserted against
    him as res judicata, hence he was not entitled to intervene; if the
    representation was in fact adequate, there was no occasion or
    ground for intervention. See Sam Fox Publishing Co. v. United
    States, 366 U.S. 683 (1961); cf. Sutphen Estates, Inc. v. United
    States, 342 U.S. 19 (1951). This reasoning might be linguistically
    justified by original Rule 24(a)(2); but it could lead to poor
    results. Compare the discussion in International M. & I. Corp. v.
    Von Clemm, 301 F.2d 857 (2d Cir. 1962); Atlantic Refining Co. v.
    Standard Oil Co., 304 F.2d 387 (D.C.Cir. 1962). A class member who
    claims that his "representative" does not adequately represent him,
    and is able to establish that proposition with sufficient
    probability, should not be put to the risk of having a judgment
    entered in the action which by its terms extends to him, and be
    obliged to test the validity of the judgment as applied to his
    interest by a later collateral attack. Rather he should, as a
    general rule, be entitled to intervene in the action.
      The amendment provides that an applicant is entitled to intervene
    in an action when his position is comparable to that of a person
    under Rule 19(a)(2)(i), as amended, unless his interest is already
    adequately represented in the action by existing parties. The Rule
    19(a)(2)(i) criterion imports practical considerations, and the
    deletion of the "bound" language similarly frees the rule from
    undue preoccupation with strict considerations of res judicata.
      The representation whose adequacy comes into question under the
    amended rule is not confined to formal representation like that
    provided by a trustee for his beneficiary or a representative party
    in a class action for a member of the class. A party to an action
    may provide practical representation to the absentee seeking
    intervention although no such formal relationship exists between
    them, and the adequacy of this practical representation will then
    have to be weighed. See International M. & I. Corp. v. Von Clemm,
    and Atlantic Refining Co. v. Standard Oil Co., both supra; Wolpe v.
    Poretsky, 144 F.2d 505 (D.C.Cir. 1944), cert. denied, 323 U.S. 777
    (1944); cf. Ford Motor Co. v. Bisanz Bros., 249 F.2d 22 (8th Cir.
    1957); and generally, Annot., 84 A.L.R.2d 1412 (1961).
      An intervention of right under the amended rule may be subject to
    appropriate conditions or restrictions responsive among other
    things to the requirements of efficient conduct of the proceedings.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Language is added to bring Rule 24(c) into conformity with the
    statute cited, resolving some confusion reflected in district court
    rules. As the text provides, counsel challenging the
    constitutionality of legislation in an action in which the
    appropriate government is not a party should call the attention of
    the court to its duty to notify the appropriate governmental
    officers. The statute imposes the burden of notification on the
    court, not the party making the constitutional challenge, partly in
    order to protect against any possible waiver of constitutional
    rights by parties inattentive to the need for notice. For this
    reason, the failure of a party to call the court's attention to the
    matter cannot be treated as a waiver.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      New Rule 5.1 replaces the final three sentences of Rule 24(c),
    implementing the provisions of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2403. Section 2403
    requires notification to the Attorney General of the United States
    when the constitutionality of an Act of Congress is called in
    question, and to the state attorney general when the
    constitutionality of a state statute is drawn into question.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 24 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      The former rule stated that the same procedure is followed when a
    United States statute gives a right to intervene. The statement is
    deleted because it added nothing.

-HEAD-
    Rule 25. Substitution of Parties

-STATUTE-
      (a) Death.
        (1) Substitution if the Claim Is Not Extinguished. If a party
      dies and the claim is not extinguished, the court may order
      substitution of the proper party. A motion for substitution may
      be made by any party or by the decedent's successor or
      representative. If the motion is not made within 90 days after
      service of a statement noting the death, the action by or against
      the decedent must be dismissed.
        (2) Continuation Among the Remaining Parties. After a party's
      death, if the right sought to be enforced survives only to or
      against the remaining parties, the action does not abate, but
      proceeds in favor of or against the remaining parties. The death
      should be noted on the record.
        (3) Service. A motion to substitute, together with a notice of
      hearing, must be served on the parties as provided in Rule 5 and
      on nonparties as provided in Rule 4. A statement noting death
      must be served in the same manner. Service may be made in any
      judicial district.

      (b) Incompetency. If a party becomes incompetent, the court may,
    on motion, permit the action to be continued by or against the
    party's representative. The motion must be served as provided in
    Rule 25(a)(3).
      (c) Transfer of Interest. If an interest is transferred, the
    action may be continued by or against the original party unless the
    court, on motion, orders the transferee to be substituted in the
    action or joined with the original party. The motion must be served
    as provided in Rule 25(a)(3).
      (d) Public Officers; Death or Separation from Office. An action
    does not abate when a public officer who is a party in an official
    capacity dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold office while
    the action is pending. The officer's successor is automatically
    substituted as a party. Later proceedings should be in the
    substituted party's name, but any misnomer not affecting the
    parties' substantial rights must be disregarded. The court may
    order substitution at any time, but the absence of such an order
    does not affect the substitution.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      Note to Subdivision (a). 1. The first paragraph of this rule is
    based upon [former] Equity Rule 45 (Death of Party - Revivor) and
    U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Sec. 778 (Death of parties; substitution
    of executor or administrator). The scire facias procedure provided
    for in the statute cited is superseded and the writ is abolished by
    Rule 81 (b). Paragraph two states the content of U.S.C., Title 28,
    [former] Sec. 779 (Death of one of several plaintiffs or
    defendants). With these two paragraphs compare generally English
    Rules Under the Judicature Act (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 17,
    r.r. 1-10.
      2. This rule modifies U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Secs. 778 (Death
    of parties; substitution of executor or administrator), 779 (Death
    of one of several plaintiffs or defendants), and 780 (Survival of
    actions, suits, or proceedings, etc.) insofar as they differ from
    it.
      Note to Subdivisions (b) and (c). These are a combination and
    adaptation of N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) Sec. 83 and Calif.Code Civ.Proc.
    (Deering, 1937) Sec. 385; see also 4 Nev.Comp.Laws (Hillyer, 1929)
    Sec. 8561.
      Note to Subdivision (d). With the first and last sentences
    compare U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Sec. 780 (Survival of actions,
    suits, or proceedings, etc.). With the second sentence of this
    subdivision compare Ex parte La Prade, 289 U.S. 444 (1933).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1948 AMENDMENT       
      The Act of February 13, 1925, 43 Stat. 941, U.S.C. Title 28, Sec.
    780, is repealed and not included in revised Title 28, for the
    stated reason that it is "Superseded by Rules 25 and 81 of the
    Federal Rules of Civil Procedure." See Report from the Committee on
    the Judiciary, House of Representatives, to Accompany H.R. 3214,
    House Rept. 308 (80th Cong., 1st Sess.), p. A239. Those officers
    which that Act specified but which were not enumerated in Rule
    25(d), namely, officers of "the Canal Zone, or of a Territory or an
    insular possession of the United States, . . . or other
    governmental agency of such Territory or insular possession,"
    should now be specifically enumerated in the rule and the amendment
    so provides.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1961 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (d)(1). Present Rule 25(d) is generally considered to
    be unsatisfactory. 4 Moore's Federal Practice &#182; 25.01[7] (2d
    ed. 1950); Wright, Amendments to the Federal Rules: The Function of
    a Continuing Rules Committee, 7 Vand.L.Rev. 521, 529 (1954);
    Developments in the Law - Remedies Against the United States and
    Its Officials, 70 Harv.L.Rev. 827, 931-34 (1957). To require, as a
    condition of substituting a successor public officer as a party to
    a pending action, that an application be made with a showing that
    there is substantial need for continuing the litigation, can rarely
    serve any useful purpose and fosters a burdensome formality. And to
    prescribe a short, fixed time period for substitution which cannot
    be extended even by agreement, see Snyder v. Buck, 340 U.S. 15, 19
    (1950), with the penalty of dismissal of the action, "makes a trap
    for unsuspecting litigants which seems unworthy of a great
    government." Vibra Brush Corp. v. Schaffer, 256 F.2d 681, 684 (2d
    Cir. 1958). Although courts have on occasion found means of
    undercutting the rule, e.g. Acheson v. Furusho, 212 F.2d 284 (9th
    Cir. 1954) (substitution of defendant officer unnecessary on theory
    that only a declaration of status was sought), it has operated
    harshly in many instances, e.g. Snyder v. Buck, supra; Poindexter
    v. Folsom, 242 F.2d 516 (3d Cir. 1957).
      Under the amendment, the successor is automatically substituted
    as a party without an application or showing of need to continue
    the action. An order of substitution is not required, but may be
    entered at any time if a party desires or the court thinks fit.
      The general term "public officer" is used in preference to the
    enumeration which appears in the present rule. It comprises
    Federal, State, and local officers.
      The expression "in his official capacity" is to be interpreted in
    its context as part of a simple procedural rule for substitution;
    care should be taken not to distort its meaning by mistaken
    analogies to the doctrine of sovereign immunity from suit or the
    Eleventh Amendment. The amended rule will apply to all actions
    brought by public officers for the government, and to any action
    brought in form against a named officer, but intrinsically against
    the government or the office or the incumbent thereof whoever he
    may be from time to time during the action. Thus the amended rule
    will apply to actions against officers to compel performance of
    official duties or to obtain judicial review of their orders. It
    will also apply to actions to prevent officers from acting in
    excess of their authority or under authority not validly conferred,
    cf. Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, 223 U.S. 605 (1912), or from
    enforcing unconstitutional enactments, cf. Ex parte Young, 209 U.S.
    123 (1908); Ex parte La Prade, 289 U.S. 444 (1933). In general it
    will apply whenever effective relief would call for corrective
    behavior by the one then having official status and power, rather
    than one who has lost that status and power through ceasing to hold
    office. Cf. Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731 (1947); Larson v. Domestic
    & Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682 (1949). Excluded from the
    operation of the amended rule will be the relatively infrequent
    actions which are directed to securing money judgments against the
    named officers enforceable against their personal assets; in these
    cases Rule 25(a)(1), not Rule 25(d), applies to the question of
    substitution. Examples are actions against officers seeking to make
    them pay damages out of their own pockets for defamatory utterances
    or other misconduct in some way related to the office, see Barr v.
    Matteo, 360 U.S. 564 (1959); Howard v. Lyons, 360 U.S. 593 (1959);
    Gregoire v. Biddle, 177 F.2d 579 (2d Cir. 1949), cert. denied, 339
    U.S. 949 (1950). Another example is the anomalous action for a tax
    refund against a collector of internal revenue, see Ignelzi v.
    Granger, 16 F.R.D. 517 (W.D.Pa. 1955), 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2006, 4
    Moore, supra, &#182; 25.05, p. 531; but see 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    1346(a)(1), authorizing the bringing of such suits against the
    United States rather than the officer.
      Automatic substitution under the amended rule, being merely a
    procedural device for substituting a successor for a past
    officeholder as a party, is distinct from and does not affect any
    substantive issues which may be involved in the action. Thus a
    defense of immunity from suit will remain in the case despite a
    substitution.
      Where the successor does not intend to pursue the policy of his
    predecessor which gave rise to the lawsuit, it will be open to him,
    after substitution, as plaintiff to seek voluntary dismissal of the
    action, or as defendant to seek to have the action dismissed as
    moot or to take other appropriate steps to avert a judgment or
    decree. Contrast Ex parte La Prade, supra; Allen v. Regents of the
    University System, 304 U.S. 439 (1938); McGrath v. National Assn.
    of Mfgrs., 344 U.S. 804 (1952); Danenberg v. Cohen, 213 F.2d 944
    (7th Cir. 1954).
      As the present amendment of Rule 25(d)(1) eliminates a specified
    time period to secure substitution of public officers, the
    reference in Rule 6(b) (regarding enlargement of time) to Rule 25
    will no longer apply to these public-officer substitutions.
      As to substitution on appeal, the rules of the appellate courts
    should be consulted.
      Subdivision (d)(2). This provision, applicable in "official
    capacity" cases as described above, will encourage the use of the
    official title without any mention of the officer individually,
    thereby recognizing the intrinsic character of the action and
    helping to eliminate concern with the problem of substitution. If
    for any reason it seems necessary or desirable to add the
    individual's name, this may be done upon motion or on the court's
    initiative without dismissal of the action; thereafter the
    procedure of amended Rule 25(d)(1) will apply if the individual
    named ceases to hold office.
      For examples of naming the office or title rather than the
    officeholder, see Annot., 102 A.L.R. 943, 948-52; Comment, 50
    Mich.L.Rev. 443, 450 (1952); cf. 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7484. Where an
    action is brought by or against a board or agency with continuity
    of existence, it has been often decided that there is no need to
    name the individual members and substitution is unnecessary when
    the personnel changes. 4 Moore, supra, &#182; 25.09, p. 536. The
    practice encouraged by amended Rule 25(d)(2) is similar.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      Present Rule 25(a)(1), together with present Rule 6(b), results
    in an inflexible requirement that an action be dismissed as to a
    deceased party if substitution is not carried out within a fixed
    period measured from the time of the death. The hardships and
    inequities of this unyielding requirement plainly appear from the
    cases. See e.g., Anderson v. Yungkau, 329 U.S. 482, 67 S.Ct. 428,
    91 L.Ed. 436 (1947); Iovino v. Waterson, 274 F.2d 41 (1959), cert.
    denied, Carlin v. Sovino, 362 U.S. 949, 80 S.Ct. 860, 4 L.Ed.2d 867
    (1960); Perry v. Allen, 239 F.2d 107 (5th Cir. 1956); Starnes v.
    Pennsylvania R.R., 26 F.R.D. 625 (E.D.N.Y.), aff'd per curiam, 295
    F.2d 704 (2d Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 813, 82 S.Ct. 688,
    7 L.Ed.2d 612 (1962); Zdanok v. Glidden Co., 28 F.R.D. 346
    (S.D.N.Y. 1961). See also 4 Moore's Federal Practice &#182;
    25.01[9] (Supp. 1960); 2 Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice &
    Procedure Sec. 621, at 420-21 (Wright ed. 1961).
      The amended rule establishes a time limit for the motion to
    substitute based not upon the time of the death, but rather upon
    the time information of the death as provided by the means of a
    suggestion of death upon the record, i.e., service of a statement
    of the fact of the death. Cf. Ill.Ann.Stat., ch. 110, Sec. 54(2)
    (Smith-Hurd 1956). The motion may not be made later than 90 days
    after the service of the statement unless the period is extended
    pursuant to Rule 6(b), as amended. See the Advisory Committee's
    Note to amended Rule 6(b). See also the new Official Form 30.
      A motion to substitute may be made by any party or by the
    representative of the deceased party without awaiting the
    suggestion of death. Indeed, the motion will usually be so made. If
    a party or the representative of the deceased party desires to
    limit the time within which another may make the motion, he may do
    so by suggesting the death upon the record.
      A motion to substitute made within the prescribed time will
    ordinarily be granted, but under the permissive language of the
    first sentence of the amended rule ("the court may order") it may
    be denied by the court in the exercise of a sound discretion if
    made long after the death - as can occur if the suggestion of death
    is not made or is delayed - and circumstances have arisen rendering
    it unfair to allow substitution. Cf. Anderson v. Yungkau, supra,
    329 U.S. at 485, 486, 67 S.Ct. at 430, 431, 91 L.Ed. 436, where it
    was noted under the present rule that settlement and distribution
    of the state of a deceased defendant might be so far advanced as to
    warrant denial of a motion for substitution even though made within
    the time limit prescribed by that rule. Accordingly, a party
    interested in securing substitution under the amended rule should
    not assume that he can rest indefinitely awaiting the suggestion of
    death before he makes his motion to substitute.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 25 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Former Rule 25(d)(2) is transferred to become Rule 17(d) because
    it deals with designation of a public officer, not substitution.

    NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1970 AMENDMENTS TO DISCOVERY
                                   RULES
      This statement is intended to serve as a general introduction to
    the amendments of Rules 26-37, concerning discovery, as well as
    related amendments of other rules. A separate note of customary
    scope is appended to amendments proposed for each rule. This
    statement provides a framework for the consideration of individual
    rule changes.

                      CHANGES IN THE DISCOVERY RULES                  
      The discovery rules, as adopted in 1938, were a striking and
    imaginative departure from tradition. It was expected from the
    outset that they would be important, but experience has shown them
    to play an even larger role than was initially foreseen. Although
    the discovery rules have been amended since 1938, the changes were
    relatively few and narrowly focused, made in order to remedy
    specific defects. The amendments now proposed reflect the first
    comprehensive review of the discovery rules undertaken since 1938.
    These amendments make substantial changes in the discovery rules.
    Those summarized here are among the more important changes.
      Scope of Discovery. New provisions are made and existing
    provisions changed affecting the scope of discovery: (1) The
    contents of insurance policies are made discoverable (Rule
    26(b)(2)). (2) A showing of good cause is no longer required for
    discovery of documents and things and entry upon land (Rule 34).
    However, a showing of need is required for discovery of "trial
    preparation" materials other than a party's discovery of his own
    statement and a witness' discovery of his own statement; and
    protection is afforded against disclosure in such documents of
    mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories
    concerning the litigation. (Rule 26(b)(3)). (3) Provision is made
    for discovery with respect to experts retained for trial
    preparation, and particularly those experts who will be called to
    testify at trial (Rule 26(b)(4)). (4) It is provided that
    interrogatories and requests for admission are not objectionable
    simply because they relate to matters of opinion or contention,
    subject of course to the supervisory power of the court (Rules
    33(b), 36(a)). (5) Medical examination is made available as to
    certain nonparties. (Rule 35(a)).
      Mechanics of Discovery. A variety of changes are made in the
    mechanics of the discovery process, affecting the sequence and
    timing of discovery, the respective obligations of the parties with
    respect to requests, responses, and motions for court orders, and
    the related powers of the court to enforce discovery requests and
    to protect against their abusive use. A new provision eliminates
    the automatic grant of priority in discovery to one side (Rule
    26(d)). Another provides that a party is not under a duty to
    supplement his responses to requests for discovery, except as
    specified (Rule 26(e)).
      Other changes in the mechanics of discovery are designed to
    encourage extrajudicial discovery with a minimum of court
    intervention. Among these are the following: (1) The requirement
    that a plaintiff seek leave of court for early discovery requests
    is eliminated or reduced, and motions for a court order under Rule
    34 are made unnecessary. Motions under Rule 35 are continued. (2)
    Answers and objections are to be served together and an enlargement
    of the time for response is provided. (3) The party seeking
    discovery, rather than the objecting party, is made responsible for
    invoking judicial determination of discovery disputes not resolved
    by the parties. (4) Judicial sanctions are tightened with respect
    to unjustified insistence upon or objection to discovery. These
    changes bring Rules 33, 34, and 36 substantially into line with the
    procedure now provided for depositions.
      Failure to amend Rule 35 in the same way is based upon two
    considerations. First, the Columbia Survey (described below) finds
    that only about 5 percent of medical examinations require court
    motions, of which about half result in court orders. Second and of
    greater importance, the interest of the person to be examined in
    the privacy of his person was recently stressed by the Supreme
    Court in Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U.S. 104 (1964). The court
    emphasized the trial judge's responsibility to assure that the
    medical examination was justified, particularly as to its scope.
      Rearrangement of Rules. A limited rearrangement of the discovery
    rules has been made, whereby certain provisions are transferred
    from one rule to another. The reasons for this rearrangement are
    discussed below in a separate section of this statement, and the
    details are set out in a table at the end of this statement.
      Optional Procedures. In two instances, new optional procedures
    have been made available. A new procedure is provided to a party
    seeking to take the deposition of a corporation or other
    organization (Rule 30(b)(6)). A party on whom interrogatories have
    been served requesting information derivable from his business
    records may under specified circumstances produce the records
    rather than give answers (Rule 33(c)).
      Other Changes. This summary of changes is by no means exhaustive.
    Various changes have been made in order to improve, tighten, or
    clarify particular provisions, to resolve conflicts in the case
    law, and to improve language. All changes, whether mentioned here
    or not, are discussed in the appropriate note for each rule.

                   A FIELD SURVEY OF DISCOVERY PRACTICE               
      Despite widespread acceptance of discovery as an essential part
    of litigation, disputes have inevitably arisen concerning the
    values claimed for discovery and abuses alleged to exist. Many
    disputes about discovery relate to particular rule provisions or
    court decisions and can be studied in traditional fashion with a
    view to specific amendment. Since discovery is in large measure
    extra-judicial, however, even these disputes may be enlightened by
    a study of discovery "in the field." And some of the larger
    questions concerning discovery can be pursued only by a study of
    its operation at the law office level and in unreported cases.
      The Committee, therefore, invited the Project for Effective
    Justice of Columbia Law School to conduct a field survey of
    discovery. Funds were obtained from the Ford Foundation and the
    Walter E. Meyer Research Institute of Law, Inc. The survey was
    carried on under the direction of Prof. Maurice Rosenberg of
    Columbia Law School. The Project for Effective Justice has
    submitted a report to the Committee entitled "Field Survey of
    Federal Pretrial Discovery" (hereafter referred to as the Columbia
    Survey). The Committee is deeply grateful for the benefit of this
    extensive undertaking and is most appreciative of the cooperation
    of the Project and the funding organizations. The Committee is
    particularly grateful to Professor Rosenberg who not only directed
    the survey but has given much time in order to assist the Committee
    in assessing the results.
      The Columbia Survey concludes, in general, that there is no
    empirical evidence to warrant a fundamental change in the
    philosophy of the discovery rules. No widespread or profound
    failings are disclosed in the scope or availability of discovery.
    The costs of discovery do not appear to be oppressive, as a general
    matter, either in relation to ability to pay or to the stakes of
    the litigation. Discovery frequently provides evidence that would
    not otherwise be available to the parties and thereby makes for a
    fairer trial or settlement. On the other hand, no positive evidence
    is found that discovery promotes settlement.
      More specific findings of the Columbia Survey are described in
    other Committee notes, in relation to particular rule provisions
    and amendments. Those interested in more detailed information may
    obtain it from the Project for Effective Justice.

                   REARRANGEMENT OF THE DISCOVERY RULES               
      The present discovery rules are structured entirely in terms of
    individual discovery devices, except for Rule 27 which deals with
    perpetuation of testimony, and Rule 37 which provides sanctions to
    enforce discovery. Thus, Rules 26 and 28 to 32 are in terms
    addressed only to the taking of a deposition of a party or third
    person. Rules 33 to 36 then deal in succession with four additional
    discovery devices: Written interrogatories to parties, production
    for inspection of documents and things, physical or mental
    examination and requests for admission.
      Under the rules as promulgated in 1938, therefore, each of the
    discovery devices was separate and self-contained. A defect of this
    arrangement is that there is no natural location in the discovery
    rules for provisions generally applicable to all discovery or to
    several discovery devices. From 1938 until the present, a few
    amendments have applied a discovery provision to several rules. For
    example, in 1948, the scope of deposition discovery in Rule 26(b)
    and the provision for protective orders in Rule 30(b) were
    incorporated by reference in Rules 33 and 34. The arrangement was
    adequate so long as there were few provisions governing discovery
    generally and these provisions were relatively simple.
      As will be seen, however, a series of amendments are now proposed
    which govern most or all of the discovery devices. Proposals of a
    similar nature will probably be made in the future. Under these
    circumstances, it is very desirable, even necessary, that the
    discovery rules contain one rule addressing itself to discovery
    generally.
      Rule 26 is obviously the most appropriate rule for this purpose.
    One of its subdivisions, Rule 26(b), in terms governs only scope of
    deposition discovery, but it has been expressly incorporated by
    reference in Rules 33 and 34 and is treated by courts as setting a
    general standard. By means of a transfer to Rule 26 of the
    provisions for protective orders now contained in Rule 30(b), and a
    transfer from Rule 26 of provisions addressed exclusively to
    depositions, Rule 26 is converted into a rule concerned with
    discovery generally. It becomes a convenient vehicle for the
    inclusion of new provisions dealing with the scope, timing, and
    regulation of discovery. Few additional transfers are needed. See
    table showing rearrangement of rules, set out below.
      There are, to be sure, disadvantages in transferring any
    provision from one rule to another. Familiarity with the present
    pattern, reinforced by the references made by prior court decisions
    and the various secondary writings about the rules, is not lightly
    to be sacrificed. Revision of treatises and other references works
    is burdensome and costly. Moreover, many States have adopted the
    existing pattern as a model for their rules.
      On the other hand, the amendments now proposed will in any event
    require revision of texts and reference works as well as
    reconsideration by States following the Federal model. If these
    amendments are to be incorporated in an understandable way, a rule
    with general discovery provisions is needed. As will be seen, the
    proposed rearrangement produces a more coherent and intelligible
    pattern for the discovery rules taken as a whole. The difficulties
    described are those encountered whenever statutes are reexamined
    and revised. Failure to rearrange the discovery rules now would
    freeze the present scheme, making future change even more
    difficult.

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE V. DISCLOSURES AND DISCOVERY

-HEAD-
    Rule 26. Duty to Disclose; General Provisions Governing Discovery

-STATUTE-
      (a) Required Disclosures.
        (1) Initial Disclosure.
          (A) In General. Except as exempted by Rule 26(a)(1)(B) or as
        otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, a party must,
        without awaiting a discovery request, provide to the other
        parties:
            (i) the name and, if known, the address and telephone
          number of each individual likely to have discoverable
          information - along with the subjects of that information -
          that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or
          defenses, unless the use would be solely for impeachment;
            (ii) a copy - or a description by category and location -
          of all documents, electronically stored information, and
          tangible things that the disclosing party has in its
          possession, custody, or control and may use to support its
          claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for
          impeachment;
            (iii) a computation of each category of damages claimed by
          the disclosing party - who must also make available for
          inspection and copying as under Rule 34 the documents or
          other evidentiary material, unless privileged or protected
          from disclosure, on which each computation is based,
          including materials bearing on the nature and extent of
          injuries suffered; and
            (iv) for inspection and copying as under Rule 34, any
          insurance agreement under which an insurance business may be
          liable to satisfy all or part of a possible judgment in the
          action or to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to
          satisfy the judgment.

          (B) Proceedings Exempt from Initial Disclosure. The following
        proceedings are exempt from initial disclosure:
            (i) an action for review on an administrative record;
            (ii) a forfeiture action in rem arising from a federal
          statute;
            (iii) a petition for habeas corpus or any other proceeding
          to challenge a criminal conviction or sentence;
            (iv) an action brought without an attorney by a person in
          the custody of the United States, a state, or a state
          subdivision;
            (v) an action to enforce or quash an administrative summons
          or subpoena;
            (vi) an action by the United States to recover benefit
          payments;
            (vii) an action by the United States to collect on a
          student loan guaranteed by the United States;
            (viii) a proceeding ancillary to a proceeding in another
          court; and
            (ix) an action to enforce an arbitration award.

          (C) Time for Initial Disclosures - In General. A party must
        make the initial disclosures at or within 14 days after the
        parties' Rule 26(f) conference unless a different time is set
        by stipulation or court order, or unless a party objects during
        the conference that initial disclosures are not appropriate in
        this action and states the objection in the proposed discovery
        plan. In ruling on the objection, the court must determine what
        disclosures, if any, are to be made and must set the time for
        disclosure.
          (D) Time for Initial Disclosures - For Parties Served or
        Joined Later. A party that is first served or otherwise joined
        after the Rule 26(f) conference must make the initial
        disclosures within 30 days after being served or joined, unless
        a different time is set by stipulation or court order.
          (E) Basis for Initial Disclosure; Unacceptable Excuses. A
        party must make its initial disclosures based on the
        information then reasonably available to it. A party is not
        excused from making its disclosures because it has not fully
        investigated the case or because it challenges the sufficiency
        of another party's disclosures or because another party has not
        made its disclosures.

        (2) Disclosure of Expert Testimony.
          (A) In General. In addition to the disclosures required by
        Rule 26(a)(1), a party must disclose to the other parties the
        identity of any witness it may use at trial to present evidence
        under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, 703, or 705.
          (B) Written Report. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by
        the court, this disclosure must be accompanied by a written
        report - prepared and signed by the witness - if the witness is
        one retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony
        in the case or one whose duties as the party's employee
        regularly involve giving expert testimony. The report must
        contain:
            (i) a complete statement of all opinions the witness will
          express and the basis and reasons for them;
            (ii) the data or other information considered by the
          witness in forming them;
            (iii) any exhibits that will be used to summarize or
          support them;
            (iv) the witness's qualifications, including a list of all
          publications authored in the previous 10 years;
            (v) a list of all other cases in which, during the previous
          4 years, the witness testified as an expert at trial or by
          deposition; and
            (vi) a statement of the compensation to be paid for the
          study and testimony in the case.

          (C) Time to Disclose Expert Testimony. A party must make
        these disclosures at the times and in the sequence that the
        court orders. Absent a stipulation or a court order, the
        disclosures must be made:
            (i) at least 90 days before the date set for trial or for
          the case to be ready for trial; or
            (ii) if the evidence is intended solely to contradict or
          rebut evidence on the same subject matter identified by
          another party under Rule 26(a)(2)(B), within 30 days after
          the other party's disclosure.

          (D) Supplementing the Disclosure. The parties must supplement
        these disclosures when required under Rule 26(e).

        (3) Pretrial Disclosures.
          (A) In General. In addition to the disclosures required by
        Rule 26(a)(1) and (2), a party must provide to the other
        parties and promptly file the following information about the
        evidence that it may present at trial other than solely for
        impeachment:
            (i) the name and, if not previously provided, the address
          and telephone number of each witness - separately identifying
          those the party expects to present and those it may call if
          the need arises;
            (ii) the designation of those witnesses whose testimony the
          party expects to present by deposition and, if not taken
          stenographically, a transcript of the pertinent parts of the
          deposition; and
            (iii) an identification of each document or other exhibit,
          including summaries of other evidence - separately
          identifying those items the party expects to offer and those
          it may offer if the need arises.

          (B) Time for Pretrial Disclosures; Objections. Unless the
        court orders otherwise, these disclosures must be made at least
        30 days before trial. Within 14 days after they are made,
        unless the court sets a different time, a party may serve and
        promptly file a list of the following objections: any
        objections to the use under Rule 32(a) of a deposition
        designated by another party under Rule 26(a)(3)(A)(ii); and any
        objection, together with the grounds for it, that may be made
        to the admissibility of materials identified under Rule
        26(a)(3)(A)(iii). An objection not so made - except for one
        under Federal Rule of Evidence 402 or 403 - is waived unless
        excused by the court for good cause.

        (4) Form of Disclosures. Unless the court orders otherwise, all
      disclosures under Rule 26(a) must be in writing, signed, and
      served.

      (b) Discovery Scope and Limits.
        (1) Scope in General. Unless otherwise limited by court order,
      the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain
      discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to
      any party's claim or defense - including the existence,
      description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any
      documents or other tangible things and the identity and location
      of persons who know of any discoverable matter. For good cause,
      the court may order discovery of any matter relevant to the
      subject matter involved in the action. Relevant information need
      not be admissible at the trial if the discovery appears
      reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
      evidence. All discovery is subject to the limitations imposed by
      Rule 26(b)(2)(C).
        (2) Limitations on Frequency and Extent.
          (A) When Permitted. By order, the court may alter the limits
        in these rules on the number of depositions and interrogatories
        or on the length of depositions under Rule 30. By order or
        local rule, the court may also limit the number of requests
        under Rule 36.
          (B) Specific Limitations on Electronically Stored
        Information. A party need not provide discovery of
        electronically stored information from sources that the party
        identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden
        or cost. On motion to compel discovery or for a protective
        order, the party from whom discovery is sought must show that
        the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue
        burden or cost. If that showing is made, the court may
        nonetheless order discovery from such sources if the requesting
        party shows good cause, considering the limitations of Rule
        26(b)(2)(C). The court may specify conditions for the
        discovery.
          (C) When Required. On motion or on its own, the court must
        limit the frequency or extent of discovery otherwise allowed by
        these rules or by local rule if it determines that:
            (i) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or
          duplicative, or can be obtained from some other source that
          is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;
            (ii) the party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity
          to obtain the information by discovery in the action; or
            (iii) the burden or expense of the proposed discovery
          outweighs its likely benefit, considering the needs of the
          case, the amount in controversy, the parties' resources, the
          importance of the issues at stake in the action, and the
          importance of the discovery in resolving the issues.

        (3) Trial Preparation: Materials.
          (A) Documents and Tangible Things. Ordinarily, a party may
        not discover documents and tangible things that are prepared in
        anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party
        or its representative (including the other party's attorney,
        consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or agent). But,
        subject to Rule 26(b)(4), those materials may be discovered if:
            (i) they are otherwise discoverable under Rule 26(b)(1);
          and
            (ii) the party shows that it has substantial need for the
          materials to prepare its case and cannot, without undue
          hardship, obtain their substantial equivalent by other means.

          (B) Protection Against Disclosure. If the court orders
        discovery of those materials, it must protect against
        disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or
        legal theories of a party's attorney or other representative
        concerning the litigation.
          (C) Previous Statement. Any party or other person may, on
        request and without the required showing, obtain the person's
        own previous statement about the action or its subject matter.
        If the request is refused, the person may move for a court
        order, and Rule 37(a)(5) applies to the award of expenses. A
        previous statement is either:
            (i) a written statement that the person has signed or
          otherwise adopted or approved; or
            (ii) a contemporaneous stenographic, mechanical,
          electrical, or other recording - or a transcription of it -
          that recites substantially verbatim the person's oral
          statement.

        (4) Trial Preparation: Experts.
          (A) Expert Who May Testify. A party may depose any person who
        has been identified as an expert whose opinions may be
        presented at trial. If Rule 26(a)(2)(B) requires a report from
        the expert, the deposition may be conducted only after the
        report is provided.
          (B) Expert Employed Only for Trial Preparation. Ordinarily, a
        party may not, by interrogatories or deposition, discover facts
        known or opinions held by an expert who has been retained or
        specially employed by another party in anticipation of
        litigation or to prepare for trial and who is not expected to
        be called as a witness at trial. But a party may do so only:
            (i) as provided in Rule 35(b); or
            (ii) on showing exceptional circumstances under which it is
          impracticable for the party to obtain facts or opinions on
          the same subject by other means.

          (C) Payment. Unless manifest injustice would result, the
        court must require that the party seeking discovery:
            (i) pay the expert a reasonable fee for time spent in
          responding to discovery under Rule 26(b)(4)(A) or (B); and
            (ii) for discovery under (B), also pay the other party a
          fair portion of the fees and expenses it reasonably incurred
          in obtaining the expert's facts and opinions.

        (5) Claiming Privilege or Protecting Trial-Preparation
      Materials.
          (A) Information Withheld. When a party withholds information
        otherwise discoverable by claiming that the information is
        privileged or subject to protection as trial-preparation
        material, the party must:
            (i) expressly make the claim; and
            (ii) describe the nature of the documents, communications,
          or tangible things not produced or disclosed - and do so in a
          manner that, without revealing information itself privileged
          or protected, will enable other parties to assess the claim.

          (B) Information Produced. If information produced in
        discovery is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection
        as trial-preparation material, the party making the claim may
        notify any party that received the information of the claim and
        the basis for it. After being notified, a party must promptly
        return, sequester, or destroy the specified information and any
        copies it has; must not use or disclose the information until
        the claim is resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve
        the information if the party disclosed it before being
        notified; and may promptly present the information to the court
        under seal for a determination of the claim. The producing
        party must preserve the information until the claim is
        resolved.

      (c) Protective Orders.
        (1) In General. A party or any person from whom discovery is
      sought may move for a protective order in the court where the
      action is pending - or as an alternative on matters relating to a
      deposition, in the court for the district where the deposition
      will be taken. The motion must include a certification that the
      movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with
      other affected parties in an effort to resolve the dispute
      without court action. The court may, for good cause, issue an
      order to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment,
      oppression, or undue burden or expense, including one or more of
      the following:
          (A) forbidding the disclosure or discovery;
          (B) specifying terms, including time and place, for the
        disclosure or discovery;
          (C) prescribing a discovery method other than the one
        selected by the party seeking discovery;
          (D) forbidding inquiry into certain matters, or limiting the
        scope of disclosure or discovery to certain matters;
          (E) designating the persons who may be present while the
        discovery is conducted;
          (F) requiring that a deposition be sealed and opened only on
        court order;
          (G) requiring that a trade secret or other confidential
        research, development, or commercial information not be
        revealed or be revealed only in a specified way; and
          (H) requiring that the parties simultaneously file specified
        documents or information in sealed envelopes, to be opened as
        the court directs.

        (2) Ordering Discovery. If a motion for a protective order is
      wholly or partly denied, the court may, on just terms, order that
      any party or person provide or permit discovery.
        (3) Awarding Expenses. Rule 37(a)(5) applies to the award of
      expenses.

      (d) Timing and Sequence of Discovery.
        (1) Timing. A party may not seek discovery from any source
      before the parties have conferred as required by Rule 26(f),
      except in a proceeding exempted from initial disclosure under
      Rule 26(a)(1)(B), or when authorized by these rules, by
      stipulation, or by court order.
        (2) Sequence. Unless, on motion, the court orders otherwise for
      the parties' and witnesses' convenience and in the interests of
      justice:
          (A) methods of discovery may be used in any sequence; and
          (B) discovery by one party does not require any other party
        to delay its discovery.

      (e) Supplementing Disclosures and Responses.
        (1) In General. A party who has made a disclosure under Rule
      26(a) - or who has responded to an interrogatory, request for
      production, or request for admission - must supplement or correct
      its disclosure or response:
          (A) in a timely manner if the party learns that in some
        material respect the disclosure or response is incomplete or
        incorrect, and if the additional or corrective information has
        not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the
        discovery process or in writing; or
          (B) as ordered by the court.

        (2) Expert Witness. For an expert whose report must be
      disclosed under Rule 26(a)(2)(B), the party's duty to supplement
      extends both to information included in the report and to
      information given during the expert's deposition. Any additions
      or changes to this information must be disclosed by the time the
      party's pretrial disclosures under Rule 26(a)(3) are due.

      (f) Conference of the Parties; Planning for Discovery.
        (1) Conference Timing. Except in a proceeding exempted from
      initial disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1)(B) or when the court
      orders otherwise, the parties must confer as soon as practicable -
       and in any event at least 21 days before a scheduling
      conference is to be held or a scheduling order is due under Rule
      16(b).
        (2) Conference Content; Parties' Responsibilities. In
      conferring, the parties must consider the nature and basis of
      their claims and defenses and the possibilities for promptly
      settling or resolving the case; make or arrange for the
      disclosures required by Rule 26(a)(1); discuss any issues about
      preserving discoverable information; and develop a proposed
      discovery plan. The attorneys of record and all unrepresented
      parties that have appeared in the case are jointly responsible
      for arranging the conference, for attempting in good faith to
      agree on the proposed discovery plan, and for submitting to the
      court within 14 days after the conference a written report
      outlining the plan. The court may order the parties or attorneys
      to attend the conference in person.
        (3) Discovery Plan. A discovery plan must state the parties'
      views and proposals on:
          (A) what changes should be made in the timing, form, or
        requirement for disclosures under Rule 26(a), including a
        statement of when initial disclosures were made or will be
        made;
          (B) the subjects on which discovery may be needed, when
        discovery should be completed, and whether discovery should be
        conducted in phases or be limited to or focused on particular
        issues;
          (C) any issues about disclosure or discovery of
        electronically stored information, including the form or forms
        in which it should be produced;
          (D) any issues about claims of privilege or of protection as
        trial-preparation materials, including - if the parties agree
        on a procedure to assert these claims after production -
        whether to ask the court to include their agreement in an
        order;
          (E) what changes should be made in the limitations on
        discovery imposed under these rules or by local rule, and what
        other limitations should be imposed; and
          (F) any other orders that the court should issue under Rule
        26(c) or under Rule 16(b) and (c).

        (4) Expedited Schedule. If necessary to comply with its
      expedited schedule for Rule 16(b) conferences, a court may by
      local rule:
          (A) require the parties' conference to occur less than 21
        days before the scheduling conference is held or a scheduling
        order is due under Rule 16(b); and
          (B) require the written report outlining the discovery plan
        to be filed less than 14 days after the parties' conference, or
        excuse the parties from submitting a written report and permit
        them to report orally on their discovery plan at the Rule 16(b)
        conference.

      (g) Signing Disclosures and Discovery Requests, Responses, and
    Objections.
        (1) Signature Required; Effect of Signature. Every disclosure
      under Rule 26(a)(1) or (a)(3) and every discovery request,
      response, or objection must be signed by at least one attorney of
      record in the attorney's own name - or by the party personally,
      if unrepresented - and must state the signer's address, e-mail
      address, and telephone number. By signing, an attorney or party
      certifies that to the best of the person's knowledge,
      information, and belief formed after a reasonable inquiry:
          (A) with respect to a disclosure, it is complete and correct
        as of the time it is made; and
          (B) with respect to a discovery request, response, or
        objection, it is:
            (i) consistent with these rules and warranted by existing
          law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying,
          or reversing existing law, or for establishing new law;
            (ii) not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to
          harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the
          cost of litigation; and
            (iii) neither unreasonable nor unduly burdensome or
          expensive, considering the needs of the case, prior discovery
          in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of
          the issues at stake in the action.

        (2) Failure to Sign. Other parties have no duty to act on an
      unsigned disclosure, request, response, or objection until it is
      signed, and the court must strike it unless a signature is
      promptly supplied after the omission is called to the attorney's
      or party's attention.
        (3) Sanction for Improper Certification. If a certification
      violates this rule without substantial justification, the court,
      on motion or on its own, must impose an appropriate sanction on
      the signer, the party on whose behalf the signer was acting, or
      both. The sanction may include an order to pay the reasonable
      expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the violation.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      Note to Subdivision (a). This rule freely authorizes the taking
    of depositions under the same circumstances and by the same methods
    whether for the purpose of discovery or for the purpose of
    obtaining evidence. Many states have adopted this practice on
    account of its simplicity and effectiveness, safeguarding it by
    imposing such restrictions upon the subsequent use of the
    deposition at the trial or hearing as are deemed advisable. See

    (Remington, 1932) Sec. 308-8; W.Va.Code (1931) ch. 57, art. 4, Sec.
    1. Compare [former] Equity Rules 47 (Depositions - To be Taken in
    Exceptional Instances); 54 (Depositions Under Revised Statutes,
    Sections 863, 865, 866, 867 - Cross-Examination); 58 (Discovery -
    Interrogatories - Inspection and Production of Documents -
    Admission of Execution or Genuineness).
      This and subsequent rules incorporate, modify, and broaden the
    provisions for depositions under U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Secs.
    639 (Depositions de bene esse; when and where taken; notice), 640
    (Same; mode of taking), 641 (Same; transmission to court), 644
    (Depositions under dedimus potestatem and in perpetuam), 646
    (Deposition under dedimus potestatem; how taken). These statutes
    are superseded insofar as they differ from this and subsequent
    rules. U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Sec. 643 (Depositions; taken in
    mode prescribed by State laws) is superseded by the third sentence
    of Subdivision (a).
      While a number of states permit discovery only from parties or
    their agents, others either make no distinction between parties or
    agents of parties and ordinary witnesses, or authorize the taking
    of ordinary depositions, without restriction, from any persons who
    have knowledge of relevant facts. See Ark.Civ.Code (Crawford, 1934)

      The more common practice in the United States is to take
    depositions on notice by the party desiring them, without any order
    from the court, and this has been followed in these rules. See

    this limitation has been largely abandoned by modern legislation.

      Note to Subdivisions (d), (e), and (f). The restrictions here
    placed upon the use of depositions at the trial or hearing are
    substantially the same as those provided in U.S.C., Title 28,
    [former] Sec. 641, for depositions taken, de bene esse, with the
    additional provision that any deposition may be used when the court
    finds the existence of exceptional circumstances. Compare English
    Rules Under the Judicature Act (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 37,
    r. 18 (with additional provision permitting use of deposition by
    consent of the parties). See also [former] Equity Rule 64 (Former
    Depositions, Etc., May be Used Before Master); and 2 Minn. Stat.
    (Mason, 1927) Sec. 9835 (Use in a subsequent action of a deposition
    filed in a previously dismissed action between the same parties and
    involving the same subject matter).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The amendment eliminates the requirement of
    leave of court for the taking of a deposition except where a
    plaintiff seeks to take a deposition within 20 days after the
    commencement of the action. The retention of the requirement where
    a deposition is sought by a plaintiff within 20 days of the
    commencement of the action protects a defendant who has not had an
    opportunity to retain counsel and inform himself as to the nature
    of the suit; the plaintiff, of course, needs no such protection.
    The present rule forbids the plaintiff to take a deposition,
    without leave of court, before the answer is served. Sometimes the
    defendant delays the serving of an answer for more than 20 days,
    but as 20 days are sufficient time for him to obtain a lawyer,
    there is no reason to forbid the plaintiff to take a deposition
    without leave merely because the answer has not been served. In all
    cases, Rule 30(a) empowers the court, for cause shown, to alter the
    time of the taking of a deposition, and Rule 30(b) contains
    provisions giving ample protection to persons who are unreasonably
    pressed. The modified practice here adopted is along the line of
    that followed in various states. See, e.g., 8 Mo.Rev.Stat.Ann.
    (1939) Sec. 1917; 2 Burns' Ind.Stat.Ann. (1933) Sec. 2-1506.
      Subdivision (b). The amendments to subdivision (b) make clear the
    broad scope of examination and that it may cover not only evidence
    for use at the trial but also inquiry into matters in themselves
    inadmissible as evidence but which will lead to the discovery of
    such evidence. The purpose of discovery is to allow a broad search
    for facts, the names of witnesses, or any other matters which may
    aid a party in the preparation or presentation of his case. Engl v.
    Aetna Life Ins. Co. (C.C.A.2d, 1943) 139 F.(2d) 469; Mahler v.
    Pennsylvania R. Co. (E.D.N.Y. 1945) 8 Fed.Rules Serv. 33.351, Case
    1. In such a preliminary inquiry admissibility at trial should not
    be the test as to whether the information sought is within the
    scope of proper examination. Such a standard unnecessarily curtails
    the utility of discovery practice. Of course, matters entirely
    without bearing either as direct evidence or as leads to evidence
    are not within the scope of inquiry, but to the extent that the
    examination develops useful information, it functions successfully
    as an instrument of discovery, even if it produces no testimony
    directly admissible. Lewis v. United Air Lines Transportation Corp.
    (D.Conn. 1939) 27 F.Supp. 946; Engl v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., supra;
    Mahler v. Pennsylvania R. Co., supra; Bloomer v. Sirian Lamp Co.
    (D.Del. 1944) 8 Fed.Rules Serv. 26b.31, Case 3; Rousseau v. Langley
    (S.D.N.Y. 1945) 9 Fed.Rules Serv. 34.41, Case 1 (Rule 26
    contemplates "examinations not merely for the narrow purpose of
    adducing testimony which may be offered in evidence but also for
    the broad discovery of information which may be useful in
    preparation for trial."); Olson Transportation Co. v. Socony-Vacuum
    Co. (E.D.Wis. 1944) 8 Fed.Rules Serv. 34.41, Case 2 (". . . the
    Rules . . . permit 'fishing' for evidence as they should."); Note
    (1945) 45 Col.L.Rev. 482. Thus hearsay, while inadmissible itself,
    may suggest testimony which properly may be proved. Under Rule 26
    (b) several cases, however, have erroneously limited discovery on
    the basis of admissibility, holding that the word "relevant" in
    effect meant "material and competent under the rules of evidence".
    Poppino v. Jones Store Co. (W.D.Mo. 1940) 3 Fed.Rules Serv. 26b.5,
    Case 1; Benevento v. A. & P. Food Stores, Inc. (E.D.N.Y. 1939) 26
    F.Supp. 424. Thus it has been said that inquiry might not be made
    into statements or other matters which, when disclosed, amounted
    only to hearsay. See Maryland for use of Montvila v. Pan-American
    Bus Lines, Inc. (D.Md. 1940) 3 Fed.Rules Serv. 26b.211, Case 3;

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      This amendment conforms to the amendment of Rule 28(b). See the
    next-to-last paragraph of the Advisory Committee's Note to that
    amendment.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      The requirement that the plaintiff obtain leave of court in order
    to serve notice of taking of a deposition within 20 days after
    commencement of the action gives rises to difficulties when the
    prospective deponent is about to become unavailable for
    examination. The problem is not confined to admiralty, but has been
    of special concern in that context because of the mobility of
    vessels and their personnel. When Rule 26 was adopted as Admiralty
    Rule 30A in 1961, the problem was alleviated by permitting
    depositions de bene esse, for which leave of court is not required.
    See Advisory Committee's Note to Admiralty Rule 30A (1961).
      A continuing study is being made in the effort to devise a
    modification of the 20-day rule appropriate to both the civil and
    admiralty practice to the end that Rule 26(a) shall state a uniform
    rule applicable alike to what are now civil actions and suits in
    admiralty. Meanwhile, the exigencies of maritime litigation require
    preservation, for the time being at least, of the traditional de
    bene esse procedure for the post-unification counterpart of the
    present suit in admiralty. Accordingly, the amendment provides for
    continued availability of that procedure in admiralty and maritime
    claims within the meaning of Rule 9(h).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1970 AMENDMENT       
      A limited rearrangement of the discovery rules is made, whereby
    certain rule provisions are transferred, as follows: Existing Rule
    26(a) is transferred to Rules 30(a) and 31(a). Existing Rule 26(c)
    is transferred to Rule 30(c). Existing Rules 26(d), (e), and (f)
    are transferred to Rule 32. Revisions of the transferred
    provisions, if any, are discussed in the notes appended to Rules
    30, 31, and 32. In addition, Rule 30(b) is transferred to Rule
    26(c). The purpose of this rearrangement is to establish Rule 26 as
    a rule governing discovery in general. (The reasons are set out in
    the Advisory Committee's explanatory statement.)
      Subdivision (a) - Discovery Devices. This is a new subdivision
    listing all of the discovery devices provided in the discovery
    rules and establishing the relationship between the general
    provisions of Rule 26 and the specific rules for particular
    discovery devices. The provision that the frequency of use of these
    methods is not limited confirms existing law. It incorporates in
    general form a provision now found in Rule 33.
      Subdivision (b) - Scope of Discovery. This subdivision is recast
    to cover the scope of discovery generally. It regulates the
    discovery obtainable through any of the discovery devices listed in
    Rule 26(a).
      All provisions as to scope of discovery are subject to the
    initial qualification that the court may limit discovery in
    accordance with these rules. Rule 26(c) (transferred from 30(b))
    confers broad powers on the courts to regulate or prevent discovery
    even though the materials sought are within the scope of 26(b), and
    these powers have always been freely exercised. For example, a
    party's income tax return is generally held not privileged, 2A
    Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure, Sec. 65.2
    (Wright ed. 1961), and yet courts have recognized that interests in
    privacy may call for a measure of extra protection. E.g.,
    Wiesenberger v. W. E. Hutton & Co., 35 F.R.D. 556 (S.D.N.Y. 1964).
    Similarly, the courts have in appropriate circumstances protected
    materials that are primarily of an impeaching character. These two
    types of materials merely illustrate the many situations, not
    capable of governance by precise rule, in which courts must
    exercise judgment. The new subsections in Rule 26(d) do not change
    existing law with respect to such situations.
      Subdivision (b)(1) - In General. The language is changed to
    provide for the scope of discovery in general terms. The existing
    subdivision, although in terms applicable only to depositions, is
    incorporated by reference in existing Rules 33 and 34. Since
    decisions as to relevance to the subject matter of the action are
    made for discovery purposes well in advance of trial, a flexible
    treatment of relevance is required and the making of discovery,
    whether voluntary or under court order, is not a concession or
    determination of relevance for purposes of trial. Cf. 4 Moore's
    Federal Practice &#182; 26-16[1] (2d ed. 1966).
      Subdivision (b)(2) - Insurance Policies. Both cases and
    commentators are sharply in conflict on the question whether
    defendant's liability insurance coverage is subject to discovery in
    the usual situation when the insurance coverage is not itself
    admissible and does not bear on another issue on the case. Examples
    of Federal cases requiring disclosure and supporting comments: Cook
    v. Welty, 253 F.Supp. 875 (D.D.C. 1966) (cases cited); Johanek v.
    Aberle, 27 F.R.D. 272 (D.Mont. 1961); Williams, Discovery of Dollar
    Limits in Liability Policies in Automobile Tort Cases, 10
    Ala.L.Rev. 355 (1958); Thode, Some Reflections on the 1957
    Amendments to the Texas Rules, 37 Tex.L.Rev. 33, 40-42 (1958).
    Examples of Federal cases refusing disclosure and supporting
    comments: Bisserier v. Manning, 207 F.Supp. 476 (D.N.J. 1962);
    Cooper v. Stender, 30 F.R.D. 389 (E.D.Tenn. 1962); Frank, Discovery
    and Insurance Coverage, 1959 Ins.L.J. 281; Fournier, Pre-Trial
    Discovery of Insurance Coverage and Limits, 28 Ford L.Rev. 215
    (1959).
      The division in reported cases is close. State decisions based on
    provisions similar to the federal rules are similarly divided. See
    cases collected in 2A Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice and
    Procedure Sec. 647.1, nn. 45.5, 45.6 (Wright ed. 1961). It appears
    to be difficult if not impossible to obtain appellate review of the
    issue. Resolution by rule amendment is indicated. The question is
    essentially procedural in that it bears upon preparation for trial
    and settlement before trial, and courts confronting the question,
    however, they have decided it, have generally treated it as
    procedural and governed by the rules.
      The amendment resolves this issue in favor of disclosure. Most of
    the decisions denying discovery, some explicitly, reason from the
    text of Rule 26(b) that it permits discovery only of matters which
    will be admissible in evidence or appear reasonably calculated to
    lead to such evidence; they avoid considerations of policy,
    regarding them as foreclosed. See Bisserier v. Manning, supra. Some
    note also that facts about a defendant's financial status are not
    discoverable as such, prior to judgment with execution unsatisfied,
    and fear that, if courts hold insurance coverage discoverable, they
    must extend the principle to other aspects of the defendant's
    financial status. The cases favoring disclosure rely heavily on the
    practical significance of insurance in the decisions lawyers make
    about settlement and trial preparation. In Clauss v. Danker, 264
    F.Supp. 246 (S.D.N.Y. 1967), the court held that the rules forbid
    disclosure but called for an amendment to permit it.
      Disclosure of insurance coverage will enable counsel for both
    sides to make the same realistic appraisal of the case, so that
    settlement and litigation strategy are based on knowledge and not
    speculation. It will conduce to settlement and avoid protracted
    litigation in some cases, though in others it may have an opposite
    effect. The amendment is limited to insurance coverage, which
    should be distinguished from any other facts concerning defendant's
    financial status (1) because insurance is an asset created
    specifically to satisfy the claim; (2) because the insurance
    company ordinarily controls the litigation; (3) because information
    about coverage is available only from defendant or his insurer; and
    (4) because disclosure does not involve a significant invasion of
    privacy.
      Disclosure is required when the insurer "may be liable" on part
    or all of the judgment. Thus, an insurance company must disclose
    even when it contests liability under the policy, and such
    disclosure does not constitute a waiver of its claim. It is
    immaterial whether the liability is to satisfy the judgment
    directly or merely to indemnify or reimburse another after he pays
    the judgment.
      The provision applies only to persons "carrying on an insurance
    business" and thus covers insurance companies and not the ordinary
    business concern that enters into a contract of indemnification.
    Cf. N.Y.Ins. Law Sec. 41. Thus, the provision makes no change in
    existing law on discovery of indemnity agreements other than
    insurance agreements by persons carrying on an insurance business.
    Similarly, the provision does not cover the business concern that
    creates a reserve fund for purposes of self-insurance.
      For some purposes other than discovery, an application for
    insurance is treated as a part of the insurance agreement. The
    provision makes clear that, for discovery purposes, the application
    is not to be so treated. The insurance application may contain
    personal and financial information concerning the insured,
    discovery of which is beyond the purpose of this provision.
      In no instance does disclosure make the facts concerning
    insurance coverage admissible in evidence.
      Subdivision (b)(3) - Trial Preparation: Materials. Some of the
    most controversial and vexing problems to emerge from the discovery
    rules have arisen out of requests for the production of documents
    or things prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial. The
    existing rules make no explicit provision for such materials. Yet,
    two verbally distinct doctrines have developed, each conferring a
    qualified immunity on these materials - the "good cause"
    requirement in Rule 34 (now generally held applicable to discovery
    of documents via deposition under Rule 45 and interrogatories under
    Rule 33) and the work-product doctrine of Hickman v. Taylor, 329
    U.S. 495 (1947). Both demand a showing of justification before
    production can be had, the one of "good cause" and the other
    variously described in the Hickman case: "necessity or
    justification," "denial * * * would unduly prejudice the
    preparation of petitioner's case," or "cause hardship or injustice"
    329 U.S. at 509-510.
      In deciding the Hickman case, the Supreme Court appears to have
    expressed a preference in 1947 for an approach to the problem of
    trial preparation materials by judicial decision rather than by
    rule. Sufficient experience has accumulated, however, with lower
    court applications of the Hickman decision to warrant a
    reappraisal.
      The major difficulties visible in the existing case law are (1)
    confusion and disagreement as to whether "good cause" is made out
    by a showing of relevance and lack of privilege, or requires an
    additional showing of necessity, (2) confusion and disagreement as
    to the scope of the Hickman work-product doctrine, particularly
    whether it extends beyond work actually performed by lawyers, and
    (3) the resulting difficulty of relating the "good cause" required
    by Rule 34 and the "necessity or justification" of the work-product
    doctrine, so that their respective roles and the distinctions
    between them are understood.
      Basic Standard. Since Rule 34 in terms requires a showing of
    "good cause" for the production of all documents and things,
    whether or not trial preparation is involved, courts have felt that
    a single formula is called for and have differed over whether a
    showing of relevance and lack of privilege is enough or whether
    more must be shown. When the facts of the cases are studied,
    however, a distinction emerges based upon the type of materials.
    With respect to documents not obtained or prepared with an eye to
    litigation, the decisions, while not uniform, reflect a strong and
    increasing tendency to relate "good cause" to a showing that the
    documents are relevant to the subject matter of the action. E.g.,
    Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Shields, 17 F.R.D. 273
    (S.D.N.Y. 1959), with cases cited; Houdry Process Corp. v.
    Commonwealth Oil Refining Co., 24 F.R.D. 58 (S.D.N.Y. 1955); see
    Bell v. Commercial Ins. Co., 280 F.2d 514, 517 (3d Cir. 1960). When
    the party whose documents are sought shows that the request for
    production is unduly burdensome or oppressive, courts have denied
    discovery for lack of "good cause", although they might just as
    easily have based their decision on the protective provisions of
    existing Rule 30(b) (new Rule 26(c)). E.g., Lauer v. Tankrederi, 39
    F.R.D. 334 (E.D.Pa. 1966).
      As to trial-preparation materials, however, the courts are
    increasingly interpreting "good cause" as requiring more than
    relevance. When lawyers have prepared or obtained the materials for
    trial, all courts require more than relevance; so much is clearly
    commanded by Hickman. But even as to the preparatory work of
    nonlawyers, while some courts ignore work-product and equate "good
    cause" with relevance, e.g., Brown v. New York, N.H. & H. RR., 17
    F.R.D. 324 (S.D.N.Y. 1955), the more recent trend is to read "good
    cause" as requiring inquiry into the importance of and need for the
    materials as well as into alternative sources for securing the same
    information. In Guilford Nat'l Bank v. Southern Ry., 297 F.2d 921
    (4th Cir. 1962), statements of witnesses obtained by claim agents
    were held not discoverable because both parties had had equal
    access to the witnesses at about the same time, shortly after the
    collision in question. The decision was based solely on Rule 34 and
    "good cause"; the court declined to rule on whether the statements
    were work-product. The court's treatment of "good cause" is quoted
    at length and with approval in Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U.S.
    104, 117-118 (1964). See also Mitchell v. Bass, 252 F.2d 513 (8th
    Cir. 1958); Hauger v. Chicago, R.I. & Pac. RR., 216 F.2d 501 (7th
    Cir. 1954); Burke v. United States, 32 F.R.D. 213 (E.D.N.Y. 1963).
    While the opinions dealing with "good cause" do not often draw an
    explicit distinction between trial preparation materials and other
    materials, in fact an overwhelming proportion of the cases in which
    special showing is required are cases involving trial preparation
    materials.
      The rules are amended by eliminating the general requirement of
    "good cause" from Rule 34 but retaining a requirement of a special
    showing for trial preparation materials in this subdivision. The
    required showing is expressed, not in terms of "good cause" whose
    generality has tended to encourage confusion and controversy, but
    in terms of the elements of the special showing to be made:
    substantial need of the materials in the preparation of the case
    and inability without undue hardship to obtain the substantial
    equivalent of the materials by other means.
      These changes conform to the holdings of the cases, when viewed
    in light of their facts. Apart from trial preparation, the fact
    that the materials sought are documentary does not in and of itself
    require a special showing beyond relevance and absence of
    privilege. The protective provisions are of course available, and
    if the party from whom production is sought raises a special issue
    of privacy (as with respect to income tax returns or grand jury
    minutes) or points to evidence primarily impeaching, or can show
    serious burden or expense, the court will exercise its traditional
    power to decide whether to issue a protective order. On the other
    hand, the requirement of a special showing for discovery of trial
    preparation materials reflects the view that each side's informal
    evaluation of its case should be protected, that each side should
    be encouraged to prepare independently, and that one side should
    not automatically have the benefit of the detailed preparatory work
    of the other side. See Field and McKusick, Maine Civil Practice 264
    (1959).
      Elimination of a "good cause" requirement from Rule 34 and the
    establishment of a requirement of a special showing in this
    subdivision will eliminate the confusion caused by having two
    verbally distinct requirements of justification that the courts
    have been unable to distinguish clearly. Moreover, the language of
    the subdivision suggests the factors which the courts should
    consider in determining whether the requisite showing has been
    made. The importance of the materials sought to the party seeking
    them in preparation of his case and the difficulty he will have
    obtaining them by other means are factors noted in the Hickman
    case. The courts should also consider the likelihood that the
    party, even if he obtains the information by independent means,
    will not have the substantial equivalent of the documents the
    production of which he seeks.
      Consideration of these factors may well lead the court to
    distinguish between witness statements taken by an investigator, on
    the one hand, and other parts of the investigative file, on the
    other. The court in Southern Ry. v. Lanham, 403 F.2d 119 (5th Cir.
    1968), while it naturally addressed itself to the "good cause"
    requirements of Rule 34, set forth as controlling considerations
    the factors contained in the language of this subdivision. The
    analysis of the court suggests circumstances under which witness
    statements will be discoverable. The witness may have given a fresh
    and contemporaneous account in a written statement while he is
    available to the party seeking discovery only a substantial time
    thereafter. Lanham, supra at 127-128; Guilford, supra at 926. Or he
    may be reluctant or hostile. Lanham, supra at 128-129; Brookshire
    v. Pennsylvania RR., 14 F.R.D. 154 (N.D.Ohio 1953); Diamond v.
    Mohawk Rubber Co., 33 F.R.D. 264 (D.Colo. 1963). Or he may have a
    lapse of memory. Tannenbaum v. Walker, 16 F.R.D. 570 (E.D.Pa.
    1954). Or he may probably be deviating from his prior statement.
    Cf. Hauger v. Chicago, R.I. & Pac. RR., 216 F.2d 501 (7th Cir.
    1954). On the other hand, a much stronger showing is needed to
    obtain evaluative materials in an investigator's reports. Lanham,
    supra at 131-133; Pickett v. L. R. Ryan, Inc., 237 F.Supp. 198
    (E.D.S.C. 1965).
      Materials assembled in the ordinary course of business, or
    pursuant to public requirements unrelated to litigation, or for
    other nonlitigation purposes are not under the qualified immunity
    provided by this subdivision. Gossman v. A. Duie Pyle, Inc., 320
    F.2d 45 (4th Cir. 1963); cf. United States v. New York Foreign
    Trade Zone Operators, Inc., 304 F.2d 792 (2d Cir. 1962). No change
    is made in the existing doctrine, noted in the Hickman case, that
    one party may discover relevant facts known or available to the
    other party, even though such facts are contained in a document
    which is not itself discoverable.
      Treatment of Lawyers; Special Protection of Mental Impressions,
    Conclusions, Opinions, and Legal Theories Concerning the
    Litigation. - The courts are divided as to whether the work-product
    doctrine extends to the preparatory work only of lawyers. The
    Hickman case left this issue open since the statements in that case
    were taken by a lawyer. As to courts of appeals, compare Alltmont
    v. United States, 177 F.2d 971, 976 (3d Cir. 1949), cert. denied,
    339 U.S. 967 (1950) (Hickman applied to statements obtained by FBI
    agents on theory it should apply to "all statements of prospective
    witnesses which a party has obtained for his trial counsel's use"),
    with Southern Ry. v. Campbell, 309 F.2d 569 (5th Cir. 1962)
    (statements taken by claim agents not work-product), and Guilford
    Nat'l Bank v. Southern Ry., 297 F.2d 921 (4th Cir. 1962) (avoiding
    issue of work-product as to claim agents, deciding case instead
    under Rule 34 "good cause"). Similarly, the district courts are
    divided on statements obtained by claim agents, compare, e.g.,
    Brown v. New York, N.H. & H. RR., 17 F.R.D. 324 (S.D.N.Y. 1955)
    with Hanke v. Milwaukee Electric Ry. & Transp. Co., 7 F.R.D. 540
    (E.D. Wis. 1947); investigators, compare Burke v. United States, 32
    F.R.D. 213 (E.D.N.Y.1963) with Snyder v. United States, 20 F.R.D. 7
    (E.D.N.Y.1956); and insurers, compare Gottlieb v. Bresler, 24
    F.R.D. 371 (D.D.C.1959) with Burns v. Mulder, 20 F.R.D. 605 (ED.Pa
    1957). See 4 Moore's Federal Practice &#182; 26.23 [8.1] (2d ed.
    1966); 2A Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec.
    652.2 (Wright ed. 1961).
      A complication is introduced by the use made by courts of the
    "good cause" requirement of Rule 34, as described above. A court
    may conclude that trial preparation materials are not work-product
    because not the result of lawyer's work and yet hold that they are
    not producible because "good cause" has not been shown. Cf.
    Guilford Nat'l Bank v. Southern Ry., 297 F.2d 921 (4th Cir. 1962),
    cited and described above. When the decisions on "good cause" are
    taken into account, the weight of authority affords protection of
    the preparatory work of both lawyers and nonlawyers (though not
    necessarily to the same extent) by requiring more than a showing of
    relevance to secure production.
      Subdivision (b)(3) reflects the trend of the cases by requiring a
    special showing, not merely as to materials prepared by an
    attorney, but also as to materials prepared in anticipation of
    litigation or preparation for trial by or for a party or any
    representative acting on his behalf. The subdivision then goes on
    to protect against disclosure the mental impressions, conclusions,
    opinions, or legal theories concerning the litigation of an
    attorney or other representative of a party. The Hickman opinion
    drew special attention to the need for protecting an attorney
    against discovery of memoranda prepared from recollection of oral
    interviews. The courts have steadfastly safeguarded against
    disclosure of lawyers' mental impressions and legal theories, as
    well as mental impressions and subjective evaluations of
    investigators and claim-agents. In enforcing this provision of the
    subdivision, the courts will sometimes find it necessary to order
    disclosure of a document but with portions deleted.
      Rules 33 and 36 have been revised in order to permit discovery
    calling for opinions, contentions, and admissions relating not only
    to fact but also to the application of law to fact. Under those
    rules, a party and his attorney or other representative may be
    required to disclose, to some extent, mental impressions, opinions,
    or conclusions. But documents or parts of documents containing
    these matters are protected against discovery by this subdivision.
    Even though a party may ultimately have to disclose in response to
    interrogatories or requests to admit, he is entitled to keep
    confidential documents containing such matters prepared for
    internal use.
      Party's Right to Own Statement. - An exception to the requirement
    of this subdivision enables a party to secure production of his own
    statement without any special showing. The cases are divided.
    Compare, e.g., Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Reynolds, 176 F.2d 476 (D.C.
    Cir. 1949); Shupe v. Pennsylvania RR., 19 F.R.D. 144 (W.D.Pa.
    1956); with e.g., New York Central RR. v. Carr, 251 F.2d 433 (4th
    Cir. 1957); Belback v. Wilson Freight Forwarding Co., 40 F.R.D. 16
    (W.D.Pa. 1966).
      Courts which treat a party's statement as though it were that of
    any witness overlook the fact that the party's statement is,
    without more, admissible in evidence. Ordinarily, a party gives a
    statement without insisting on a copy because he does not yet have
    a lawyer and does not understand the legal consequences of his
    actions. Thus, the statement is given at a time when he functions
    at a disadvantage. Discrepancies between his trial testimony and
    earlier statement may result from lapse of memory or ordinary
    inaccuracy; a written statement produced for the first time at
    trial may give such discrepancies a prominence which they do not
    deserve. In appropriate cases the court may order a party to be
    deposed before his statement is produced. E.g., Smith v. Central
    Linen Service Co., 39 F.R.D. 15 (D.Md. 1966); McCoy v. General
    Motors Corp., 33 F.R.D. 354 (W.D.Pa. 1963).
      Commentators strongly support the view that a party be able to
    secure his statement without a showing. 4 Moore's Federal Practice
    &#182; 26.23 [8.4] (2d ed. 1966); 2A Barron & Holtzoff, Federal
    Practice and Procedure Sec. 652.3 (Wright ed. 1961); see also Note,
    Developments in the Law - Discovery, 74 Harv.L.Rev. 940, 1039
    (1961). The following states have by statute or rule taken the same
    position: Statutes: Fla.Stat.Ann. Sec. 92.33; Ga.Code Ann. Sec. 38-
    2109(b); La.Stat.Ann.R.S. 13:3732; Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. c. 271, Sec.
    44; Minn.Stat.Ann. Sec. 602.01; N.Y.C.P.L.R. Sec. 3101(e). Rules:
    Mo.R.C.P. 56.01(a); N.Dak.R.C.P. 34(b); Wyo.R.C.P. 34(b); cf.
    Mich.G.C.R. 306.2.
      In order to clarify and tighten the provision on statements by a
    party, the term "statement" is defined. The definition is adapted
    from 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3500(e) (Jencks Act). The statement of a party
    may of course be that of plaintiff or defendant, and it may be that
    of an individual or of a corporation or other organization.
      Witness' Right to Own Statement. - A second exception to the
    requirement of this subdivision permits a nonparty witness to
    obtain a copy of his own statement without any special showing.
    Many, though not all, of the considerations supporting a party's
    right to obtain his statement apply also to the non-party witness.
    Insurance companies are increasingly recognizing that a witness is
    entitled to a copy of his statement and are modifying their regular
    practice accordingly.
      Subdivision (b)(4) - Trial Preparation: Experts. This is a new
    provision dealing with discovery of information (including facts
    and opinions) obtained by a party from an expert retained by that
    party in relation to litigation or obtained by the expert and not
    yet transmitted to the party. The subdivision deals separately with
    those experts whom the party expects to call as trial witnesses and
    with those experts who have been retained or specially employed by
    the party but who are not expected to be witnesses. It should be
    noted that the subdivision does not address itself to the expert
    whose information was not acquired in preparation for trial but
    rather because he was an actor or viewer with respect to
    transactions or occurrences that are part of the subject matter of
    the lawsuit. Such an expert should be treated as an ordinary
    witness.
      Subsection (b)(4)(A) deals with discovery of information obtained
    by or through experts who will be called as witnesses at trial. The
    provision is responsive to problems suggested by a relatively
    recent line of authorities. Many of these cases present intricate
    and difficult issues as to which expert testimony is likely to be
    determinative. Prominent among them are food and drug, patent, and
    condemnation cases. See, e.g., United States v. Nysco Laboratories,
    Inc., 26 F.R.D. 159, 162 (E.D.N.Y. 1960) (food and drug); E. I. du
    Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 24 F.R.D. 416, 421
    (D.Del. 1959) (patent); Cold Metal Process Co. v. Aluminum Co. of
    America, 7 F.R.D. 425 (N.D.Ohio 1947), aff'd. Sachs v. Aluminum Co.
    of America, 167 F.2d 570 (6th Cir. 1948) (same); United States v.
    50.34 Acres of Land, 13 F.R.D. 19 (E.D.N.Y. 1952) (condemnation).
      In cases of this character, a prohibition against discovery of
    information held by expert witnesses produces in acute form the
    very evils that discovery has been created to prevent. Effective
    cross-examination of an expert witness requires advance
    preparation. The lawyer even with the help of his own experts
    frequently cannot anticipate the particular approach his
    adversary's expert will take or the data on which he will base his
    judgment on the stand. McGlothlin, Some Practical Problems in Proof
    of Economic, Scientific, and Technical Facts, 23 F.R.D. 467, 478
    (1958). A California study of discovery and pretrial in
    condemnation cases notes that the only substitute for discovery of
    experts' valuation materials is "lengthy - and often fruitless -
    cross-examination during trial," and recommends pretrial exchange
    of such material. Calif.Law Rev.Comm'n, Discovery in Eminent Domain
    Proceedings 707-710 (Jan.1963). Similarly, effective rebuttal
    requires advance knowledge of the line of testimony of the other
    side. If the latter is foreclosed by a rule against discovery, then
    the narrowing of issues and elimination of surprise which discovery
    normally produces are frustrated.
      These considerations appear to account for the broadening of
    discovery against experts in the cases cited where expert testimony
    was central to the case. In some instances, the opinions are
    explicit in relating expanded discovery to improved cross-
    examination and rebuttal at trial. Franks v. National Dairy
    Products Corp., 41 F.R.D. 234 (W.D.Tex. 1966); United States v.
    23.76 Acres, 32 F.R.D. 593 (D.Md. 1963); see also an unpublished
    opinion of Judge Hincks, quoted in United States v. 48 Jars, etc.,
    23 F.R.D. 192, 198 (D.D.C. 1958). On the other hand, the need for a
    new provision is shown by the many cases in which discovery of
    expert trial witnesses is needed for effective cross-examination
    and rebuttal, and yet courts apply the traditional doctrine and
    refuse disclosure. E.g., United States v. Certain Parcels of Land,
    25 F.R.D. 192 (N.D.Cal. 1959); United States v. Certain Acres, 18
    F.R.D. 98 (M.D.Ga. 1955).
      Although the trial problems flowing from lack of discovery of
    expert witnesses are most acute and noteworthy when the case turns
    largely on experts, the same problems are encountered when a single
    expert testifies. Thus, subdivision (b)(4)(A) draws no line between
    complex and simple cases, or between cases with many experts and
    those with but one. It establishes by rule substantially the
    procedure adopted by decision of the court in Knighton v. Villian &
    Fassio, 39 F.R.D. 11 (D.Md. 1965). For a full analysis of the
    problem and strong recommendations to the same effect, see
    Friedenthal, Discovery and Use of an Adverse Party's Expert
    Information, 14 Stan.L.Rev. 455, 485-488 (1962); Long, Discovery
    and Experts under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 38 F.R.D.
    111 (1965).
      Past judicial restrictions on discovery of an adversary's expert,
    particularly as to his opinions, reflect the fear that one side
    will benefit unduly from the other's better preparation. The
    procedure established in subsection (b)(4)(A) holds the risk to a
    minimum. Discovery is limited to trial witnesses, and may be
    obtained only at a time when the parties know who their expert
    witnesses will be. A party must as a practical matter prepare his
    own case in advance of that time, for he can hardly hope to build
    his case out of his opponent's experts.
      Subdivision (b)(4)(A) provides for discovery of an expert who is
    to testify at the trial. A party can require one who intends to use
    the expert to state the substance of the testimony that the expert
    is expected to give. The court may order further discovery, and it
    has ample power to regulate its timing and scope and to prevent
    abuse. Ordinarily, the order for further discovery shall compensate
    the expert for his time, and may compensate the party who intends
    to use the expert for past expenses reasonably incurred in
    obtaining facts or opinions from the expert. Those provisions are
    likely to discourage abusive practices.
      Subdivision (b)(4)(B) deals with an expert who has been retained
    or specially employed by the party in anticipation of litigation or
    preparation for trial (thus excluding an expert who is simply a
    general employee of the party not specially employed on the case),
    but who is not expected to be called as a witness. Under its
    provisions, a party may discover facts known or opinions held by
    such an expert only on a showing of exceptional circumstances under
    which it is impracticable for the party seeking discovery to obtain
    facts or opinions on the same subject by other means.
      Subdivision (b)(4)(B) is concerned only with experts retained or
    specially consulted in relation to trial preparation. Thus the
    subdivision precludes discovery against experts who were informally
    consulted in preparation for trial, but not retained or specially
    employed. As an ancillary procedure, a party may on a proper
    showing require the other party to name experts retained or
    specially employed, but not those informally consulted.
      These new provisions of subdivision (b)(4) repudiate the few
    decisions that have held an expert's information privileged simply
    because of his status as an expert, e.g., American Oil Co. v.
    Pennsylvania Petroleum Products Co., 23 F.R.D. 680, 685-686 (D.R.I.
    1959). See Louisell, Modern California Discovery 315-316 (1963).
    They also reject as ill-considered the decisions which have sought
    to bring expert information within the work-product doctrine. See
    United States v. McKay, 372 F.2d 174, 176-177 (5th Cir. 1967). The
    provisions adopt a form of the more recently developed doctrine of
    "unfairness". See e.g., United States v. 23.76 Acres of Land, 32
    F.R.D. 593, 597 (D.Md. 1963); Louisell, supra, at 317-318; 4
    Moore's Federal Practice Sec. 26.24 (2d ed. 1966).
      Under subdivision (b)(4)(C), the court is directed or authorized
    to issue protective orders, including an order that the expert be
    paid a reasonable fee for time spent in responding to discovery,
    and that the party whose expert is made subject to discovery be
    paid a fair portion of the fees and expenses that the party
    incurred in obtaining information from the expert. The court may
    issue the latter order as a condition of discovery, or it may delay
    the order until after discovery is completed. These provisions for
    fees and expenses meet the objection that it is unfair to permit
    one side to obtain without cost the benefit of an expert's work for
    which the other side has paid, often a substantial sum. E.g., Lewis
    v. United Air Lines Transp. Corp., 32 F.Supp. 21 (W.D.Pa. 1940);
    Walsh v. Reynolds Metal Co., 15 F.R.D. 376 (D.N.J. 1954). On the
    other hand, a party may not obtain discovery simply by offering to
    pay fees and expenses. Cf. Boynton v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,
    36 F.Supp. 593 (D.Mass. 1941).
      In instances of discovery under subdivision (b)(4)(B), the court
    is directed to award fees and expenses to the other party, since
    the information is of direct value to the discovering party's
    preparation of his case. In ordering discovery under (b)(4)(A)(ii),
    the court has discretion whether to award fees and expenses to the
    other party; its decision should depend upon whether the
    discovering party is simply learning about the other party's case
    or is going beyond this to develop his own case. Even in cases
    where the court is directed to issue a protective order, it may
    decline to do so if it finds that manifest injustice would result.
    Thus, the court can protect, when necessary and appropriate, the
    interests of an indigent party.
      Subdivision (c) - Protective Orders. The provisions of existing
    Rule 30(b) are transferred to this subdivision (c), as part of the
    rearrangement of Rule 26. The language has been changed to give it
    application to discovery generally. The subdivision recognizes the
    power of the court in the district where a deposition is being
    taken to make protective orders. Such power is needed when the
    deposition is being taken far from the court where the action is
    pending. The court in the district where the deposition is being
    taken may, and frequently will, remit the deponent or party to the
    court where the action is pending.
      In addition, drafting changes are made to carry out and clarify
    the sense of the rule. Insertions are made to avoid any possible
    implication that a protective order does not extend to "time" as
    well as to "place" or may not safeguard against "undue burden or
    expense."
      The new reference to trade secrets and other confidential
    commercial information reflects existing law. The courts have not
    given trade secrets automatic and complete immunity against
    disclosure, but have in each case weighed their claim to privacy
    against the need for disclosure. Frequently, they have been
    afforded a limited protection. See, e.g., Covey Oil Co. v.
    Continental Oil Co., 340 F.2d 993 (10th Cir. 1965); Julius M. Ames
    Co. v. Bostitch, Inc., 235 F.Supp. 856 (S.D.N.Y. 1964).
      The subdivision contains new matter relating to sanctions. When a
    motion for a protective order is made and the court is disposed to
    deny it, the court may go a step further and issue an order to
    provide or permit discovery. This will bring the sanctions of Rule
    37(b) directly into play. Since the court has heard the contentions
    of all interested persons, an affirmative order is justified. See
    Rosenberg, Sanctions to Effectuate Pretrial Discovery, 58
    Col.L.Rev. 480, 492-493 (1958). In addition, the court may require
    the payment of expenses incurred in relation to the motion.
      Subdivision (d) - Sequence and Priority. This new provision is
    concerned with the sequence in which parties may proceed with
    discovery and with related problems of timing. The principal
    effects of the new provision are first, to eliminate any fixed
    priority in the sequence of discovery, and second, to make clear
    and explicit the court's power to establish priority by an order
    issued in a particular case.
      A priority rule developed by some courts, which confers priority
    on the party who first serves notice of taking a deposition, is
    unsatisfactory in several important respects:
      First, this priority rule permits a party to establish a priority
    running to all depositions as to which he has given earlier notice.
    Since he can on a given day serve notice of taking many depositions
    he is in a position to delay his adversary's taking of depositions
    for an inordinate time. Some courts have ruled that deposition
    priority also permits a party to delay his answers to
    interrogatories and production of documents. E.g., E. I. du Pont de
    Nemours & Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 23 F.R.D. 237 (D.Del.
    1959); but cf. Sturdevant v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 32 F.R.D. 426
    (W.D.Mo. 1963).
      Second, since notice is the key to priority, if both parties wish
    to take depositions first a race results. See Caldwell-Clements,
    Inc. v. McGraw-Hill Pub. Co., 11 F.R.D. 156 (S.D.N.Y. 1951)
    (description of tactics used by parties). But the existing rules on
    notice of deposition create a race with runners starting from
    different positions. The plaintiff may not give notice without
    leave of court until 20 days after commencement of the action,
    whereas the defendant may serve notice at any time after
    commencement. Thus, a careful and prompt defendant can almost
    always secure priority. This advantage of defendants is fortuitous,
    because the purpose of requiring plaintiff to wait 20 days is to
    afford defendant an opportunity to obtain counsel, not to confer
    priority.
      Third, although courts have ordered a change in the normal
    sequence of discovery on a number of occasions, e.g., Kaeppler v.
    James H. Matthews & Co., 200 F.Supp. 229 (E.D.Pa. 1961); Park &
    Tilford Distillers Corp. v. Distillers Co., 19 F.R.D. 169 (S.D.N.Y.
    1956), and have at all times avowed discretion to vary the usual
    priority, most commentators are agreed that courts in fact grant
    relief only for "the most obviously compelling reasons." 2A Barron
    & Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure 447-47 (Wright ed.
    1961); see also Younger, Priority of Pretrial Examination in the
    Federal Courts - A Comment, 34 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 1271 (1959); Freund,
    The Pleading and Pretrial of an Antitrust Claim, 46 Corn.L.Q. 555,
    564, (1964). Discontent with the fairness of actual practice has
    been evinced by other observers. Comments, 59 Yale L.J. 117, 134-
    136 (1949); Yudkin, Some Refinements in Federal Discovery
    Procedure, 11 Fed.B.J. 289, 296-297 (1951); Developments in the Law-
    Discovery, 74 Harv.L.Rev. 940, 954-958 (1961).
      Despite these difficulties, some courts have adhered to the
    priority rule, presumably because it provides a test which is
    easily understood and applied by the parties without much court
    intervention. It thus permits deposition discovery to function
    extrajudicially, which the rules provide for and the courts desire.
    For these same reasons, courts are reluctant to make numerous
    exceptions to the rule.
      The Columbia Survey makes clear that the problem of priority does
    not affect litigants generally. It found that most litigants do not
    move quickly to obtain discovery. In over half of the cases, both
    parties waited at least 50 days. During the first 20 days after
    commencement of the action - the period when defendant might assure
    his priority by noticing depositions - 16 percent of the defendants
    acted to obtain discovery. A race could not have occurred in more
    than 16 percent of the cases and it undoubtedly occurred in fewer.
    On the other hand, five times as many defendants as plaintiffs
    served notice of deposition during the first 19 days. To the same
    effect, see Comment, Tactical Use and Abuse of Depositions Under
    the Federal Rules, 59 Yale L.J. 117, 134 (1949).
      These findings do not mean, however, that the priority rule is
    satisfactory or that a problem of priority does not exist. The
    court decisions show that parties do bottle on this issue and carry
    their disputes to court. The statistics show that these court cases
    are not typical. By the same token, they reveal that more extensive
    exercise of judicial discretion to vary the priority will not bring
    a flood of litigation, and that a change in the priority rule will
    in fact affect only a small fraction of the cases.
      It is contended by some that there is no need to alter the
    existing priority practice. In support, it is urged that there is
    no evidence that injustices in fact result from present practice
    and that, in any event, the courts can and do promulgate local
    rules, as in New York, to deal with local situations and issue
    orders to avoid possible injustice in particular cases.
      Subdivision (d) is based on the contrary view that the rule of
    priority based on notice is unsatisfactory and unfair in its
    operation. Subdivision (d) follows an approach adapted from Civil
    Rule 4 of the District Court for the Southern District of New York.
    That rule provides that starting 40 days after commencement of the
    action, unless otherwise ordered by the court, the fact that one
    part is taking a deposition shall not prevent another party from
    doing so "concurrently." In practice, the depositions are not
    usually taken simultaneously; rather, the parties work out
    arrangements for alternation in the taking of depositions. One
    party may take a complete deposition and then the other, or, if the
    depositions are extensive, one party deposes for a set time, and
    then the other. See Caldwell-Clements, Inc. v. McGraw-Hill Pub.
    Co., 11 F.R.D. 156 (S.D.N.Y. 1951).
      In principle, one party's initiation of discovery should not wait
    upon the other's completion, unless delay is dictated by special
    considerations. Clearly the principle is feasible with respect to
    all methods of discovery other than depositions. And the experience
    of the Southern District of New York shows that the principle can
    be applied to depositions as well. The courts have not had an
    increase in motion business on this matter. Once it is clear to
    lawyers that they bargain on an equal footing, they are usually
    able to arrange for an orderly succession of depositions without
    judicial intervention. Professor Moore has called attention to
    Civil Rule 4 and suggested that it may usefully be extended to
    other areas. 4 Moore's Federal Practice 1154 (2d ed. 1966).
      The court may upon motion and by order grant priority in a
    particular case. But a local court rule purporting to confer
    priority in certain classes of cases would be inconsistent with
    this subdivision and thus void.
      Subdivision (e) - Supplementation of Responses. The rules do not
    now state whether interrogatories (and questions at deposition as
    well as requests for inspection and admissions) impose a
    "continuing burden" on the responding party to supplement his
    answers if he obtains new information. The issue is acute when new
    information renders substantially incomplete or inaccurate an
    answer which was complete and accurate when made. It is essential
    that the rules provide an answer to this question. The parties can
    adjust to a rule either way, once they know what it is. See 4
    Moore's Federal Practice &#182; 33.25[4] (2d ed. 1966).
      Arguments can be made both ways. Imposition of a continuing
    burden reduces the proliferation of additional sets of
    interrogatories. Some courts have adopted local rules establishing
    such a burden. E.g., E.D.Pa.R. 20(f), quoted in Taggart v. Vermont
    Transp. Co., 32 F.R.D. 587 (E.D.Pa. 1963); D.Me.R.15(c). Others
    have imposed the burden by decision, E.g., Chenault v. Nebraska
    Farm Products, Inc., 9 F.R.D. 529, 533 (D.Nebr. 1949). On the other
    hand, there are serious objections to the burden, especially in
    protracted cases. Although the party signs the answers, it is his
    lawyer who understands their significance and bears the
    responsibility to bring answers up to date. In a complex case all
    sorts of information reaches the party, who little understands its
    bearing on answers previously given to interrogatories. In
    practice, therefore, the lawyer under a continuing burden must
    periodically recheck all interrogatories and canvass all new
    information. But a full set of new answers may no longer be needed
    by the interrogating party. Some issues will have been dropped from
    the case, some questions are now seen as unimportant, and other
    questions must in any event be reformulated. See Novick v.
    Pennsylvania RR., 18 F.R.D. 296, 298 (W.D.Pa. 1955).
      Subdivision (e) provides that a party is not under a continuing
    burden except as expressly provided. Cf. Note, 68 Harv.L.Rev. 673,
    677 (1955). An exception is made as to the identity of persons
    having knowledge of discoverable matters, because of the obvious
    importance to each side of knowing all witnesses and because
    information about witnesses routinely comes to each lawyer's
    attention. Many of the decisions on the issue of a continuing
    burden have in fact concerned the identity of witnesses. An
    exception is also made as to expert trial witnesses in order to
    carry out the provisions of Rule 26(b)(4). See Diversified Products
    Corp. v. Sports Center Co., 42 F.R.D. 3 (D.Md. 1967).
      Another exception is made for the situation in which a party, or
    more frequently his lawyer, obtains actual knowledge that a prior
    response is incorrect. This exception does not impose a duty to
    check the accuracy of prior responses, but it prevents knowing
    concealment by a party or attorney. Finally, a duty to supplement
    may be imposed by order of the court in a particular case
    (including an order resulting from a pretrial conference) or by
    agreement of the parties. A party may of course make a new
    discovery request which requires supplementation of prior
    responses.
      The duty will normally be enforced, in those limited instances
    where it is imposed, through sanctions imposed by the trial court,
    including exclusion of evidence, continuance, or other action, as
    the court may deem appropriate.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1980 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (f). This subdivision is new. There has been
    widespread criticism of abuse of discovery. The Committee has
    considered a number of proposals to eliminate abuse, including a
    change in Rule 26(b)(1) with respect to the scope of discovery and
    a change in Rule 33(a) to limit the number of questions that can be
    asked by interrogatories to parties.
      The Committee believes that abuse of discovery, while very
    serious in certain cases, is not so general as to require such
    basic changes in the rules that govern discovery in all cases. A
    very recent study of discovery in selected metropolitan districts
    tends to support its belief. P. Connolly, E. Holleman, & M.
    Kuhlman, Judicial Controls and the Civil Litigative Process:
    Discovery (Federal Judicial Center, 1978). In the judgment of the
    Committee abuse can best be prevented by intervention by the court
    as soon as abuse is threatened.
      To this end this subdivision provides that counsel who has
    attempted without success to effect with opposing counsel a
    reasonable program or plan for discovery is entitled to the
    assistance of the court.
      It is not contemplated that requests for discovery conferences
    will be made routinely. A relatively narrow discovery dispute
    should be resolved by resort to Rules 26(c) or 37(a), and if it
    appears that a request for a conference is in fact grounded in such
    a dispute, the court may refer counsel to those rules. If the court
    is persuaded that a request is frivolous or vexatious, it can
    strike it. See Rules 11 and 7(b)(2).
      A number of courts routinely consider discovery matters in
    preliminary pretrial conferences held shortly after the pleadings
    are closed. This subdivision does not interfere with such a
    practice. It authorizes the court to combine a discovery conference
    with a pretrial conference under Rule 16 if a pretrial conference
    is held sufficiently early to prevent or curb abuse.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983 AMENDMENT       
      Excessive discovery and evasion or resistance to reasonable
    discovery requests pose significant problems. Recent studies have
    made some attempt to determine the sources and extent of the
    difficulties. See Brazil, Civil Discovery: Lawyers' Views of its
    Effectiveness, Principal Problems and Abuses, American Bar

    Changes in the Discovery Rules, 1978 Ariz.St.L.J. 475.
      The purpose of discovery is to provide a mechanism for making
    relevant information available to the litigants. "Mutual knowledge
    of all the relevant facts gathered by both parties is essential to
    proper litigation." Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 507 (1947).
    Thus the spirit of the rules is violated when advocates attempt to
    use discovery tools as tactical weapons rather than to expose the
    facts and illuminate the issues by overuse of discovery or
    unnecessary use of defensive weapons or evasive responses. All of
    this results in excessively costly and time-consuming activities
    that are disproportionate to the nature of the case, the amount
    involved, or the issues or values at stake.
      Given our adversary tradition and the current discovery rules, it
    is not surprising that there are many opportunities, if not
    incentives, for attorneys to engage in discovery that, although
    authorized by the broad, permissive terms of the rules,
    nevertheless results in delay. See Brazil, The Adversary Character
    of Civil Discovery: A Critique and Proposals for Change, 31
    Vand.L.Rev. 1259 (1978). As a result, it has been said that the
    rules have "not infrequently [been] exploited to the disadvantage
    of justice." Herbert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 153, 179 (1979) (Powell,
    J., concurring). These practices impose costs on an already
    overburdened system and impede the fundamental goal of the "just,
    speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action."
    Fed.R.Civ.P. 1.
      Subdivision (a); Discovery Methods. The deletion of the last
    sentence of Rule 26(a)(1), which provided that unless the court
    ordered otherwise under Rule 26(c) "the frequency of use" of the
    various discovery methods was not to be limited, is an attempt to
    address the problem of duplicative, redundant, and excessive
    discovery and to reduce it. The amendment, in conjunction with the
    changes in Rule 26(b)(1), is designed to encourage district judges
    to identify instances of needless discovery and to limit the use of
    the various discovery devices accordingly. The question may be
    raised by one of the parties, typically on a motion for a
    protective order, or by the court on its own initiative. It is
    entirely appropriate to consider a limitation on the frequency of
    use of discovery at a discovery conference under Rule 26(f) or at
    any other pretrial conference authorized by these rules. In
    considering the discovery needs of a particular case, the court
    should consider the factors described in Rule 26(b)(1).
      Subdivision (b); Discovery Scope and Limits. Rule 26(b)(1) has
    been amended to add a sentence to deal with the problem of over-
    discovery. The objective is to guard against redundant or
    disproportionate discovery by giving the court authority to reduce
    the amount of discovery that may be directed to matters that are
    otherwise proper subjects of inquiry. The new sentence is intended
    to encourage judges to be more aggressive in identifying and
    discouraging discovery overuse. The grounds mentioned in the
    amended rule for limiting discovery reflect the existing practice
    of many courts in issuing protective orders under Rule 26(c). See
    e.g., Carlson Cos. v. Sperry & Hutchinson Co., 374 F.Supp. 1080
    (D.Minn. 1974); Dolgow v. Anderson, 53 F.R.D. 661 (E.D.N.Y. 1971);
    Mitchell v. American Tobacco Co., 33 F.R.D. 262 (M.D.Pa. 1963);
    Welty v. Clute, 1 F.R.D. 446 (W.D.N.Y. 1941). On the whole,
    however, district judges have been reluctant to limit the use of
    the discovery devices. See, e.g., Apco Oil Co. v. Certified
    Transp., Inc., 46 F.R.D. 428 (W.D.Mo. 1969). See generally 8 Wright
    & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil Secs. 2036, 2037,
    2039, 2040 (1970).
      The first element of the standard, Rule 26(b)(1)(i), is designed
    to minimize redundancy in discovery and encourage attorneys to be
    sensitive to the comparative costs of different methods of securing
    information. Subdivision (b)(1)(ii) also seeks to reduce
    repetitiveness and to oblige lawyers to think through their
    discovery activities in advance so that full utilization is made of
    each deposition, document request, or set of interrogatories. The
    elements of Rule 26(b)(1)(iii) address the problem of discovery
    that is disproportionate to the individual lawsuit as measured by
    such matters as its nature and complexity, the importance of the
    issues at stake in a case seeking damages, the limitations on a
    financially weak litigant to withstand extensive opposition to a
    discovery program or to respond to discovery requests, and the
    significance of the substantive issues, as measured in philosophic,
    social, or institutional terms. Thus the rule recognizes that many
    cases in public policy spheres, such as employment practices, free
    speech, and other matters, may have importance far beyond the
    monetary amount involved. The court must apply the standards in an
    even-handed manner that will prevent use of discovery to wage a war
    of attrition or as a device to coerce a party, whether financially
    weak or affluent.
      The rule contemplates greater judicial involvement in the
    discovery process and thus acknowledges the reality that it cannot
    always operate on a self-regulating basis. See Connolly, Holleman &
    Kuhlman, Judicial Controls and the Civil Litigative Process:
    Discovery 77, Federal Judicial Center (1978). In an appropriate
    case the court could restrict the number of depositions,
    interrogatories, or the scope of a production request. But the
    court must be careful not to deprive a party of discovery that is
    reasonably necessary to afford a fair opportunity to develop and
    prepare the case.
      The court may act on motion, or its own initiative. It is
    entirely appropriate to resort to the amended rule in conjunction
    with a discovery conference under Rule 26(f) or one of the other
    pretrial conferences authorized by the rules.
      Subdivision (g); Signing of Discovery Requests, Responses, and
    Objections. Rule 26(g) imposes an affirmative duty to engage in
    pretrial discovery in a responsible manner that is consistent with
    the spirit and purposes of Rules 26 through 37. In addition, Rule
    26(g) is designed to curb discovery abuse by explicitly encouraging
    the imposition of sanctions. The subdivision provides a deterrent
    to both excessive discovery and evasion by imposing a certification
    requirement that obliges each attorney to stop and think about the
    legitimacy of a discovery request, a response thereto, or an
    objection. The term "response" includes answers to interrogatories
    and to requests to admit as well as responses to production
    requests.
      If primary responsibility for conducting discovery is to continue
    to rest with the litigants, they must be obliged to act responsibly
    and avoid abuse. With this in mind, Rule 26(g), which parallels the
    amendments to Rule 11, requires an attorney or unrepresented party
    to sign each discovery request, response, or objection. Motions
    relating to discovery are governed by Rule 11. However, since a
    discovery request, response, or objection usually deals with more
    specific subject matter than motions or papers, the elements that
    must be certified in connection with the former are spelled out
    more completely. The signature is a certification of the elements
    set forth in Rule 26(g).
      Although the certification duty requires the lawyer to pause and
    consider the reasonableness of his request, response, or objection,
    it is not meant to discourage or restrict necessary and legitimate
    discovery. The rule simply requires that the attorney make a
    reasonable inquiry into the factual basis of his response, request,
    or objection.
      The duty to make a "reasonable inquiry" is satisfied if the
    investigation undertaken by the attorney and the conclusions drawn
    therefrom are reasonable under the circumstances. It is an
    objective standard similar to the one imposed by Rule 11. See the
    Advisory Committee Note to Rule 11. See also Kinee v. Abraham
    Lincoln Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 365 F.Supp. 975 (E.D.Pa. 1973). In
    making the inquiry, the attorney may rely on assertions by the
    client and on communications with other counsel in the case as long
    as that reliance is appropriate under the circumstances.
    Ultimately, what is reasonable is a matter for the court to decide
    on the totality of the circumstances.
      Rule 26(g) does not require the signing attorney to certify the
    truthfulness of the client's factual responses to a discovery
    request. Rather, the signature certifies that the lawyer has made a
    reasonable effort to assure that the client has provided all the
    information and documents available to him that are responsive to
    the discovery demand. Thus, the lawyer's certification under Rule
    26(g) should be distinguished from other signature requirements in
    the rules, such as those in Rules 30(e) and 33.
      Nor does the rule require a party or an attorney to disclose
    privileged communications or work product in order to show that a
    discovery request, response, or objection is substantially
    justified. The provisions of Rule 26(c), including appropriate
    orders after in camera inspection by the court, remain available to
    protect a party claiming privilege or work product protection.
      The signing requirement means that every discovery request,
    response, or objection should be grounded on a theory that is
    reasonable under the precedents or a good faith belief as to what
    should be the law. This standard is heavily dependent on the
    circumstances of each case. The certification speaks as of the time
    it is made. The duty to supplement discovery responses continues to
    be governed by Rule 26(e).
      Concern about discovery abuse has led to widespread recognition
    that there is a need for more aggressive judicial control and
    supervision. ACF Industries, Inc. v. EEOC, 439 U.S. 1081 (1979)
    (certiorari denied) (Powell, J., dissenting). Sanctions to deter
    discovery abuse would be more effective if they were diligently
    applied "not merely to penalize those whose conduct may be deemed
    to warrant such a sanction, but to deter those who might be tempted
    to such conduct in the absence of such a deterrent." National
    Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, 427 U.S. 639, 643
    (1976). See also Note, The Emerging Deterrence Orientation in the
    Imposition of Discovery Sanctions, 91 Harv. L. Rev. 1033 (1978).
    Thus the premise of Rule 26(g) is that imposing sanctions on
    attorneys who fail to meet the rule's standards will significantly
    reduce abuse by imposing disadvantages therefor.
      Because of the asserted reluctance to impose sanctions on
    attorneys who abuse the discovery rules, see Brazil, Civil
    Discovery: Lawyers' Views of its Effectiveness, Principal Problems
    and Abuses, American Bar Foundation (1980); Ellington, A Study of
    Sanctions for Discovery Abuse, Department of Justice (1979), Rule
    26(g) makes explicit the authority judges now have to impose
    appropriate sanctions and requires them to use it. This authority
    derives from Rule 37, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1927, and the court's inherent
    power. See Roadway Express, Inc., v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752 (1980);
    Martin v. Bell Helicopter Co., 85 F.R.D. 654, 661-62 (D.Col. 1980);
    Note, Sanctions Imposed by Courts on Attorneys Who Abuse the
    Judicial Process, 44 U.Chi.L.Rev. 619 (1977). The new rule mandates
    that sanctions be imposed on attorneys who fail to meet the
    standards established in the first portion of Rule 26(g). The
    nature of the sanction is a matter of judicial discretion to be
    exercised in light of the particular circumstances. The court may
    take into account any failure by the party seeking sanctions to
    invoke protection under Rule 26(c) at an early stage in the
    litigation.
      The sanctioning process must comport with due process
    requirements. The kind of notice and hearing required will depend
    on the facts of the case and the severity of the sanction being
    considered. To prevent the proliferation of the sanction procedure
    and to avoid multiple hearings, discovery in any sanction
    proceeding normally should be permitted only when it is clearly
    required by the interests of justice. In most cases the court will
    be aware of the circumstances and only a brief hearing should be
    necessary.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). Through the addition of paragraphs (1)-(4), this
    subdivision imposes on parties a duty to disclose, without awaiting
    formal discovery requests, certain basic information that is needed
    in most cases to prepare for trial or make an informed decision
    about settlement. The rule requires all parties (1) early in the
    case to exchange information regarding potential witnesses,
    documentary evidence, damages, and insurance, (2) at an appropriate
    time during the discovery period to identify expert witnesses and
    provide a detailed written statement of the testimony that may be
    offered at trial through specially retained experts, and (3) as the
    trial date approaches to identify the particular evidence that may
    be offered at trial. The enumeration in Rule 26(a) of items to be
    disclosed does not prevent a court from requiring by order or local
    rule that the parties disclose additional information without a
    discovery request. Nor are parties precluded from using traditional
    discovery methods to obtain further information regarding these
    matters, as for example asking an expert during a deposition about
    testimony given in other litigation beyond the four-year period
    specified in Rule 26(a)(2)(B).
      A major purpose of the revision is to accelerate the exchange of
    basic information about the case and to eliminate the paper work
    involved in requesting such information, and the rule should be
    applied in a manner to achieve those objectives. The concepts of
    imposing a duty of disclosure were set forth in Brazil, The
    Adversary Character of Civil Discovery: A Critique and Proposals
    for Change, 31 Vand. L. Rev. 1348 (1978), and Schwarzer, The
    Federal Rules, the Adversary Process, and Discovery Reform, 50 U.
    Pitt. L. Rev. 703, 721-23 (1989).
      The rule is based upon the experience of district courts that
    have required disclosure of some of this information through local
    rules, court-approved standard interrogatories, and standing
    orders. Most have required pretrial disclosure of the kind of
    information described in Rule 26(a)(3). Many have required written
    reports from experts containing information like that specified in
    Rule 26(a)(2)(B). While far more limited, the experience of the few
    state and federal courts that have required pre-discovery exchange
    of core information such as is contemplated in Rule 26(a)(1)
    indicates that savings in time and expense can be achieved,
    particularly if the litigants meet and discuss the issues in the
    case as a predicate for this exchange and if a judge supports the
    process, as by using the results to guide further proceedings in
    the case. Courts in Canada and the United Kingdom have for many
    years required disclosure of certain information without awaiting a
    request from an adversary.
      Paragraph (1). As the functional equivalent of court-ordered
    interrogatories, this paragraph requires early disclosure, without
    need for any request, of four types of information that have been
    customarily secured early in litigation through formal discovery.
    The introductory clause permits the court, by local rule, to exempt
    all or particular types of cases from these disclosure
    requirement[s] or to modify the nature of the information to be
    disclosed. It is expected that courts would, for example, exempt
    cases like Social Security reviews and government collection cases
    in which discovery would not be appropriate or would be unlikely.
    By order the court may eliminate or modify the disclosure
    requirements in a particular case, and similarly the parties,
    unless precluded by order or local rule, can stipulate to
    elimination or modification of the requirements for that case. The
    disclosure obligations specified in paragraph (1) will not be
    appropriate for all cases, and it is expected that changes in these
    obligations will be made by the court or parties when the
    circumstances warrant.
      Authorization of these local variations is, in large measure,
    included in order to accommodate the Civil Justice Reform Act of
    1990, which implicitly directs districts to experiment during the
    study period with differing procedures to reduce the time and
    expense of civil litigation. The civil justice delay and expense
    reduction plans adopted by the courts under the Act differ as to
    the type, form, and timing of disclosures required. Section
    105(c)(1) of the Act calls for a report by the Judicial Conference
    to Congress by December 31, 1995, comparing experience in twenty of
    these courts; and section 105(c)(2)(B) contemplates that some
    changes in the Rules may then be needed. While these studies may
    indicate the desirability of further changes in Rule 26(a)(1),
    these changes probably could not become effective before December
    1998 at the earliest. In the meantime, the present revision puts in
    place a series of disclosure obligations that, unless a court acts
    affirmatively to impose other requirements or indeed to reject all
    such requirements for the present, are designed to eliminate
    certain discovery, help focus the discovery that is needed, and
    facilitate preparation for trial or settlement.
      Subparagraph (A) requires identification of all persons who,
    based on the investigation conducted thus far, are likely to have
    discoverable information relevant to the factual disputes between
    the parties. All persons with such information should be disclosed,
    whether or not their testimony will be supportive of the position
    of the disclosing party. As officers of the court, counsel are
    expected to disclose the identity of those persons who may be used
    by them as witnesses or who, if their potential testimony were
    known, might reasonably be expected to be deposed or called as a
    witness by any of the other parties. Indicating briefly the general
    topics on which such persons have information should not be
    burdensome, and will assist other parties in deciding which
    depositions will actually be needed.
      Subparagraph (B) is included as a substitute for the inquiries
    routinely made about the existence and location of documents and
    other tangible things in the possession, custody, or control of the
    disclosing party. Although, unlike subdivision (a)(3)(C), an
    itemized listing of each exhibit is not required, the disclosure
    should describe and categorize, to the extent identified during the
    initial investigation, the nature and location of potentially
    relevant documents and records, including computerized data and
    other electronically-recorded information, sufficiently to enable
    opposing parties (1) to make an informed decision concerning which
    documents might need to be examined, at least initially, and (2) to
    frame their document requests in a manner likely to avoid squabbles
    resulting from the wording of the requests. As with potential
    witnesses, the requirement for disclosure of documents applies to
    all potentially relevant items then known to the party, whether or
    not supportive of its contentions in the case.
      Unlike subparagraphs (C) and (D), subparagraph (B) does not
    require production of any documents. Of course, in cases involving
    few documents a disclosing party may prefer to provide copies of
    the documents rather than describe them, and the rule is written to
    afford this option to the disclosing party. If, as will be more
    typical, only the description is provided, the other parties are
    expected to obtain the documents desired by proceeding under Rule
    34 or through informal requests. The disclosing party does not, by
    describing documents under subparagraph (B), waive its right to
    object to production on the basis of privilege or work product
    protection, or to assert that the documents are not sufficiently
    relevant to justify the burden or expense of production.
      The initial disclosure requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B)
    are limited to identification of potential evidence "relevant to
    disputed facts alleged with particularity in the pleadings." There
    is no need for a party to identify potential evidence with respect
    to allegations that are admitted. Broad, vague, and conclusory
    allegations sometimes tolerated in notice pleading - for example,
    the assertion that a product with many component parts is defective
    in some unspecified manner - should not impose upon responding
    parties the obligation at that point to search for and identify all
    persons possibly involved in, or all documents affecting, the
    design, manufacture, and assembly of the product. The greater the
    specificity and clarity of the allegations in the pleadings, the
    more complete should be the listing of potential witnesses and
    types of documentary evidence. Although paragraphs (1)(A) and
    (1)(B) by their terms refer to the factual disputes defined in the
    pleadings, the rule contemplates that these issues would be
    informally refined and clarified during the meeting of the parties
    under subdivision (f) and that the disclosure obligations would be
    adjusted in the light of these discussions. The disclosure
    requirements should, in short, be applied with common sense in
    light of the principles of Rule 1, keeping in mind the salutary
    purposes that the rule is intended to accomplish. The litigants
    should not indulge in gamesmanship with respect to the disclosure
    obligations.
      Subparagraph (C) imposes a burden of disclosure that includes the
    functional equivalent of a standing Request for Production under
    Rule 34. A party claiming damages or other monetary relief must, in
    addition to disclosing the calculation of such damages, make
    available the supporting documents for inspection and copying as if
    a request for such materials had been made under Rule 34. This
    obligation applies only with respect to documents then reasonably
    available to it and not privileged or protected as work product.
    Likewise, a party would not be expected to provide a calculation of
    damages which, as in many patent infringement actions, depends on
    information in the possession of another party or person.
      Subparagraph (D) replaces subdivision (b)(2) of Rule 26, and
    provides that liability insurance policies be made available for
    inspection and copying. The last two sentences of that subdivision
    have been omitted as unnecessary, not to signify any change of law.
    The disclosure of insurance information does not thereby render
    such information admissible in evidence. See Rule 411, Federal
    Rules of Evidence. Nor does subparagraph (D) require disclosure of
    applications for insurance, though in particular cases such
    information may be discoverable in accordance with revised
    subdivision (a)(5).
      Unless the court directs a different time, the disclosures
    required by subdivision (a)(1) are to be made at or within 10 days
    after the meeting of the parties under subdivision (f). One of the
    purposes of this meeting is to refine the factual disputes with
    respect to which disclosures should be made under paragraphs (1)(A)
    and (1)(B), particularly if an answer has not been filed by a
    defendant, or, indeed, to afford the parties an opportunity to
    modify by stipulation the timing or scope of these obligations. The
    time of this meeting is generally left to the parties provided it
    is held at least 14 days before a scheduling conference is held or
    before a scheduling order is due under Rule 16(b). In cases in
    which no scheduling conference is held, this will mean that the
    meeting must ordinarily be held within 75 days after a defendant
    has first appeared in the case and hence that the initial
    disclosures would be due no later than 85 days after the first
    appearance of a defendant.
      Before making its disclosures, a party has the obligation under
    subdivision (g)(1) to make a reasonable inquiry into the facts of
    the case. The rule does not demand an exhaustive investigation at
    this stage of the case, but one that is reasonable under the
    circumstances, focusing on the facts that are alleged with
    particularity in the pleadings. The type of investigation that can
    be expected at this point will vary based upon such factors as the
    number and complexity of the issues; the location, nature, number,
    and availability of potentially relevant witnesses and documents;
    the extent of past working relationships between the attorney and
    the client, particularly in handling related or similar litigation;
    and of course how long the party has to conduct an investigation,
    either before or after filing of the case. As provided in the last
    sentence of subdivision (a)(1), a party is not excused from the
    duty of disclosure merely because its investigation is incomplete.
    The party should make its initial disclosures based on the
    pleadings and the information then reasonably available to it. As
    its investigation continues and as the issues in the pleadings are
    clarified, it should supplement its disclosures as required by
    subdivision (e)(1). A party is not relieved from its obligation of
    disclosure merely because another party has not made its
    disclosures or has made an inadequate disclosure.
      It will often be desirable, particularly if the claims made in
    the complaint are broadly stated, for the parties to have their
    Rule 26(f) meeting early in the case, perhaps before a defendant
    has answered the complaint or had time to conduct other than a
    cursory investigation. In such circumstances, in order to
    facilitate more meaningful and useful initial disclosures, they can
    and should stipulate to a period of more than 10 days after the
    meeting in which to make these disclosures, at least for defendants
    who had no advance notice of the potential litigation. A
    stipulation at an early meeting affording such a defendant at least
    60 days after receiving the complaint in which to make its
    disclosures under subdivision (a)(1) - a period that is two weeks
    longer than the time formerly specified for responding to
    interrogatories served with a complaint - should be adequate and
    appropriate in most cases.
      Paragraph (2). This paragraph imposes an additional duty to
    disclose information regarding expert testimony sufficiently in
    advance of trial that opposing parties have a reasonable
    opportunity to prepare for effective cross examination and perhaps
    arrange for expert testimony from other witnesses. Normally the
    court should prescribe a time for these disclosures in a scheduling
    order under Rule 16(b), and in most cases the party with the burden
    of proof on an issue should disclose its expert testimony on that
    issue before other parties are required to make their disclosures
    with respect to that issue. In the absence of such a direction, the
    disclosures are to be made by all parties at least 90 days before
    the trial date or the date by which the case is to be ready for
    trial, except that an additional 30 days is allowed (unless the
    court specifies another time) for disclosure of expert testimony to
    be used solely to contradict or rebut the testimony that may be
    presented by another party's expert. For a discussion of procedures
    that have been used to enhance the reliability of expert testimony,
    see M. Graham, Expert Witness Testimony and the Federal Rules of
    Evidence: Insuring Adequate Assurance of Trustworthiness, 1986 U.
    Ill. L. Rev. 90.
      Paragraph (2)(B) requires that persons retained or specially
    employed to provide expert testimony, or whose duties as an
    employee of the party regularly involve the giving of expert
    testimony, must prepare a detailed and complete written report,
    stating the testimony the witness is expected to present during
    direct examination, together with the reasons therefor. The
    information disclosed under the former rule in answering
    interrogatories about the "substance" of expert testimony was
    frequently so sketchy and vague that it rarely dispensed with the
    need to depose the expert and often was even of little help in
    preparing for a deposition of the witness. Revised Rule 37(c)(1)
    provides an incentive for full disclosure; namely, that a party
    will not ordinarily be permitted to use on direct examination any
    expert testimony not so disclosed. Rule 26(a)(2)(B) does not
    preclude counsel from providing assistance to experts in preparing
    the reports, and indeed, with experts such as automobile mechanics,
    this assistance may be needed. Nevertheless, the report, which is
    intended to set forth the substance of the direct examination,
    should be written in a manner that reflects the testimony to be
    given by the witness and it must be signed by the witness.
      The report is to disclose the data and other information
    considered by the expert and any exhibits or charts that summarize
    or support the expert's opinions. Given this obligation of
    disclosure, litigants should no longer be able to argue that
    materials furnished to their experts to be used in forming their
    opinions - whether or not ultimately relied upon by the expert -
    are privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure when such
    persons are testifying or being deposed.
      Revised subdivision (b)(4)(A) authorizes the deposition of expert
    witnesses. Since depositions of experts required to prepare a
    written report may be taken only after the report has been served,
    the length of the deposition of such experts should be reduced, and
    in many cases the report may eliminate the need for a deposition.
    Revised subdivision (e)(1) requires disclosure of any material
    changes made in the opinions of an expert from whom a report is
    required, whether the changes are in the written report or in
    testimony given at a deposition.
      For convenience, this rule and revised Rule 30 continue to use
    the term "expert" to refer to those persons who will testify under
    Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence with respect to
    scientific, technical, and other specialized matters. The
    requirement of a written report in paragraph (2)(B), however,
    applies only to those experts who are retained or specially
    employed to provide such testimony in the case or whose duties as
    an employee of a party regularly involve the giving of such
    testimony. A treating physician, for example, can be deposed or
    called to testify at trial without any requirement for a written
    report. By local rule, order, or written stipulation, the
    requirement of a written report may be waived for particular
    experts or imposed upon additional persons who will provide
    opinions under Rule 702.
      Paragraph (3). This paragraph imposes an additional duty to
    disclose, without any request, information customarily needed in
    final preparation for trial. These disclosures are to be made in
    accordance with schedules adopted by the court under Rule 16(b) or
    by special order. If no such schedule is directed by the court, the
    disclosures are to be made at least 30 days before commencement of
    the trial. By its terms, rule 26(a)(3) does not require disclosure
    of evidence to be used solely for impeachment purposes; however,
    disclosure of such evidence - as well as other items relating to
    conduct of trial - may be required by local rule or a pretrial
    order.
      Subparagraph (A) requires the parties to designate the persons
    whose testimony they may present as substantive evidence at trial,
    whether in person or by deposition. Those who will probably be
    called as witnesses should be listed separately from those who are
    not likely to be called but who are being listed in order to
    preserve the right to do so if needed because of developments
    during trial. Revised Rule 37(c)(1) provides that only persons so
    listed may be used at trial to present substantive evidence. This
    restriction does not apply unless the omission was "without
    substantial justification" and hence would not bar an unlisted
    witness if the need for such testimony is based upon developments
    during trial that could not reasonably have been anticipated -
    e.g., a change of testimony.
      Listing a witness does not obligate the party to secure the
    attendance of the person at trial, but should preclude the party
    from objecting if the person is called to testify by another party
    who did not list the person as a witness.
      Subparagraph (B) requires the party to indicate which of these
    potential witnesses will be presented by deposition at trial. A
    party expecting to use at trial a deposition not recorded by
    stenographic means is required by revised Rule 32 to provide the
    court with a transcript of the pertinent portions of such
    depositions. This rule requires that copies of the transcript of a
    nonstenographic deposition be provided to other parties in advance
    of trial for verification, an obvious concern since counsel often
    utilize their own personnel to prepare transcripts from audio or
    video tapes. By order or local rule, the court may require that
    parties designate the particular portions of stenographic
    depositions to be used at trial.
      Subparagraph (C) requires disclosure of exhibits, including
    summaries (whether to be offered in lieu of other documentary
    evidence or to be used as an aid in understanding such evidence),
    that may be offered as substantive evidence. The rule requires a
    separate listing of each such exhibit, though it should permit
    voluminous items of a similar or standardized character to be
    described by meaningful categories. For example, unless the court
    has otherwise directed, a series of vouchers might be shown
    collectively as a single exhibit with their starting and ending
    dates. As with witnesses, the exhibits that will probably be
    offered are to be listed separately from those which are unlikely
    to be offered but which are listed in order to preserve the right
    to do so if needed because of developments during trial. Under
    revised Rule 37(c)(1) the court can permit use of unlisted
    documents the need for which could not reasonably have been
    anticipated in advance of trial.
      Upon receipt of these final pretrial disclosures, other parties
    have 14 days (unless a different time is specified by the court) to
    disclose any objections they wish to preserve to the usability of
    the deposition testimony or to the admissibility of the documentary
    evidence (other than under Rules 402 and 403 of the Federal Rules
    of Evidence). Similar provisions have become commonplace either in
    pretrial orders or by local rules, and significantly expedite the
    presentation of evidence at trial, as well as eliminate the need to
    have available witnesses to provide "foundation" testimony for most
    items of documentary evidence. The listing of a potential objection
    does not constitute the making of that objection or require the
    court to rule on the objection; rather, it preserves the right of
    the party to make the objection when and as appropriate during
    trial. The court may, however, elect to treat the listing as a
    motion "in limine" and rule upon the objections in advance of trial
    to the extent appropriate.
      The time specified in the rule for the final pretrial disclosures
    is relatively close to the trial date. The objective is to
    eliminate the time and expense in making these disclosures of
    evidence and objections in those cases that settle shortly before
    trial, while affording a reasonable time for final preparation for
    trial in those cases that do not settle. In many cases, it will be
    desirable for the court in a scheduling or pretrial order to set an
    earlier time for disclosures of evidence and provide more time for
    disclosing potential objections.
      Paragraph (4). This paragraph prescribes the form of disclosures.
    A signed written statement is required, reminding the parties and
    counsel of the solemnity of the obligations imposed; and the
    signature on the initial or pretrial disclosure is a certification
    under subdivision (g)(1) that it is complete and correct as of the
    time when made. Consistent with Rule 5(d), these disclosures are to
    be filed with the court unless otherwise directed. It is
    anticipated that many courts will direct that expert reports
    required under paragraph (2)(B) not be filed until needed in
    connection with a motion or for trial.
      Paragraph (5). This paragraph is revised to take note of the
    availability of revised Rule 45 for inspection from non-parties of
    documents and premises without the need for a deposition.
      Subdivision (b). This subdivision is revised in several respects.
    First, former paragraph (1) is subdivided into two paragraphs for
    ease of reference and to avoid renumbering of paragraphs (3) and
    (4). Textual changes are then made in new paragraph (2) to enable
    the court to keep tighter rein on the extent of discovery. The
    information explosion of recent decades has greatly increased both
    the potential cost of wide-ranging discovery and the potential for
    discovery to be used as an instrument for delay or oppression.
    Amendments to Rules 30, 31, and 33 place presumptive limits on the
    number of depositions and interrogatories, subject to leave of
    court to pursue additional discovery. The revisions in Rule
    26(b)(2) are intended to provide the court with broader discretion
    to impose additional restrictions on the scope and extent of
    discovery and to authorize courts that develop case tracking
    systems based on the complexity of cases to increase or decrease by
    local rule the presumptive number of depositions and
    interrogatories allowed in particular types or classifications of
    cases. The revision also dispels any doubt as to the power of the
    court to impose limitations on the length of depositions under Rule
    30 or on the number of requests for admission under Rule 36.
      Second, former paragraph (2), relating to insurance, has been
    relocated as part of the required initial disclosures under
    subdivision (a)(1)(D), and revised to provide for disclosure of the
    policy itself.
      Third, paragraph (4)(A) is revised to provide that experts who
    are expected to be witnesses will be subject to deposition prior to
    trial, conforming the norm stated in the rule to the actual
    practice followed in most courts, in which depositions of experts
    have become standard. Concerns regarding the expense of such
    depositions should be mitigated by the fact that the expert's fees
    for the deposition will ordinarily be borne by the party taking the
    deposition. The requirement under subdivision (a)(2)(B) of a
    complete and detailed report of the expected testimony of certain
    forensic experts may, moreover, eliminate the need for some such
    depositions or at least reduce the length of the depositions.
    Accordingly, the deposition of an expert required by subdivision
    (a)(2)(B) to provide a written report may be taken only after the
    report has been served.
      Paragraph (4)(C), bearing on compensation of experts, is revised
    to take account of the changes in paragraph (4)(A).
      Paragraph (5) is a new provision. A party must notify other
    parties if it is withholding materials otherwise subject to
    disclosure under the rule or pursuant to a discovery request
    because it is asserting a claim of privilege or work product
    protection. To withhold materials without such notice is contrary
    to the rule, subjects the party to sanctions under Rule 37(b)(2),
    and may be viewed as a waiver of the privilege or protection.
      The party must also provide sufficient information to enable
    other parties to evaluate the applicability of the claimed
    privilege or protection. Although the person from whom the
    discovery is sought decides whether to claim a privilege or
    protection, the court ultimately decides whether, if this claim is
    challenged, the privilege or protection applies. Providing
    information pertinent to the applicability of the privilege or
    protection should reduce the need for in camera examination of the
    documents.
      The rule does not attempt to define for each case what
    information must be provided when a party asserts a claim of
    privilege or work product protection. Details concerning time,
    persons, general subject matter, etc., may be appropriate if only a
    few items are withheld, but may be unduly burdensome when
    voluminous documents are claimed to be privileged or protected,
    particularly if the items can be described by categories. A party
    can seek relief through a protective order under subdivision (c) if
    compliance with the requirement for providing this information
    would be an unreasonable burden. In rare circumstances some of the
    pertinent information affecting applicability of the claim, such as
    the identity of the client, may itself be privileged; the rule
    provides that such information need not be disclosed.
      The obligation to provide pertinent information concerning
    withheld privileged materials applies only to items "otherwise
    discoverable." If a broad discovery request is made - for example,
    for all documents of a particular type during a twenty year period -
     and the responding party believes in good faith that production
    of documents for more than the past three years would be unduly
    burdensome, it should make its objection to the breadth of the
    request and, with respect to the documents generated in that three
    year period, produce the unprivileged documents and describe those
    withheld under the claim of privilege. If the court later rules
    that documents for a seven year period are properly discoverable,
    the documents for the additional four years should then be either
    produced (if not privileged) or described (if claimed to be
    privileged).
      Subdivision (c). The revision requires that before filing a
    motion for a protective order the movant must confer - either in
    person or by telephone - with the other affected parties in a good
    faith effort to resolve the discovery dispute without the need for
    court intervention. If the movant is unable to get opposing parties
    even to discuss the matter, the efforts in attempting to arrange
    such a conference should be indicated in the certificate.
      Subdivision (d). This subdivision is revised to provide that
    formal discovery - as distinguished from interviews of potential
    witnesses and other informal discovery - not commence until the
    parties have met and conferred as required by subdivision (f).
    Discovery can begin earlier if authorized under Rule 30(a)(2)(C)
    (deposition of person about to leave the country) or by local rule,
    order, or stipulation. This will be appropriate in some cases, such
    as those involving requests for a preliminary injunction or motions
    challenging personal jurisdiction. If a local rule exempts any
    types of cases in which discovery may be needed from the
    requirement of a meeting under Rule 26(f), it should specify when
    discovery may commence in those cases.
      The meeting of counsel is to take place as soon as practicable
    and in any event at least 14 days before the date of the scheduling
    conference under Rule 16(b) or the date a scheduling order is due
    under Rule 16(b). The court can assure that discovery is not unduly
    delayed either by entering a special order or by setting the case
    for a scheduling conference.
      Subdivision (e). This subdivision is revised to provide that the
    requirement for supplementation applies to all disclosures required
    by subdivisions (a)(1)-(3). Like the former rule, the duty, while
    imposed on a "party," applies whether the corrective information is
    learned by the client or by the attorney. Supplementations need not
    be made as each new item of information is learned but should be
    made at appropriate intervals during the discovery period, and with
    special promptness as the trial date approaches. It may be useful
    for the scheduling order to specify the time or times when
    supplementations should be made.
      The revision also clarifies that the obligation to supplement
    responses to formal discovery requests applies to interrogatories,
    requests for production, and requests for admissions, but not
    ordinarily to deposition testimony. However, with respect to
    experts from whom a written report is required under subdivision
    (a)(2)(B), changes in the opinions expressed by the expert whether
    in the report or at a subsequent deposition are subject to a duty
    of supplemental disclosure under subdivision (e)(1).
      The obligation to supplement disclosures and discovery responses
    applies whenever a party learns that its prior disclosures or
    responses are in some material respect incomplete or incorrect.
    There is, however, no obligation to provide supplemental or
    corrective information that has been otherwise made known to the
    parties in writing or during the discovery process, as when a
    witness not previously disclosed is identified during the taking of
    a deposition or when an expert during a deposition corrects
    information contained in an earlier report.
      Subdivision (f). This subdivision was added in 1980 to provide a
    party threatened with abusive discovery with a special means for
    obtaining judicial intervention other than through discrete motions
    under Rules 26(c) and 37(a). The amendment envisioned a two-step
    process: first, the parties would attempt to frame a mutually
    agreeable plan; second, the court would hold a "discovery
    conference" and then enter an order establishing a schedule and
    limitations for the conduct of discovery. It was contemplated that
    the procedure, an elective one triggered on request of a party,
    would be used in special cases rather than as a routine matter. As
    expected, the device has been used only sparingly in most courts,
    and judicial controls over the discovery process have ordinarily
    been imposed through scheduling orders under Rule 16(b) or through
    rulings on discovery motions.
      The provisions relating to a conference with the court are
    removed from subdivision (f). This change does not signal any
    lessening of the importance of judicial supervision. Indeed, there
    is a greater need for early judicial involvement to consider the
    scope and timing of the disclosure requirements of Rule 26(a) and
    the presumptive limits on discovery imposed under these rules or by
    local rules. Rather, the change is made because the provisions
    addressing the use of conferences with the court to control
    discovery are more properly included in Rule 16, which is being
    revised to highlight the court's powers regarding the discovery
    process.
      The desirability of some judicial control of discovery can hardly
    be doubted. Rule 16, as revised, requires that the court set a time
    for completion of discovery and authorizes various other orders
    affecting the scope, timing, and extent of discovery and
    disclosures. Before entering such orders, the court should consider
    the views of the parties, preferably by means of a conference, but
    at the least through written submissions. Moreover, it is desirable
    that the parties' proposals regarding discovery be developed
    through a process where they meet in person, informally explore the
    nature and basis of the issues, and discuss how discovery can be
    conducted most efficiently and economically.
      As noted above, former subdivision (f) envisioned the development
    of proposed discovery plans as an optional procedure to be used in
    relatively few cases. The revised rule directs that in all cases
    not exempted by local rule or special order the litigants must meet
    in person and plan for discovery. Following this meeting, the
    parties submit to the court their proposals for a discovery plan
    and can begin formal discovery. Their report will assist the court
    in seeing that the timing and scope of disclosures under revised
    Rule 26(a) and the limitations on the extent of discovery under
    these rules and local rules are tailored to the circumstances of
    the particular case.
      To assure that the court has the litigants' proposals before
    deciding on a scheduling order and that the commencement of
    discovery is not delayed unduly, the rule provides that the meeting
    of the parties take place as soon as practicable and in any event
    at least 14 days before a scheduling conference is held or before a
    scheduling order is due under Rule 16(b). (Rule 16(b) requires that
    a scheduling order be entered within 90 days after the first
    appearance of a defendant or, if earlier, within 120 days after the
    complaint has been served on any defendant.) The obligation to
    participate in the planning process is imposed on all parties that
    have appeared in the case, including defendants who, because of a
    pending Rule 12 motion, may not have yet filed an answer in the
    case. Each such party should attend the meeting, either through one
    of its attorneys or in person if unrepresented. If more parties are
    joined or appear after the initial meeting, an additional meeting
    may be desirable.
      Subdivision (f) describes certain matters that should be
    accomplished at the meeting and included in the proposed discovery
    plan. This listing does not exclude consideration of other
    subjects, such as the time when any dispositive motions should be
    filed and when the case should be ready for trial.
      The parties are directed under subdivision (a)(1) to make the
    disclosures required by that subdivision at or within 10 days after
    this meeting. In many cases the parties should use the meeting to
    exchange, discuss, and clarify their respective disclosures. In
    other cases, it may be more useful if the disclosures are delayed
    until after the parties have discussed at the meeting the claims
    and defenses in order to define the issues with respect to which
    the initial disclosures should be made. As discussed in the Notes
    to subdivision (a)(1), the parties may also need to consider
    whether a stipulation extending this 10-day period would be
    appropriate, as when a defendant would otherwise have less than 60
    days after being served in which to make its initial disclosure.
    The parties should also discuss at the meeting what additional
    information, although not subject to the disclosure requirements,
    can be made available informally without the necessity for formal
    discovery requests.
      The report is to be submitted to the court within 10 days after
    the meeting and should not be difficult to prepare. In most cases
    counsel should be able to agree that one of them will be
    responsible for its preparation and submission to the court. Form
    35 has been added in the Appendix to the Rules, both to illustrate
    the type of report that is contemplated and to serve as a checklist
    for the meeting.
      The litigants are expected to attempt in good faith to agree on
    the contents of the proposed discovery plan. If they cannot agree
    on all aspects of the plan, their report to the court should
    indicate the competing proposals of the parties on those items, as
    well as the matters on which they agree. Unfortunately, there may
    be cases in which, because of disagreements about time or place or
    for other reasons, the meeting is not attended by all parties or,
    indeed, no meeting takes place. In such situations, the report - or
    reports - should describe the circumstances and the court may need
    to consider sanctions under Rule 37(g).
      By local rule or special order, the court can exempt particular
    cases or types of cases from the meet-and-confer requirement of
    subdivision (f). In general this should include any types of cases
    which are exempted by local rule from the requirement for a
    scheduling order under Rule 16(b), such as cases in which there
    will be no discovery (e.g., bankruptcy appeals and reviews of
    social security determinations). In addition, the court may want to
    exempt cases in which discovery is rarely needed (e.g., government
    collection cases and proceedings to enforce administrative
    summonses) or in which a meeting of the parties might be
    impracticable (e.g., actions by unrepresented prisoners). Note that
    if a court exempts from the requirements for a meeting any types of
    cases in which discovery may be needed, it should indicate when
    discovery may commence in those cases.
      Subdivision (g). Paragraph (1) is added to require signatures on
    disclosures, a requirement that parallels the provisions of
    paragraph (2) with respect to discovery requests, responses, and
    objections. The provisions of paragraph (3) have been modified to
    be consistent with Rules 37(a)(4) and 37(c)(1); in combination,
    these rules establish sanctions for violation of the rules
    regarding disclosures and discovery matters. Amended Rule 11 no
    longer applies to such violations.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      Purposes of amendments. The Rule 26(a)(1) initial disclosure
    provisions are amended to establish a nationally uniform practice.
    The scope of the disclosure obligation is narrowed to cover only
    information that the disclosing party may use to support its
    position. In addition, the rule exempts specified categories of
    proceedings from initial disclosure, and permits a party who
    contends that disclosure is not appropriate in the circumstances of
    the case to present its objections to the court, which must then
    determine whether disclosure should be made. Related changes are
    made in Rules 26(d) and (f).
      The initial disclosure requirements added by the 1993 amendments
    permitted local rules directing that disclosure would not be
    required or altering its operation. The inclusion of the "opt out"
    provision reflected the strong opposition to initial disclosure
    felt in some districts, and permitted experimentation with
    differing disclosure rules in those districts that were favorable
    to disclosure. The local option also recognized that - partly in
    response to the first publication in 1991 of a proposed disclosure
    rule - many districts had adopted a variety of disclosure programs
    under the aegis of the Civil Justice Reform Act. It was hoped that
    developing experience under a variety of disclosure systems would
    support eventual refinement of a uniform national disclosure
    practice. In addition, there was hope that local experience could
    identify categories of actions in which disclosure is not useful.
      A striking array of local regimes in fact emerged for disclosure
    and related features introduced in 1993. See D. Stienstra,
    Implementation of Disclosure in United States District Courts, With
    Specific Attention to Courts' Responses to Selected Amendments to
    Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 (Federal Judicial Center, March
    30, 1998) (describing and categorizing local regimes). In its final
    report to Congress on the CJRA experience, the Judicial Conference
    recommended reexamination of the need for national uniformity,
    particularly in regard to initial disclosure. Judicial Conference,
    Alternative Proposals for Reduction of Cost and Delay: Assessment
    of Principles, Guidelines and Techniques, 175 F.R.D. 62, 98 (1997).
      At the Committee's request, the Federal Judicial Center undertook
    a survey in 1997 to develop information on current disclosure and
    discovery practices. See T. Willging, J. Shapard, D. Stienstra & D.
    Miletich, Discovery and Disclosure Practice, Problems, and
    Proposals for Change (Federal Judicial Center, 1997). In addition,
    the Committee convened two conferences on discovery involving
    lawyers from around the country and received reports and
    recommendations on possible discovery amendments from a number of
    bar groups. Papers and other proceedings from the second conference
    are published in 39 Boston Col. L. Rev. 517-840 (1998).
      The Committee has discerned widespread support for national
    uniformity. Many lawyers have experienced difficulty in coping with
    divergent disclosure and other practices as they move from one
    district to another. Lawyers surveyed by the Federal Judicial
    Center ranked adoption of a uniform national disclosure rule second
    among proposed rule changes (behind increased availability of
    judges to resolve discovery disputes) as a means to reduce
    litigation expenses without interfering with fair outcomes.
    Discovery and Disclosure Practice, supra, at 44-45. National
    uniformity is also a central purpose of the Rules Enabling Act of
    1934, as amended, 28 U.S.C. Secs. 2072-2077.
      These amendments restore national uniformity to disclosure
    practice. Uniformity is also restored to other aspects of discovery
    by deleting most of the provisions authorizing local rules that
    vary the number of permitted discovery events or the length of
    depositions. Local rule options are also deleted from Rules 26(d)
    and (f).
      Subdivision (a)(1). The amendments remove the authority to alter
    or opt out of the national disclosure requirements by local rule,
    invalidating not only formal local rules but also informal
    "standing" orders of an individual judge or court that purport to
    create exemptions from - or limit or expand - the disclosure
    provided under the national rule. See Rule 83. Case-specific orders
    remain proper, however, and are expressly required if a party
    objects that initial disclosure is not appropriate in the
    circumstances of the action. Specified categories of proceedings
    are excluded from initial disclosure under subdivision (a)(1)(E).
    In addition, the parties can stipulate to forgo disclosure, as was
    true before. But even in a case excluded by subdivision (a)(1)(E)
    or in which the parties stipulate to bypass disclosure, the court
    can order exchange of similar information in managing the action
    under Rule 16.
      The initial disclosure obligation of subdivisions (a)(1)(A) and
    (B) has been narrowed to identification of witnesses and documents
    that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or
    defenses. "Use" includes any use at a pretrial conference, to
    support a motion, or at trial. The disclosure obligation is also
    triggered by intended use in discovery, apart from use to respond
    to a discovery request; use of a document to question a witness
    during a deposition is a common example. The disclosure obligation
    attaches both to witnesses and documents a party intends to use and
    also to witnesses and to documents the party intends to use if - in
    the language of Rule 26(a)(3) - "the need arises."
      A party is no longer obligated to disclose witnesses or
    documents, whether favorable or unfavorable, that it does not
    intend to use. The obligation to disclose information the party may
    use connects directly to the exclusion sanction of Rule 37(c)(1).
    Because the disclosure obligation is limited to material that the
    party may use, it is no longer tied to particularized allegations
    in the pleadings. Subdivision (e)(1), which is unchanged, requires
    supplementation if information later acquired would have been
    subject to the disclosure requirement. As case preparation
    continues, a party must supplement its disclosures when it
    determines that it may use a witness or document that it did not
    previously intend to use.
      The disclosure obligation applies to "claims and defenses," and
    therefore requires a party to disclose information it may use to
    support its denial or rebuttal of the allegations, claim, or
    defense of another party. It thereby bolsters the requirements of
    Rule 11(b)(4), which authorizes denials "warranted on the
    evidence," and disclosure should include the identity of any
    witness or document that the disclosing party may use to support
    such denials.
      Subdivision (a)(3) presently excuses pretrial disclosure of
    information solely for impeachment. Impeachment information is
    similarly excluded from the initial disclosure requirement.
      Subdivisions (a)(1)(C) and (D) are not changed. Should a case be
    exempted from initial disclosure by Rule 26(a)(1)(E) or by
    agreement or order, the insurance information described by
    subparagraph (D) should be subject to discovery, as it would have
    been under the principles of former Rule 26(b)(2), which was added
    in 1970 and deleted in 1993 as redundant in light of the new
    initial disclosure obligation.
      New subdivision (a)(1)(E) excludes eight specified categories of
    proceedings from initial disclosure. The objective of this listing
    is to identify cases in which there is likely to be little or no
    discovery, or in which initial disclosure appears unlikely to
    contribute to the effective development of the case. The list was
    developed after a review of the categories excluded by local rules
    in various districts from the operation of Rule 16(b) and the
    conference requirements of subdivision (f). Subdivision (a)(1)(E)
    refers to categories of "proceedings" rather than categories of
    "actions" because some might not properly be labeled "actions."
    Case designations made by the parties or the clerk's office at the
    time of filing do not control application of the exemptions. The
    descriptions in the rule are generic and are intended to be
    administered by the parties - and, when needed, the courts - with
    the flexibility needed to adapt to gradual evolution in the types
    of proceedings that fall within these general categories. The
    exclusion of an action for review on an administrative record, for
    example, is intended to reach a proceeding that is framed as an
    "appeal" based solely on an administrative record. The exclusion
    should not apply to a proceeding in a form that commonly permits
    admission of new evidence to supplement the record. Item (vii),
    excluding a proceeding ancillary to proceedings in other courts,
    does not refer to bankruptcy proceedings; application of the Civil
    Rules to bankruptcy proceedings is determined by the Bankruptcy
    Rules.
      Subdivision (a)(1)(E) is likely to exempt a substantial
    proportion of the cases in most districts from the initial
    disclosure requirement. Based on 1996 and 1997 case filing
    statistics, Federal Judicial Center staff estimate that,
    nationwide, these categories total approximately one-third of all
    civil filings.
      The categories of proceedings listed in subdivision (a)(1)(E) are
    also exempted from the subdivision (f) conference requirement and
    from the subdivision (d) moratorium on discovery. Although there is
    no restriction on commencement of discovery in these cases, it is
    not expected that this opportunity will often lead to abuse since
    there is likely to be little or no discovery in most such cases.
    Should a defendant need more time to respond to discovery requests
    filed at the beginning of an exempted action, it can seek relief by
    motion under Rule 26(c) if the plaintiff is unwilling to defer the
    due date by agreement.
      Subdivision (a)(1)(E)'s enumeration of exempt categories is
    exclusive. Although a case-specific order can alter or excuse
    initial disclosure, local rules or "standing" orders that purport
    to create general exemptions are invalid. See Rule 83.
      The time for initial disclosure is extended to 14 days after the
    subdivision (f) conference unless the court orders otherwise. This
    change is integrated with corresponding changes requiring that the
    subdivision (f) conference be held 21 days before the Rule 16(b)
    scheduling conference or scheduling order, and that the report on
    the subdivision (f) conference be submitted to the court 14 days
    after the meeting. These changes provide a more orderly opportunity
    for the parties to review the disclosures, and for the court to
    consider the report. In many instances, the subdivision (f)
    conference and the effective preparation of the case would benefit
    from disclosure before the conference, and earlier disclosure is
    encouraged.
      The presumptive disclosure date does not apply if a party objects
    to initial disclosure during the subdivision (f) conference and
    states its objection in the subdivision (f) discovery plan. The
    right to object to initial disclosure is not intended to afford
    parties an opportunity to "opt out" of disclosure unilaterally. It
    does provide an opportunity for an objecting party to present to
    the court its position that disclosure would be "inappropriate in
    the circumstances of the action." Making the objection permits the
    objecting party to present the question to the judge before any
    party is required to make disclosure. The court must then rule on
    the objection and determine what disclosures - if any - should be
    made. Ordinarily, this determination would be included in the Rule
    16(b) scheduling order, but the court could handle the matter in a
    different fashion. Even when circumstances warrant suspending some
    disclosure obligations, others - such as the damages and insurance
    information called for by subdivisions (a)(1)(C) and (D) - may
    continue to be appropriate.
      The presumptive disclosure date is also inapplicable to a party
    who is "first served or otherwise joined" after the subdivision (f)
    conference. This phrase refers to the date of service of a claim on
    a party in a defensive posture (such as a defendant or third-party
    defendant), and the date of joinder of a party added as a claimant
    or an intervenor. Absent court order or stipulation, a new party
    has 30 days in which to make its initial disclosures. But it is
    expected that later-added parties will ordinarily be treated the
    same as the original parties when the original parties have
    stipulated to forgo initial disclosure, or the court has ordered
    disclosure in a modified form.
      Subdivision (a)(3). The amendment to Rule 5(d) forbids filing
    disclosures under subdivisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) until they are
    used in the proceeding, and this change is reflected in an
    amendment to subdivision (a)(4). Disclosures under subdivision
    (a)(3), however, may be important to the court in connection with
    the final pretrial conference or otherwise in preparing for trial.
    The requirement that objections to certain matters be filed points
    up the court's need to be provided with these materials.
    Accordingly, the requirement that subdivision (a)(3) materials be
    filed has been moved from subdivision (a)(4) to subdivision (a)(3),
    and it has also been made clear that they - and any objections -
    should be filed "promptly."
      Subdivision (a)(4). The filing requirement has been removed from
    this subdivision. Rule 5(d) has been amended to provide that
    disclosures under subdivisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) must not be filed
    until used in the proceeding. Subdivision (a)(3) has been amended
    to require that the disclosures it directs, and objections to them,
    be filed promptly. Subdivision (a)(4) continues to require that all
    disclosures under subdivisions (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) be in
    writing, signed, and served.
      "Shall" is replaced by "must" under the program to conform
    amended rules to current style conventions when there is no
    ambiguity.
      Subdivision (b)(1). In 1978, the Committee published for comment
    a proposed amendment, suggested by the Section of Litigation of the
    American Bar Association, to refine the scope of discovery by
    deleting the "subject matter" language. This proposal was
    withdrawn, and the Committee has since then made other changes in
    the discovery rules to address concerns about overbroad discovery.
    Concerns about costs and delay of discovery have persisted
    nonetheless, and other bar groups have repeatedly renewed similar
    proposals for amendment to this subdivision to delete the "subject
    matter" language. Nearly one-third of the lawyers surveyed in 1997
    by the Federal Judicial Center endorsed narrowing the scope of
    discovery as a means of reducing litigation expense without
    interfering with fair case resolutions. Discovery and Disclosure
    Practice, supra, at 44-45 (1997). The Committee has heard that in
    some instances, particularly cases involving large quantities of
    discovery, parties seek to justify discovery requests that sweep
    far beyond the claims and defenses of the parties on the ground
    that they nevertheless have a bearing on the "subject matter"
    involved in the action.
      The amendments proposed for subdivision (b)(1) include one
    element of these earlier proposals but also differ from these
    proposals in significant ways. The similarity is that the
    amendments describe the scope of party-controlled discovery in
    terms of matter relevant to the claim or defense of any party. The
    court, however, retains authority to order discovery of any matter
    relevant to the subject matter involved in the action for good
    cause. The amendment is designed to involve the court more actively
    in regulating the breadth of sweeping or contentious discovery. The
    Committee has been informed repeatedly by lawyers that involvement
    of the court in managing discovery is an important method of
    controlling problems of inappropriately broad discovery. Increasing
    the availability of judicial officers to resolve discovery disputes
    and increasing court management of discovery were both strongly
    endorsed by the attorneys surveyed by the Federal Judicial Center.
    See Discovery and Disclosure Practice, supra, at 44. Under the
    amended provisions, if there is an objection that discovery goes
    beyond material relevant to the parties' claims or defenses, the
    court would become involved to determine whether the discovery is
    relevant to the claims or defenses and, if not, whether good cause
    exists for authorizing it so long as it is relevant to the subject
    matter of the action. The good-cause standard warranting broader
    discovery is meant to be flexible.
      The Committee intends that the parties and the court focus on the
    actual claims and defenses involved in the action. The dividing
    line between information relevant to the claims and defenses and
    that relevant only to the subject matter of the action cannot be
    defined with precision. A variety of types of information not
    directly pertinent to the incident in suit could be relevant to the
    claims or defenses raised in a given action. For example, other
    incidents of the same type, or involving the same product, could be
    properly discoverable under the revised standard. Information about
    organizational arrangements or filing systems of a party could be
    discoverable if likely to yield or lead to the discovery of
    admissible information. Similarly, information that could be used
    to impeach a likely witness, although not otherwise relevant to the
    claims or defenses, might be properly discoverable. In each
    instance, the determination whether such information is
    discoverable because it is relevant to the claims or defenses
    depends on the circumstances of the pending action.
      The rule change signals to the court that it has the authority to
    confine discovery to the claims and defenses asserted in the
    pleadings, and signals to the parties that they have no entitlement
    to discovery to develop new claims or defenses that are not already
    identified in the pleadings. In general, it is hoped that
    reasonable lawyers can cooperate to manage discovery without the
    need for judicial intervention. When judicial intervention is
    invoked, the actual scope of discovery should be determined
    according to the reasonable needs of the action. The court may
    permit broader discovery in a particular case depending on the
    circumstances of the case, the nature of the claims and defenses,
    and the scope of the discovery requested.
      The amendments also modify the provision regarding discovery of
    information not admissible in evidence. As added in 1946, this
    sentence was designed to make clear that otherwise relevant
    material could not be withheld because it was hearsay or otherwise
    inadmissible. The Committee was concerned that the "reasonably
    calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence"
    standard set forth in this sentence might swallow any other
    limitation on the scope of discovery. Accordingly, this sentence
    has been amended to clarify that information must be relevant to be
    discoverable, even though inadmissible, and that discovery of such
    material is permitted if reasonably calculated to lead to the
    discovery of admissible evidence. As used here, "relevant" means
    within the scope of discovery as defined in this subdivision, and
    it would include information relevant to the subject matter
    involved in the action if the court has ordered discovery to that
    limit based on a showing of good cause.
      Finally, a sentence has been added calling attention to the
    limitations of subdivision (b)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii). These
    limitations apply to discovery that is otherwise within the scope
    of subdivision (b)(1). The Committee has been told repeatedly that
    courts have not implemented these limitations with the vigor that
    was contemplated. See 8 Federal Practice & Procedure Sec. 2008.1 at
    121. This otherwise redundant cross-reference has been added to
    emphasize the need for active judicial use of subdivision (b)(2) to
    control excessive discovery. Cf. Crawford-El v. Britton, 118 S. Ct.
    1584, 1597 (1998) (quoting Rule 26(b)(2)(iii) and stating that
    "Rule 26 vests the trial judge with broad discretion to tailor
    discovery narrowly").
      Subdivision (b)(2). Rules 30, 31, and 33 establish presumptive
    national limits on the numbers of depositions and interrogatories.
    New Rule 30(d)(2) establishes a presumptive limit on the length of
    depositions. Subdivision (b)(2) is amended to remove the previous
    permission for local rules that establish different presumptive
    limits on these discovery activities. There is no reason to believe
    that unique circumstances justify varying these nationally-
    applicable presumptive limits in certain districts. The limits can
    be modified by court order or agreement in an individual action,
    but "standing" orders imposing different presumptive limits are not
    authorized. Because there is no national rule limiting the number
    of Rule 36 requests for admissions, the rule continues to authorize
    local rules that impose numerical limits on them. This change is
    not intended to interfere with differentiated case management in
    districts that use this technique by case-specific order as part of
    their Rule 16 process.
      Subdivision (d). The amendments remove the prior authority to
    exempt cases by local rule from the moratorium on discovery before
    the subdivision (f) conference, but the categories of proceedings
    exempted from initial disclosure under subdivision (a)(1)(E) are
    excluded from subdivision (d). The parties may agree to disregard
    the moratorium where it applies, and the court may so order in a
    case, but "standing" orders altering the moratorium are not
    authorized.
      Subdivision (f). As in subdivision (d), the amendments remove the
    prior authority to exempt cases by local rule from the conference
    requirement. The Committee has been informed that the addition of
    the conference was one of the most successful changes made in the
    1993 amendments, and it therefore has determined to apply the
    conference requirement nationwide. The categories of proceedings
    exempted from initial disclosure under subdivision (a)(1)(E) are
    exempted from the conference requirement for the reasons that
    warrant exclusion from initial disclosure. The court may order that
    the conference need not occur in a case where otherwise required,
    or that it occur in a case otherwise exempted by subdivision
    (a)(1)(E). "Standing" orders altering the conference requirement
    for categories of cases are not authorized.
      The rule is amended to require only a "conference" of the
    parties, rather than a "meeting." There are important benefits to
    face-to-face discussion of the topics to be covered in the
    conference, and those benefits may be lost if other means of
    conferring were routinely used when face-to-face meetings would not
    impose burdens. Nevertheless, geographic conditions in some
    districts may exact costs far out of proportion to these benefits.
    The amendment allows the court by case-specific order to require a
    face-to-face meeting, but "standing" orders so requiring are not
    authorized.
      As noted concerning the amendments to subdivision (a)(1), the
    time for the conference has been changed to at least 21 days before
    the Rule 16 scheduling conference, and the time for the report is
    changed to no more than 14 days after the Rule 26(f) conference.
    This should ensure that the court will have the report well in
    advance of the scheduling conference or the entry of the scheduling
    order.
      Since Rule 16 was amended in 1983 to mandate some case management
    activities in all courts, it has included deadlines for completing
    these tasks to ensure that all courts do so within a reasonable
    time. Rule 26(f) was fit into this scheme when it was adopted in
    1993. It was never intended, however, that the national
    requirements that certain activities be completed by a certain time
    should delay case management in districts that move much faster
    than the national rules direct, and the rule is therefore amended
    to permit such a court to adopt a local rule that shortens the
    period specified for the completion of these tasks.
      "Shall" is replaced by "must," "does," or an active verb under
    the program to conform amended rules to current style conventions
    when there is no ambiguity.
      GAP Report. The Advisory Committee recommends that the amendments
    to Rules 26(a)(1)(A) and (B) be changed so that initial disclosure
    applies to information the disclosing party "may use to support"
    its claims or defenses. It also recommends changes in the Committee
    Note to explain that disclosure requirement. In addition, it
    recommends inclusion in the Note of further explanatory matter
    regarding the exclusion from initial disclosure provided in new
    Rule 26(a)(1)(E) for actions for review on an administrative record
    and the impact of these exclusions on bankruptcy proceedings. Minor
    wording improvements in the Note are also proposed.
      The Advisory Committee recommends changing the rule to authorize
    the court to expand discovery to any "matter" - not "information" -
    relevant to the subject matter involved in the action. In addition,
    it recommends additional clarifying material in the Committee Note
    about the impact of the change on some commonly disputed discovery
    topics, the relationship between cost-bearing under Rule 26(b)(2)
    and expansion of the scope of discovery on a showing of good cause,
    and the meaning of "relevant" in the revision to the last sentence
    of current subdivision (b)(1). In addition, some minor
    clarifications of language changes have been proposed for the
    Committee Note.
      The Advisory Committee recommends adding a sentence to the
    published amendments to Rule 26(f) authorizing local rules
    shortening the time between the attorney conference and the court's
    action under Rule 16(b), and addition to the Committee Note of
    explanatory material about this change to the rule. This addition
    can be made without republication in response to public comments.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a). Rule 26(a)(1)(B) is amended to parallel Rule
    34(a) by recognizing that a party must disclose electronically
    stored information as well as documents that it may use to support
    its claims or defenses. The term "electronically stored
    information" has the same broad meaning in Rule 26(a)(1) as in Rule
    34(a). This amendment is consistent with the 1993 addition of Rule
    26(a)(1)(B). The term "data compilations" is deleted as unnecessary
    because it is a subset of both documents and electronically stored
    information.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. As noted in the
    introduction [omitted], this provision was not included in the
    published rule. It is included as a conforming amendment, to make
    Rule 26(a)(1) consistent with the changes that were included in the
    published proposals.
      [Subdivision (a)(1)(E).] Civil forfeiture actions are added to
    the list of exemptions from Rule 26(a)(1) disclosure requirements.
    These actions are governed by new Supplemental Rule G. Disclosure
    is not likely to be useful.
      Subdivision (b)(2). The amendment to Rule 26(b)(2) is designed to
    address issues raised by difficulties in locating, retrieving, and
    providing discovery of some electronically stored information.
    Electronic storage systems often make it easier to locate and
    retrieve information. These advantages are properly taken into
    account in determining the reasonable scope of discovery in a
    particular case. But some sources of electronically stored
    information can be accessed only with substantial burden and cost.
    In a particular case, these burdens and costs may make the
    information on such sources not reasonably accessible.
      It is not possible to define in a rule the different types of
    technological features that may affect the burdens and costs of
    accessing electronically stored information. Information systems
    are designed to provide ready access to information used in regular
    ongoing activities. They also may be designed so as to provide
    ready access to information that is not regularly used. But a
    system may retain information on sources that are accessible only
    by incurring substantial burdens or costs. Subparagraph (B) is
    added to regulate discovery from such sources.
      Under this rule, a responding party should produce electronically
    stored information that is relevant, not privileged, and reasonably
    accessible, subject to the (b)(2)(C) limitations that apply to all
    discovery. The responding party must also identify, by category or
    type, the sources containing potentially responsive information
    that it is neither searching nor producing. The identification
    should, to the extent possible, provide enough detail to enable the
    requesting party to evaluate the burdens and costs of providing the
    discovery and the likelihood of finding responsive information on
    the identified sources.
      A party's identification of sources of electronically stored
    information as not reasonably accessible does not relieve the party
    of its common-law or statutory duties to preserve evidence. Whether
    a responding party is required to preserve unsearched sources of
    potentially responsive information that it believes are not
    reasonably accessible depends on the circumstances of each case. It
    is often useful for the parties to discuss this issue early in
    discovery.
      The volume of - and the ability to search - much electronically
    stored information means that in many cases the responding party
    will be able to produce information from reasonably accessible
    sources that will fully satisfy the parties' discovery needs. In
    many circumstances the requesting party should obtain and evaluate
    the information from such sources before insisting that the
    responding party search and produce information contained on
    sources that are not reasonably accessible. If the requesting party
    continues to seek discovery of information from sources identified
    as not reasonably accessible, the parties should discuss the
    burdens and costs of accessing and retrieving the information, the
    needs that may establish good cause for requiring all or part of
    the requested discovery even if the information sought is not
    reasonably accessible, and conditions on obtaining and producing
    the information that may be appropriate.
      If the parties cannot agree whether, or on what terms, sources
    identified as not reasonably accessible should be searched and
    discoverable information produced, the issue may be raised either
    by a motion to compel discovery or by a motion for a protective
    order. The parties must confer before bringing either motion. If
    the parties do not resolve the issue and the court must decide, the
    responding party must show that the identified sources of
    information are not reasonably accessible because of undue burden
    or cost. The requesting party may need discovery to test this
    assertion. Such discovery might take the form of requiring the
    responding party to conduct a sampling of information contained on
    the sources identified as not reasonably accessible; allowing some
    form of inspection of such sources; or taking depositions of
    witnesses knowledgeable about the responding party's information
    systems.
      Once it is shown that a source of electronically stored
    information is not reasonably accessible, the requesting party may
    still obtain discovery by showing good cause, considering the
    limitations of Rule 26(b)(2)(C) that balance the costs and
    potential benefits of discovery. The decision whether to require a
    responding party to search for and produce information that is not
    reasonably accessible depends not only on the burdens and costs of
    doing so, but also on whether those burdens and costs can be
    justified in the circumstances of the case. Appropriate
    considerations may include: (1) the specificity of the discovery
    request; (2) the quantity of information available from other and
    more easily accessed sources; (3) the failure to produce relevant
    information that seems likely to have existed but is no longer
    available on more easily accessed sources; (4) the likelihood of
    finding relevant, responsive information that cannot be obtained
    from other, more easily accessed sources; (5) predictions as to the
    importance and usefulness of the further information; (6) the
    importance of the issues at stake in the litigation; and (7) the
    parties' resources.
      The responding party has the burden as to one aspect of the
    inquiry - whether the identified sources are not reasonably
    accessible in light of the burdens and costs required to search
    for, retrieve, and produce whatever responsive information may be
    found. The requesting party has the burden of showing that its need
    for the discovery outweighs the burdens and costs of locating,
    retrieving, and producing the information. In some cases, the court
    will be able to determine whether the identified sources are not
    reasonably accessible and whether the requesting party has shown
    good cause for some or all of the discovery, consistent with the
    limitations of Rule 26(b)(2)(C), through a single proceeding or
    presentation. The good-cause determination, however, may be
    complicated because the court and parties may know little about
    what information the sources identified as not reasonably
    accessible might contain, whether it is relevant, or how valuable
    it may be to the litigation. In such cases, the parties may need
    some focused discovery, which may include sampling of the sources,
    to learn more about what burdens and costs are involved in
    accessing the information, what the information consists of, and
    how valuable it is for the litigation in light of information that
    can be obtained by exhausting other opportunities for discovery.
      The good-cause inquiry and consideration of the Rule 26(b)(2)(C)
    limitations are coupled with the authority to set conditions for
    discovery. The conditions may take the form of limits on the
    amount, type, or sources of information required to be accessed and
    produced. The conditions may also include payment by the requesting
    party of part or all of the reasonable costs of obtaining
    information from sources that are not reasonably accessible. A
    requesting party's willingness to share or bear the access costs
    may be weighed by the court in determining whether there is good
    cause. But the producing party's burdens in reviewing the
    information for relevance and privilege may weigh against
    permitting the requested discovery.
      The limitations of Rule 26(b)(2)(C) continue to apply to all
    discovery of electronically stored information, including that
    stored on reasonably accessible electronic sources.
      Changes Made after Publication and Comment. This recommendation
    modifies the version of the proposed rule amendment as published.
    Responding to comments that the published proposal seemed to
    require identification of information that cannot be identified
    because it is not reasonably accessible, the rule text was
    clarified by requiring identification of sources that are not
    reasonably accessible. The test of reasonable accessibility was
    clarified by adding "because of undue burden or cost."
      The published proposal referred only to a motion by the
    requesting party to compel discovery. The rule text has been
    changed to recognize that the responding party may wish to
    determine its search and potential preservation obligations by
    moving for a protective order.
      The provision that the court may for good cause order discovery
    from sources that are not reasonably accessible is expanded in two
    ways. It now states specifically that the requesting party is the
    one who must show good cause, and it refers to consideration of the
    limitations on discovery set out in present Rule 26(b)(2)(i), (ii),
    and (iii).
      The published proposal was added at the end of present Rule
    26(b)(2). It has been relocated to become a new subparagraph (B),
    allocating present Rule 26(b)(2) to new subparagraphs (A) and (C).
    The Committee Note was changed to reflect the rule text revisions.
    It also was shortened. The shortening was accomplished in part by
    deleting references to problems that are likely to become antique
    as technology continues to evolve, and in part by deleting passages
    that were at a level of detail better suited for a practice manual
    than a Committee Note.
      The changes from the published proposed amendment to Rule
    26(b)(2) are set out below. [Omitted]
      Subdivision (b)(5). The Committee has repeatedly been advised
    that the risk of privilege waiver, and the work necessary to avoid
    it, add to the costs and delay of discovery. When the review is of
    electronically stored information, the risk of waiver, and the time
    and effort required to avoid it, can increase substantially because
    of the volume of electronically stored information and the
    difficulty in ensuring that all information to be produced has in
    fact been reviewed. Rule 26(b)(5)(A) provides a procedure for a
    party that has withheld information on the basis of privilege or
    protection as trial-preparation material to make the claim so that
    the requesting party can decide whether to contest the claim and
    the court can resolve the dispute. Rule 26(b)(5)(B) is added to
    provide a procedure for a party to assert a claim of privilege or
    trial-preparation material protection after information is produced
    in discovery in the action and, if the claim is contested, permit
    any party that received the information to present the matter to
    the court for resolution.
      Rule 26(b)(5)(B) does not address whether the privilege or
    protection that is asserted after production was waived by the
    production. The courts have developed principles to determine
    whether, and under what circumstances, waiver results from
    inadvertent production of privileged or protected information. Rule
    26(b)(5)(B) provides a procedure for presenting and addressing
    these issues. Rule 26(b)(5)(B) works in tandem with Rule 26(f),
    which is amended to direct the parties to discuss privilege issues
    in preparing their discovery plan, and which, with amended Rule
    16(b), allows the parties to ask the court to include in an order
    any agreements the parties reach regarding issues of privilege or
    trial-preparation material protection. Agreements reached under
    Rule 26(f)(4) and orders including such agreements entered under
    Rule 16(b)(6) may be considered when a court determines whether a
    waiver has occurred. Such agreements and orders ordinarily control
    if they adopt procedures different from those in Rule 26(b)(5)(B).
      A party asserting a claim of privilege or protection after
    production must give notice to the receiving party. That notice
    should be in writing unless the circumstances preclude it. Such
    circumstances could include the assertion of the claim during a
    deposition. The notice should be as specific as possible in
    identifying the information and stating the basis for the claim.
    Because the receiving party must decide whether to challenge the
    claim and may sequester the information and submit it to the court
    for a ruling on whether the claimed privilege or protection applies
    and whether it has been waived, the notice should be sufficiently
    detailed so as to enable the receiving party and the court to
    understand the basis for the claim and to determine whether waiver
    has occurred. Courts will continue to examine whether a claim of
    privilege or protection was made at a reasonable time when delay is
    part of the waiver determination under the governing law.
      After receiving notice, each party that received the information
    must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the information and any
    copies it has. The option of sequestering or destroying the
    information is included in part because the receiving party may
    have incorporated the information in protected trial-preparation
    materials. No receiving party may use or disclose the information
    pending resolution of the privilege claim. The receiving party may
    present to the court the questions whether the information is
    privileged or protected as trial-preparation material, and whether
    the privilege or protection has been waived. If it does so, it must
    provide the court with the grounds for the privilege or protection
    specified in the producing party's notice, and serve all parties.
    In presenting the question, the party may use the content of the
    information only to the extent permitted by the applicable law of
    privilege, protection for trial-preparation material, and
    professional responsibility.
      If a party disclosed the information to nonparties before
    receiving notice of a claim of privilege or protection as trial-
    preparation material, it must take reasonable steps to retrieve
    the information and to return it, sequester it until the claim is
    resolved, or destroy it.
      Whether the information is returned or not, the producing party
    must preserve the information pending the court's ruling on whether
    the claim of privilege or of protection is properly asserted and
    whether it was waived. As with claims made under Rule 26(b)(5)(A),
    there may be no ruling if the other parties do not contest the
    claim.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. The rule recommended
    for approval is modified from the published proposal. The rule is
    expanded to include trial-preparation protection claims in addition
    to privilege claims.
      The published proposal referred to production "without intending
    to waive a claim of privilege." This reference to intent was
    deleted because many courts include intent in the factors that
    determine whether production waives privilege.
      The published proposal required that the producing party give
    notice "within a reasonable time." The time requirement was deleted
    because it seemed to implicate the question whether production
    effected a waiver, a question not addressed by the rule, and also
    because a receiving party cannot practicably ignore a notice that
    it believes was unreasonably delayed. The notice procedure was
    further changed to require that the producing party state the basis
    for the claim.
      Two statements in the published Note have been brought into the
    rule text. The first provides that the receiving party may not use
    or disclose the information until the claim is resolved. The second
    provides that if the receiving party disclosed the information
    before being notified, it must take reasonable steps to retrieve
    it.(!1)

      The rule text was expanded by adding a provision that the
    receiving party may promptly present the information to the court
    under seal for a determination of the claim.
      The published proposal provided that the producing party must
    comply with Rule 26(b)(5)(A) after making the claim. This provision
    was deleted as unnecessary.
      Changes are made in the Committee Note to reflect the changes in
    the rule text.
      The changes from the published rule are shown below. [Omitted]
      Subdivision (f). Rule 26(f) is amended to direct the parties to
    discuss discovery of electronically stored information during their
    discovery-planning conference. The rule focuses on "issues relating
    to disclosure or discovery of electronically stored information";
    the discussion is not required in cases not involving electronic
    discovery, and the amendment imposes no additional requirements in
    those cases. When the parties do anticipate disclosure or discovery
    of electronically stored information, discussion at the outset may
    avoid later difficulties or ease their resolution.
      When a case involves discovery of electronically stored
    information, the issues to be addressed during the Rule 26(f)
    conference depend on the nature and extent of the contemplated
    discovery and of the parties' information systems. It may be
    important for the parties to discuss those systems, and accordingly
    important for counsel to become familiar with those systems before
    the conference. With that information, the parties can develop a
    discovery plan that takes into account the capabilities of their
    computer systems. In appropriate cases identification of, and early
    discovery from, individuals with special knowledge of a party's
    computer systems may be helpful.
      The particular issues regarding electronically stored information
    that deserve attention during the discovery planning stage depend
    on the specifics of the given case. See Manual for Complex
    Litigation (4th) Sec. 40.25(2) (listing topics for discussion in a
    proposed order regarding meet-and-confer sessions). For example,
    the parties may specify the topics for such discovery and the time
    period for which discovery will be sought. They may identify the
    various sources of such information within a party's control that
    should be searched for electronically stored information. They may
    discuss whether the information is reasonably accessible to the
    party that has it, including the burden or cost of retrieving and
    reviewing the information. See Rule 26(b)(2)(B). Rule 26(f)(3)
    explicitly directs the parties to discuss the form or forms in
    which electronically stored information might be produced. The
    parties may be able to reach agreement on the forms of production,
    making discovery more efficient. Rule 34(b) is amended to permit a
    requesting party to specify the form or forms in which it wants
    electronically stored information produced. If the requesting party
    does not specify a form, Rule 34(b) directs the responding party to
    state the forms it intends to use in the production. Early
    discussion of the forms of production may facilitate the
    application of Rule 34(b) by allowing the parties to determine what
    forms of production will meet both parties' needs. Early
    identification of disputes over the forms of production may help
    avoid the expense and delay of searches or productions using
    inappropriate forms.
      Rule 26(f) is also amended to direct the parties to discuss any
    issues regarding preservation of discoverable information during
    their conference as they develop a discovery plan. This provision
    applies to all sorts of discoverable information, but can be
    particularly important with regard to electronically stored
    information. The volume and dynamic nature of electronically stored
    information may complicate preservation obligations. The ordinary
    operation of computers involves both the automatic creation and the
    automatic deletion or overwriting of certain information. Failure
    to address preservation issues early in the litigation increases
    uncertainty and raises a risk of disputes.
      The parties' discussion should pay particular attention to the
    balance between the competing needs to preserve relevant evidence
    and to continue routine operations critical to ongoing activities.
    Complete or broad cessation of a party's routine computer
    operations could paralyze the party's activities. Cf. Manual for
    Complex Litigation (4th) Sec. 11.422 ("A blanket preservation order
    may be prohibitively expensive and unduly burdensome for parties
    dependent on computer systems for their day-to-day operations.")
    The parties should take account of these considerations in their
    discussions, with the goal of agreeing on reasonable preservation
    steps.
      The requirement that the parties discuss preservation does not
    imply that courts should routinely enter preservation orders. A
    preservation order entered over objections should be narrowly
    tailored. Ex parte preservation orders should issue only in
    exceptional circumstances.
      Rule 26(f) is also amended to provide that the parties should
    discuss any issues relating to assertions of privilege or of
    protection as trial-preparation materials, including whether the
    parties can facilitate discovery by agreeing on procedures for
    asserting claims of privilege or protection after production and
    whether to ask the court to enter an order that includes any
    agreement the parties reach. The Committee has repeatedly been
    advised about the discovery difficulties that can result from
    efforts to guard against waiver of privilege and work-product
    protection. Frequently parties find it necessary to spend large
    amounts of time reviewing materials requested through discovery to
    avoid waiving privilege. These efforts are necessary because
    materials subject to a claim of privilege or protection are often
    difficult to identify. A failure to withhold even one such item may
    result in an argument that there has been a waiver of privilege as
    to all other privileged materials on that subject matter. Efforts
    to avoid the risk of waiver can impose substantial costs on the
    party producing the material and the time required for the
    privilege review can substantially delay access for the party
    seeking discovery.
      These problems often become more acute when discovery of
    electronically stored information is sought. The volume of such
    data, and the informality that attends use of e-mail and some other
    types of electronically stored information, may make privilege
    determinations more difficult, and privilege review correspondingly
    more expensive and time consuming. Other aspects of electronically
    stored information pose particular difficulties for privilege
    review. For example, production may be sought of information
    automatically included in electronic files but not apparent to the
    creator or to readers. Computer programs may retain draft language,
    editorial comments, and other deleted matter (sometimes referred to
    as "embedded data" or "embedded edits") in an electronic file but
    not make them apparent to the reader. Information describing the
    history, tracking, or management of an electronic file (sometimes
    called "metadata") is usually not apparent to the reader viewing a
    hard copy or a screen image. Whether this information should be
    produced may be among the topics discussed in the Rule 26(f)
    conference. If it is, it may need to be reviewed to ensure that no
    privileged information is included, further complicating the task
    of privilege review.
      Parties may attempt to minimize these costs and delays by
    agreeing to protocols that minimize the risk of waiver. They may
    agree that the responding party will provide certain requested
    materials for initial examination without waiving any privilege or
    protection - sometimes known as a "quick peek." The requesting
    party then designates the documents it wishes to have actually
    produced. This designation is the Rule 34 request. The responding
    party then responds in the usual course, screening only those
    documents actually requested for formal production and asserting
    privilege claims as provided in Rule 26(b)(5)(A). On other
    occasions, parties enter agreements - sometimes called "clawback
    agreements" - that production without intent to waive privilege or
    protection should not be a waiver so long as the responding party
    identifies the documents mistakenly produced, and that the
    documents should be returned under those circumstances. Other
    voluntary arrangements may be appropriate depending on the
    circumstances of each litigation. In most circumstances, a party
    who receives information under such an arrangement cannot assert
    that production of the information waived a claim of privilege or
    of protection as trial-preparation material.
      Although these agreements may not be appropriate for all cases,
    in certain cases they can facilitate prompt and economical
    discovery by reducing delay before the discovering party obtains
    access to documents, and by reducing the cost and burden of review
    by the producing party. A case-management or other order including
    such agreements may further facilitate the discovery process. Form
    35 is amended to include a report to the court about any agreement
    regarding protections against inadvertent forfeiture or waiver of
    privilege or protection that the parties have reached, and Rule
    16(b) is amended to recognize that the court may include such an
    agreement in a case- management or other order. If the parties
    agree to entry of such an order, their proposal should be included
    in the report to the court.
      Rule 26(b)(5)(B) is added to establish a parallel procedure to
    assert privilege or protection as trial-preparation material after
    production, leaving the question of waiver to later determination
    by the court.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. The Committee
    recommends a modified version of what was published. Rule 26(f)(3)
    was expanded to refer to the form "or forms" of production, in
    parallel with the like change in Rule 34. Different forms may be
    suitable for different sources of electronically stored
    information.
      The published Rule 26(f)(4) proposal described the parties' views
    and proposals concerning whether, on their agreement, the court
    should enter an order protecting the right to assert privilege
    after production. This has been revised to refer to the parties'
    views and proposals concerning any issues relating to claims of
    privilege, including - if the parties agree on a procedure to
    assert such claims after production - whether to ask the court to
    include their agreement in an order. As with Rule 16(b)(6), this
    change was made to avoid any implications as to the scope of the
    protection that may be afforded by court adoption of the parties'
    agreement.
      Rule 26(f)(4) also was expanded to include trial-preparation
    materials.
      The Committee Note was revised to reflect the changes in the rule
    text.
      The changes from the published rule are shown below. [Omitted]

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 26 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Former Rule 26(a)(5) served as an index of the discovery methods
    provided by later rules. It was deleted as redundant. Deletion does
    not affect the right to pursue discovery in addition to disclosure.
      Former Rule 26(b)(1) began with a general statement of the scope
    of discovery that appeared to function as a preface to each of the
    five numbered paragraphs that followed. This preface has been
    shifted to the text of paragraph (1) because it does not accurately
    reflect the limits embodied in paragraphs (2), (3), or (4), and
    because paragraph (5) does not address the scope of discovery.
      The reference to discovery of "books" in former Rule 26(b)(1) was
    deleted to achieve consistent expression throughout the discovery
    rules. Books remain a proper subject of discovery.
      Amended Rule 26(b)(3) states that a party may obtain a copy of
    the party's own previous statement "on request." Former Rule
    26(b)(3) expressly made the request procedure available to a
    nonparty witness, but did not describe the procedure to be used by
    a party. This apparent gap is closed by adopting the request
    procedure, which ensures that a party need not invoke Rule 34 to
    obtain a copy of the party's own statement.
      Rule 26(e) stated the duty to supplement or correct a disclosure
    or discovery response "to include information thereafter acquired."
    This apparent limit is not reflected in practice; parties recognize
    the duty to supplement or correct by providing information that was
    not originally provided although it was available at the time of
    the initial disclosure or response. These words are deleted to
    reflect the actual meaning of the present rule.
      Former Rule 26(e) used different phrases to describe the time to
    supplement or correct a disclosure or discovery response.
    Disclosures were to be supplemented "at appropriate intervals." A
    prior discovery response must be "seasonably * * * amend[ed]." The
    fine distinction between these phrases has not been observed in
    practice. Amended Rule 26(e)(1)(A) uses the same phrase for
    disclosures and discovery responses. The party must supplement or
    correct "in a timely manner."
      Former Rule 26(g)(1) did not call for striking an unsigned
    disclosure. The omission was an obvious drafting oversight. Amended
    Rule 26(g)(2) includes disclosures in the list of matters that the
    court must strike unless a signature is provided "promptly * * *
    after being called to the attorney's or party's attention."
      Former Rule 26(b)(2)(A) referred to a "good faith" argument to
    extend existing law. Amended Rule 26(b)(1)(B)(i) changes this
    reference to a "nonfrivolous" argument to achieve consistency with
    Rule 11(b)(2).
      As with the Rule 11 signature on a pleading, written motion, or
    other paper, disclosure and discovery signatures should include not
    only a postal address but also a telephone number and electronic-
    mail address. A signer who lacks one or more of those addresses
    need not supply a nonexistent item.
      Rule 11(b)(2) recognizes that it is legitimate to argue for
    establishing new law. An argument to establish new law is equally
    legitimate in conducting discovery.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. See Note to Rule 1,
    supra.

-FOOTNOTE-               

    (!1) In response to concerns about the proposal raised at the
         June 15-16, 2005, Standing Committee meeting, the Committee
         Note was revised to emphasize that the courts will continue to
         examine whether a privilege claim was made at a reasonable
         time, as part of substantive law.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Before an Action Is Filed.
        (1) Petition. A person who wants to perpetuate testimony about
      any matter cognizable in a United States court may file a
      verified petition in the district court for the district where
      any expected adverse party resides. The petition must ask for an
      order authorizing the petitioner to depose the named persons in
      order to perpetuate their testimony. The petition must be titled
      in the petitioner's name and must show:
          (A) that the petitioner expects to be a party to an action
        cognizable in a United States court but cannot presently bring
        it or cause it to be brought;
          (B) the subject matter of the expected action and the
        petitioner's interest;
          (C) the facts that the petitioner wants to establish by the
        proposed testimony and the reasons to perpetuate it;
          (D) the names or a description of the persons whom the
        petitioner expects to be adverse parties and their addresses,
        so far as known; and
          (E) the name, address, and expected substance of the
        testimony of each deponent.

        (2) Notice and Service. At least 21 days before the hearing
      date, the petitioner must serve each expected adverse party with
      a copy of the petition and a notice stating the time and place of
      the hearing. The notice may be served either inside or outside
      the district or state in the manner provided in Rule 4. If that
      service cannot be made with reasonable diligence on an expected
      adverse party, the court may order service by publication or
      otherwise. The court must appoint an attorney to represent
      persons not served in the manner provided in Rule 4 and to cross-
      examine the deponent if an unserved person is not otherwise
      represented. If any expected adverse party is a minor or is
      incompetent, Rule 17(c) applies.
        (3) Order and Examination. If satisfied that perpetuating the
      testimony may prevent a failure or delay of justice, the court
      must issue an order that designates or describes the persons
      whose depositions may be taken, specifies the subject matter of
      the examinations, and states whether the depositions will be
      taken orally or by written interrogatories. The depositions may
      then be taken under these rules, and the court may issue orders
      like those authorized by Rules 34 and 35. A reference in these
      rules to the court where an action is pending means, for purposes
      of this rule, the court where the petition for the deposition was
      filed.
        (4) Using the Deposition. A deposition to perpetuate testimony
      may be used under Rule 32(a) in any later-filed district-court
      action involving the same subject matter if the deposition either
      was taken under these rules or, although not so taken, would be
      admissible in evidence in the courts of the state where it was
      taken.

      (b) Pending Appeal.
        (1) In General. The court where a judgment has been rendered
      may, if an appeal has been taken or may still be taken, permit a
      party to depose witnesses to perpetuate their testimony for use
      in the event of further proceedings in that court.
        (2) Motion. The party who wants to perpetuate testimony may
      move for leave to take the depositions, on the same notice and
      service as if the action were pending in the district court. The
      motion must show:
          (A) the name, address, and expected substance of the
        testimony of each deponent; and
          (B) the reasons for perpetuating the testimony.

        (3) Court Order. If the court finds that perpetuating the
      testimony may prevent a failure or delay of justice, the court
      may permit the depositions to be taken and may issue orders like
      those authorized by Rules 34 and 35. The depositions may be taken
      and used as any other deposition taken in a pending district-
      court action.

      (c) Perpetuation by an Action. This rule does not limit a court's
    power to entertain an action to perpetuate testimony.

    equity practice or under modern statutes. See Arizona v.
    California, 292 U.S. 341 (1934); Todd Engineering Dry Dock and
    Repair Co. v. United States, 32 F.(2d) 734 (C.C.A.5th, 1929); Hall

      Note to Subdivision (b). This follows the practice approved in
    Richter v. Union Trust Co., 115 U.S. 55 (1885), by extending the
    right to perpetuate testimony to cases pending an appeal.
      Note to Subdivision (c). This preserves the right to employ a
    separate action to perpetuate testimony under U.S.C., Title 28,
    [former] Sec. 644 (Depositions under dedimus potestatem and in
    perpetuam) as an alternate method.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      Since the second sentence in subdivision (a)(3) refers only to
    depositions, it is arguable that Rules 34 and 35 are inapplicable
    in proceedings to perpetuate testimony. The new matter [in
    subdivisions (a)(3) and (b)] clarifies. A conforming change is also
    made in subdivision (b).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1948 AMENDMENT       
      The only changes are in nomenclature to conform to the official
    designation of a district court in Title 28, U.S.C., Sec. 132(a).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1971 AMENDMENT       
      The reference intended in this subdivision is to the rule
    governing the use of depositions in court proceedings. Formerly
    Rule 26(d), that rule is now Rule 32(a). The subdivision is amended
    accordingly.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             
      The outdated cross-reference to former Rule 4(d) is corrected to
    incorporate all Rule 4 methods of service. Former Rule 4(d) has
    been allocated to many different subdivisions of Rule 4. Former
    Rule 4(d) did not cover all categories of defendants or modes of
    service, and present Rule 4 reaches further than all of former Rule
    4. But there is no reason to distinguish between the different
    categories of defendants and modes of service encompassed by Rule
    4. Rule 4 service provides effective notice. Notice by such means
    should be provided to any expected adverse party that comes within
    Rule 4.
      Other changes are made to conform Rule 27(a)(2) to current style
    conventions.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Only style changes
    are recommended in the published draft.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 27 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE V. DISCLOSURES AND DISCOVERY

-HEAD-
    Rule 28. Persons Before Whom Depositions May Be Taken

-STATUTE-
      (a) Within the United States.
        (1) In General. Within the United States or a territory or
      insular possession subject to United States jurisdiction, a
      deposition must be taken before:
          (A) an officer authorized to administer oaths either by
        federal law or by the law in the place of examination; or
          (B) a person appointed by the court where the action is
        pending to administer oaths and take testimony.

        (2) Definition of "Officer." The term "officer" in Rules 30,
      31, and 32 includes a person appointed by the court under this
      rule or designated by the parties under Rule 29(a).

      (b) In a Foreign Country.
        (1) In General. A deposition may be taken in a foreign country:
          (A) under an applicable treaty or convention;
          (B) under a letter of request, whether or not captioned a
        "letter rogatory";
          (C) on notice, before a person authorized to administer oaths
        either by federal law or by the law in the place of
        examination; or
          (D) before a person commissioned by the court to administer
        any necessary oath and take testimony.

        (2) Issuing a Letter of Request or a Commission. A letter of
      request, a commission, or both may be issued:
          (A) on appropriate terms after an application and notice of
        it; and
          (B) without a showing that taking the deposition in another
        manner is impracticable or inconvenient.

        (3) Form of a Request, Notice, or Commission. When a letter of
      request or any other device is used according to a treaty or
      convention, it must be captioned in the form prescribed by that
      treaty or convention. A letter of request may be addressed "To
      the Appropriate Authority in [name of country]." A deposition
      notice or a commission must designate by name or descriptive
      title the person before whom the deposition is to be taken.
        (4) Letter of Request - Admitting Evidence. Evidence obtained
      in response to a letter of request need not be excluded merely
      because it is not a verbatim transcript, because the testimony
      was not taken under oath, or because of any similar departure
      from the requirements for depositions taken within the United
      States.

      (c) Disqualification. A deposition must not be taken before a
    person who is any party's relative, employee, or attorney; who is
    related to or employed by any party's attorney; or who is
    financially interested in the action.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      In effect this rule is substantially the same as U.S.C., Title
    28, [former] Sec. 639 (Depositions de bene esse; when and where
    taken; notice). U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Sec. 642 (Depositions,
    acknowledgements, and affidavits taken by notaries public) does not
    conflict with subdivision (a).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      The added language [in subdivision (a)] provides for the
    situation, occasionally arising, when depositions must be taken in
    an isolated place where there is no one readily available who has
    the power to administer oaths and take testimony according to the
    terms of the rule as originally stated. In addition, the amendment
    affords a more convenient method of securing depositions in the
    case where state lines intervene between the location of various
    witnesses otherwise rather closely grouped. The amendment insures
    that the person appointed shall have adequate power to perform his
    duties. It has been held that a person authorized to act in the
    premises, as, for example, a master, may take testimony outside the
    district of his appointment. Consolidated Fastener Co. v. Columbian
    Button & Fastener Co. (C.C.N.D.N.Y. 1898) 85 Fed. 54; Mathieson
    Alkali Works v. Arnold, Hoffman & Co. (C.C.A.1st, 1929) 31 F.(2d)
    1.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment of clause (1) is designed to facilitate depositions
    in foreign countries by enlarging the class of persons before whom
    the depositions may be taken on notice. The class is no longer
    confined, as at present, to a secretary of embassy or legation,
    consul general, consul, vice consul, or consular agent of the
    United States. In a country that regards the taking of testimony by
    a foreign official in aid of litigation pending in a court of
    another country as an infringement upon its sovereignty, it will be
    expedient to notice depositions before officers of the country in
    which the examination is taken. See generally Symposium, Letters
    Rogatory (Grossman ed. 1956); Doyle, Taking Evidence by Deposition
    and Letters Rogatory and Obtaining Documents in Foreign Territory,
    Proc. A.B.A., Sec. Int'l & Comp. L. 37 (1959); Heilpern, Procuring
    Evidence Abroad, 14 Tul.L.Rev. 29 (1939); Jones, International
    Judicial Assistance: Procedural Chaos and a Program for Reform, 62
    Yale L.J. 515, 526-29 (1953); Smit, International Aspects of
    Federal Civil Procedure, 61 Colum.L.Rev. 1031, 1056-58 (1961).
      Clause (2) of amended subdivision (b), like the corresponding
    provision of subdivision (a) dealing with depositions taken in the
    United States, makes it clear that the appointment of a person by
    commission in itself confers power upon him to administer any
    necessary oath.
      It has been held that a letter rogatory will not be issued unless
    the use of a notice or commission is shown to be impossible or
    impractical. See, e.g., United States v. Matles, 154 F.Supp. 574
    (E.D.N.Y. 1957); The Edmund Fanning, 89 F.Supp. 282 (E.D.N.Y.
    1950); Branyan v. Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij, 13 F.R.D.
    425 (S.D.N.Y. 1953). See also Ali Akber Kiachif v. Philco
    International Corp., 10 F.R.D. 277 (S.D.N.Y. 1950). The intent of
    the fourth sentence of the amended subdivision is to overcome this
    judicial antipathy and to permit a sound choice between depositions
    under a letter rogatory and on notice or by commission in the light
    of all the circumstances. In a case in which the foreign country
    will compel a witness to attend or testify in aid of a letter
    rogatory but not in aid of a commission, a letter rogatory may be
    preferred on the ground that it is less expensive to execute, even
    if there is plainly no need for compulsive process. A letter
    rogatory may also be preferred when it cannot be demonstrated that
    a witness will be recalcitrant or when the witness states that he
    is willing to testify voluntarily, but the contingency exists that
    he will change his mind at the last moment. In the latter case, it
    may be advisable to issue both a commission and a letter rogatory,
    the latter to be executed if the former fails. The choice between a
    letter rogatory and a commission may be conditioned by other
    factors, including the nature and extent of the assistance that the
    foreign country will give to the execution of either.
      In executing a letter rogatory the courts of other countries may
    be expected to follow their customary procedure for taking
    testimony. See United States v. Paraffin Wax, 2255 Bags, 23 F.R.D.
    289 (E.D.N.Y. 1959). In many non-common-law countries the judge
    questions the witness, sometimes without first administering an
    oath, the attorneys put any supplemental questions either to the
    witness or through the judge, and the judge dictates a summary of
    the testimony, which the witness acknowledges as correct. See
    Jones, supra, at 530-32; Doyle, supra, at 39-41. The last sentence
    of the amended subdivision provides, contrary to the implications
    of some authority, that evidence recorded in such a fashion need
    not be excluded on that account. See The Mandu, 11 F.Supp. 845
    (E.D.N.Y. 1935). But cf. Nelson v. United States, 17 Fed.Cas. 1340
    (No. 10,116) (C.C.D.Pa. 1816); Winthrop v. Union Ins. Co., 30
    Fed.Cas. 376 (No. 17901) (C.C.D.Pa. 1807). The specific reference
    to the lack of an oath or a verbatim transcript is intended to be
    illustrative. Whether or to what degree the value or weight of the
    evidence may be affected by the method of taking or recording the
    testimony is left for determination according to the circumstances
    of the particular case, cf. Uebersee Finanz-Korporation, A.G. v.
    Brownell, 121 F.Supp. 420 (D.D.C. 1954); Danisch v. Guardian Life
    Ins. Co., 19 F.R.D. 235 (S.D.N.Y. 1956); the testimony may indeed
    be so devoid of substance or probative value as to warrant its
    exclusion altogether.
      Some foreign countries are hostile to allowing a deposition to be
    taken in their country, especially by notice or commission, or to
    lending assistance in the taking of a deposition. Thus compliance
    with the terms of amended subdivision (b) may not in all cases
    ensure completion of a deposition abroad. Examination of the law
    and policy of the particular foreign country in advance of
    attempting a deposition is therefore advisable. See 4 Moore's
    Federal Practice &#182;&#182; 28.05-28.08 (2d ed. 1950).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1980 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are clarifying.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      This revision is intended to make effective use of the Hague
    Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial
    Matters, and of any similar treaties that the United States may
    enter into in the future which provide procedures for taking
    depositions abroad. The party taking the deposition is ordinarily
    obliged to conform to an applicable treaty or convention if an
    effective deposition can be taken by such internationally approved
    means, even though a verbatim transcript is not available or
    testimony cannot be taken under oath. For a discussion of the
    impact of such treaties upon the discovery process, and of the
    application of principles of comity upon discovery in countries not
    signatories to a convention, see Socie&#233;te&#233; Nationale
    Industrielle Ae&#233;rospatiale v. United States District Court,
    482 U.S. 522 (1987).
      The term "letter of request" has been substituted in the rule for
    the term "letter rogatory" because it is the primary method
    provided by the Hague Convention. A letter rogatory is essentially
    a form of letter of request. There are several other minor changes
    that are designed merely to carry out the intent of the other
    alterations.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 28 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

    Rule 29. Stipulations About Discovery Procedure

-STATUTE-
      Unless the court orders otherwise, the parties may stipulate
    that:
        (a) a deposition may be taken before any person, at any time or
      place, on any notice, and in the manner specified - in which
      event it may be used in the same way as any other deposition; and
        (b) other procedures governing or limiting discovery be
      modified - but a stipulation extending the time for any form of
      discovery must have court approval if it would interfere with the
      time set for completing discovery, for hearing a motion, or for
      trial.

-MISC1-
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1970 AMENDMENT       
      There is no provision for stipulations varying the procedures by
    which methods of discovery other than depositions are governed. It
    is common practice for parties to agree on such variations, and the
    amendment recognizes such agreements and provides a formal
    mechanism in the rules for giving them effect. Any stipulation
    varying the procedures may be superseded by court order, and
    stipulations extending the time for response to discovery under
    Rules 33, 34, and 36 require court approval.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is revised to give greater opportunity for litigants to
    agree upon modifications to the procedures governing discovery or
    to limitations upon discovery. Counsel are encouraged to agree on
    less expensive and time-consuming methods to obtain information, as
    through voluntary exchange of documents, use of interviews in lieu
    of depositions, etc. Likewise, when more depositions or
    interrogatories are needed than allowed under these rules or when
    more time is needed to complete a deposition than allowed under a
    local rule, they can, by agreeing to the additional discovery,
    eliminate the need for a special motion addressed to the court.
      Under the revised rule, the litigants ordinarily are not required
    to obtain the court's approval of these stipulations. By order or
    local rule, the court can, however, direct that its approval be
    obtained for particular types of stipulations; and, in any event,
    approval must be obtained if a stipulation to extend the 30-day
    period for responding to interrogatories, requests for production,
    or requests for admissions would interfere with dates set by the
    court for completing discovery, for hearing of a motion, or for
    trial.

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE V. DISCLOSURES AND DISCOVERY

-HEAD-
    Rule 30. Depositions by Oral Examination

-STATUTE-
      (a) When a Deposition May Be Taken.
        (1) Without Leave. A party may, by oral questions, depose any
      person, including a party, without leave of court except as
      provided in Rule 30(a)(2). The deponent's attendance may be
      compelled by subpoena under Rule 45.
        (2) With Leave. A party must obtain leave of court, and the
      court must grant leave to the extent consistent with Rule
      26(b)(2):
          (A) if the parties have not stipulated to the deposition and:
            (i) the deposition would result in more than 10 depositions
          being taken under this rule or Rule 31 by the plaintiffs, or
          by the defendants, or by the third-party defendants;
            (ii) the deponent has already been deposed in the case; or
            (iii) the party seeks to take the deposition before the
          time specified in Rule 26(d), unless the party certifies in
          the notice, with supporting facts, that the deponent is
          expected to leave the United States and be unavailable for
          examination in this country after that time; or

          (B) if the deponent is confined in prison.

      (b) Notice of the Deposition; Other Formal Requirements.
        (1) Notice in General. A party who wants to depose a person by
      oral questions must give reasonable written notice to every other
      party. The notice must state the time and place of the deposition
      and, if known, the deponent's name and address. If the name is
      unknown, the notice must provide a general description sufficient
      to identify the person or the particular class or group to which
      the person belongs.
        (2) Producing Documents. If a subpoena duces tecum is to be
      served on the deponent, the materials designated for production,
      as set out in the subpoena, must be listed in the notice or in an
      attachment. The notice to a party deponent may be accompanied by
      a request under Rule 34 to produce documents and tangible things
      at the deposition.
        (3) Method of Recording.
          (A) Method Stated in the Notice. The party who notices the
        deposition must state in the notice the method for recording
        the testimony. Unless the court orders otherwise, testimony may
        be recorded by audio, audiovisual, or stenographic means. The
        noticing party bears the recording costs. Any party may arrange
        to transcribe a deposition.
          (B) Additional Method. With prior notice to the deponent and
        other parties, any party may designate another method for
        recording the testimony in addition to that specified in the
        original notice. That party bears the expense of the additional
        record or transcript unless the court orders otherwise.

        (4) By Remote Means. The parties may stipulate - or the court
      may on motion order - that a deposition be taken by telephone or
      other remote means. For the purpose of this rule and Rules 28(a),
      37(a)(2), and 37(b)(1), the deposition takes place where the
      deponent answers the questions.
        (5) Officer's Duties.
          (A) Before the Deposition. Unless the parties stipulate
        otherwise, a deposition must be conducted before an officer
        appointed or designated under Rule 28. The officer must begin
        the deposition with an on-the-record statement that includes:
            (i) the officer's name and business address;
            (ii) the date, time, and place of the deposition;
            (iii) the deponent's name;
            (iv) the officer's administration of the oath or
          affirmation to the deponent; and
            (v) the identity of all persons present.

          (B) Conducting the Deposition; Avoiding Distortion. If the
        deposition is recorded nonstenographically, the officer must
        repeat the items in Rule 30(b)(5)(A)(i)-(iii) at the beginning
        of each unit of the recording medium. The deponent's and
        attorneys' appearance or demeanor must not be distorted through
        recording techniques.
          (C) After the Deposition. At the end of a deposition, the
        officer must state on the record that the deposition is
        complete and must set out any stipulations made by the
        attorneys about custody of the transcript or recording and of
        the exhibits, or about any other pertinent matters.

        (6) Notice or Subpoena Directed to an Organization. In its
      notice or subpoena, a party may name as the deponent a public or
      private corporation, a partnership, an association, a
      governmental agency, or other entity and must describe with
      reasonable particularity the matters for examination. The named
      organization must then designate one or more officers, directors,
      or managing agents, or designate other persons who consent to
      testify on its behalf; and it may set out the matters on which
      each person designated will testify. A subpoena must advise a
      nonparty organization of its duty to make this designation. The
      persons designated must testify about information known or
      reasonably available to the organization. This paragraph (6) does
      not preclude a deposition by any other procedure allowed by these
      rules.

      (c) Examination and Cross-Examination; Record of the Examination;
    Objections; Written Questions.
        (1) Examination and Cross-Examination. The examination and
      cross-examination of a deponent proceed as they would at trial
      under the Federal Rules of Evidence, except Rules 103 and 615.
      After putting the deponent under oath or affirmation, the officer
      must record the testimony by the method designated under Rule
      30(b)(3)(A). The testimony must be recorded by the officer
      personally or by a person acting in the presence and under the
      direction of the officer.
        (2) Objections. An objection at the time of the examination -
      whether to evidence, to a party's conduct, to the officer's
      qualifications, to the manner of taking the deposition, or to any
      other aspect of the deposition - must be noted on the record, but
      the examination still proceeds; the testimony is taken subject to
      any objection. An objection must be stated concisely in a
      nonargumentative and nonsuggestive manner. A person may instruct
      a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a
      privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the court, or to
      present a motion under Rule 30(d)(3).
        (3) Participating Through Written Questions. Instead of
      participating in the oral examination, a party may serve written
      questions in a sealed envelope on the party noticing the
      deposition, who must deliver them to the officer. The officer
      must ask the deponent those questions and record the answers
      verbatim.

      (d) Duration; Sanction; Motion to Terminate or Limit.
        (1) Duration. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the
      court, a deposition is limited to 1 day of 7 hours. The court
      must allow additional time consistent with Rule 26(b)(2) if
      needed to fairly examine the deponent or if the deponent, another
      person, or any other circumstance impedes or delays the
      examination.
        (2) Sanction. The court may impose an appropriate sanction -
      including the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred by
      any party - on a person who impedes, delays, or frustrates the
      fair examination of the deponent.
        (3) Motion to Terminate or Limit.
          (A) Grounds. At any time during a deposition, the deponent or
        a party may move to terminate or limit it on the ground that it
        is being conducted in bad faith or in a manner that
        unreasonably annoys, embarrasses, or oppresses the deponent or
        party. The motion may be filed in the court where the action is
        pending or the deposition is being taken. If the objecting
        deponent or party so demands, the deposition must be suspended
        for the time necessary to obtain an order.
          (B) Order. The court may order that the deposition be
        terminated or may limit its scope and manner as provided in
        Rule 26(c). If terminated, the deposition may be resumed only
        by order of the court where the action is pending.
          (C) Award of Expenses. Rule 37(a)(5) applies to the award of
        expenses.

      (e) Review by the Witness; Changes.
        (1) Review; Statement of Changes. On request by the deponent or
      a party before the deposition is completed, the deponent must be
      allowed 30 days after being notified by the officer that the
      transcript or recording is available in which:
          (A) to review the transcript or recording; and
          (B) if there are changes in form or substance, to sign a
        statement listing the changes and the reasons for making them.

        (2) Changes Indicated in the Officer's Certificate. The officer
      must note in the certificate prescribed by Rule 30(f)(1) whether
      a review was requested and, if so, must attach any changes the
      deponent makes during the 30-day period.

      (f) Certification and Delivery; Exhibits; Copies of the
    Transcript or Recording; Filing.
        (1) Certification and Delivery. The officer must certify in
      writing that the witness was duly sworn and that the deposition
      accurately records the witness's testimony. The certificate must
      accompany the record of the deposition. Unless the court orders
      otherwise, the officer must seal the deposition in an envelope or
      package bearing the title of the action and marked "Deposition of
      [witness's name]" and must promptly send it to the attorney who
      arranged for the transcript or recording. The attorney must store
      it under conditions that will protect it against loss,
      destruction, tampering, or deterioration.
        (2) Documents and Tangible Things.
          (A) Originals and Copies. Documents and tangible things
        produced for inspection during a deposition must, on a party's
        request, be marked for identification and attached to the
        deposition. Any party may inspect and copy them. But if the
        person who produced them wants to keep the originals, the
        person may:
            (i) offer copies to be marked, attached to the deposition,
          and then used as originals - after giving all parties a fair
          opportunity to verify the copies by comparing them with the
          originals; or
            (ii) give all parties a fair opportunity to inspect and
          copy the originals after they are marked - in which event the
          originals may be used as if attached to the deposition.

          (B) Order Regarding the Originals. Any party may move for an
        order that the originals be attached to the deposition pending
        final disposition of the case.

        (3) Copies of the Transcript or Recording. Unless otherwise
      stipulated or ordered by the court, the officer must retain the
      stenographic notes of a deposition taken stenographically or a
      copy of the recording of a deposition taken by another method.
      When paid reasonable charges, the officer must furnish a copy of
      the transcript or recording to any party or the deponent.
        (4) Notice of Filing. A party who files the deposition must
      promptly notify all other parties of the filing.

      (g) Failure to Attend a Deposition or Serve a Subpoena; Expenses.
    A party who, expecting a deposition to be taken, attends in person
    or by an attorney may recover reasonable expenses for attending,
    including attorney's fees, if the noticing party failed to:
        (1) attend and proceed with the deposition; or
        (2) serve a subpoena on a nonparty deponent, who consequently
      did not attend.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      Note to Subdivision (a). This is in accordance with common
    practice. See U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Sec. 639 (Depositions de
    bene esse; when and where taken; notice), the relevant provisions
    of which are incorporated in this rule; Calif.Code Civ.Proc.
    (Deering, 1937) Sec. 2031; and statutes cited in respect to notice
    in the Note to Rule 26(a). The provision for enlarging or
    shortening the time of notice has been added to give flexibility to
    the rule.
      Note to Subdivisions (b) and (d). These are introduced as a
    safeguard for the protection of parties and deponents on account of
    the unlimited right of discovery given by Rule 26.
      Note to Subdivisions (c) and (e). These follow the general plan
    of [former] Equity Rule 51 (Evidence Taken Before Examiners, Etc.)
    and U. S. C., Title 28, [former] Secs. 640 (Depositions de bene
    esse; mode of taking), and [former] 641 (Same; transmission to
    court), but are more specific. They also permit the deponent to
    require the officer to make changes in the deposition if the
    deponent is not satisfied with it. See also [former] Equity Rule 50
    (Stenographer-Appointment-Fees).
      Note to Subdivision (f). Compare [former] Equity Rule 55
    (Depositions Deemed Published When Filed).
      Note to Subdivision (g). This is similar to 2 Minn. Stat. (Mason,
    1927) Sec. 9833, but is more extensive.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      This amendment corresponds to the change in Rule 4(d)(4). See the
    Advisory Committee's Note to that amendment.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1970 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). This subdivision contains the provisions of
    existing Rule 26(a), transferred here as part of the rearrangement
    relating to Rule 26. Existing Rule 30(a) is transferred to 30(b).
    Changes in language have been made to conform to the new
    arrangement.
      This subdivision is further revised in regard to the requirement
    of leave of court for taking a deposition. The present procedure,
    requiring a plaintiff to obtain leave of court if he serves notice
    of taking a deposition within 20 days after commencement of the
    action, is changed in several respects. First, leave is required by
    reference to the time the deposition is to be taken rather than the
    date of serving notice of taking. Second, the 20-day period is
    extended to 30 days and runs from the service of summons and
    complaint on any defendant, rather than the commencement of the
    action. Cf. Ill. S.Ct.R. 19-1, S-H Ill.Ann.Stat. Sec. 101.19-1.
    Third, leave is not required beyond the time that defendant
    initiates discovery, thus showing that he has retained counsel. As
    under the present practice, a party not afforded a reasonable
    opportunity to appear at a deposition, because he has not yet been
    served with process, is protected against use of the deposition at
    trial against him. See Rule 32(a), transferred from 26(d).
    Moreover, he can later redepose the witness if he so desires.
      The purpose of requiring the plaintiff to obtain leave of court
    is, as stated by the Advisory Committee that proposed the present
    language of Rule 26(a), to protect "a defendant who has not had an
    opportunity to retain counsel and inform himself as to the nature
    of the suit." Note to 1948 amendment of Rule 26(a), quoted in 3A
    Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure 455-456 (Wright
    ed. 1958). In order to assure defendant of this opportunity, the
    period is lengthened to 30 days. This protection, however, is
    relevant to the time of taking the deposition, not to the time that
    notice is served. Similarly, the protective period should run from
    the service of process rather than the filing of the complaint with
    the court. As stated in the note to Rule 26(d), the courts have
    used the service of notice as a convenient reference point for
    assigning priority in taking depositions, but with the elimination
    of priority in new Rule 26(d) the reference point is no longer
    needed. The new procedure is consistent in principle with the
    provisions of Rules 33, 34, and 36 as revised.
      Plaintiff is excused from obtaining leave even during the initial
    30-day period if he gives the special notice provided in
    subdivision (b)(2). The required notice must state that the person
    to be examined is about to go out of the district where the action
    is pending and more than 100 miles from the place of trial, or out
    of the United States, or on a voyage to sea, and will be
    unavailable for examination unless deposed within the 30-day
    period. These events occur most often in maritime litigation, when
    seamen are transferred from one port to another or are about to go
    to sea. Yet, there are analogous situations in nonmaritime
    litigation, and although the maritime problems are more common, a
    rule limited to claims in the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction
    is not justified.
      In the recent unification of the civil and admiralty rules, this
    problem was temporarily met through addition in Rule 26(a) of a
    provision that depositions de bene esse may continue to be taken as
    to admiralty and maritime claims within the meaning of Rule 9(h).
    It was recognized at the time that "a uniform rule applicable alike
    to what are now civil actions and suits in admiralty" was clearly
    preferable, but the de bene esse procedure was adopted "for the
    time being at least." See Advisory Committee's note in Report of
    the Judicial Conference: Proposed Amendments to Rules of Civil
    Procedure 43-44 (1966).
      The changes in Rule 30(a) and the new Rule 30(b)(2) provide a
    formula applicable to ordinary civil as well as maritime claims.
    They replace the provision for depositions de bene esse. They
    authorize an early deposition without leave of court where the
    witness is about to depart and, unless his deposition is promptly
    taken, (1) it will be impossible or very difficult to depose him
    before trial or (2) his deposition can later be taken but only with
    substantially increased effort and expense. Cf. S.S. Hai Chang,
    1966 A.M.C. 2239 (S.D.N.Y. 1966), in which the deposing party is
    required to prepay expenses and counsel fees of the other party's
    lawyer when the action is pending in New York and depositions are
    to be taken on the West Coast. Defendant is protected by a
    provision that the deposition cannot be used against him if he was
    unable through exercise of diligence to obtain counsel to represent
    him.
      The distance of 100 miles from place of trial is derived from the
    de bene esse provision and also conforms to the reach of a subpoena
    of the trial court, as provided in Rule 45(e). See also S.D.N.Y.
    Civ.R. 5(a). Some parts of the de bene esse provision are omitted
    from Rule 30(b)(2). Modern deposition practice adequately covers
    the witness who lives more than 100 miles away from place of trial.
    If a witness is aged or infirm, leave of court can be obtained.
      Subdivision (b). Existing Rule 30(b) on protective orders has
    been transferred to Rule 26(c), and existing Rule 30(a) relating to
    the notice of taking deposition has been transferred to this
    subdivision. Because new material has been added, subsection
    numbers have been inserted.
      Subdivision (b)(1). If a subpoena duces tecum is to be served, a
    copy thereof or a designation of the materials to be produced must
    accompany the notice. Each party is thereby enabled to prepare for
    the deposition more effectively.
      Subdivision (b)(2). This subdivision is discussed in the note to
    subdivision (a), to which it relates.
      Subdivision (b)(3). This provision is derived from existing Rule
    30(a), with a minor change of language.
      Subdivision (b)(4). In order to facilitate less expensive
    procedures, provision is made for the recording of testimony by
    other than stenographic means - e.g., by mechanical, electronic, or
    photographic means. Because these methods give rise to problems of
    accuracy and trustworthiness, the party taking the deposition is
    required to apply for a court order. The order is to specify how
    the testimony is to be recorded, preserved, and filed, and it may
    contain whatever additional safeguards the court deems necessary.
      Subdivision (b)(5). A provision is added to enable a party,
    through service of notice, to require another party to produce
    documents or things at the taking of his deposition. This may now
    be done as to a nonparty deponent through use of a subpoena duces
    tecum as authorized by Rule 45, but some courts have held that
    documents may be secured from a party only under Rule 34. See 2A
    Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 644.1 n.
    83.2, Sec. 792 n. 16 (Wright ed. 1961). With the elimination of
    "good cause" from Rule 34, the reason for this restrictive doctrine
    has disappeared. Cf. N.Y.C.P.L.R. Sec. 3111.
      Whether production of documents or things should be obtained
    directly under Rule 34 or at the deposition under this rule will
    depend on the nature and volume of the documents or things. Both
    methods are made available. When the documents are few and simple,
    and closely related to the oral examination, ability to proceed via
    this rule will facilitate discovery. If the discovering party
    insists on examining many and complex documents at the taking of
    the deposition, thereby causing undue burdens on others, the latter
    may, under Rules 26(c) or 30(d), apply for a court order that the
    examining party proceed via Rule 34 alone.
      Subdivision (b)(6). A new provision is added, whereby a party may
    name a corporation, partnership, association, or governmental
    agency as the deponent and designate the matters on which he
    requests examination, and the organization shall then name one or
    more of its officers, directors, or managing agents, or other
    persons consenting to appear and testify on its behalf with respect
    to matters known or reasonably available to the organization. Cf.
    Alberta Sup.Ct.R. 255. The organization may designate persons other
    than officers, directors, and managing agents, but only with their
    consent. Thus, an employee or agent who has an independent or
    conflicting interest in the litigation - for example, in a personal
    injury case - can refuse to testify on behalf of the organization.
      This procedure supplements the existing practice whereby the
    examining party designates the corporate official to be deposed.
    Thus, if the examining party believes that certain officials who
    have not testified pursuant to this subdivision have added
    information, he may depose them. On the other hand, a court's
    decision whether to issue a protective order may take account of
    the availability and use made of the procedures provided in this
    subdivision.
      The new procedure should be viewed as an added facility for
    discovery, one which may be advantageous to both sides as well as
    an improvement in the deposition process. It will reduce the
    difficulties now encountered in determining, prior to the taking of
    a deposition, whether a particular employee or agent is a "managing
    agent." See Note, Discovery Against Corporations Under the Federal
    Rules, 47 Iowa L.Rev. 1006-1016 (1962). It will curb the "bandying"
    by which officers or managing agents of a corporation are deposed
    in turn but each disclaims knowledge of facts that are clearly
    known to persons in the organization and thereby to it. Cf. Haney
    v. Woodward & Lothrop, Inc., 330 F.2d 940, 944 (4th Cir. 1964). The
    provisions should also assist organizations which find that an
    unnecessarily large number of their officers and agents are being
    deposed by a party uncertain of who in the organization has
    knowledge. Some courts have held that under the existing rules a
    corporation should not be burdened with choosing which person is to
    appear for it. E.g., United States v. Gahagan Dredging Corp., 24
    F.R.D. 328, 329 (S.D.N.Y. 1958). This burden is not essentially
    different from that of answering interrogatories under Rule 33, and
    is in any case lighter than that of an examining party ignorant of
    who in the corporation has knowledge.
      Subdivision (c). A new sentence is inserted at the beginning,
    representing the transfer of existing Rule 26(c) to this
    subdivision. Another addition conforms to the new provision in
    subdivision (b)(4).
      The present rule provides that transcription shall be carried out
    unless all parties waive it. In view of the many depositions taken
    from which nothing useful is discovered, the revised language
    provides that transcription is to be performed if any party
    requests it. The fact of the request is relevant to the exercise of
    the court's discretion in determining who shall pay for
    transcription.
      Parties choosing to serve written questions rather than
    participate personally in an oral deposition are directed to serve
    their questions on the party taking the deposition, since the
    officer is often not identified in advance. Confidentiality is
    preserved, since the questions may be served in a sealed envelope.
      Subdivision (d). The assessment of expenses incurred in relation
    to motions made under this subdivision (d) is made subject to the
    provisions of Rule 37(a). The standards for assessment of expenses
    are more fully set out in Rule 37(a), and these standards should
    apply to the essentially similar motions of this subdivision.
      Subdivision (e). The provision relating to the refusal of a
    witness to sign his deposition is tightened through insertion of a
    30-day time period.
      Subdivision (f)(1). A provision is added which codifies in a
    flexible way the procedure for handling exhibits related to the
    deposition and at the same time assures each party that he may
    inspect and copy documents and things produced by a nonparty
    witness in response to subpoena duces tecum. As a general rule and
    in the absence of agreement to the contrary or order of the court,
    exhibits produced without objection are to be annexed to and
    returned with the deposition, but a witness may substitute copies
    for purposes of marking and he may obtain return of the exhibits.
    The right of the parties to inspect exhibits for identification and
    to make copies is assured. Cf. N.Y.C.P.L.R. Sec. 3116(c).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1971 AMENDMENT       
      The subdivision permits a party to name a corporation or other
    form of organization as a deponent in the notice of examination and
    to describe in the notice the matters about which discovery is
    desired. The organization is then obliged to designate natural
    persons to testify on its behalf. The amendment clarifies the
    procedure to be followed if a party desires to examine a non-party
    organization through persons designated by the organization. Under
    the rules, a subpoena rather than a notice of examination is served
    on a non-party to compel attendance at the taking of a deposition.
    The amendment provides that a subpoena may name a non-party
    organization as the deponent and may indicate the matters about
    which discovery is desired. In that event, the non-party
    organization must respond by designating natural persons, who are
    then obliged to testify as to matters known or reasonably available
    to the organization. To insure that a non-party organization that
    is not represented by counsel has knowledge of its duty to
    designate, the amendment directs the party seeking discovery to
    advise of the duty in the body of the subpoena.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1972 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (c). Existing. Rule 43(b), which is to be abrogated,
    deals with the use of leading questions, the calling,
    interrogation, impeachment, and scope of cross-examination of
    adverse parties, officers, etc. These topics are dealt with in many
    places in the Rules of Evidence. Moreover, many pertinent topics
    included in the Rules of Evidence are not mentioned in Rule 43(b),
    e.g. privilege. A reference to the Rules of Evidence generally is
    therefore made in subdivision (c) of Rule 30.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1980 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b)(4). It has been proposed that electronic
    recording of depositions be authorized as a matter of course,
    subject to the right of a party to seek an order that a deposition
    be recorded by stenographic means. The Committee is not satisfied
    that a case has been made for a reversal of present practice. The
    amendment is made to encourage parties to agree to the use of
    electronic recording of depositions so that conflicting claims with
    respect to the potential of electronic recording for reducing costs
    of depositions can be appraised in the light of greater experience.
    The provision that the parties may stipulate that depositions may
    be recorded by other than stenographic means seems implicit in Rule
    29. The amendment makes it explicit. The provision that the
    stipulation or order shall designate the person before whom the
    deposition is to be taken is added to encourage the naming of the
    recording technician as that person, eliminating the necessity of
    the presence of one whose only function is to administer the oath.
    See Rules 28(a) and 29.
      Subdivision (b)(7). Depositions by telephone are now authorized
    by Rule 29 upon stipulation of the parties. The amendment
    authorizes that method by order of the court. The final sentence is
    added to make it clear that when a deposition is taken by telephone
    it is taken in the district and at the place where the witness is
    to answer the questions rather than that where the questions are
    propounded.
      Subdivision (f)(1). For the reasons set out in the Note following
    the amendment of Rule 5(d), the court may wish to permit the
    parties to retain depositions unless they are to be used in the
    action. The amendment of the first paragraph permits the court to
    so order.
      The amendment of the second paragraph is clarifying. The purpose
    of the paragraph is to permit a person who produces materials at a
    deposition to offer copies for marking and annexation to the
    deposition. Such copies are a "substitute" for the originals, which
    are not to be marked and which can thereafter be used or even
    disposed of by the person who produces them. In the light of that
    purpose, the former language of the paragraph had been justly
    termed "opaque." Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure:
    Civil Sec. 2114.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

          EFFECTIVE DATE OF AMENDMENT PROPOSED NOVEMBER 20, 1972      
      Amendment of this rule embraced by the order entered by the
    Supreme Court of the United States on November 20, 1972, effective
    on the 180th day beginning after January 2, 1975, see section 3 of
    Pub. L. 93-595, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1959, set out as a note
    under section 2074 of this title.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). Paragraph (1) retains the first and third
    sentences from the former subdivision (a) without significant
    modification. The second and fourth sentences are relocated.
      Paragraph (2) collects all provisions bearing on requirements of
    leave of court to take a deposition.
      Paragraph (2)(A) is new. It provides a limit on the number of
    depositions the parties may take, absent leave of court or
    stipulation with the other parties. One aim of this revision is to
    assure judicial review under the standards stated in Rule 26(b)(2)
    before any side will be allowed to take more than ten depositions
    in a case without agreement of the other parties. A second
    objective is to emphasize that counsel have a professional
    obligation to develop a mutual cost-effective plan for discovery in
    the case. Leave to take additional depositions should be granted
    when consistent with the principles of Rule 26(b)(2), and in some
    cases the ten-per-side limit should be reduced in accordance with
    those same principles. Consideration should ordinarily be given at
    the planning meeting of the parties under Rule 26(f) and at the
    time of a scheduling conference under Rule 16(b) as to enlargements
    or reductions in the number of depositions, eliminating the need
    for special motions.
      A deposition under Rule 30(b)(6) should, for purposes of this
    limit, be treated as a single deposition even though more than one
    person may be designated to testify.
      In multi-party cases, the parties on any side are expected to
    confer and agree as to which depositions are most needed, given the
    presumptive limit on the number of depositions they can take
    without leave of court. If these disputes cannot be amicably
    resolved, the court can be requested to resolve the dispute or
    permit additional depositions.
      Paragraph (2)(B) is new. It requires leave of court if any
    witness is to be deposed in the action more than once. This
    requirement does not apply when a deposition is temporarily
    recessed for convenience of counsel or the deponent or to enable
    additional materials to be gathered before resuming the deposition.
    If significant travel costs would be incurred to resume the
    deposition, the parties should consider the feasibility of
    conducting the balance of the examination by telephonic means.
      Paragraph (2)(C) revises the second sentence of the former
    subdivision (a) as to when depositions may be taken. Consistent
    with the changes made in Rule 26(d), providing that formal
    discovery ordinarily not commence until after the litigants have
    met and conferred as directed in revised Rule 26(f), the rule
    requires leave of court or agreement of the parties if a deposition
    is to be taken before that time (except when a witness is about to
    leave the country).
      Subdivision (b). The primary change in subdivision (b) is that
    parties will be authorized to record deposition testimony by
    nonstenographic means without first having to obtain permission of
    the court or agreement from other counsel.
      Former subdivision (b)(2) is partly relocated in subdivision
    (a)(2)(C) of this rule. The latter two sentences of the first
    paragraph are deleted, in part because they are redundant to Rule
    26(g) and in part because Rule 11 no longer applies to discovery
    requests. The second paragraph of the former subdivision (b)(2),
    relating to use of depositions at trial where a party was unable to
    obtain counsel in time for an accelerated deposition, is relocated
    in Rule 32.
      New paragraph (2) confers on the party taking the deposition the
    choice of the method of recording, without the need to obtain prior
    court approval for one taken other than stenographically. A party
    choosing to record a deposition only by videotape or audiotape
    should understand that a transcript will be required by Rule
    26(a)(3)(B) and Rule 32(c) if the deposition is later to be offered
    as evidence at trial or on a dispositive motion under Rule 56.
    Objections to the nonstenographic recording of a deposition, when
    warranted by the circumstances, can be presented to the court under
    Rule 26(c).
      Paragraph (3) provides that other parties may arrange, at their
    own expense, for the recording of a deposition by a means
    (stenographic, visual, or sound) in addition to the method
    designated by the person noticing the deposition. The former
    provisions of this paragraph, relating to the court's power to
    change the date of a deposition, have been eliminated as redundant
    in view of Rule 26(c)(2).
      Revised paragraph (4) requires that all depositions be recorded
    by an officer designated or appointed under Rule 28 and contains
    special provisions designed to provide basic safeguards to assure
    the utility and integrity of recordings taken other than
    stenographically.
      Paragraph (7) is revised to authorize the taking of a deposition
    not only by telephone but also by other remote electronic means,
    such as satellite television, when agreed to by the parties or
    authorized by the court.
      Subdivision (c). Minor changes are made in this subdivision to
    reflect those made in subdivision (b) and to complement the new
    provisions of subdivision (d)(1), aimed at reducing the number of
    interruptions during depositions.
      In addition, the revision addresses a recurring problem as to
    whether other potential deponents can attend a deposition. Courts
    have disagreed, some holding that witnesses should be excluded
    through invocation of Rule 615 of the evidence rules, and others
    holding that witnesses may attend unless excluded by an order under
    Rule 26(c)(5). The revision provides that other witnesses are not
    automatically excluded from a deposition simply by the request of a
    party. Exclusion, however, can be ordered under Rule 26(c)(5) when
    appropriate; and, if exclusion is ordered, consideration should be
    given as to whether the excluded witnesses likewise should be
    precluded from reading, or being otherwise informed about, the
    testimony given in the earlier depositions. The revision addresses
    only the matter of attendance by potential deponents, and does not
    attempt to resolve issues concerning attendance by others, such as
    members of the public or press.
      Subdivision (d). The first sentence of new paragraph (1) provides
    that any objections during a deposition must be made concisely and
    in a non-argumentative and non-suggestive manner. Depositions
    frequently have been unduly prolonged, if not unfairly frustrated,
    by lengthy objections and colloquy, often suggesting how the
    deponent should respond. While objections may, under the revised
    rule, be made during a deposition, they ordinarily should be
    limited to those that under Rule 32(d)(3) might be waived if not
    made at that time, i.e., objections on grounds that might be
    immediately obviated, removed, or cured, such as to the form of a
    question or the responsiveness of an answer. Under Rule 32(b),
    other objections can, even without the so-called "usual
    stipulation" preserving objections, be raised for the first time at
    trial and therefore should be kept to a minimum during a
    deposition.
      Directions to a deponent not to answer a question can be even
    more disruptive than objections. The second sentence of new
    paragraph (1) prohibits such directions except in the three
    circumstances indicated: to claim a privilege or protection against
    disclosure (e.g., as work product), to enforce a court directive
    limiting the scope or length of permissible discovery, or to
    suspend a deposition to enable presentation of a motion under
    paragraph (3).
      Paragraph (2) is added to this subdivision to dispel any doubts
    regarding the power of the court by order or local rule to
    establish limits on the length of depositions. The rule also
    explicitly authorizes the court to impose the cost resulting from
    obstructive tactics that unreasonably prolong a deposition on the
    person engaged in such obstruction. This sanction may be imposed on
    a non-party witness as well as a party or attorney, but is
    otherwise congruent with Rule 26(g).
      It is anticipated that limits on the length of depositions
    prescribed by local rules would be presumptive only, subject to
    modification by the court or by agreement of the parties. Such
    modifications typically should be discussed by the parties in their
    meeting under Rule 26(f) and included in the scheduling order
    required by Rule 16(b). Additional time, moreover, should be
    allowed under the revised rule when justified under the principles
    stated in Rule 26(b)(2). To reduce the number of special motions,
    local rules should ordinarily permit - and indeed encourage - the
    parties to agree to additional time, as when, during the taking of
    a deposition, it becomes clear that some additional examination is
    needed.
      Paragraph (3) authorizes appropriate sanctions not only when a
    deposition is unreasonably prolonged, but also when an attorney
    engages in other practices that improperly frustrate the fair
    examination of the deponent, such as making improper objections or
    giving directions not to answer prohibited by paragraph (1). In
    general, counsel should not engage in any conduct during a
    deposition that would not be allowed in the presence of a judicial
    officer. The making of an excessive number of unnecessary
    objections may itself constitute sanctionable conduct, as may the
    refusal of an attorney to agree with other counsel on a fair
    apportionment of the time allowed for examination of a deponent or
    a refusal to agree to a reasonable request for some additional time
    to complete a deposition, when that is permitted by the local rule
    or order.
      Subdivision (e). Various changes are made in this subdivision to
    reduce problems sometimes encountered when depositions are taken
    stenographically. Reporters frequently have difficulties obtaining
    signatures - and the return of depositions - from deponents. Under
    the revision pre-filing review by the deponent is required only if
    requested before the deposition is completed. If review is
    requested, the deponent will be allowed 30 days to review the
    transcript or recording and to indicate any changes in form or
    substance. Signature of the deponent will be required only if
    review is requested and changes are made.
      Subdivision (f). Minor changes are made in this subdivision to
    reflect those made in subdivision (b). In courts which direct that
    depositions not be automatically filed, the reporter can transmit
    the transcript or recording to the attorney taking the deposition
    (or ordering the transcript or record), who then becomes custodian
    for the court of the original record of the deposition. Pursuant to
    subdivision (f)(2), as under the prior rule, any other party is
    entitled to secure a copy of the deposition from the officer
    designated to take the deposition; accordingly, unless ordered or
    agreed, the officer must retain a copy of the recording or the
    stenographic notes.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (d). Paragraph (1) has been amended to clarify the
    terms regarding behavior during depositions. The references to
    objections "to evidence" and limitations "on evidence" have been
    removed to avoid disputes about what is "evidence" and whether an
    objection is to, or a limitation is on, discovery instead. It is
    intended that the rule apply to any objection to a question or
    other issue arising during a deposition, and to any limitation
    imposed by the court in connection with a deposition, which might
    relate to duration or other matters.
      The current rule places limitations on instructions that a
    witness not answer only when the instruction is made by a "party."
    Similar limitations should apply with regard to anyone who might
    purport to instruct a witness not to answer a question.
    Accordingly, the rule is amended to apply the limitation to
    instructions by any person. The amendment is not intended to confer
    new authority on nonparties to instruct witnesses to refuse to
    answer deposition questions. The amendment makes it clear that,
    whatever the legitimacy of giving such instructions, the nonparty
    is subject to the same limitations as parties.
      Paragraph (2) imposes a presumptive durational limitation of one
    day of seven hours for any deposition. The Committee has been
    informed that overlong depositions can result in undue costs and
    delays in some circumstances. This limitation contemplates that
    there will be reasonable breaks during the day for lunch and other
    reasons, and that the only time to be counted is the time occupied
    by the actual deposition. For purposes of this durational limit,
    the deposition of each person designated under Rule 30(b)(6) should
    be considered a separate deposition. The presumptive duration may
    be extended, or otherwise altered, by agreement. Absent agreement,
    a court order is needed. The party seeking a court order to extend
    the examination, or otherwise alter the limitations, is expected to
    show good cause to justify such an order.
      Parties considering extending the time for a deposition - and
    courts asked to order an extension - might consider a variety of
    factors. For example, if the witness needs an interpreter, that may
    prolong the examination. If the examination will cover events
    occurring over a long period of time, that may justify allowing
    additional time. In cases in which the witness will be questioned
    about numerous or lengthy documents, it is often desirable for the
    interrogating party to send copies of the documents to the witness
    sufficiently in advance of the deposition so that the witness can
    become familiar with them. Should the witness nevertheless not read
    the documents in advance, thereby prolonging the deposition, a
    court could consider that a reason for extending the time limit. If
    the examination reveals that documents have been requested but not
    produced, that may justify further examination once production has
    occurred. In multi-party cases, the need for each party to examine
    the witness may warrant additional time, although duplicative
    questioning should be avoided and parties with similar interests
    should strive to designate one lawyer to question about areas of
    common interest. Similarly, should the lawyer for the witness want
    to examine the witness, that may require additional time. Finally,
    with regard to expert witnesses, there may more often be a need for
    additional time - even after the submission of the report required
    by Rule 26(a)(2) - for full exploration of the theories upon which
    the witness relies.
      It is expected that in most instances the parties and the witness
    will make reasonable accommodations to avoid the need for resort to
    the court. The limitation is phrased in terms of a single day on
    the assumption that ordinarily a single day would be preferable to
    a deposition extending over multiple days; if alternative
    arrangements would better suit the parties, they may agree to them.
    It is also assumed that there will be reasonable breaks during the
    day. Preoccupation with timing is to be avoided.
      The rule directs the court to allow additional time where
    consistent with Rule 26(b)(2) if needed for a fair examination of
    the deponent. In addition, if the deponent or another person
    impedes or delays the examination, the court must authorize extra
    time. The amendment makes clear that additional time should also be
    allowed where the examination is impeded by an "other
    circumstance," which might include a power outage, a health
    emergency, or other event.
      In keeping with the amendment to Rule 26(b)(2), the provision
    added in 1993 granting authority to adopt a local rule limiting the
    time permitted for depositions has been removed. The court may
    enter a case-specific order directing shorter depositions for all
    depositions in a case or with regard to a specific witness. The
    court may also order that a deposition be taken for limited periods
    on several days.
      Paragraph (3) includes sanctions provisions formerly included in
    paragraph (2). It authorizes the court to impose an appropriate
    sanction on any person responsible for an impediment that
    frustrated the fair examination of the deponent. This could include
    the deponent, any party, or any other person involved in the
    deposition. If the impediment or delay results from an "other
    circumstance" under paragraph (2), ordinarily no sanction would be
    appropriate.
      Former paragraph (3) has been renumbered (4) but is otherwise
    unchanged.
      Subdivision (f)(1). This subdivision is amended because Rule 5(d)
    has been amended to direct that discovery materials, including
    depositions, ordinarily should not be filed. The rule already has
    provisions directing that the lawyer who arranged for the
    transcript or recording preserve the deposition. Rule 5(d) provides
    that, once the deposition is used in the proceeding, the attorney
    must file it with the court.
      "Shall" is replaced by "must" or "may" under the program to
    conform amended rules to current style conventions when there is no
    ambiguity.
      GAP Report. The Advisory Committee recommends deleting the
    requirement in the published proposed amendments that the deponent
    consent to extending a deposition beyond one day, and adding an
    amendment to Rule 30(f)(1) to conform to the published amendment to
    Rule 5(d) regarding filing of depositions. It also recommends
    conforming the Committee Note with regard to the deponent veto, and
    adding material to the Note to provide direction on computation of
    the durational limitation on depositions, to provide examples of
    situations in which the parties might agree - or the court order -
    that a deposition be extended, and to make clear that no new
    authority to instruct a witness is conferred by the amendment. One
    minor wording improvement in the Note is also suggested.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 30 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      The right to arrange a deposition transcription should be open to
    any party, regardless of the means of recording and regardless of
    who noticed the deposition.
      "[O]ther entity" is added to the list of organizations that may
    be named as deponent. The purpose is to ensure that the deposition
    process can be used to reach information known or reasonably
    available to an organization no matter what abstract fictive
    concept is used to describe the organization. Nothing is gained by
    wrangling over the place to fit into current rule language such
    entities as limited liability companies, limited partnerships,
    business trusts, more exotic common-law creations, or forms
    developed in other countries.

    TITLE V. DISCLOSURES AND DISCOVERY

-HEAD-
    Rule 31. Depositions by Written Questions

-STATUTE-
      (a) When a Deposition May Be Taken.
        (1) Without Leave. A party may, by written questions, depose
      any person, including a party, without leave of court except as
      provided in Rule 31(a)(2). The deponent's attendance may be
      compelled by subpoena under Rule 45.
        (2) With Leave. A party must obtain leave of court, and the
      court must grant leave to the extent consistent with Rule
      26(b)(2):
          (A) if the parties have not stipulated to the deposition and:
            (i) the deposition would result in more than 10 depositions
          being taken under this rule or Rule 30 by the plaintiffs, or
          by the defendants, or by the third-party defendants;
            (ii) the deponent has already been deposed in the case; or
            (iii) the party seeks to take a deposition before the time
          specified in Rule 26(d); or

          (B) if the deponent is confined in prison.

        (3) Service; Required Notice. A party who wants to depose a
      person by written questions must serve them on every other party,
      with a notice stating, if known, the deponent's name and address.
      If the name is unknown, the notice must provide a general
      description sufficient to identify the person or the particular
      class or group to which the person belongs. The notice must also
      state the name or descriptive title and the address of the
      officer before whom the deposition will be taken.
        (4) Questions Directed to an Organization. A public or private
      corporation, a partnership, an association, or a governmental
      agency may be deposed by written questions in accordance with
      Rule 30(b)(6).
        (5) Questions from Other Parties. Any questions to the deponent
      from other parties must be served on all parties as follows:
      cross-questions, within 14 days after being served with the
      notice and direct questions; redirect questions, within 7 days
      after being served with cross-questions; and recross-questions,
      within 7 days after being served with redirect questions. The
      court may, for good cause, extend or shorten these times.

      (b) Delivery to the Officer; Officer's Duties. The party who
    noticed the deposition must deliver to the officer a copy of all
    the questions served and of the notice. The officer must promptly
    proceed in the manner provided in Rule 30(c), (e), and (f) to:
        (1) take the deponent's testimony in response to the questions;
        (2) prepare and certify the deposition; and
        (3) send it to the party, attaching a copy of the questions and
      of the notice.

      (c) Notice of Completion or Filing.
        (1) Completion. The party who noticed the deposition must
      notify all other parties when it is completed.
        (2) Filing. A party who files the deposition must promptly
      notify all other parties of the filing.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      This rule is in accordance with common practice. In most of the
    states listed in the Note to Rule 26(a), provisions similar to this
    rule will be found in the statutes which in their respective
    statutory compilations follow those cited in the Note to Rule
    26(a).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1970 AMENDMENT       
      Confusion is created by the use of the same terminology to
    describe both the taking of a deposition upon "written
    interrogatories" pursuant to this rule and the serving of "written
    interrogatories" upon parties pursuant to Rule 33. The distinction
    between these two modes of discovery will be more readily and
    clearly grasped through substitution of the word "questions" for
    "interrogatories" throughout this rule.
      Subdivision (a). A new paragraph is inserted at the beginning of
    this subdivision to conform to the rearrangement of provisions in
    Rules 26(a), 30(a), and 30(b).
      The revised subdivision permits designation of the deponent by
    general description or by class or group. This conforms to the
    practice for depositions on oral examination.
      The new procedure provided in Rule 30(b)(6) for taking the
    deposition of a corporation or other organization through persons
    designated by the organization is incorporated by reference.
      The service of all questions, including cross, redirect, and
    recross, is to be made on all parties. This will inform the parties
    and enable them to participate fully in the procedure.
      The time allowed for service of cross, redirect, and recross
    questions has been extended. Experience with the existing time
    limits shows them to be unrealistically short. No special
    restriction is placed on the time for serving the notice of taking
    the deposition and the first set of questions. Since no party is
    required to serve cross questions less than 30 days after the
    notice and questions are served, the defendant has sufficient time
    to obtain counsel. The court may for cause shown enlarge or shorten
    the time.
      Subdivision (d). Since new Rule 26(c) provides for protective
    orders with respect to all discovery, and expressly provides that
    the court may order that one discovery device be used in place of
    another, subdivision (d) is eliminated as unnecessary.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The first paragraph of subdivision (a) is
    divided into two subparagraphs, with provisions comparable to those
    made in the revision of Rule 30. Changes are made in the former
    third paragraph, numbered in the revision as paragraph (4), to
    reduce the total time for developing cross-examination, redirect,
    and recross questions from 50 days to 28 days.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 31 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      The party who noticed a deposition on written questions must
    notify all other parties when the deposition is completed, so that
    they may make use of the deposition. A deposition is completed when
    it is recorded and the deponent has either waived or exercised the
    right of review under Rule 30(e)(1).

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE V. DISCLOSURES AND DISCOVERY

-HEAD-
    Rule 32. Using Depositions in Court Proceedings

-STATUTE-
      (a) Using Depositions.
        (1) In General. At a hearing or trial, all or part of a
      deposition may be used against a party on these conditions:
          (A) the party was present or represented at the taking of the
        deposition or had reasonable notice of it;
          (B) it is used to the extent it would be admissible under the
        Federal Rules of Evidence if the deponent were present and
        testifying; and
          (C) the use is allowed by Rule 32(a)(2) through (8).

        (2) Impeachment and Other Uses. Any party may use a deposition
      to contradict or impeach the testimony given by the deponent as a
      witness, or for any other purpose allowed by the Federal Rules of
      Evidence.
        (3) Deposition of Party, Agent, or Designee. An adverse party
      may use for any purpose the deposition of a party or anyone who,
      when deposed, was the party's officer, director, managing agent,
      or designee under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4).
        (4) Unavailable Witness. A party may use for any purpose the
      deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, if the court
      finds:
          (A) that the witness is dead;
          (B) that the witness is more than 100 miles from the place of
        hearing or trial or is outside the United States, unless it
        appears that the witness's absence was procured by the party
        offering the deposition;
          (C) that the witness cannot attend or testify because of age,
        illness, infirmity, or imprisonment;
          (D) that the party offering the deposition could not procure
        the witness's attendance by subpoena; or
          (E) on motion and notice, that exceptional circumstances make
        it desirable - in the interest of justice and with due regard
        to the importance of live testimony in open court - to permit
        the deposition to be used.

        (5) Limitations on Use.
          (A) Deposition Taken on Short Notice. A deposition must not
        be used against a party who, having received less than 14 days'
        notice of the deposition, promptly moved for a protective order
        under Rule 26(c)(1)(B) requesting that it not be taken or be
        taken at a different time or place - and this motion was still
        pending when the deposition was taken.
          (B) Unavailable Deponent; Party Could Not Obtain an Attorney.
        A deposition taken without leave of court under the
        unavailability provision of Rule 30(a)(2)(A)(iii) must not be
        used against a party who shows that, when served with the
        notice, it could not, despite diligent efforts, obtain an
        attorney to represent it at the deposition.

        (6) Using Part of a Deposition. If a party offers in evidence
      only part of a deposition, an adverse party may require the
      offeror to introduce other parts that in fairness should be
      considered with the part introduced, and any party may itself
      introduce any other parts.
        (7) Substituting a Party. Substituting a party under Rule 25
      does not affect the right to use a deposition previously taken.
        (8) Deposition Taken in an Earlier Action. A deposition
      lawfully taken and, if required, filed in any federal- or state-
      court action may be used in a later action involving the same
      subject matter between the same parties, or their representatives
      or successors in interest, to the same extent as if taken in the
      later action. A deposition previously taken may also be used as
      allowed by the Federal Rules of Evidence.

      (b) Objections to Admissibility. Subject to Rules 28(b) and
    32(d)(3), an objection may be made at a hearing or trial to the
    admission of any deposition testimony that would be inadmissible if
    the witness were present and testifying.
      (c) Form of Presentation. Unless the court orders otherwise, a
    party must provide a transcript of any deposition testimony the
    party offers, but may provide the court with the testimony in
    nontranscript form as well. On any party's request, deposition
    testimony offered in a jury trial for any purpose other than
    impeachment must be presented in nontranscript form, if available,
    unless the court for good cause orders otherwise.
      (d) Waiver of Objections.
        (1) To the Notice. An objection to an error or irregularity in
      a deposition notice is waived unless promptly served in writing
      on the party giving the notice.
        (2) To the Officer's Qualification. An objection based on
      disqualification of the officer before whom a deposition is to be
      taken is waived if not made:
          (A) before the deposition begins; or
          (B) promptly after the basis for disqualification becomes
        known or, with reasonable diligence, could have been known.

        (3) To the Taking of the Deposition.
          (A) Objection to Competence, Relevance, or Materiality. An
        objection to a deponent's competence - or to the competence,
        relevance, or materiality of testimony - is not waived by a
        failure to make the objection before or during the deposition,
        unless the ground for it might have been corrected at that
        time.
          (B) Objection to an Error or Irregularity. An objection to an
        error or irregularity at an oral examination is waived if:
            (i) it relates to the manner of taking the deposition, the
          form of a question or answer, the oath or affirmation, a
          party's conduct, or other matters that might have been
          corrected at that time; and
            (ii) it is not timely made during the deposition.

          (C) Objection to a Written Question. An objection to the form
        of a written question under Rule 31 is waived if not served in
        writing on the party submitting the question within the time
        for serving responsive questions or, if the question is a
        recross-question, within 7 days after being served with it.

        (4) To Completing and Returning the Deposition. An objection to
      how the officer transcribed the testimony - or prepared, signed,
      certified, sealed, endorsed, sent, or otherwise dealt with the
      deposition - is waived unless a motion to suppress is made
      promptly after the error or irregularity becomes known or, with
      reasonable diligence, could have been known.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      This rule is in accordance with common practice. In most of the
    states listed in the Note to Rule 26, provisions similar to this
    rule will be found in the statutes which in their respective
    statutory compilations follow those cited in the Note to Rule 26.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1970 AMENDMENT       
      As part of the rearrangement of the discovery rules, existing
    subdivisions (d), (e), and (f) of Rule 26 are transferred to Rule
    32 as new subdivisions (a), (b), and (c). The provisions of Rule 32
    are retained as subdivision (d) of Rule 32 with appropriate changes
    in the lettering and numbering of subheadings. The new rule is
    given a suitable new title. A beneficial byproduct of the
    rearrangement is that provisions which are naturally related to one
    another are placed in one rule.
      A change is made in new Rule 32(a), whereby it is made clear that
    the rules of evidence are to be applied to depositions offered at
    trial as though the deponent were then present and testifying at
    trial. This eliminates the possibility of certain technical hearsay
    objections which are based, not on the contents of deponent's
    testimony, but on his absence from court. The language of present
    Rule 26(d) does not appear to authorize these technical objections,
    but it is not entirely clear. Note present Rule 26(e), transferred
    to Rule 32(b); see 2A Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice and
    Procedure 164-166 (Wright ed. 1961).
      An addition in Rule 32(a)(2) provides for use of a deposition of
    a person designated by a corporation or other organization, which
    is a party, to testify on its behalf. This complements the new
    procedure for taking the deposition of a corporation or other
    organization provided in Rules 30(b)(6) and 31(a). The addition is
    appropriate, since the deposition is in substance and effect that
    of the corporation or other organization which is a party.
      A change is made in the standard under which a party offering
    part of a deposition in evidence may be required to introduce
    additional parts of the deposition. The new standard is contained
    in a proposal made by the Advisory Committee on Rules of Evidence.
    See Rule 1-07 and accompanying Note, Preliminary Draft of Proposed
    Rules of Evidence for the United States District Courts and
    Magistrates 21-22 (March, 1969).
      References to other rules are changed to conform to the
    rearrangement, and minor verbal changes have been made for
    clarification. The time for objecting to written questions served
    under Rule 31 is slightly extended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1972 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (e). The concept of "making a person one's own
    witness" appears to have had significance principally in two
    respects: impeachment and waiver of incompetency. Neither retains
    any vitality under the Rules of Evidence. The old prohibition
    against impeaching one's own witness is eliminated by Evidence Rule
    607. The lack of recognition in the Rules of Evidence of state
    rules of incompetency in the Dead Man's area renders it unnecessary
    to consider aspects of waiver arising from calling the incompetent
    party witness. Subdivision (c) is deleted because it appears to be
    no longer necessary in the light of the Rules of Evidence.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1980 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a)(1). Rule 801(d) of the Federal Rules of Evidence
    permits a prior inconsistent statement of a witness in a deposition
    to be used as substantive evidence. And Rule 801(d)(2) makes the
    statement of an agent or servant admissible against the principal
    under the circumstances described in the Rule. The language of the
    present subdivision is, therefore, too narrow.
      Subdivision (a)(4). The requirement that a prior action must have
    been dismissed before depositions taken for use in it can be used
    in a subsequent action was doubtless an oversight, and the courts
    have ignored it. See Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and
    Procedure: Civil Sec. 2150. The final sentence is added to reflect
    the fact that the Federal Rules of Evidence permit a broader use of
    depositions previously taken under certain circumstances. For
    example, Rule 804(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides
    that if a witness is unavailable, as that term is defined by the
    rule, his deposition in any earlier proceeding can be used against
    a party to the prior proceeding who had an opportunity and similar
    motive to develop the testimony of the witness.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The last sentence of revised subdivision (a) not
    only includes the substance of the provisions formerly contained in
    the second paragraph of Rule 30(b)(2), but adds a provision to deal
    with the situation when a party, receiving minimal notice of a
    proposed deposition, is unable to obtain a court ruling on its
    motion for a protective order seeking to delay or change the place
    of the deposition. Ordinarily a party does not obtain protection
    merely by the filing of a motion for a protective order under Rule
    26(c); any protection is dependent upon the court's ruling. Under
    the revision, a party receiving less than 11 days notice of a
    deposition can, provided its motion for a protective order is filed
    promptly, be spared the risks resulting from nonattendance at the
    deposition held before its motion is ruled upon. Although the
    revision of Rule 32(a) covers only the risk that the deposition
    could be used against the non-appearing movant, it should also
    follow that, when the proposed deponent is the movant, the deponent
    would have "just cause" for failing to appear for purposes of Rule
    37(d)(1). Inclusion of this provision is not intended to signify
    that 11 days' notice is the minimum advance notice for all
    depositions or that greater than 10 days should necessarily be
    deemed sufficient in all situations.
      Subdivision (c). This new subdivision, inserted at the location
    of a subdivision previously abrogated, is included in view of the
    increased opportunities for video-recording and audio-recording of
    depositions under revised Rule 30(b). Under this rule a party may
    offer deposition testimony in any of the forms authorized under
    Rule 30(b) but, if offering it in a nonstenographic form, must
    provide the court with a transcript of the portions so offered. On
    request of any party in a jury trial, deposition testimony offered
    other than for impeachment purposes is to be presented in a
    nonstenographic form if available, unless the court directs
    otherwise. Note that under Rule 26(a)(3)(B) a party expecting to
    use nonstenographic deposition testimony as substantive evidence is
    required to provide other parties with a transcript in advance of
    trial.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 32 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Former Rule 32(a) applied "[a]t the trial or upon the hearing of
    a motion or an interlocutory proceeding." The amended rule
    describes the same events as "a hearing or trial."
      The final paragraph of former Rule 32(a) allowed use in a later
    action of a deposition "lawfully taken and duly filed in the former
    action." Because of the 2000 amendment of Rule 5(d), many
    depositions are not filed. Amended Rule 32(a)(8) reflects this
    change by excluding use of an unfiled deposition only if filing was
    required in the former action.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The times set in the former rule at less than 11 days and within
    5 days have been revised to 14 days and 7 days. See the Note to
    Rule 6.

-HEAD-
    Rule 33. Interrogatories to Parties

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General.
        (1) Number. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the
      court, a party may serve on any other party no more than 25
      written interrogatories, including all discrete subparts. Leave
      to serve additional interrogatories may be granted to the extent
      consistent with Rule 26(b)(2).
        (2) Scope. An interrogatory may relate to any matter that may
      be inquired into under Rule 26(b). An interrogatory is not
      objectionable merely because it asks for an opinion or contention
      that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the
      court may order that the interrogatory need not be answered until
      designated discovery is complete, or until a pretrial conference
      or some other time.

      (b) Answers and Objections.
        (1) Responding Party. The interrogatories must be answered:
          (A) by the party to whom they are directed; or
          (B) if that party is a public or private corporation, a
        partnership, an association, or a governmental agency, by any
        officer or agent, who must furnish the information available to
        the party.

        (2) Time to Respond. The responding party must serve its
      answers and any objections within 30 days after being served with
      the interrogatories. A shorter or longer time may be stipulated
      to under Rule 29 or be ordered by the court.
        (3) Answering Each Interrogatory. Each interrogatory must, to
      the extent it is not objected to, be answered separately and
      fully in writing under oath.
        (4) Objections. The grounds for objecting to an interrogatory
      must be stated with specificity. Any ground not stated in a
      timely objection is waived unless the court, for good cause,
      excuses the failure.
        (5) Signature. The person who makes the answers must sign them,
      and the attorney who objects must sign any objections.

      (c) Use. An answer to an interrogatory may be used to the extent
    allowed by the Federal Rules of Evidence.
      (d) Option to Produce Business Records. If the answer to an
    interrogatory may be determined by examining, auditing, compiling,
    abstracting, or summarizing a party's business records (including
    electronically stored information), and if the burden of deriving
    or ascertaining the answer will be substantially the same for
    either party, the responding party may answer by:
        (1) specifying the records that must be reviewed, in sufficient
      detail to enable the interrogating party to locate and identify
      them as readily as the responding party could; and
        (2) giving the interrogating party a reasonable opportunity to
      examine and audit the records and to make copies, compilations,
      abstracts, or summaries.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      This rule restates the substance of [former] Equity Rule 58
    (Discovery - Interrogatories - Inspection and Production of
    Documents - Admission of Execution or Genuineness), with
    modifications to conform to these rules.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      The added second sentence in the first paragraph of Rule 33
    conforms with a similar change in Rule 26(a) and will avoid
    litigation as to when the interrogatories may be served. Original
    Rule 33 does not state the times at which parties may serve written
    interrogatories upon each other. It has been the accepted view,
    however, that the times were the same in Rule 33 as those stated in
    Rule 26(a). United States v. American Solvents & Chemical Corp. of
    California (D.Del. 1939) 30 F.Supp. 107; Sheldon v. Great Lakes
    Transit Corp. (W.D.N.Y. 1942) 5 Fed.Rules Serv. 33.11, Case 3;
    Musher Foundation, Inc. v. Alba Trading Co. (S.D.N.Y. 1941) 42
    F.Supp. 281; 2 Moore's Federal Practice, (1938) 2621. The time
    within which leave of court must be secured by a plaintiff has been
    fixed at 10 days, in view of the fact that a defendant has 10 days
    within which to make objections in any case, which should give him
    ample time to engage counsel and prepare.
      Further in the first paragraph of Rule 33, the word "service" is
    substituted for "delivery" in conformance with the use of the word
    "serve" elsewhere in the rule and generally throughout the rules.
    See also Note to Rule 13(a) herein. The portion of the rule dealing
    with practice on objections has been revised so as to afford a
    clearer statement of the procedure. The addition of the words "to
    interrogatories to which objection is made" insures that only the
    answers to the objectionable interrogatories may be deferred, and
    that the answers to interrogatories not objectionable shall be
    forthcoming within the time prescribed in the rule. Under the
    original wording, answers to all interrogatories may be withheld
    until objections, sometimes to but a few interrogatories, are
    determined. The amendment expedites the procedure of the rule and
    serves to eliminate the strike value of objections to minor
    interrogatories. The elimination of the last sentence of the
    original rule is in line with the policy stated subsequently in
    this note.
      The added second paragraph in Rule 33 contributes clarity and
    specificity as to the use and scope of interrogatories to the
    parties. The field of inquiry will be as broad as the scope of
    examination under Rule 26(b). There is no reason why
    interrogatories should be more limited than depositions,
    particularly when the former represent an inexpensive means of
    securing useful information. See Hoffman v. Wilson Line, Inc.
    (E.D.Pa. 1946) 9 Fed.Rules Serv. 33.514, Case 2; Brewster v.
    Technicolor, Inc. (S.D.N.Y. 1941) 5 Fed.Rules Serv. 33.319, Case 3;
    Kingsway Press, Inc. v. Farrell Publishing Corp. (S.D.N.Y. 1939) 30
    F.Supp. 775. Under present Rule 33 some courts have unnecessarily
    restricted the breadth of inquiry on various grounds. See Auer v.
    Hershey Creamery Co. (D.N.J. 1939) 2 Fed.Rules Serv. 33.31, Case 2,
    1 F.R.D. 14; Tudor v. Leslie (D.Mass. 1940) 4 Fed.Rules Serv.
    33.324, Case 1. Other courts have read into the rule the
    requirement that interrogation should be directed only towards
    "important facts", and have tended to fix a more or less arbitrary
    limit as to the number of interrogatories which could be asked in
    any case. See Knox v. Alter (W.D.Pa. 1942) 6 Fed.Rules Serv.
    33.352, Case 1; Byers Theaters, Inc. v. Murphy (W.D.Va. 1940) 3
    Fed.Rules Serv. 33.31, Case 3, 1 F.R.D. 286; Coca-Cola Co. v. Dixi-
    Cola Laboratories, Inc. (D.Md. 1939) 30 F.Supp. 275. See also
    comment on these restrictions in Holtzoff, Instruments of Discovery
    Under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (1942) 41 Mich.L.Rev. 205,
    216-217. Under amended Rule 33, the party interrogated is given the
    right to invoke such protective orders under Rule 30(b) as are
    appropriate to the situation. At the same time, it is provided that
    the number of or number of sets of interrogatories to be served may
    not be limited arbitrarily or as a general policy to any particular
    number, but that a limit may be fixed only as justice requires to
    avoid annoyance, expense, embarrassment or oppression in individual
    cases. The party interrogated, therefore, must show the necessity
    for limitation on that basis. It will be noted that in accord with
    this change the last sentence of the present rule, restricting the
    sets of interrogatories to be served, has been stricken. In J.
    Schoeneman, Inc. v. Brauer (W.D.Mo. 1940) 3 Fed.Rules Serv. 33.31,
    Case 2, the court said: "Rule 33 . . . has been interpreted . . .
    as being just as broad in its implications as in the case of
    depositions . . . It makes no difference therefore, how many
    interrogatories are propounded. If the inquiries are pertinent the
    opposing party cannot complain." To the same effect, see Canuso v.
    City of Niagara Falls (W.D.N.Y. 1945) 8 Fed.Rules Serv. 33.352,
    Case 1; Hoffman v. Wilson Line, Inc., supra.
      By virtue of express language in the added second paragraph of
    Rule 33, as amended, any uncertainty as to the use of the answers
    to interrogatories is removed. The omission of a provision on this
    score in the original rule has caused some difficulty. See, e.g.,
    Bailey v. New England Mutual Life Ins. Co. (S.D.Cal. 1940) 4
    Fed.Rules Serv. 33.46, Case 1.
      The second sentence of the second paragraph in Rule 33, as
    amended, concerns the situation where a party wishes to serve
    interrogatories on a party after having taken his deposition, or
    vice versa. It has been held that an oral examination of a party,
    after the submission to him and answer of interrogatories, would be
    permitted. Howard v. State Marine Corp. (S.D.N.Y. 1940) 4 Fed.Rules
    Serv. 33.62, Case 1, 1 F.R.D. 499; Stevens v. Minder Construction
    Co. (S.D.N.Y. 1943) 7 Fed.Rules Serv. 30b.31, Case 2. But
    objections have been sustained to interrogatories served after the
    oral deposition of a party had been taken. McNally v. Simons
    (S.D.N.Y. 1940) 3 Fed.Rules Serv. 33.61, Case 1, 1 F.R.D. 254;
    Currier v. Currier (S.D.N.Y. 1942) 6 Fed.Rules Serv. 33.61, Case 1.
    Rule 33, as amended, permits either interrogatories after a
    deposition or a deposition after interrogatories. It may be quite
    desirable or necessary to elicit additional information by the
    inexpensive method of interrogatories where a deposition has
    already been taken. The party to be interrogated, however, may seek
    a protective order from the court under Rule 30(b) where the
    additional deposition or interrogation works a hardship or
    injustice on the party from whom it is sought.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1970 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The mechanics of the operation of Rule 33 are
    substantially revised by the proposed amendment, with a view to
    reducing court intervention. There is general agreement that
    interrogatories spawn a greater percentage of objections and
    motions than any other discovery device. The Columbia Survey shows
    that, although half of the litigants resorted to depositions and
    about one-third used interrogatories, about 65 percent of the
    objections were made with respect to interrogatories and 26 percent
    related to depositions. See also Speck, The Use of Discovery in
    United States District Courts, 60 Yale L.J. 1132, 1144, 1151
    (1951); Note, 36 Minn.L.Rev. 364, 379 (1952).
      The procedures now provided in Rule 33 seem calculated to
    encourage objections and court motions. The time periods now
    allowed for responding to interrogatories - 15 days for answers and
    10 days for objections - are too short. The Columbia Survey shows
    that tardy response to interrogatories is common, virtually
    expected. The same was reported in Speck, supra, 60 Yale L.J. 1132,
    1144. The time pressures tend to encourage objections as a means of
    gaining time to answer.
      The time for objections is even shorter than for answers, and the
    party runs the risk that if he fails to object in time he may have
    waived his objections. E.g., Cleminshaw v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 21
    F.R.D. 300 (D.Del. 1957); see 4 Moore's Federal Practice, &#182;
    33.27 (2d ed. 1966); 2A Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice and
    Procedure 372-373 (Wright ed. 1961). It often seems easier to
    object than to seek an extension of time. Unlike Rules 30(d) and
    37(a), Rule 33 imposes no sanction of expenses on a party whose
    objections are clearly unjustified.
      Rule 33 assures that the objections will lead directly to court,
    through its requirement that they be served with a notice of
    hearing. Although this procedure does preclude an out-of-court
    resolution of the dispute, the procedure tends to discourage
    informal negotiations. If answers are served and they are thought
    inadequate, the interrogating party may move under Rule 37(a) for
    an order compelling adequate answers. There is no assurance that
    the hearing on objections and that on inadequate answers will be
    heard together.
      The amendment improves the procedure of Rule 33 in the following
    respects:
      (1) The time allowed for response is increased to 30 days and
    this time period applies to both answers and objections, but a
    defendant need not respond in less than 45 days after service of
    the summons and complaint upon him. As is true under existing law,
    the responding party who believes that some parts or all of the
    interrogatories are objectionable may choose to seek a protective
    order under new Rule 26(c) or may serve objections under this rule.
    Unless he applies for a protective order, he is required to serve
    answers or objections in response to the interrogatories, subject
    to the sanctions provided in Rule 37(d). Answers and objections are
    served together, so that a response to each interrogatory is
    encouraged, and any failure to respond is easily noted.
      (2) In view of the enlarged time permitted for response, it is no
    longer necessary to require leave of court for service of
    interrogatories. The purpose of this requirement - that defendant
    have time to obtain counsel before a response must be made - is
    adequately fulfilled by the requirement that interrogatories be
    served upon a party with or after service of the summons and
    complaint upon him.
      Some would urge that the plaintiff nevertheless not be permitted
    to serve interrogatories with the complaint. They fear that a
    routine practice might be invited, whereby form interrogatories
    would accompany most complaints. More fundamentally, they feel
    that, since very general complaints are permitted in present-day
    pleading, it is fair that the defendant have a right to take the
    lead in serving interrogatories. (These views apply also to Rule
    36.) The amendment of Rule 33 rejects these views, in favor of
    allowing both parties to go forward with discovery, each free to
    obtain the information he needs respecting the case.
      (3) If objections are made, the burden is on the interrogating
    party to move under Rule 37(a) for a court order compelling
    answers, in the course of which the court will pass on the
    objections. The change in the burden of going forward does not
    alter the existing obligation of an objecting party to justify his
    objections. E.g., Pressley v. Boehlke, 33 F.R.D. 316 (W.D.N.C.
    1963). If the discovering party asserts than an answer is
    incomplete or evasive, again he may look to Rule 37(a) for relief,
    and he should add this assertion to his motion to overrule
    objections. There is no requirement that the parties consult
    informally concerning their differences, but the new procedure
    should encourage consultation, and the court may by local rule
    require it.
      The proposed changes are similar in approach to those adopted by
    California in 1961. See Calif.Code Civ.Proc. Sec. 2030(a). The
    experience of the Los Angeles Superior Court is informally reported
    as showing that the California amendment resulted in a significant
    reduction in court motions concerning interrogatories. Rhode Island
    takes a similar approach. See R. 33, R.I.R.Civ.Proc. Official
    Draft, p. 74 (Boston Law Book Co.).
      A change is made in subdivision (a) which is not related to the
    sequence of procedures. The restriction to "adverse" parties is
    eliminated. The courts have generally construed this restriction as
    precluding interrogatories unless an issue between the parties is
    disclosed by the pleadings - even though the parties may have
    conflicting interests. E.g., Mozeika v. Kaufman Construction Co.,
    25 F.R.D. 233 (E.D.Pa. 1960) (plaintiff and third-party defendant);
    Biddle v. Hutchinson, 24 F.R.D. 256 (M.D.Pa. 1959) (codefendants).
    The resulting distinctions have often been highly technical. In
    Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U.S. 104 (1964), the Supreme Court
    rejected a contention that examination under Rule 35 could be had
    only against an "opposing" party, as not in keeping "with the aims
    of a liberal, nontechnical application of the Federal Rules." 379
    U.S. at 116. Eliminating the requirement of "adverse" parties from
    Rule 33 brings it into line with all other discovery rules.
      A second change in subdivision (a) is the addition of the term
    "governmental agency" to the listing of organizations whose answers
    are to be made by any officer or agent of the organization. This
    does not involve any change in existing law. Compare the similar
    listing in Rule 30(b)(6).
      The duty of a party to supplement his answers to interrogatories
    is governed by a new provision in Rule 26(e).
      Subdivision (b). There are numerous and conflicting decisions on
    the question whether and to what extent interrogatories are limited
    to matters "of fact," or may elicit opinions, contentions, and
    legal conclusions. Compare, e.g., Payer, Hewitt & Co. v. Bellanca
    Corp., 26 F.R.D. 219 (D.Del. 1960) (opinions bad); Zinsky v. New
    York Central R.R., 36 F.R.D. 680 (N.D.Ohio 1964) (factual opinion
    or contention good, but legal theory bad); United States v. Carter
    Products, Inc., 28 F.R.D. 373 (S.D.N.Y.1961) (factual contentions
    and legal theories bad) with Taylor v. Sound Steamship Lines, Inc.,
    100 F.Supp. 388 (D.Conn. 1951) (opinions good), Bynum v. United
    States, 36 F.R.D. 14 (E.D.La. 1964) (contentions as to facts
    constituting negligence good). For lists of the many conflicting
    authorities, see 4 Moore's Federal Practice &#182; 33.17 (2d ed.
    1966); 2A Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec.
    768 (Wright ed. 1961).
      Rule 33 is amended to provide that an interrogatory is not
    objectionable merely because it calls for an opinion or contention
    that relates to fact or the application of law to fact. Efforts to
    draw sharp lines between facts and opinions have invariably been
    unsuccessful, and the clear trend of the cases is to permit
    "factual" opinions. As to requests for opinions or contentions that
    call for the application of law to fact, they can be most useful in
    narrowing and sharpening the issues, which is a major purpose of
    discovery. See Diversified Products Corp. v. Sports Center Co., 42
    F.R.D. 3 (D.Md. 1967); Moore, supra; Field & McKusick, Maine Civil
    Practice Sec. 26.18 (1959). On the other hand, under the new
    language interrogatories may not extend to issues of "pure law,"
    i.e., legal issues unrelated to the facts of the case. Cf. United
    States v. Maryland & Va. Milk Producers Assn., Inc., 22 F.R.D. 300
    (D.D.C. 1958).
      Since interrogatories involving mixed questions of law and fact
    may create disputes between the parties which are best resolved
    after much or all of the other discovery has been completed, the
    court is expressly authorized to defer an answer. Likewise, the
    court may delay determination until pretrial conference, if it
    believes that the dispute is best resolved in the presence of the
    judge.
      The principal question raised with respect to the cases
    permitting such interrogatories is whether they reintroduce
    undesirable aspects of the prior pleading practice, whereby parties
    were chained to misconceived contentions or theories, and ultimate
    determination on the merits was frustrated. See James, The Revival
    of Bills of Particulars under the Federal Rules, 71 Harv.L.Rev.
    1473 (1958). But there are few if any instances in the recorded
    cases demonstrating that such frustration has occurred. The general
    rule governing the use of answers to interrogatories is that under
    ordinary circumstances they do not limit proof. See e.g., McElroy
    v. United Air Lines, Inc., 21 F.R.D. 100 (W.D.Mo. 1967); Pressley
    v. Boehlke, 33 F.R.D. 316, 317 (W.D.N.C. 1963). Although in
    exceptional circumstances reliance on an answer may cause such
    prejudice that the court will hold the answering party bound to his
    answer, e.g., Zielinski v. Philadelphia Piers, Inc., 139 F.Supp.
    408 (E.D.Pa. 1956), the interrogating party will ordinarily not be
    entitled to rely on the unchanging character of the answers he
    receives and cannot base prejudice on such reliance. The rule does
    not affect the power of a court to permit withdrawal or amendment
    of answers to interrogatories.
      The use of answers to interrogatories at trial is made subject to
    the rules of evidence. The provisions governing use of depositions,
    to which Rule 33 presently refers, are not entirely apposite to
    answers to interrogatories, since deposition practice contemplates
    that all parties will ordinarily participate through cross-
    examination. See 4 Moore's Federal Practice &#182; 33.29[1] (2 ed.
    1966).
      Certain provisions are deleted from subdivision (b) because they
    are fully covered by new Rule 26(c) providing for protective orders
    and Rules 26(a) and 26(d). The language of the subdivision is thus
    simplified without any change of substance.
      Subdivision (c). This is a new subdivision, adopted from
    Calif.Code Civ.Proc. Sec. 2030(c), relating especially to
    interrogatories which require a party to engage in burdensome or
    expensive research into his own business records in order to give
    an answer. The subdivision gives the party an option to make the
    records available and place the burden of research on the party who
    seeks the information. "This provision, without undermining the
    liberal scope of interrogatory discovery, places the burden of
    discovery upon its potential benefitee," Louisell, Modern
    California Discovery, 124-125 (1963), and alleviates a problem
    which in the past has troubled Federal courts. See Speck, The Use
    of Discovery in United States District Courts, 60 Yale L.J. 1132,
    1142-1144 (1951). The interrogating party is protected against
    abusive use of this provision through the requirement that the
    burden of ascertaining the answer be substantially the same for
    both sides. A respondent may not impose on an interrogating party a
    mass of records as to which research is feasible only for one
    familiar with the records. At the same time, the respondent unable
    to invoke this subdivision does not on that account lose the
    protection available to him under new Rule 26(c) against oppressive
    or unduly burdensome or expensive interrogatories. And even when
    the respondent successfully invokes the subdivision, the court is
    not deprived of its usual power, in appropriate cases, to require
    that the interrogating party reimburse the respondent for the
    expense of assembling his records and making them intelligible.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1980 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (c). The Committee is advised that parties upon whom
    interrogatories are served have occasionally responded by directing
    the interrogating party to a mass of business records or by
    offering to make all of their records available, justifying the
    response by the option provided by this subdivision. Such practices
    are an abuse of the option. A party who is permitted by the terms
    of this subdivision to offer records for inspection in lieu of
    answering an interrogatory should offer them in a manner that
    permits the same direct and economical access that is available to
    the party. If the information sought exists in the form of
    compilations, abstracts or summaries then available to the
    responding party, those should be made available to the
    interrogating party. The final sentence is added to make it clear
    that a responding party has the duty to specify, by category and
    location, the records from which answers to interrogatories can be
    derived.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Purpose of Revision. The purpose of this revision is to reduce
    the frequency and increase the efficiency of interrogatory
    practice. The revision is based on experience with local rules. For
    ease of reference, subdivision (a) is divided into two subdivisions
    and the remaining subdivisions renumbered.
      Subdivision (a). Revision of this subdivision limits
    interrogatory practice. Because Rule 26(a)(1)-(3) requires
    disclosure of much of the information previously obtained by this
    form of discovery, there should be less occasion to use it.
    Experience in over half of the district courts has confirmed that
    limitations on the number of interrogatories are useful and
    manageable. Moreover, because the device can be costly and may be
    used as a means of harassment, it is desirable to subject its use
    to the control of the court consistent with the principles stated
    in Rule 26(b)(2), particularly in multi-party cases where it has
    not been unusual for the same interrogatory to be propounded to a
    party by more than one of its adversaries.
      Each party is allowed to serve 25 interrogatories upon any other
    party, but must secure leave of court (or a stipulation from the
    opposing party) to serve a larger number. Parties cannot evade this
    presumptive limitation through the device of joining as "subparts"
    questions that seek information about discrete separate subjects.
    However, a question asking about communications of a particular
    type should be treated as a single interrogatory even though it
    requests that the time, place, persons present, and contents be
    stated separately for each such communication.
      As with the number of depositions authorized by Rule 30, leave to
    serve additional interrogatories is to be allowed when consistent
    with Rule 26(b)(2). The aim is not to prevent needed discovery, but
    to provide judicial scrutiny before parties make potentially
    excessive use of this discovery device. In many cases it will be
    appropriate for the court to permit a larger number of
    interrogatories in the scheduling order entered under Rule 16(b).
      Unless leave of court is obtained, interrogatories may not be
    served prior to the meeting of the parties under Rule 26(f).
      When a case with outstanding interrogatories exceeding the number
    permitted by this rule is removed to federal court, the
    interrogating party must seek leave allowing the additional
    interrogatories, specify which twenty-five are to be answered, or
    resubmit interrogatories that comply with the rule. Moreover, under
    Rule 26(d), the time for response would be measured from the date
    of the parties' meeting under Rule 26(f). See Rule 81(c), providing
    that these rules govern procedures after removal.
      Subdivision (b). A separate subdivision is made of the former
    second paragraph of subdivision (a). Language is added to paragraph
    (1) of this subdivision to emphasize the duty of the responding
    party to provide full answers to the extent not objectionable. If,
    for example, an interrogatory seeking information about numerous
    facilities or products is deemed objectionable, but an
    interrogatory seeking information about a lesser number of
    facilities or products would not have been objectionable, the
    interrogatory should be answered with respect to the latter even
    though an objection is raised as to the balance of the facilities
    or products. Similarly, the fact that additional time may be needed
    to respond to some questions (or to some aspects of questions)
    should not justify a delay in responding to those questions (or
    other aspects of questions) that can be answered within the
    prescribed time.
      Paragraph (4) is added to make clear that objections must be
    specifically justified, and that unstated or untimely grounds for
    objection ordinarily are waived. Note also the provisions of
    revised Rule 26(b)(5), which require a responding party to indicate
    when it is withholding information under a claim of privilege or as
    trial preparation materials.
      These provisions should be read in light of Rule 26(g),
    authorizing the court to impose sanctions on a party and attorney
    making an unfounded objection to an interrogatory.
      Subdivisions (c) and (d). The provisions of former subdivisions
    (b) and (c) are renumbered.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 33(d) is amended to parallel Rule 34(a) by recognizing the
    importance of electronically stored information. The term
    "electronically stored information" has the same broad meaning in
    Rule 33(d) as in Rule 34(a). Much business information is stored
    only in electronic form; the Rule 33(d) option should be available
    with respect to such records as well.
      Special difficulties may arise in using electronically stored
    information, either due to its form or because it is dependent on a
    particular computer system. Rule 33(d) allows a responding party to
    substitute access to documents or electronically stored information
    for an answer only if the burden of deriving the answer will be
    substantially the same for either party. Rule 33(d) states that a
    party electing to respond to an interrogatory by providing
    electronically stored information must ensure that the
    interrogating party can locate and identify it "as readily as can
    the party served," and that the responding party must give the
    interrogating party a "reasonable opportunity to examine, audit, or
    inspect" the information. Depending on the circumstances,
    satisfying these provisions with regard to electronically stored
    information may require the responding party to provide some
    combination of technical support, information on application
    software, or other assistance. The key question is whether such
    support enables the interrogating party to derive or ascertain the
    answer from the electronically stored information as readily as the
    responding party. A party that wishes to invoke Rule 33(d) by
    specifying electronically stored information may be required to
    provide direct access to its electronic information system, but
    only if that is necessary to afford the requesting party an
    adequate opportunity to derive or ascertain the answer to the
    interrogatory. In that situation, the responding party's need to
    protect sensitive interests of confidentiality or privacy may mean
    that it must derive or ascertain and provide the answer itself
    rather than invoke Rule 33(d).
      Changes Made after Publication and Comment. No changes are made
    to the rule text. The Committee Note is changed to reflect the
    sensitivities that limit direct access by a requesting party to a
    responding party's information system. If direct access to the
    responding party's system is the only way to enable a requesting
    party to locate and identify the records from which the answer may
    be ascertained, the responding party may choose to derive or
    ascertain the answer itself.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 33 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      The final sentence of former Rule 33(a) was a redundant cross-
    reference to the discovery moratorium provisions of Rule 26(d).
    Rule 26(d) is now familiar, obviating any need to carry forward the
    redundant cross-reference.
      Former Rule 33(b)(5) was a redundant reminder of Rule 37(a)
    procedure and is omitted as no longer useful.
      Former Rule 33(c) stated that an interrogatory "is not
    necessarily objectionable merely because an answer * * * involves
    an opinion or contention * * *." "[I]s not necessarily" seemed to
    imply that the interrogatory might be objectionable merely for this
    reason. This implication has been ignored in practice. Opinion and
    contention interrogatories are used routinely. Amended Rule
    33(a)(2) embodies the current meaning of Rule 33 by omitting
    "necessarily."

-HEAD-
    Rule 34. Producing Documents, Electronically Stored Information,
      and Tangible Things, or Entering onto Land, for Inspection and
      Other Purposes

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. A party may serve on any other party a request
    within the scope of Rule 26(b):
        (1) to produce and permit the requesting party or its
      representative to inspect, copy, test, or sample the following
      items in the responding party's possession, custody, or control:
          (A) any designated documents or electronically stored
        information - including writings, drawings, graphs, charts,
        photographs, sound recordings, images, and other data or data
        compilations - stored in any medium from which information can
        be obtained either directly or, if necessary, after translation
        by the responding party into a reasonably usable form; or
          (B) any designated tangible things; or

        (2) to permit entry onto designated land or other property
      possessed or controlled by the responding party, so that the
      requesting party may inspect, measure, survey, photograph, test,
      or sample the property or any designated object or operation on
      it.

      (b) Procedure.
        (1) Contents of the Request. The request:
          (A) must describe with reasonable particularity each item or
        category of items to be inspected;
          (B) must specify a reasonable time, place, and manner for the
        inspection and for performing the related acts; and
          (C) may specify the form or forms in which electronically
        stored information is to be produced.

        (2) Responses and Objections.
          (A) Time to Respond. The party to whom the request is
        directed must respond in writing within 30 days after being
        served. A shorter or longer time may be stipulated to under
        Rule 29 or be ordered by the court.
          (B) Responding to Each Item. For each item or category, the
        response must either state that inspection and related
        activities will be permitted as requested or state an objection
        to the request, including the reasons.
          (C) Objections. An objection to part of a request must
        specify the part and permit inspection of the rest.
          (D) Responding to a Request for Production of Electronically
        Stored Information. The response may state an objection to a
        requested form for producing electronically stored information.
        If the responding party objects to a requested form - or if no
        form was specified in the request - the party must state the
        form or forms it intends to use.
          (E) Producing the Documents or Electronically Stored
        Information. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the
        court, these procedures apply to producing documents or
        electronically stored information:
            (i) A party must produce documents as they are kept in the
          usual course of business or must organize and label them to
          correspond to the categories in the request;
            (ii) If a request does not specify a form for producing
          electronically stored information, a party must produce it in
          a form or forms in which it is ordinarily maintained or in a
          reasonably usable form or forms; and
            (iii) A party need not produce the same electronically
          stored information in more than one form.

      (c) Nonparties. As provided in Rule 45, a nonparty may be
    compelled to produce documents and tangible things or to permit an
    inspection.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      The changes in clauses (1) and (2) correlate the scope of inquiry
    permitted under Rule 34 with that provided in Rule 26(b), and thus
    remove any ambiguity created by the former differences in language.
    As stated in Olson Transportation Co. v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.
    (E.D.Wis. 1944) 8 Fed.Rules Serv. 34.41, Case 2, ". . . Rule 34 is
    a direct and simple method of discovery." At the same time the
    addition of the words following the term "parties" makes certain
    that the person in whose custody, possession, or control the
    evidence reposes may have the benefit of the applicable protective
    orders stated in Rule 30(b). This change should be considered in
    the light of the proposed expansion of Rule 30(b).
      An objection has been made that the word "designated" in Rule 34
    has been construed with undue strictness in some district court
    cases so as to require great and impracticable specificity in the
    description of documents, papers, books, etc., sought to be
    inspected. The Committee, however, believes that no amendment is
    needed, and that the proper meaning of "designated" as requiring
    specificity has already been delineated by the Supreme Court. See
    Brown v. United States (1928) 276 U.S. 134, 143 ("The subpoena . .
    . specifies . . . with reasonable particularity the subjects to
    which the documents called for related."); Consolidated Rendering
    Co. v. Vermont (1908) 207 U.S. 541, 543-544 ("We see no reason why
    all such books, papers and correspondence which related to the
    subject of inquiry, and were described with reasonable detail,
    should not be called for and the company directed to produce them.
    Otherwise, the State would be compelled to designate each
    particular paper which it desired, which presupposes an accurate
    knowledge of such papers, which the tribunal desiring the papers
    would probably rarely, if ever, have.").

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1970 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 34 is revised to accomplish the following major changes in
    the existing rule: (1) to eliminate the requirement of good cause;
    (2) to have the rule operate extrajudicially; (3) to include
    testing and sampling as well as inspecting or photographing
    tangible things; and (4) to make clear that the rule does not
    preclude an independent action for analogous discovery against
    persons not parties.
      Subdivision (a). Good cause is eliminated because it has
    furnished an uncertain and erratic protection to the parties from
    whom production is sought and is now rendered unnecessary by virtue
    of the more specific provisions added to Rule 26(b) relating to
    materials assembled in preparation for trial and to experts
    retained or consulted by parties.
      The good cause requirement was originally inserted in Rule 34 as
    a general protective provision in the absence of experience with
    the specific problems that would arise thereunder. As the note to
    Rule 26(b)(3) on trial preparation materials makes clear, good
    cause has been applied differently to varying classes of documents,
    though not without confusion. It has often been said in court
    opinions that good cause requires a consideration of need for the
    materials and of alternative means of obtaining them, i.e.,
    something more than relevance and lack of privilege. But the
    overwhelming proportion of the cases in which the formula of good
    cause has been applied to require a special showing are those
    involving trial preparation. In practice, the courts have not
    treated documents as having a special immunity to discovery simply
    because of their being documents. Protection may be afforded to
    claims of privacy or secrecy or of undue burden or expense under
    what is now Rule 26(c) (previously Rule 30(b)). To be sure, an
    appraisal of "undue" burden inevitably entails consideration of the
    needs of the party seeking discovery. With special provisions added
    to govern trial preparation materials and experts, there is no
    longer any occasion to retain the requirement of good cause.
      The revision of Rule 34 to have it operate extrajudicially,
    rather than by court order, is to a large extent a reflection of
    existing law office practice. The Columbia Survey shows that of the
    litigants seeking inspection of documents or things, only about 25
    percent filed motions for court orders. This minor fraction
    nevertheless accounted for a significant number of motions. About
    half of these motions were uncontested and in almost all instances
    the party seeking production ultimately prevailed. Although an
    extrajudicial procedure will not drastically alter existing
    practice under Rule 34 - it will conform to it in most cases - it
    has the potential of saving court time in a substantial though
    proportionately small number of cases tried annually.
      The inclusion of testing and sampling of tangible things and
    objects or operations on land reflects a need frequently
    encountered by parties in preparation for trial. If the operation
    of a particular machine is the basis of a claim for negligent
    injury, it will often be necessary to test its operating parts or
    to sample and test the products it is producing. Cf. Mich.Gen.Ct.R.
    310.1(1) (1963) (testing authorized).
      The inclusive description of "documents" is revised to accord
    with changing technology. It makes clear that Rule 34 applies to
    electronic data compilations from which information can be obtained
    only with the use of detection devices, and that when the data can
    as a practical matter be made usable by the discovering party only
    through respondent's devices, respondent may be required to use his
    devices to translate the data into usable form. In many instances,
    this means that respondent will have to supply a print-out of
    computer data. The burden thus placed on respondent will vary from
    case to case, and the courts have ample power under Rule 26(c) to
    protect respondent against undue burden of expense, either by
    restricting discovery or requiring that the discovering party pay
    costs. Similarly, if the discovering party needs to check the
    electronic source itself, the court may protect respondent with
    respect to preservation of his records, confidentially of
    nondiscoverable matters, and costs.
      Subdivision (b). The procedure provided in Rule 34 is essentially
    the same as that in Rule 33, as amended, and the discussion in the
    note appended to that rule is relevant to Rule 34 as well. Problems
    peculiar to Rule 34 relate to the specific arrangements that must
    be worked out for inspection and related acts of copying,
    photographing, testing, or sampling. The rule provides that a
    request for inspection shall set forth the items to be inspected
    either by item or category, describing each with reasonable
    particularity, and shall specify a reasonable time, place, and
    manner of making the inspection.
      Subdivision (c). Rule 34 as revised continues to apply only to
    parties. Comments from the bar make clear that in the preparation
    of cases for trial it is occasionally necessary to enter land or
    inspect large tangible things in the possession of a person not a
    party, and that some courts have dismissed independent actions in
    the nature of bills in equity for such discovery on the ground that
    Rule 34 is preemptive. While an ideal solution to this problem is
    to provide for discovery against persons not parties in Rule 34,
    both the jurisdictional and procedural problems are very complex.
    For the present, this subdivision makes clear that Rule 34 does not
    preclude independent actions for discovery against persons not
    parties.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1980 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b). The Committee is advised that, "It is apparently
    not rare for parties deliberately to mix critical documents with
    others in the hope of obscuring significance." Report of the
    Special Committee for the Study of Discovery Abuse, Section of
    Litigation of the American Bar Association (1977) 22. The sentence
    added by this subdivision follows the recommendation of the Report.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This amendment reflects the change effected by revision of Rule
    45 to provide for subpoenas to compel non-parties to produce
    documents and things and to submit to inspections of premises. The
    deletion of the text of the former paragraph is not intended to
    preclude an independent action for production of documents or
    things or for permission to enter upon land, but such actions may
    no longer be necessary in light of this revision.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      The rule is revised to reflect the change made by Rule 26(d),
    preventing a party from seeking formal discovery prior to the
    meeting of the parties required by Rule 26(f). Also, like a change
    made in Rule 33, the rule is modified to make clear that, if a
    request for production is objectionable only in part, production
    should be afforded with respect to the unobjectionable portions.
      When a case with outstanding requests for production is removed
    to federal court, the time for response would be measured from the
    date of the parties' meeting. See Rule 81(c), providing that these
    rules govern procedures after removal.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a). As originally adopted, Rule 34 focused on
    discovery of "documents" and "things." In 1970, Rule 34(a) was
    amended to include discovery of data compilations, anticipating
    that the use of computerized information would increase. Since
    then, the growth in electronically stored information and in the
    variety of systems for creating and storing such information has
    been dramatic. Lawyers and judges interpreted the term "documents"
    to include electronically stored information because it was
    obviously improper to allow a party to evade discovery obligations
    on the basis that the label had not kept pace with changes in
    information technology. But it has become increasingly difficult to
    say that all forms of electronically stored information, many
    dynamic in nature, fit within the traditional concept of a
    "document." Electronically stored information may exist in dynamic
    databases and other forms far different from fixed expression on
    paper. Rule 34(a) is amended to confirm that discovery of
    electronically stored information stands on equal footing with
    discovery of paper documents. The change clarifies that Rule 34
    applies to information that is fixed in a tangible form and to
    information that is stored in a medium from which it can be
    retrieved and examined. At the same time, a Rule 34 request for
    production of "documents" should be understood to encompass, and
    the response should include, electronically stored information
    unless discovery in the action has clearly distinguished between
    electronically stored information and "documents."
      Discoverable information often exists in both paper and
    electronic form, and the same or similar information might exist in
    both. The items listed in Rule 34(a) show different ways in which
    information may be recorded or stored. Images, for example, might
    be hard-copy documents or electronically stored information. The
    wide variety of computer systems currently in use, and the rapidity
    of technological change, counsel against a limiting or precise
    definition of electronically stored information. Rule 34(a)(1) is
    expansive and includes any type of information that is stored
    electronically. A common example often sought in discovery is
    electronic communications, such as e-mail. The rule covers - either
    as documents or as electronically stored information - information
    "stored in any medium," to encompass future developments in
    computer technology. Rule 34(a)(1) is intended to be broad enough
    to cover all current types of computer-based information, and
    flexible enough to encompass future changes and developments.
      References elsewhere in the rules to "electronically stored
    information" should be understood to invoke this expansive
    approach. A companion change is made to Rule 33(d), making it
    explicit that parties choosing to respond to an interrogatory by
    permitting access to responsive records may do so by providing
    access to electronically stored information. More generally, the
    term used in Rule 34(a)(1) appears in a number of other amendments,
    such as those to Rules 26(a)(1), 26(b)(2), 26(b)(5)(B), 26(f),
    34(b), 37(f), and 45. In each of these rules, electronically stored
    information has the same broad meaning it has under Rule 34(a)(1).
    References to "documents" appear in discovery rules that are not
    amended, including Rules 30(f), 36(a), and 37(c)(2). These
    references should be interpreted to include electronically stored
    information as circumstances warrant.
      The term "electronically stored information" is broad, but
    whether material that falls within this term should be produced,
    and in what form, are separate questions that must be addressed
    under Rules 26(b), 26(c), and 34(b).
      The Rule 34(a) requirement that, if necessary, a party producing
    electronically stored information translate it into reasonably
    usable form does not address the issue of translating from one
    human language to another. See In re Puerto Rico Elect. Power
    Auth., 687 F.2d 501, 504-510 (1st Cir. 1989).
      Rule 34(a)(1) is also amended to make clear that parties may
    request an opportunity to test or sample materials sought under the
    rule in addition to inspecting and copying them. That opportunity
    may be important for both electronically stored information and
    hard-copy materials. The current rule is not clear that such
    testing or sampling is authorized; the amendment expressly permits
    it. As with any other form of discovery, issues of burden and
    intrusiveness raised by requests to test or sample can be addressed
    under Rules 26(b)(2) and 26(c). Inspection or testing of certain
    types of electronically stored information or of a responding
    party's electronic information system may raise issues of
    confidentiality or privacy. The addition of testing and sampling to
    Rule 34(a) with regard to documents and electronically stored
    information is not meant to create a routine right of direct access
    to a party's electronic information system, although such access
    might be justified in some circumstances. Courts should guard
    against undue intrusiveness resulting from inspecting or testing
    such systems.
      Rule 34(a)(1) is further amended to make clear that tangible
    things must - like documents and land sought to be examined - be
    designated in the request.
      Subdivision (b). Rule 34(b) provides that a party must produce
    documents as they are kept in the usual course of business or must
    organize and label them to correspond with the categories in the
    discovery request. The production of electronically stored
    information should be subject to comparable requirements to protect
    against deliberate or inadvertent production in ways that raise
    unnecessary obstacles for the requesting party. Rule 34(b) is
    amended to ensure similar protection for electronically stored
    information.
      The amendment to Rule 34(b) permits the requesting party to
    designate the form or forms in which it wants electronically stored
    information produced. The form of production is more important to
    the exchange of electronically stored information than of hard-copy
    materials, although a party might specify hard copy as the
    requested form. Specification of the desired form or forms may
    facilitate the orderly, efficient, and cost-effective discovery of
    electronically stored information. The rule recognizes that
    different forms of production may be appropriate for different
    types of electronically stored information. Using current
    technology, for example, a party might be called upon to produce
    word processing documents, e-mail messages, electronic
    spreadsheets, different image or sound files, and material from
    databases. Requiring that such diverse types of electronically
    stored information all be produced in the same form could prove
    impossible, and even if possible could increase the cost and
    burdens of producing and using the information. The rule therefore
    provides that the requesting party may ask for different forms of
    production for different types of electronically stored
    information.
      The rule does not require that the requesting party choose a form
    or forms of production. The requesting party may not have a
    preference. In some cases, the requesting party may not know what
    form the producing party uses to maintain its electronically stored
    information, although Rule 26(f)(3) is amended to call for
    discussion of the form of production in the parties' prediscovery
    conference.
      The responding party also is involved in determining the form of
    production. In the written response to the production request that
    Rule 34 requires, the responding party must state the form it
    intends to use for producing electronically stored information if
    the requesting party does not specify a form or if the responding
    party objects to a form that the requesting party specifies.
    Stating the intended form before the production occurs may permit
    the parties to identify and seek to resolve disputes before the
    expense and work of the production occurs. A party that responds to
    a discovery request by simply producing electronically stored
    information in a form of its choice, without identifying that form
    in advance of the production in the response required by Rule
    34(b), runs a risk that the requesting party can show that the
    produced form is not reasonably usable and that it is entitled to
    production of some or all of the information in an additional form.
    Additional time might be required to permit a responding party to
    assess the appropriate form or forms of production.
      If the requesting party is not satisfied with the form stated by
    the responding party, or if the responding party has objected to
    the form specified by the requesting party, the parties must meet
    and confer under Rule 37(a)(2)(B) in an effort to resolve the
    matter before the requesting party can file a motion to compel. If
    they cannot agree and the court resolves the dispute, the court is
    not limited to the forms initially chosen by the requesting party,
    stated by the responding party, or specified in this rule for
    situations in which there is no court order or party agreement.
      If the form of production is not specified by party agreement or
    court order, the responding party must produce electronically
    stored information either in a form or forms in which it is
    ordinarily maintained or in a form or forms that are reasonably
    usable. Rule 34(a) requires that, if necessary, a responding party
    "translate" information it produces into a "reasonably usable"
    form. Under some circumstances, the responding party may need to
    provide some reasonable amount of technical support, information on
    application software, or other reasonable assistance to enable the
    requesting party to use the information. The rule does not require
    a party to produce electronically stored information in the form it
    [sic] which it is ordinarily maintained, as long as it is produced
    in a reasonably usable form. But the option to produce in a
    reasonably usable form does not mean that a responding party is
    free to convert electronically stored information from the form in
    which it is ordinarily maintained to a different form that makes it
    more difficult or burdensome for the requesting party to use the
    information efficiently in the litigation. If the responding party
    ordinarily maintains the information it is producing in a way that
    makes it searchable by electronic means, the information should not
    be produced in a form that removes or significantly degrades this
    feature.
      Some electronically stored information may be ordinarily
    maintained in a form that is not reasonably usable by any party.
    One example is "legacy" data that can be used only by superseded
    systems. The questions whether a producing party should be required
    to convert such information to a more usable form, or should be
    required to produce it at all, should be addressed under Rule
    26(b)(2)(B).
      Whether or not the requesting party specified the form of
    production, Rule 34(b) provides that the same electronically stored
    information ordinarily be produced in only one form.
      Changes Made after Publication and Comment. The proposed
    amendment recommended for approval has been modified from the
    published version. The sequence of "documents or electronically
    stored information" is changed to emphasize that the parenthetical
    exemplifications apply equally to illustrate "documents" and
    "electronically stored information." The reference to "detection
    devices" is deleted as redundant with "translated" and as archaic.
      The references to the form of production are changed in the rule
    and Committee Note to refer also to "forms." Different forms may be
    appropriate or necessary for different sources of information.
      The published proposal allowed the requesting party to specify a
    form for production and recognized that the responding party could
    object to the requested form. This procedure is now amplified by
    directing that the responding party state the form or forms it
    intends to use for production if the request does not specify a
    form or if the responding party objects to the requested form.
      The default forms of production to be used when the parties do
    not agree on a form and there is no court order are changed in
    part. As in the published proposal, one default form is "a form or
    forms in which [electronically stored information] is ordinarily
    maintained." The alternative default form, however, is changed from
    "an electronically searchable form" to "a form or forms that are
    reasonably usable." "[A]n electronically searchable form" proved to
    have several defects. Some electronically stored information cannot
    be searched electronically. In addition, there often are many
    different levels of electronic searchability - the published
    default would authorize production in a minimally searchable form
    even though more easily searched forms might be available at equal
    or less cost to the responding party.
      The provision that absent court order a party need not produce
    the same electronically stored information in more than one form
    was moved to become a separate item for the sake of emphasis.
      The Committee Note was changed to reflect these changes in rule
    text, and also to clarify many aspects of the published Note. In
    addition, the Note was expanded to add a caveat to the published
    amendment that establishes the rule that documents - and now
    electronically stored information - may be tested and sampled as
    well as inspected and copied. Fears were expressed that testing and
    sampling might imply routine direct access to a party's information
    system. The Note states that direct access is not a routine right,
    "although such access might be justified in some circumstances."
      The changes in the rule text since publication are set out below.
    [Omitted]

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 34 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      The final sentence in the first paragraph of former Rule 34(b)
    was a redundant cross-reference to the discovery moratorium
    provisions of Rule 26(d). Rule 26(d) is now familiar, obviating any
    need to carry forward the redundant cross-reference.
      The redundant reminder of Rule 37(a) procedure in the second
    paragraph of former Rule 34(b) is omitted as no longer useful.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. See Note to Rule 1,

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE V. DISCLOSURES AND DISCOVERY

-HEAD-
    Rule 35. Physical and Mental Examinations

-STATUTE-
      (a) Order for an Examination.
        (1) In General. The court where the action is pending may order
      a party whose mental or physical condition - including blood
      group - is in controversy to submit to a physical or mental
      examination by a suitably licensed or certified examiner. The
      court has the same authority to order a party to produce for
      examination a person who is in its custody or under its legal
      control.
        (2) Motion and Notice; Contents of the Order. The order:
          (A) may be made only on motion for good cause and on notice
        to all parties and the person to be examined; and
          (B) must specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and
        scope of the examination, as well as the person or persons who
        will perform it.

      (b) Examiner's Report.
        (1) Request by the Party or Person Examined. The party who
      moved for the examination must, on request, deliver to the
      requester a copy of the examiner's report, together with like
      reports of all earlier examinations of the same condition. The
      request may be made by the party against whom the examination
      order was issued or by the person examined.
        (2) Contents. The examiner's report must be in writing and must
      set out in detail the examiner's findings, including diagnoses,
      conclusions, and the results of any tests.
        (3) Request by the Moving Party. After delivering the reports,
      the party who moved for the examination may request - and is
      entitled to receive - from the party against whom the examination
      order was issued like reports of all earlier or later
      examinations of the same condition. But those reports need not be
      delivered by the party with custody or control of the person
      examined if the party shows that it could not obtain them.
        (4) Waiver of Privilege. By requesting and obtaining the
      examiner's report, or by deposing the examiner, the party
      examined waives any privilege it may have - in that action or any
      other action involving the same controversy - concerning
      testimony about all examinations of the same condition.
        (5) Failure to Deliver a Report. The court on motion may order -
       on just terms - that a party deliver the report of an
      examination. If the report is not provided, the court may exclude
      the examiner's testimony at trial.
        (6) Scope. This subdivision (b) applies also to an examination
      made by the parties' agreement, unless the agreement states
      otherwise. This subdivision does not preclude obtaining an
      examiner's report or deposing an examiner under other rules.

      The constitutionality of legislation providing for physical
    examination of parties was sustained in Lyon v. Manhattan Railway
    Co., 142 N.Y. 298, 37 N.E. 113 (1894), and McGovern v. Hope, 63
    N.J.L. 76, 42 Atl. 830 (1899). In Union Pacific Ry. Co. v.
    Botsford, 141 U.S. 250 (1891), it was held that the court could not
    order the physical examination of a party in the absence of
    statutory authority. But in Camden and Suburban Ry. Co. v. Stetson,
    177 U.S. 172 (1900) where there was statutory authority for such
    examination, derived from a state statute made operative by the
    conformity act, the practice was sustained. Such authority is now
    found in the present rule made operative by the Act of June 19,
    1934, ch. 651, U.S.C., Title 28, Secs. 723b [see 2072] (Rules in
    actions at law; Supreme Court authorized to make) and 723c [see
    2072] (Union of equity and action at law rules; power of Supreme
    Court).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1970 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). Rule 35(a) has hitherto provided only for an
    order requiring a party to submit to an examination. It is
    desirable to extend the rule to provide for an order against the
    party for examination of a person in his custody or under his legal
    control. As appears from the provisions of amended Rule 37(b)(2)
    and the comment under that rule, an order to "produce" the third
    person imposes only an obligation to use good faith efforts to
    produce the person.
      The amendment will settle beyond doubt that a parent or guardian
    suing to recover for injuries to a minor may be ordered to produce
    the minor for examination. Further, the amendment expressly
    includes blood examination within the kinds of examinations that
    can be ordered under the rule. See Beach v. Beach, 114 F.2d 479
    (D.C. Cir. 1940). Provisions similar to the amendment have been
    adopted in at least 10 States: Calif.Code Civ.Proc. Sec. 2032;
    Ida.R.Civ.P. 35; Ill.S-H Ann. c. 110A, Sec. 215; Md.R.P. 420;
    Mich.Gen. Ct.R. 311; Minn.R.Civ.P. 35; Mo.Vern.Ann.R.Civ.P. 60.01;
    N.Dak.R.Civ.P. 35; N.Y.C.P.L. Sec. 3121; Wyo.R.Civ.P. 35.
      The amendment makes no change in the requirements of Rule 35
    that, before a court order may issue, the relevant physical or
    mental condition must be shown to be "in controversy" and "good
    cause" must be shown for the examination. Thus, the amendment has
    no effect on the recent decision of the Supreme Court in
    Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U.S. 104 (1964), stressing the
    importance of these requirements and applying them to the facts of
    the case. The amendment makes no reference to employees of a party.
    Provisions relating to employees in the State statutes and rules
    cited above appear to have been virtually unused.
      Subdivision (b)(1). This subdivision is amended to correct an
    imbalance in Rule 35(b)(1) as heretofore written. Under that text,
    a party causing a Rule 35(a) examination to be made is required to
    furnish to the party examined, on request, a copy of the examining
    physician's report. If he delivers this copy, he is in turn
    entitled to receive from the party examined reports of all
    examinations of the same condition previously or later made. But
    the rule has not in terms entitled the examined party to receive
    from the party causing the Rule 35(a) examination any reports of
    earlier examinations of the same condition to which the latter may
    have access. The amendment cures this defect. See La.Stat.Ann.,
    Civ.Proc. art. 1495 (1960); Utah R.Civ.P.35(c).
      The amendment specifies that the written report of the examining
    physician includes results of all tests made, such as results of X-
    rays and cardiograms. It also embodies changes required by the
    broadening of Rule 35(a) to take in persons who are not parties.
      Subdivision (b)(3). This new subdivision removes any possible
    doubt that reports of examination may be obtained although no order
    for examination has been made under Rule 35(a). Examinations are
    very frequently made by agreement, and sometimes before the party
    examined has an attorney. The courts have uniformly ordered that
    reports be supplied, see 4 Moore's Federal Practice &#182; 35.06,
    n.1 (2d ed. 1966); 2A Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice and
    Procedure Sec. 823, n. 22 (Wright ed. 1961), and it appears best to
    fill the technical gap in the present rule.
      The subdivision also makes clear that reports of examining
    physicians are discoverable not only under Rule 35(b) but under
    other rules as well. To be sure, if the report is privileged, then
    discovery is not permissible under any rule other than Rule 35(b)
    and it is permissible under Rule 35(b) only if the party requests a
    copy of the report of examination made by the other party's doctor.
    Sher v. De Haven, 199 F.2d 777 (D.C. Cir. 1952), cert. denied 345
    U.S. 936 (1953). But if the report is unprivileged and is subject
    to discovery under the provisions of rules other than Rule 35(b) -
    such as Rules 34 or 26(b)(3) or (4) - discovery should not depend
    upon whether the person examined demands a copy of the report.
    Although a few cases have suggested the contrary, e.g., Galloway v.
    National Dairy Products Corp., 24 F.R.D. 362 (E.D.Pa. 1959), the
    better considered district court decisions hold that Rule 35(b) is
    not preemptive. E.g., Leszynski v. Russ, 29 F.R.D. 10, 12 (D.Md.
    1961) and cases cited. The question was recently given full
    consideration in Buffington v. Wood, 351 F.2d 292 (3d Cir. 1965),
    holding that Rule 35(b) is not preemptive.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      The revision authorizes the court to require physical or mental
    examinations conducted by any person who is suitably licensed or
    certified.
      The rule was revised in 1988 by Congressional enactment to
    authorize mental examinations by licensed clinical psychologists.
    This revision extends that amendment to include other certified or
    licensed professionals, such as dentists or occupational
    therapists, who are not physicians or clinical psychologists, but
    who may be well-qualified to give valuable testimony about the
    physical or mental condition that is the subject of dispute.
      The requirement that the examiner be suitably licensed or
    certified is a new requirement. The court is thus expressly
    authorized to assess the credentials of the examiner to assure that
    no person is subjected to a court-ordered examination by an
    examiner whose testimony would be of such limited value that it
    would be unjust to require the person to undergo the invasion of
    privacy associated with the examination. This authority is not
    wholly new, for under the former rule, the court retained
    discretion to refuse to order an examination, or to restrict an
    examination. 8 WRIGHT & MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE & PROCEDURE Sec.
    2234 (1986 Supp.). The revision is intended to encourage the
    exercise of this discretion, especially with respect to
    examinations by persons having narrow qualifications.
      The court's responsibility to determine the suitability of the
    examiner's qualifications applies even to a proposed examination by
    a physician. If the proposed examination and testimony calls for an
    expertise that the proposed examiner does not have, it should not
    be ordered, even if the proposed examiner is a physician. The rule
    does not, however, require that the license or certificate be
    conferred by the jurisdiction in which the examination is
    conducted.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 35 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

                          AMENDMENT BY PUBLIC LAW                      
      1988 - Subd. (a). Pub. L. 100-690, Sec. 7047(b)(1), substituted
    "physical examination by a physician, or mental examination by a
    physician or psychologist" for "physical or mental examination by a
    physician".
      Subd. (b). Pub. L. 100-690, Sec. 7047(b)(2), inserted "or
    psychologist" in heading, in two places in par. (1), and in two

    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE V. DISCLOSURES AND DISCOVERY

-HEAD-
    Rule 36. Requests for Admission

-STATUTE-
      (a) Scope and Procedure.
        (1) Scope. A party may serve on any other party a written
      request to admit, for purposes of the pending action only, the
      truth of any matters within the scope of Rule 26(b)(1) relating
      to:
          (A) facts, the application of law to fact, or opinions about
        either; and
          (B) the genuineness of any described documents.

        (2) Form; Copy of a Document. Each matter must be separately
      stated. A request to admit the genuineness of a document must be
      accompanied by a copy of the document unless it is, or has been,
      otherwise furnished or made available for inspection and copying.
        (3) Time to Respond; Effect of Not Responding. A matter is
      admitted unless, within 30 days after being served, the party to
      whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party a
      written answer or objection addressed to the matter and signed by
      the party or its attorney. A shorter or longer time for
      responding may be stipulated to under Rule 29 or be ordered by
      the court.
        (4) Answer. If a matter is not admitted, the answer must
      specifically deny it or state in detail why the answering party
      cannot truthfully admit or deny it. A denial must fairly respond
      to the substance of the matter; and when good faith requires that
      a party qualify an answer or deny only a part of a matter, the
      answer must specify the part admitted and qualify or deny the
      rest. The answering party may assert lack of knowledge or
      information as a reason for failing to admit or deny only if the
      party states that it has made reasonable inquiry and that the
      information it knows or can readily obtain is insufficient to
      enable it to admit or deny.
        (5) Objections. The grounds for objecting to a request must be
      stated. A party must not object solely on the ground that the
      request presents a genuine issue for trial.
        (6) Motion Regarding the Sufficiency of an Answer or Objection.
      The requesting party may move to determine the sufficiency of an
      answer or objection. Unless the court finds an objection
      justified, it must order that an answer be served. On finding
      that an answer does not comply with this rule, the court may
      order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended
      answer be served. The court may defer its final decision until a
      pretrial conference or a specified time before trial. Rule
      37(a)(5) applies to an award of expenses.

      (b) Effect of an Admission; Withdrawing or Amending It. A matter
    admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the
    court, on motion, permits the admission to be withdrawn or amended.
    Subject to Rule 16(e), the court may permit withdrawal or amendment
    if it would promote the presentation of the merits of the action
    and if the court is not persuaded that it would prejudice the
    requesting party in maintaining or defending the action on the
    merits. An admission under this rule is not an admission for any
    other purpose and cannot be used against the party in any other
    proceeding.

    which provides for the admission of the execution and genuineness
    of documents); English Rules Under the Judicature Act (The Annual
    Practice, 1937) O. 32; Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937) ch. 110, Sec. 182 and

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      The first change in the first sentence of Rule 36(a) and the
    addition of the new second sentence, specifying when requests for
    admissions may be served, bring Rule 36 in line with amended Rules
    26(a) and 33. There is no reason why these rules should not be
    treated alike. Other provisions of Rule 36(a) give the party whose
    admissions are requested adequate protection.
      The second change in the first sentence of the rule [subdivision
    (a)] removes any uncertainty as to whether a party can be called
    upon to admit matters of fact other than those set forth in
    relevant documents described in and exhibited with the request. In
    Smyth v. Kaufman (C.C.A.2d, 1940) 114 F.(2d) 40, it was held that
    the word "therein", now stricken from the rule [said subdivision]
    referred to the request and that a matter of fact not related to
    any document could be presented to the other party for admission or
    denial. The rule of this case is now clearly stated.
      The substitution of the word "served" for "delivered" in the
    third sentence of the amended rule [said subdivision] is in
    conformance with the use of the word "serve" elsewhere in the rule
    and generally throughout the rules. See also Notes to Rules 13(a)
    and 33 herein. The substitution [in said subdivision] of "shorter
    or longer" for "further" will enable a court to designate a lesser
    period than 10 days for answer. This conforms with a similar
    provision already contained in Rule 33.
      The addition of clause (2) [in said subdivision] specifies the
    method by which a party may challenge the propriety of a request to
    admit. There has been considerable difference of judicial opinion
    as to the correct method, if any, available to secure relief from
    an allegedly improper request. See Commentary, Methods of Objecting
    to Notice to Admit (1942) 5 Fed.Rules Serv. 835; International
    Carbonic Engineering Co. v. Natural Carbonic Products, Inc.
    (S.D.Cal. 1944) 57 F.Supp. 248. The changes in clause (1) are
    merely of a clarifying and conforming nature.
      The first of the added last two sentences [in said subdivision]
    prevents an objection to a part of a request from holding up the
    answer, if any, to the remainder. See similar proposed change in
    Rule 33. The last sentence strengthens the rule by making the
    denial accurately reflect the party's position. It is taken, with
    necessary changes, from Rule 8(b).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1970 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 36 serves two vital purposes, both of which are designed to
    reduce trial time. Admissions are sought, first to facilitate proof
    with respect to issues that cannot be eliminated from the case, and
    secondly, to narrow the issues by eliminating those that can be.
    The changes made in the rule are designed to serve these purposes
    more effectively. Certain disagreements in the courts about the
    proper scope of the rule are resolved. In addition, the procedural
    operation of the rule is brought into line with other discovery
    procedures, and the binding effect of an admission is clarified.
    See generally Finman, The Request for Admissions in Federal Civil
    Procedure, 71 Yale L.J. 371 (1962).
      Subdivision (a). As revised, the subdivision provides that a
    request may be made to admit any matter within the scope of Rule
    26(b) that relate to statements or opinions of fact or of the
    application of law to fact. It thereby eliminates the requirement
    that the matters be "of fact." This change resolves conflicts in
    the court decisions as to whether a request to admit matters of
    "opinion" and matters involving "mixed law and fact" is proper
    under the rule. As to "opinion," compare, e.g., Jackson Bluff Corp.
    v. Marcelle, 20 F.R.D. 139 (E.D.N.Y. 1957); California v. The S.S.
    Jules Fribourg, 19 F.R.D. 432 (N.D.Calif. 1955), with e.g., Photon,
    Inc. v. Harris Intertype, Inc., 28 F.R.D. 327 (D.Mass. 1961); Hise
    v. Lockwood Grader Corp., 153 F.Supp 276 (D.Nebr. 1957). As to
    "mixed law and fact" the majority of courts sustain objections,
    e.g., Minnesota Mining and Mfg. Co. v. Norton Co., 36 F.R.D. 1
    (N.D.Ohio 1964), but McSparran v. Hanigan, 225 F.Supp. 628 (E.D.Pa.
    1963) is to the contrary.
      Not only is it difficult as a practical matter to separate "fact"
    from "opinion," see 4 Moore's Federal Practice &#182; 36.04 (2d ed.
    1966); cf. 2A Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure 317
    (Wright ed. 1961), but an admission on a matter of opinion may
    facilitate proof or narrow the issues or both. An admission of a
    matter involving the application of law to fact may, in a given
    case, even more clearly narrow the issues. For example, an
    admission that an employee acted in the scope of his employment may
    remove a major issue from the trial. In McSparran v. Hanigan,
    supra, plaintiff admitted that "the premises on which said accident
    occurred, were occupied or under the control" of one of the
    defendants, 225 F.Supp. at 636. This admission, involving law as
    well as fact, removed one of the issues from the lawsuit and
    thereby reduced the proof required at trial. The amended provision
    does not authorize requests for admissions of law unrelated to the
    facts of the case.
      Requests for admission involving the application of law to fact
    may create disputes between the parties which are best resolved in
    the presence of the judge after much or all of the other discovery
    has been completed. Power is therefore expressly conferred upon the
    court to defer decision until a pretrial conference is held or
    until a designated time prior to trial. On the other hand, the
    court should not automatically defer decision; in many instances,
    the importance of the admission lies in enabling the requesting
    party to avoid the burdensome accumulation of proof prior to the
    pretrial conference.
      Courts have also divided on whether an answering party may
    properly object to request for admission as to matters which that
    party regards as "in dispute." Compare, e.g., Syracuse Broadcasting
    Corp. v. Newhouse, 271 F.2d 910, 917 (2d Cir. 1959); Driver v.
    Gindy Mfg. Corp., 24 F.R.D. 473 (E.D.Pa. 1959); with e.g.,
    McGonigle v. Baxter, 27 F.R.D. 504 (E.D.Pa. 1961); United States v.
    Ehbauer, 13 F.R.D. 462 (W.D.Mo. 1952). The proper response in such
    cases is an answer. The very purpose of the request is to ascertain
    whether the answering party is prepared to admit or regards the
    matter as presenting a genuine issue for trial. In his answer, the
    party may deny, or he may give his reason for inability to admit or
    deny the existence of a genuine issue. The party runs no risk of
    sanctions if the matter is genuinely in issue, since Rule 37(c)
    provides a sanction of costs only when there are no good reasons
    for a failure to admit.
      On the other hand, requests to admit may be so voluminous and so
    framed that the answering party finds the task of identifying what
    is in dispute and what is not unduly burdensome. If so, the
    responding party may obtain a protective order under Rule 26(c).
    Some of the decisions sustaining objections on "disputability"
    grounds could have been justified by the burdensome character of
    the requests. See, e.g., Syracuse Broadcasting Corp. v. Newhouse,
    supra.
      Another sharp split of authority exists on the question whether a
    party may base his answer on lack of information or knowledge
    without seeking out additional information. One line of cases has
    held that a party may answer on the basis of such knowledge as he
    has at the time he answers. E.g., Jackson Buff Corp. v. Marcelle,
    20 F.R.D. 139 (E.D.N.Y. 1957); Sladek v. General Motors Corp., 16
    F.R.D. 104 (S.D.Iowa 1954). A larger group of cases, supported by
    commentators, has taken the view that if the responding party lacks
    knowledge, he must inform himself in reasonable fashion. E.g., Hise
    v. Lockwood Grader Corp., 153 F.Supp. 276 (D.Nebr. 1957); E. H.
    Tate Co. v. Jiffy Enterprises, Inc., 16 F.R.D. 571 (E.D.Pa. 1954);
    Finman, supra, 71 Yale L.J. 371, 404-409; 4 Moore's Federal
    Practice &#182; 36.04 (2d ed. 1966); 2A Barron & Holtzoff, Federal
    Practice and Procedure 509 (Wright ed. 1961).
      The rule as revised adopts the majority view, as in keeping with
    a basic principle of the discovery rules that a reasonable burden
    may be imposed on the parties when its discharge will facilitate
    preparation for trial and ease the trial process. It has been
    argued against this view that one side should not have the burden
    of "proving" the other side's case. The revised rule requires only
    that the answering party make reasonable inquiry and secure such
    knowledge and information as are readily obtainable by him. In most
    instances, the investigation will be necessary either to his own
    case or to preparation for rebuttal. Even when it is not, the
    information may be close enough at hand to be "readily obtainable."
    Rule 36 requires only that the party state that he has taken these
    steps. The sanction for failure of a party to inform himself before
    he answers lies in the award of costs after trial, as provided in
    Rule 37(c).
      The requirement that the answer to a request for admission be
    sworn is deleted, in favor of a provision that the answer be signed
    by the party or by his attorney. The provisions of Rule 36 make it
    clear that admissions function very much as pleadings do. Thus,
    when a party admits in part and denies in part, his admission is
    for purposes of the pending action only and may not be used against
    him in any other proceeding. The broadening of the rule to
    encompass mixed questions of law and fact reinforces this feature.
    Rule 36 does not lack a sanction for false answers; Rule 37(c)
    furnishes an appropriate deterrent.
      The existing language describing the available grounds for
    objection to a request for admission is eliminated as neither
    necessary nor helpful. The statement that objection may be made to
    any request, which is "improper" adds nothing to the provisions
    that the party serve an answer or objection addressed to each
    matter and that he state his reasons for any objection. None of the
    other discovery rules set forth grounds for objection, except so
    far as all are subject to the general provisions of Rule 26.
      Changes are made in the sequence of procedures in Rule 36 so that
    they conform to the new procedures in Rules 33 and 34. The major
    changes are as follows:
      (1) The normal time for response to a request for admissions is
    lengthened from 10 to 30 days, conforming more closely to
    prevailing practice. A defendant need not respond, however, in less
    than 45 days after service of the summons and complaint upon him.
    The court may lengthen or shorten the time when special situations
    require it.
      (2) The present requirement that the plaintiff wait 10 days to
    serve requests without leave of court is eliminated. The revised
    provision accords with those in Rules 33 and 34.
      (3) The requirement that the objecting party move automatically
    for a hearing on his objection is eliminated, and the burden is on
    the requesting party to move for an order. The change in the burden
    of going forward does not modify present law on burden of
    persuasion. The award of expenses incurred in relation to the
    motion is made subject to the comprehensive provisions of Rule
    37(a)(4).
      (4) A problem peculiar to Rule 36 arises if the responding party
    serves answers that are not in conformity with the requirements of
    the rule - for example, a denial is not "specific," or the
    explanation of inability to admit or deny is not "in detail." Rule
    36 now makes no provision for court scrutiny of such answers before
    trial, and it seems to contemplate that defective answers bring
    about admissions just as effectively as if no answer had been
    served. Some cases have so held. E.g., Southern Ry. Co. v. Crosby,
    201 F.2d 878 (4th Cir. 1953); United States v. Laney, 96 F.Supp.
    482 (E.D.S.C. 1951).
      Giving a defective answer the automatic effect of an admission
    may cause unfair surprise. A responding party who purported to deny
    or to be unable to admit or deny will for the first time at trial
    confront the contention that he has made a binding admission. Since
    it is not always easy to know whether a denial is "specific" or an
    explanation is "in detail," neither party can know how the court
    will rule at trial and whether proof must be prepared. Some courts,
    therefore, have entertained motions to rule on defective answers.
    They have at times ordered that amended answers be served, when the
    defects were technical, and at other times have declared that the
    matter was admitted. E.g., Woods v. Stewart, 171 F.2d 544 (5th Cir.
    1948); SEC v. Kaye, Real & Co., 122 F.Supp. 639 (S.D.N.Y. 1954);
    Seib's Hatcheries, Inc. v. Lindley, 13 F.R.D. 113 (W.D.Ark. 1952).
    The rule as revised conforms to the latter practice.
      Subdivision (b). The rule does not now indicate the extent to
    which a party is bound by his admission. Some courts view
    admissions as the equivalent of sworn testimony E.g., Ark.-Tenn
    Distributing Corp. v. Breidt, 209 F.2d 359 (3d Cir. 1954); United
    States v. Lemons, 125 F.Supp. 686 (W.D.Ark. 1954); 4 Moore's
    Federal Practice &#182; 36.08 (2d ed. 1966 Supp.). At least in some
    jurisdictions a party may rebut his own testimony, e.g., Alamo v.
    Del Rosario, 98 F.2d 328 (D.C.Cir. 1938), and by analogy an
    admission made pursuant to Rule 36 may likewise be thought
    rebuttable. The courts in Ark-Tenn and Lemons, supra, reasoned in
    this way, although the results reached may be supported on
    different grounds. In McSparran v. Hanigan, 225 F.Supp. 628, 636-
    637 (E.D.Pa. 1963), the court held that an admission is
    conclusively binding, though noting the confusion created by prior
    decisions.
      The new provisions give an admission a conclusively binding
    effect, for purposes only of the pending action, unless the
    admission is withdrawn or amended. In form and substance a Rule 36
    admission is comparable to an admission in pleadings or a
    stipulation drafted by counsel for use at trial, rather than to an
    evidentiary admission of a party. Louisell, Modern California
    Discovery Sec. 8.07 (1963); 2A Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice
    and Procedure Sec. 838 (Wright ed. 1961). Unless the party securing
    an admission can depend on its binding effect, he cannot safely
    avoid the expense of preparing to prove the very matters on which
    he has secured the admission, and the purpose of the rule is
    defeated. Field & McKusick, Maine Civil Practice Sec. 36.4 (1959);
    Finman, supra, 71 Yale L.J. 371, 418-426; Comment, 56 Nw.U.L.Rev.
    679, 682-683 (1961).
      Provision is made for withdrawal or amendment of an admission.
    This provision emphasizes the importance of having the action
    resolved on the merits, while at the same time assuring each party
    that justified reliance on an admission in preparation for trial
    will not operate to his prejudice. Cf. Moosman v. Joseph P. Blitz,
    Inc., 358 F.2d 686 (2d Cir. 1966).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      The rule is revised to reflect the change made by Rule 26(d),
    preventing a party from seeking formal discovery until after the
    meeting of the parties required by Rule 26(f).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 36 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      The final sentence of the first paragraph of former Rule 36(a)
    was a redundant cross-reference to the discovery moratorium
    provisions of Rule 26(d). Rule 26(d) is now familiar, obviating any
    need to carry forward the redundant cross-reference. The redundant
    reminder of Rule 37(c) in the second paragraph was likewise
    omitted.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. See Note to Rule 1,

    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE V. DISCLOSURES AND DISCOVERY

-HEAD-
    Rule 37. Failure to Make Disclosures or to Cooperate in Discovery;
      Sanctions

-STATUTE-
      (a) Motion for an Order Compelling Disclosure or Discovery.
        (1) In General. On notice to other parties and all affected
      persons, a party may move for an order compelling disclosure or
      discovery. The motion must include a certification that the
      movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with
      the person or party failing to make disclosure or discovery in an
      effort to obtain it without court action.
        (2) Appropriate Court. A motion for an order to a party must be
      made in the court where the action is pending. A motion for an
      order to a nonparty must be made in the court where the discovery
      is or will be taken.
        (3) Specific Motions.
          (A) To Compel Disclosure. If a party fails to make a
        disclosure required by Rule 26(a), any other party may move to
        compel disclosure and for appropriate sanctions.
          (B) To Compel a Discovery Response. A party seeking discovery
        may move for an order compelling an answer, designation,
        production, or inspection. This motion may be made if:
            (i) a deponent fails to answer a question asked under Rule
          30 or 31;
            (ii) a corporation or other entity fails to make a
          designation under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4);
            (iii) a party fails to answer an interrogatory submitted
          under Rule 33; or
            (iv) a party fails to respond that inspection will be
          permitted - or fails to permit inspection - as requested
          under Rule 34.

          (C) Related to a Deposition. When taking an oral deposition,
        the party asking a question may complete or adjourn the
        examination before moving for an order.

        (4) Evasive or Incomplete Disclosure, Answer, or Response. For
      purposes of this subdivision (a), an evasive or incomplete
      disclosure, answer, or response must be treated as a failure to
      disclose, answer, or respond.
        (5) Payment of Expenses; Protective Orders.
          (A) If the Motion Is Granted (or Disclosure or Discovery Is
        Provided After Filing). If the motion is granted - or if the
        disclosure or requested discovery is provided after the motion
        was filed - the court must, after giving an opportunity to be
        heard, require the party or deponent whose conduct necessitated
        the motion, the party or attorney advising that conduct, or
        both to pay the movant's reasonable expenses incurred in making
        the motion, including attorney's fees. But the court must not
        order this payment if:
            (i) the movant filed the motion before attempting in good
          faith to obtain the disclosure or discovery without court
          action;
            (ii) the opposing party's nondisclosure, response, or
          objection was substantially justified; or
            (iii) other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.

          (B) If the Motion Is Denied. If the motion is denied, the
        court may issue any protective order authorized under Rule
        26(c) and must, after giving an opportunity to be heard,
        require the movant, the attorney filing the motion, or both to
        pay the party or deponent who opposed the motion its reasonable
        expenses incurred in opposing the motion, including attorney's
        fees. But the court must not order this payment if the motion
        was substantially justified or other circumstances make an
        award of expenses unjust.
          (C) If the Motion Is Granted in Part and Denied in Part. If
        the motion is granted in part and denied in part, the court may
        issue any protective order authorized under Rule 26(c) and may,
        after giving an opportunity to be heard, apportion the
        reasonable expenses for the motion.

      (b) Failure to Comply with a Court Order.
        (1) Sanctions in the District Where the Deposition Is Taken. If
      the court where the discovery is taken orders a deponent to be
      sworn or to answer a question and the deponent fails to obey, the
      failure may be treated as contempt of court.
        (2) Sanctions in the District Where the Action Is Pending.
          (A) For Not Obeying a Discovery Order. If a party or a
        party's officer, director, or managing agent - or a witness
        designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4) - fails to obey an
        order to provide or permit discovery, including an order under
        Rule 26(f), 35, or 37(a), the court where the action is pending
        may issue further just orders. They may include the following:
            (i) directing that the matters embraced in the order or
          other designated facts be taken as established for purposes
          of the action, as the prevailing party claims;
            (ii) prohibiting the disobedient party from supporting or
          opposing designated claims or defenses, or from introducing
          designated matters in evidence;
            (iii) striking pleadings in whole or in part;
            (iv) staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed;
            (v) dismissing the action or proceeding in whole or in
          part;
            (vi) rendering a default judgment against the disobedient
          party; or
            (vii) treating as contempt of court the failure to obey any
          order except an order to submit to a physical or mental
          examination.

          (B) For Not Producing a Person for Examination. If a party
        fails to comply with an order under Rule 35(a) requiring it to
        produce another person for examination, the court may issue any
        of the orders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)-(vi), unless the
        disobedient party shows that it cannot produce the other
        person.
          (C) Payment of Expenses. Instead of or in addition to the
        orders above, the court must order the disobedient party, the
        attorney advising that party, or both to pay the reasonable
        expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure,
        unless the failure was substantially justified or other
        circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.

      (c) Failure to Disclose, to Supplement an Earlier Response, or to
    Admit.
        (1) Failure to Disclose or Supplement. If a party fails to
      provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule
      26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or
      witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a
      trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is
      harmless. In addition to or instead of this sanction, the court,
      on motion and after giving an opportunity to be heard:
          (A) may order payment of the reasonable expenses, including
        attorney's fees, caused by the failure;
          (B) may inform the jury of the party's failure; and
          (C) may impose other appropriate sanctions, including any of
        the orders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)-(vi).

        (2) Failure to Admit. If a party fails to admit what is
      requested under Rule 36 and if the requesting party later proves
      a document to be genuine or the matter true, the requesting party
      may move that the party who failed to admit pay the reasonable
      expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred in making that
      proof. The court must so order unless:
          (A) the request was held objectionable under Rule 36(a);
          (B) the admission sought was of no substantial importance;
          (C) the party failing to admit had a reasonable ground to
        believe that it might prevail on the matter; or
          (D) there was other good reason for the failure to admit.

      (d) Party's Failure to Attend Its Own Deposition, Serve Answers
    to Interrogatories, or Respond to a Request for Inspection.
        (1) In General.
          (A) Motion; Grounds for Sanctions. The court where the action
        is pending may, on motion, order sanctions if:
            (i) a party or a party's officer, director, or managing
          agent - or a person designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or
          31(a)(4) - fails, after being served with proper notice, to
          appear for that person's deposition; or
            (ii) a party, after being properly served with
          interrogatories under Rule 33 or a request for inspection
          under Rule 34, fails to serve its answers, objections, or
          written response.

          (B) Certification. A motion for sanctions for failing to
        answer or respond must include a certification that the movant
        has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the
        party failing to act in an effort to obtain the answer or
        response without court action.

        (2) Unacceptable Excuse for Failing to Act. A failure described
      in Rule 37(d)(1)(A) is not excused on the ground that the
      discovery sought was objectionable, unless the party failing to
      act has a pending motion for a protective order under Rule 26(c).
        (3) Types of Sanctions. Sanctions may include any of the orders
      listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)-(vi). Instead of or in addition to
      these sanctions, the court must require the party failing to act,
      the attorney advising that party, or both to pay the reasonable
      expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure,
      unless the failure was substantially justified or other
      circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.

      (e) Failure to Provide Electronically Stored Information. Absent
    exceptional circumstances, a court may not impose sanctions under
    these rules on a party for failing to provide electronically stored
    information lost as a result of the routine, good-faith operation
    of an electronic information system.
      (f) Failure to Participate in Framing a Discovery Plan. If a
    party or its attorney fails to participate in good faith in
    developing and submitting a proposed discovery plan as required by
    Rule 26(f), the court may, after giving an opportunity to be heard,
    require that party or attorney to pay to any other party the
    reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the
    failure.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      The provisions of this rule authorizing orders establishing facts
    or excluding evidence or striking pleadings, or authorizing
    judgments of dismissal or default, for refusal to answer questions
    or permit inspection or otherwise make discovery, are in accord
    with Hammond Packing Co. v. Arkansas, 212 U.S. 322 (1909), which
    distinguishes between the justifiable use of such measures as a
    means of compelling the production of evidence, and their
    unjustifiable use, as in Hovey v. Elliott, 167 U.S. 409 (1897), for
    the mere purpose of punishing for contempt.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1948 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment substitutes the present statutory reference.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1970 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 37 provides generally for sanctions against parties or
    persons unjustifiably resisting discovery. Experience has brought
    to light a number of defects in the language of the rule as well as
    instances in which it is not serving the purposes for which it was
    designed. See Rosenberg, Sanctions to Effectuate Pretrial
    Discovery, 58 Col.L.Rev. 480 (1958). In addition, changes being
    made in other discovery rules requiring conforming amendments to
    Rule 37.
      Rule 37 sometimes refers to a "failure" to afford discovery and
    at other times to a "refusal" to do so. Taking note of this dual
    terminology, courts have imported into "refusal" a requirement of
    "wilfullness." See Roth v. Paramount Pictures Corp., 8 F.R.D. 31
    (W.D.Pa. 1948); Campbell v. Johnson, 101 F.Supp. 705, 707 (S.D.N.Y.
    1951). In Societe Internationale v. Rogers, 357 U.S. 197 (1958),
    the Supreme Court concluded that the rather random use of these two
    terms in Rule 37 showed no design to use them with consistently
    distinctive meanings, that "refused" in Rule 37(b)(2) meant simply
    a failure to comply, and that wilfullness was relevant only to the
    selection of sanctions, if any, to be imposed. Nevertheless, after
    the decision in Societe, the court in Hinson v. Michigan Mutual
    Liability Co., 275 F.2d 537 (5th Cir. 1960) once again ruled that
    "refusal" required wilfullness. Substitution of "failure" for
    "refusal" throughout Rule 37 should eliminate this confusion and
    bring the rule into harmony with the Societe Internationale
    decision. See Rosenberg, supra, 58 Col.L.Rev. 480, 489-490 (1958).
      Subdivision (a). Rule 37(a) provides relief to a party seeking
    discovery against one who, with or without stated objections, fails
    to afford the discovery sought. It has always fully served this
    function in relation to depositions, but the amendments being made
    to Rules 33 and 34 give Rule 37(a) added scope and importance.
    Under existing Rule 33, a party objecting to interrogatories must
    make a motion for court hearing on his objections. The changes now
    made in Rules 33 and 37(a) make it clear that the interrogating
    party must move to compel answers, and the motion is provided for
    in Rule 37(a). Existing Rule 34, since it requires a court order
    prior to production of documents or things or permission to enter
    on land, has no relation to Rule 37(a). Amendments of Rules 34 and
    37(a) create a procedure similar to that provided for Rule 33.
      Subdivision (a)(1). This is a new provision making clear to which
    court a party may apply for an order compelling discovery. Existing
    Rule 37(a) refers only to the court in which the deposition is
    being taken; nevertheless, it has been held that the court where
    the action is pending has "inherent power" to compel a party
    deponent to answer. Lincoln Laboratories, Inc. v. Savage
    Laboratories, Inc., 27 F.R.D. 476 (D.Del. 1961). In relation to
    Rule 33 interrogatories and Rule 34 requests for inspection, the
    court where the action is pending is the appropriate enforcing
    tribunal. The new provision eliminates the need to resort to
    inherent power by spelling out the respective roles of the court
    where the action is pending and the court where the deposition is
    taken. In some instances, two courts are available to a party
    seeking to compel answers from a party deponent. The party seeking
    discovery may choose the court to which he will apply, but the
    court has power to remit the party to the other court as a more
    appropriate forum.
      Subdivision (a)(2). This subdivision contains the substance of
    existing provisions of Rule 37(a) authorizing motions to compel
    answers to questions put at depositions and to interrogatories. New
    provisions authorize motions for orders compelling designation
    under Rules 30(b)(6) and 31(a) and compelling inspection in
    accordance with a request made under Rule 34. If the court denies a
    motion, in whole or part, it may accompany the denial with issuance
    of a protective order. Compare the converse provision in Rule
    26(c).
      Subdivision (a)(3). This new provision makes clear that an
    evasive or incomplete answer is to be considered, for purposes of
    subdivision (a), a failure to answer. The courts have consistently
    held that they have the power to compel adequate answers. E.g.,
    Cone Mills Corp. v. Joseph Bancroft & Sons Co., 33 F.R.D. 318
    (D.Del. 1963). This power is recognized and incorporated into the
    rule.
      Subdivision (a)(4). This subdivision amends the provisions for
    award of expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, to the
    prevailing party or person when a motion is made for an order
    compelling discovery. At present, an award of expenses is made only
    if the losing party or person is found to have acted without
    substantial justification. The change requires that expenses be
    awarded unless the conduct of the losing party or person is found
    to have been substantially justified. The test of "substantial
    justification" remains, but the change in language is intended to
    encourage judges to be more alert to abuses occurring in the
    discovery process.
      On many occasions, to be sure, the dispute over discovery between
    the parties is genuine, though ultimately resolved one way or the
    other by the court. In such cases, the losing party is
    substantially justified in carrying the matter to court. But the
    rules should deter the abuse implicit in carrying or forcing a
    discovery dispute to court when no genuine dispute exists. And the
    potential or actual imposition of expenses is virtually the sole
    formal sanction in the rules to deter a party from pressing to a
    court hearing frivolous requests for or objections to discovery.
      The present provision of Rule 37(a) that the court shall require
    payment if it finds that the defeated party acted without
    "substantial justification" may appear adequate, but in fact it has
    been little used. Only a handful of reported cases include an award
    of expenses, and the Columbia Survey found that in only one
    instance out of about 50 motions decided under Rule 37(a) did the
    court award expenses. It appears that the courts do not utilize the
    most important available sanction to deter abusive resort to the
    judiciary.
      The proposed change provides in effect that expenses should
    ordinarily be awarded unless a court finds that the losing party
    acted justifiably in carrying his point to court. At the same time,
    a necessary flexibility is maintained, since the court retains the
    power to find that other circumstances make an award of expenses
    unjust - as where the prevailing party also acted unjustifiably.
    The amendment does not significantly narrow the discretion of the
    court, but rather presses the court to address itself to abusive
    practices. The present provision that expenses may be imposed upon
    either the party or his attorney or both is unchanged. But it is
    not contemplated that expenses will be imposed upon the attorney
    merely because the party is indigent.
      Subdivision (b). This subdivision deals with sanctions for
    failure to comply with a court order. The present captions for
    subsections (1) and (2) entitled, "Contempt" and "Other
    Consequences," respectively, are confusing. One of the consequences
    listed in (2) is the arrest of the party, representing the exercise
    of the contempt power. The contents of the subsections show that
    the first authorizes the sanction of contempt (and no other) by the
    court in which the deposition is taken, whereas the second
    subsection authorizes a variety of sanctions, including contempt,
    which may be imposed by the court in which the action is pending.
    The captions of the subsections are changed to deflect their
    contents.
      The scope of Rule 37(b)(2) is broadened by extending it to
    include any order "to provide or permit discovery," including
    orders issued under Rules 37(a) and 35. Various rules authorize
    orders for discovery - e.g., Rule 35 (b)(1), Rule 26(c) as revised.
    Rule 37(d). See Rosenberg, supra, 58 Col.L.Rev. 480, 484-486. Rule
    37(b)(2) should provide comprehensively for enforcement of all
    these orders. Cf. Societe Internationale v. Rogers, 357 U.S. 197,
    207 (1958). On the other hand, the reference to Rule 34 is deleted
    to conform to the changed procedure in that rule.
      A new subsection (E) provides that sanctions which have been
    available against a party for failure to comply with an order under
    Rule 35(a) to submit to examination will now be available against
    him for his failure to comply with a Rule 35(a) order to produce a
    third person for examination, unless he shows that he is unable to
    produce the person. In this context, "unable" means in effect
    "unable in good faith." See Societe Internationale v. Rogers, 357
    U.S. 197 (1958).
      Subdivision (b)(2) is amplified to provide for payment of
    reasonable expenses caused by the failure to obey the order.
    Although Rules 37(b)(2) and 37(d) have been silent as to award of
    expenses, courts have nevertheless ordered them on occasion. E.g.,
    United Sheeplined Clothing Co. v. Arctic Fur Cap Corp., 165 F.Supp.
    193 (S.D.N.Y.1958); Austin Theatre, Inc. v. Warner Bros. Picture,
    Inc., 22 F.R.D. 302 (S.D.N.Y. 1958). The provision places the
    burden on the disobedient party to avoid expenses by showing that
    his failure is justified or that special circumstances make an
    award of expenses unjust. Allocating the burden in this way
    conforms to the changed provisions as to expenses in Rule 37(a),
    and is particularly appropriate when a court order is disobeyed.
      An added reference to directors of a party is similar to a change
    made in subdivision (d) and is explained in the note to that
    subdivision. The added reference to persons designated by a party
    under Rules 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of the party
    carries out the new procedure in those rules for taking a
    deposition of a corporation or other organization.
      Subdivision (c). Rule 37(c) provides a sanction for the
    enforcement of Rule 36 dealing with requests for admission. Rule 36
    provides the mechanism whereby a party may obtain from another
    party in appropriate instances either (1) and admission, or (2) a
    sworn and specific denial, or (3) a sworn statement "setting forth
    in detail the reasons why he cannot truthfully admit or deny." If
    the party obtains the second or third of these responses, in proper
    form, Rule 36 does not provide for a pretrial hearing on whether
    the response is warranted by the evidence thus far accumulated.
    Instead, Rule 37(c) is intended to provide posttrial relief in the
    form of a requirement that the party improperly refusing the
    admission pay the expenses of the other side in making the
    necessary proof at trial.
      Rule 37(c), as now written, addresses itself in terms only to the
    sworn denial and is silent with respect to the statement of reasons
    for an inability to admit or deny. There is no apparent basis for
    this distinction, since the sanction provided in Rule 37(c) should
    deter all unjustified failures to admit. This omission in the rule
    has caused confused and diverse treatment in the courts. One court
    has held that if a party gives inadequate reasons, he should be
    treated before trial as having denied the request, so that Rule
    37(c) may apply. Bertha Bldg. Corp. v. National Theatres Corp., 15
    F.R.D. 339 (E.D.N.Y. 1954). Another has held that the party should
    be treated as having admitted the request. Heng Hsin Co. v. Stern,
    Morgenthau & Co., 20 Fed.Rules Serv. 36a.52, Case 1 (S.D.N.Y. Dec.
    10, 1954). Still another has ordered a new response, without
    indicating what the outcome should be if the new response were
    inadequate. United States Plywood Corp. v. Hudson Lumber Co., 127
    F.Supp. 489, 497-498 (S.D.N.Y. 1954). See generally Finman, The
    Request for Admissions in Federal Civil Procedure, 71 Yale L.J.
    371, 426-430 (1962). The amendment eliminates this defect in Rule
    37(c) by bringing within its scope all failures to admit.
      Additional provisions in Rule 37(c) protect a party from having
    to pay expenses if the request for admission was held objectionable
    under Rule 36(a) or if the party failing to admit had reasonable
    ground to believe that he might prevail on the matter. The latter
    provision emphasizes that the true test under Rule 37(c) is not
    whether a party prevailed at trial but whether he acted reasonably
    in believing that he might prevail.
      Subdivision (d). The scope of subdivision (d) is broadened to
    include responses to requests for inspection under Rule 34, thereby
    conforming to the new procedures of Rule 34.
      Two related changes are made in subdivision (d): the permissible
    sanctions are broadened to include such orders "as are just"; and
    the requirement that the failure to appear or respond be "wilful"
    is eliminated. Although Rule 37(d) in terms provides for only three
    sanctions, all rather severe, the courts have interpreted it as
    permitting softer sanctions than those which it sets forth. E.g.,
    Gill v. Stolow, 240 F.2d 669 (2d Cir. 1957); Saltzman v. Birrell,
    156 F.Supp. 538 (S.D.N.Y. 1957); 2A Barron & Holtzoff, Federal
    Practice and Procedure 554-557 (Wright ed. 1961). The rule is
    changed to provide the greater flexibility as to sanctions which
    the cases show is needed.
      The resulting flexibility as to sanctions eliminates any need to
    retain the requirement that the failure to appear or respond be
    "wilful." The concept of "wilful failure" is at best subtle and
    difficult, and the cases do not supply a bright line. Many courts
    have imposed sanctions without referring to wilfullness. E.g.,
    Milewski v. Schneider Transportation Co., 238 F.2d 397 (6th Cir.
    1956); Dictograph Products, Inc. v. Kentworth Corp., 7 F.R.D. 543
    (W.D.Ky. 1947). In addition, in view of the possibility of light
    sanctions, even a negligent failure should come within Rule 37(d).
    If default is caused by counsel's ignorance of Federal practice,
    cf. Dunn. v. Pa. R.R., 96 F. Supp. 597 (N.D.Ohio 1951), or by his
    preoccupation with another aspect of the case, cf. Maurer-Neuer,
    Inc. v. United Packinghouse Workers, 26 F.R.D. 139 (D.Kans. 1960),
    dismissal of the action and default judgment are not justified, but
    the imposition of expenses and fees may well be. "Wilfullness"
    continues to play a role, along with various other factors, in the
    choice of sanctions. Thus, the scheme conforms to Rule 37(b) as
    construed by the Supreme Court in Societe Internationale v. Rogers,
    357 U.S. 197, 208 (1958).
      A provision is added to make clear that a party may not properly
    remain completely silent even when he regards a notice to take his
    deposition or a set of interrogatories or requests to inspect as
    improper and objectionable. If he desires not to appear or not to
    respond, he must apply for a protective order. The cases are
    divided on whether a protective order must be sought. Compare
    Collins v. Wayland, 139 F.2d 677 (9th Cir. 1944), cert. den. 322
    U.S. 744; Bourgeois v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 20 F.R.D. 358
    (S.D.N.Y. 1957); Loosley v. Stone, 15 F.R.D. 373 (S.D.Ill. 1954),
    with Scarlatos v. Kulukundis, 21 F.R.D. 185 (S.D.N.Y. 1957); Ross
    v. True Temper Corp., 11 F.R.D 307 (N.D.Ohio 1951). Compare also
    Rosenberg, supra, 58 Col.L.Rev. 480, 496 (1958) with 2A Barron &
    Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure 530-531 (Wright ed. 1961).
    The party from whom discovery is sought is afforded, through Rule
    26(c), a fair and effective procedure whereby he can challenge the
    request made. At the same time, the total non-compliance with which
    Rule 37(d) is concerned may impose severe inconvenience or hardship
    on the discovering party and substantially delay the discovery
    process. Cf. 2B Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure
    306-307 (Wright ed. 1961) (response to a subpoena).
      The failure of an officer or managing agent of a party to make
    discovery as required by present Rule 37(d) is treated as the
    failure of the party. The rule as revised provides similar
    treatment for a director of a party. There is slight warrant for
    the present distinction between officers and managing agents on the
    one hand and directors on the other. Although the legal power over
    a director to compel his making discovery may not be as great as
    over officers or managing agents, Campbell v. General Motors Corp.,
    13 F.R.D. 331 (S.D.N.Y. 1952), the practical differences are
    negligible. That a director's interests are normally aligned with
    those of his corporation is shown by the provisions of old Rule
    26(d)(2), transferred to 32(a)(2) (deposition of director of party
    may be used at trial by an adverse party for any purpose) and of
    Rule 43(b) (director of party may be treated at trial as a hostile
    witness on direct examination by any adverse party). Moreover, in
    those rare instances when a corporation is unable through good
    faith efforts to compel a director to make discovery, it is
    unlikely that the court will impose sanctions. Cf. Societe
    Internationale v. Rogers, 357 U.S. 197 (1958).
      Subdivision (e). The change in the caption conforms to the
    language of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1783, as amended in 1964.
      Subdivision (f). Until recently, costs of a civil action could be
    awarded against the United States only when expressly provided by
    Act of Congress, and such provision was rarely made. See
    H.R.Rept.No. 1535, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 2-3 (1966). To avoid any
    conflict with this doctrine, Rule 37(f) has provided that expenses
    and attorney's fees may not be imposed upon the United States under
    Rule 37. See 2A Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure
    857 (Wright ed. 1961).
      A major change in the law was made in 1966, 80 Stat. 308, 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 2412 (1966), whereby a judgment for costs may
    ordinarily be awarded to the prevailing party in any civil action
    brought by or against the United States. Costs are not to include
    the fees and expenses of attorneys. In light of this legislative
    development, Rule 37(f) is amended to permit the award of expenses
    and fees against the United States under Rule 37, but only to the
    extent permitted by statute. The amendment brings Rule 37(f) into
    line with present and future statutory provisions.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1980 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b)(2). New Rule 26(f) provides that if a discovery
    conference is held, at its close the court shall enter an order
    respecting the subsequent conduct of discovery. The amendment
    provides that the sanctions available for violation of other court
    orders respecting discovery are available for violation of the
    discovery conference order.
      Subdivision (e). Subdivision (e) is stricken. Title 28, U.S.C.
    Sec. 1783 no longer refers to sanctions. The subdivision otherwise
    duplicates Rule 45(e)(2).
      Subdivision (g). New Rule 26(f) imposes a duty on parties to
    participate in good faith in the framing of a discovery plan by
    agreement upon the request of any party. This subdivision
    authorizes the court to award to parties who participate in good
    faith in an attempt to frame a discovery plan the expenses incurred
    in the attempt if any party or his attorney fails to participate in
    good faith and thereby causes additional expense.
      Failure of United States to Participate in Good Faith in
    Discovery. Rule 37 authorizes the court to direct that parties or
    attorneys who fail to participate in good faith in the discovery
    process pay the expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by
    other parties as a result of that failure. Since attorneys' fees
    cannot ordinarily be awarded against the United States (28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 2412), there is often no practical remedy for the misconduct
    of its officers and attorneys. However, in the case of a government
    attorney who fails to participate in good faith in discovery,
    nothing prevents a court in an appropriate case from giving written
    notification of that fact to the Attorney General of the United
    States and other appropriate heads of offices or agencies thereof.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). This subdivision is revised to reflect the
    revision of Rule 26(a), requiring disclosure of matters without a
    discovery request.
      Pursuant to new subdivision (a)(2)(A), a party dissatisfied with
    the disclosure made by an opposing party may under this rule move
    for an order to compel disclosure. In providing for such a motion,
    the revised rule parallels the provisions of the former rule
    dealing with failures to answer particular interrogatories. Such a
    motion may be needed when the information to be disclosed might be
    helpful to the party seeking the disclosure but not to the party
    required to make the disclosure. If the party required to make the
    disclosure would need the material to support its own contentions,
    the more effective enforcement of the disclosure requirement will
    be to exclude the evidence not disclosed, as provided in
    subdivision (c)(1) of this revised rule.
      Language is included in the new paragraph and added to the
    subparagraph (B) that requires litigants to seek to resolve
    discovery disputes by informal means before filing a motion with
    the court. This requirement is based on successful experience with
    similar local rules of court promulgated pursuant to Rule 83.
      The last sentence of paragraph (2) is moved into paragraph (4).
      Under revised paragraph (3), evasive or incomplete disclosures
    and responses to interrogatories and production requests are
    treated as failures to disclose or respond. Interrogatories and
    requests for production should not be read or interpreted in an
    artificially restrictive or hypertechnical manner to avoid
    disclosure of information fairly covered by the discovery request,
    and to do so is subject to appropriate sanctions under subdivision
    (a).
      Revised paragraph (4) is divided into three subparagraphs for
    ease of reference, and in each the phrase "after opportunity for
    hearing" is changed to "after affording an opportunity to be heard"
    to make clear that the court can consider such questions on written
    submissions as well as on oral hearings.
      Subparagraph (A) is revised to cover the situation where
    information that should have been produced without a motion to
    compel is produced after the motion is filed but before it is
    brought on for hearing. The rule also is revised to provide that a
    party should not be awarded its expenses for filing a motion that
    could have been avoided by conferring with opposing counsel.
      Subparagraph (C) is revised to include the provision that
    formerly was contained in subdivision (a)(2) and to include the
    same requirement of an opportunity to be heard that is specified in
    subparagraphs (A) and (B).
      Subdivision (c). The revision provides a self-executing sanction
    for failure to make a disclosure required by Rule 26(a), without
    need for a motion under subdivision (a)(2)(A).
      Paragraph (1) prevents a party from using as evidence any
    witnesses or information that, without substantial justification,
    has not been disclosed as required by Rules 26(a) and 26(e)(1).
    This automatic sanction provides a strong inducement for disclosure
    of material that the disclosing party would expect to use as
    evidence, whether at a trial, at a hearing, or on a motion, such as
    one under Rule 56. As disclosure of evidence offered solely for
    impeachment purposes is not required under those rules, this
    preclusion sanction likewise does not apply to that evidence.
      Limiting the automatic sanction to violations "without
    substantial justification," coupled with the exception for
    violations that are "harmless," is needed to avoid unduly harsh
    penalties in a variety of situations: e.g., the inadvertent
    omission from a Rule 26(a)(1)(A) disclosure of the name of a
    potential witness known to all parties; the failure to list as a
    trial witness a person so listed by another party; or the lack of
    knowledge of a pro se litigant of the requirement to make
    disclosures. In the latter situation, however, exclusion would be
    proper if the requirement for disclosure had been called to the
    litigant's attention by either the court or another party.
      Preclusion of evidence is not an effective incentive to compel
    disclosure of information that, being supportive of the position of
    the opposing party, might advantageously be concealed by the
    disclosing party. However, the rule provides the court with a wide
    range of other sanctions - such as declaring specified facts to be
    established, preventing contradictory evidence, or, like spoliation
    of evidence, allowing the jury to be informed of the fact of
    nondisclosure - that, though not self-executing, can be imposed
    when found to be warranted after a hearing. The failure to identify
    a witness or document in a disclosure statement would be admissible
    under the Federal Rules of Evidence under the same principles that
    allow a party's interrogatory answers to be offered against it.
      Subdivision (d). This subdivision is revised to require that,
    where a party fails to file any response to interrogatories or a
    Rule 34 request, the discovering party should informally seek to
    obtain such responses before filing a motion for sanctions.
      The last sentence of this subdivision is revised to clarify that
    it is the pendency of a motion for protective order that may be
    urged as an excuse for a violation of subdivision (d). If a party's
    motion has been denied, the party cannot argue that its subsequent
    failure to comply would be justified. In this connection, it should
    be noted that the filing of a motion under Rule 26(c) is not self-
    executing - the relief authorized under that rule depends on
    obtaining the court's order to that effect.
      Subdivision (g). This subdivision is modified to conform to the
    revision of Rule 26(f).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (c)(1). When this subdivision was added in 1993 to
    direct exclusion of materials not disclosed as required, the duty
    to supplement discovery responses pursuant to Rule 26(e)(2) was
    omitted. In the face of this omission, courts may rely on inherent
    power to sanction for failure to supplement as required by Rule
    26(e)(2), see 8 Federal Practice & Procedure Sec. 2050 at 607-09,
    but that is an uncertain and unregulated ground for imposing
    sanctions. There is no obvious occasion for a Rule 37(a) motion in
    connection with failure to supplement, and ordinarily only Rule
    37(c)(1) exists as rule-based authority for sanctions if this
    supplementation obligation is violated.
      The amendment explicitly adds failure to comply with Rule
    26(e)(2) as a ground for sanctions under Rule 37(c)(1), including
    exclusion of withheld materials. The rule provides that this
    sanction power only applies when the failure to supplement was
    "without substantial justification." Even if the failure was not
    substantially justified, a party should be allowed to use the
    material that was not disclosed if the lack of earlier notice was
    harmless.
      "Shall" is replaced by "is" under the program to conform amended
    rules to current style conventions when there is no ambiguity.
      GAP Report. The Advisory Committee recommends that the published
    amendment proposal be modified to state that the exclusion sanction
    can apply to failure "to amend a prior response to discovery as
    required by Rule 26(e)(2)." In addition, one minor phrasing change
    is recommended for the Committee Note.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (f). Subdivision (f) is new. It focuses on a
    distinctive feature of computer operations, the routine alteration
    and deletion of information that attends ordinary use. Many steps
    essential to computer operation may alter or destroy information,
    for reasons that have nothing to do with how that information might
    relate to litigation. As a result, the ordinary operation of
    computer systems creates a risk that a party may lose potentially
    discoverable information without culpable conduct on its part.
    Under Rule 37(f), absent exceptional circumstances, sanctions
    cannot be imposed for loss of electronically stored information
    resulting from the routine, good-faith operation of an electronic
    information system.
      Rule 37(f) applies only to information lost due to the "routine
    operation of an electronic information system" - the ways in which
    such systems are generally designed, programmed, and implemented to
    meet the party's technical and business needs. The "routine
    operation" of computer systems includes the alteration and
    overwriting of information, often without the operator's specific
    direction or awareness, a feature with no direct counterpart in
    hard-copy documents. Such features are essential to the operation
    of electronic information systems.
      Rule 37(f) applies to information lost due to the routine
    operation of an information system only if the operation was in
    good faith. Good faith in the routine operation of an information
    system may involve a party's intervention to modify or suspend
    certain features of that routine operation to prevent the loss of
    information, if that information is subject to a preservation
    obligation. A preservation obligation may arise from many sources,
    including common law, statutes, regulations, or a court order in
    the case. The good faith requirement of Rule 37(f) means that a
    party is not permitted to exploit the routine operation of an
    information system to thwart discovery obligations by allowing that
    operation to continue in order to destroy specific stored
    information that it is required to preserve. When a party is under
    a duty to preserve information because of pending or reasonably
    anticipated litigation, intervention in the routine operation of an
    information system is one aspect of what is often called a
    "litigation hold." Among the factors that bear on a party's good
    faith in the routine operation of an information system are the
    steps the party took to comply with a court order in the case or
    party agreement requiring preservation of specific electronically
    stored information.
      Whether good faith would call for steps to prevent the loss of
    information on sources that the party believes are not reasonably
    accessible under Rule 26(b)(2) depends on the circumstances of each
    case. One factor is whether the party reasonably believes that the
    information on such sources is likely to be discoverable and not
    available from reasonably accessible sources.
      The protection provided by Rule 37(f) applies only to sanctions
    "under these rules." It does not affect other sources of authority
    to impose sanctions or rules of professional responsibility.
      This rule restricts the imposition of "sanctions." It does not
    prevent a court from making the kinds of adjustments frequently
    used in managing discovery if a party is unable to provide relevant
    responsive information. For example, a court could order the
    responding party to produce an additional witness for deposition,
    respond to additional interrogatories, or make similar attempts to
    provide substitutes or alternatives for some or all of the lost
    information.
      Changes Made after Publication and Comment. The published rule
    barred sanctions only if the party who lost electronically stored
    information took reasonable steps to preserve the information after
    it knew or should have known the information was discoverable in
    the action. A footnote invited comment on an alternative standard
    that barred sanctions unless the party recklessly or intentionally
    failed to preserve the information. The present proposal
    establishes an intermediate standard, protecting against sanctions
    if the information was lost in the "good faith" operation of an
    electronic information system. The present proposal carries forward
    a related element that was a central part of the published proposal
    - the information must have been lost in the system's "routine
    operation." The change to a good-faith test made it possible to
    eliminate the reference to information "discoverable in the
    action," removing a potential source of confusion as to the duty to
    preserve information on sources that are identified as not
    reasonably accessible under Rule 26(b)(2)(B).
      The change to a good-faith standard is accompanied by addition of
    a provision that permits sanctions for loss of information in good-
    faith routine operation in "exceptional circumstances." This
    provision recognizes that in some circumstances a court should
    provide remedies to protect an entirely innocent party requesting
    discovery against serious prejudice arising from the loss of
    potentially important information.
      As published, the rule included an express exception that denied
    protection if a party "violated an order in the action requiring it
    to preserve electronically stored information." This exception was
    deleted for fear that it would invite routine applications for
    preservation orders, and often for overbroad orders. The revised
    Committee Note observes that violation of an order is an element in
    determining whether a party acted in good faith.
      The revised proposal broadens the rule's protection by applying
    to operation of "an" electronic information system, rather than
    "the party's" system. The change protects a party who has
    contracted with an outside firm to provide electronic information
    storage, avoiding potential arguments whether the system can be
    characterized as "the party's." The party remains obliged to act in
    good faith to avoid loss of information in routine operations
    conducted by the outside firm.
      The Committee Note is changed to reflect the changes in the rule
    text.
      The changes from the published version of the proposed rule text
    are set out below. [Omitted]

    Rule 38. Right to a Jury Trial; Demand

-STATUTE-
      (a) Right Preserved. The right of trial by jury as declared by
    the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution - or as provided by a
    federal statute - is preserved to the parties inviolate.
      (b) Demand. On any issue triable of right by a jury, a party may
    demand a jury trial by:
        (1) serving the other parties with a written demand - which may
      be included in a pleading - no later than 14 days after the last
      pleading directed to the issue is served; and
        (2) filing the demand in accordance with Rule 5(d).

      (c) Specifying Issues. In its demand, a party may specify the
    issues that it wishes to have tried by a jury; otherwise, it is
    considered to have demanded a jury trial on all the issues so
    triable. If the party has demanded a jury trial on only some
    issues, any other party may - within 14 days after being served
    with the demand or within a shorter time ordered by the court -
    serve a demand for a jury trial on any other or all factual issues
    triable by jury.
      (d) Waiver; Withdrawal. A party waives a jury trial unless its
    demand is properly served and filed. A proper demand may be
    withdrawn only if the parties consent.
      (e) Admiralty and Maritime Claims. These rules do not create a
    right to a jury trial on issues in a claim that is an admiralty or
    maritime claim under Rule 9(h).

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      This rule provides for the preservation of the constitutional
    right of trial by jury as directed in the enabling act (act of June
    19, 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, U.S.C., Title 28, Sec. 723c [see 2072]),
    and it and the next rule make definite provision for claim and
    waiver of jury trial, following the method used in many American
    states and in England and the British Dominions. Thus the claim
    must be made at once on initial pleading or appearance under
    Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937) ch. 110, Sec. 188; 6 Tenn.Code Ann. (Williams,
    1934) Sec. 8734; compare Wyo.Rev.Stat.Ann. (1931) Sec. 89-1320

    Rule 39. Trial by Jury or by the Court

-STATUTE-
      (a) When a Demand Is Made. When a jury trial has been demanded
    under Rule 38, the action must be designated on the docket as a
    jury action. The trial on all issues so demanded must be by jury
    unless:
        (1) the parties or their attorneys file a stipulation to a
      nonjury trial or so stipulate on the record; or
        (2) the court, on motion or on its own, finds that on some or
      all of those issues there is no federal right to a jury trial.

      (b) When No Demand Is Made. Issues on which a jury trial is not
    properly demanded are to be tried by the court. But the court may,
    on motion, order a jury trial on any issue for which a jury might
    have been demanded.
      (c) Advisory Jury; Jury Trial by Consent. In an action not
    triable of right by a jury, the court, on motion or on its own:
        (1) may try any issue with an advisory jury; or
        (2) may, with the parties' consent, try any issue by a jury
      whose verdict has the same effect as if a jury trial had been a
      matter of right, unless the action is against the United States
      and a federal statute provides for a nonjury trial.

      The provisions for express waiver of jury trial found in U.S.C.,
    Title 28, [former] Sec. 773 (Trial of issues of fact; by court) are
    incorporated in this rule. See rule 38, however, which extends the
    provisions for waiver of jury. U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Sec. 772
    (Trial of issues of fact; in equity in patent causes) is unaffected
    by this rule. When certain of the issues are to be tried by jury
    and others by the court, the court may determine the sequence in
    which such issues shall be tried. See Liberty Oil Co. v. Condon
    Nat. Bank, 260 U.S. 235 (1922).

      The best methods for scheduling trials depend on local

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE VI. TRIALS

-HEAD-
    Rule 41. Dismissal of Actions

-STATUTE-
      (a) Voluntary Dismissal.
        (1) By the Plaintiff.
          (A) Without a Court Order. Subject to Rules 23(e), 23.1(c),
        23.2, and 66 and any applicable federal statute, the plaintiff
        may dismiss an action without a court order by filing:
            (i) a notice of dismissal before the opposing party serves
          either an answer or a motion for summary judgment; or
            (ii) a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who
          have appeared.

          (B) Effect. Unless the notice or stipulation states
        otherwise, the dismissal is without prejudice. But if the
        plaintiff previously dismissed any federal- or state-court
        action based on or including the same claim, a notice of
        dismissal operates as an adjudication on the merits.

        (2) By Court Order; Effect. Except as provided in Rule
      41(a)(1), an action may be dismissed at the plaintiff's request
      only by court order, on terms that the court considers proper. If
      a defendant has pleaded a counterclaim before being served with
      the plaintiff's motion to dismiss, the action may be dismissed
      over the defendant's objection only if the counterclaim can
      remain pending for independent adjudication. Unless the order
      states otherwise, a dismissal under this paragraph (2) is without
      prejudice.

      (b) Involuntary Dismissal; Effect. If the plaintiff fails to
    prosecute or to comply with these rules or a court order, a
    defendant may move to dismiss the action or any claim against it.
    Unless the dismissal order states otherwise, a dismissal under this
    subdivision (b) and any dismissal not under this rule - except one
    for lack of jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join a
    party under Rule 19 - operates as an adjudication on the merits.
      (c) Dismissing a Counterclaim, Crossclaim, or Third-Party Claim.
    This rule applies to a dismissal of any counterclaim, crossclaim,
    or third-party claim. A claimant's voluntary dismissal under Rule
    41(a)(1)(A)(i) must be made:
        (1) before a responsive pleading is served; or
        (2) if there is no responsive pleading, before evidence is
      introduced at a hearing or trial.

      (d) Costs of a Previously Dismissed Action. If a plaintiff who
    previously dismissed an action in any court files an action based
    on or including the same claim against the same defendant, the
    court:
        (1) may order the plaintiff to pay all or part of the costs of
      that previous action; and
        (2) may stay the proceedings until the plaintiff has complied.

      Note to Subdivision (a). Compare Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937) ch. 110,
    Sec. 176, and English Rules Under the Judicature Act (The Annual
    Practice, 1937) O. 26.
      Provisions regarding dismissal in such statutes as U.S.C., Title
    8, Sec. 164 [see 1329] (Jurisdiction of district courts in
    immigration cases) and U.S.C., Title 31, Sec. 232 [now 3730]
    (Liability of persons making false claims against United States;
    suits) are preserved by paragraph (1).
      Note to Subdivision (b). This provides for the equivalent of a
    nonsuit on motion by the defendant after the completion of the
    presentation of evidence by the plaintiff. Also, for actions tried
    without a jury, it provides the equivalent of the directed verdict
    practice for jury actions which is regulated by Rule 50.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The insertion of the reference to Rule 66
    correlates Rule 41(a)(1) with the express provisions concerning
    dismissal set forth in amended Rule 66 on receivers.
      The change in Rule 41(a)(1)(i) gives the service of a motion for
    summary judgment by the adverse party the same effect in preventing
    unlimited dismissal as was originally given only to the service of
    an answer. The omission of reference to a motion for summary
    judgment in the original rule was subject to criticism. 3 Moore's
    Federal Practice (1938) 3037-3038, n. 12. A motion for summary
    judgment may be forthcoming prior to answer, and if well taken will
    eliminate the necessity for an answer. Since such a motion may
    require even more research and preparation than the answer itself,
    there is good reason why the service of the motion, like that of
    the answer, should prevent a voluntary dismissal by the adversary
    without court approval.
      The word "generally" has been stricken from Rule 41(a)(1)(ii) in
    order to avoid confusion and to conform with the elimination of the
    necessity for special appearances by original Rule 12(b).
      Subdivision (b). In some cases tried without a jury, where at the
    close of plaintiff's evidence the defendant moves for dismissal
    under Rule 41(b) on the ground that plaintiff's evidence is
    insufficient for recovery, the plaintiff's own evidence may be
    conflicting or present questions of credibility. In ruling on the
    defendant's motion, questions arise as to the function of the judge
    in evaluating the testimony and whether findings should be made if
    the motion is sustained. Three circuits hold that as the judge is
    the trier of the facts in such a situation his function is not the
    same as on a motion to direct a verdict, where the jury is the
    trier of the facts, and that the judge in deciding such a motion in
    a non-jury case may pass on conflicts of evidence and credibility,
    and if he performs that function of evaluating the testimony and
    grants the motion on the merits, findings are required. Young v.
    United States (C.C.A.9th, 1940) 111 F.(2d) 823; Gary Theatre Co. v.
    Columbia Pictures Corporation (C.C.A.7th, 1941) 120 F.(2d) 891;
    Bach v. Friden Calculating Machine Co., Inc. (C.C.A.6th, 1945) 148
    F.(2d) 407. Cf. Mateas v. Fred Harvey, a Corporation (C.C.A.9th,
    1945) 146 F.(2d) 989. The Third Circuit has held that on such a
    motion the function of the court is the same as on a motion to
    direct in a jury case, and that the court should only decide
    whether there is evidence which would support a judgment for the
    plaintiff, and, therefore, findings are not required by Rule 52.
    Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. v. Mason (C.C.A.3d, 1940) 115
    F.(2d) 548; Schad v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. (C.C.A.3d,
    1943) 136 F.(2d) 991. The added sentence in Rule 41(b) incorporates
    the view of the Sixth, Seventh and Ninth Circuits. See also 3
    Moore's Federal Practice (1938) Cum. Supplement Sec. 41.03, under
    "Page 3045"; Commentary, The Motion to Dismiss in Non-Jury Cases
    (1946) 9 Fed.Rules Serv., Comm.Pg. 41b.14.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      Under the present text of the second sentence of this
    subdivision, the motion for dismissal at the close of the
    plaintiff's evidence may be made in a case tried to a jury as well
    as in a case tried without a jury. But, when made in a jury-tried
    case, this motion overlaps the motion for a directed verdict under
    Rule 50(a), which is also available in the same situation. It has
    been held that the standard to be applied in deciding the Rule
    41(b) motion at the close of the plaintiff's evidence in a jury-
    tried case is the same as that used upon a motion for a directed
    verdict made at the same stage; and, just as the court need not
    make findings pursuant to Rule 52(a) when it directs a verdict, so
    in a jury-tried case it may omit these findings in granting the
    Rule 41(b) motion. See generally O'Brien v. Westinghouse Electric
    Corp., 293 F.2d 1, 5-10 (3d Cir. 1961).
      As indicated by the discussion in the O'Brien case, the overlap
    has caused confusion. Accordingly, the second and third sentences
    of Rule 41(b) are amended to provide that the motion for dismissal
    at the close of the plaintiff's evidence shall apply only to
    nonjury cases (including cases tried with an advisory jury).
    Hereafter the correct motion in jury-tried cases will be the motion
    for a directed verdict. This involves no change of substance. It
    should be noted that the court upon a motion for a directed verdict
    may in appropriate circumstances deny that motion and grant instead
    a new trial, or a voluntary dismissal without prejudice under Rule
    41(a)(2). See 6 Moore's Federal Practice Sec. 59.08[5] (2d ed.
    1954); cf. Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co., 330 U.S. 212,
    217, 67 S.Ct. 752, 91 L.Ed. 849 (1947).
      The first sentence of Rule 41(b), providing for dismissal for
    failure to prosecute or to comply with the Rules or any order of
    court, and the general provisions of the last sentence remain
    applicable in jury as well as nonjury cases.
      The amendment of the last sentence of Rule 41(b) indicates that a
    dismissal for lack of an indispensable party does not operate as an
    adjudication on the merits. Such a dismissal does not bar a new
    action, for it is based merely "on a plaintiff's failure to comply
    with a precondition requisite to the Court's going forward to
    determine the merits of his substantive claim." See Costello v.
    United States, 365 U.S. 265, 284-288, 81 S.Ct. 534, 5 L.Ed.2d 551 &
    n. 5 (1961); Mallow v. Hinde, 12 Wheat. (25 U.S.) 193, 6 L.Ed. 599
    (1827); Clark, Code Pleading 602 (2d ed. 1947); Restatement of
    Judgments Sec. 49, comm. a, b (1942). This amendment corrects an
    omission from the rule and is consistent with an earlier amendment,
    effective in 1948, adding "the defense of failure to join an
    indispensable party" to clause (1) of Rule 12(h).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      The terminology is changed to accord with the amendment of Rule
    19. See that amended rule and the Advisory Committee's Note
    thereto.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1968 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment corrects an inadvertent error in the reference to
    amended Rule 23.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Language is deleted that authorized the use of this rule as a
    means of terminating a non-jury action on the merits when the
    plaintiff has failed to carry a burden of proof in presenting the
    plaintiff's case. The device is replaced by the new provisions of
    Rule 52(c), which authorize entry of judgment against the defendant
    as well as the plaintiff, and earlier than the close of the case of
    the party against whom judgment is rendered. A motion to dismiss
    under Rule 41 on the ground that a plaintiff's evidence is legally
    insufficient should now be treated as a motion for judgment on
    partial findings as provided in Rule 52(c).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 41 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      When Rule 23 was amended in 1966, Rules 23.1 and 23.2 were
    separated from Rule 23. Rule 41(a)(1) was not then amended to
    reflect the Rule 23 changes. In 1968 Rule 41(a)(1) was amended to
    correct the cross-reference to what had become Rule 23(e), but
    Rules 23.1 and 23.2 were inadvertently overlooked. Rules 23.1 and
    23.2 are now added to the list of exceptions in Rule 41(a)(1)(A).
    This change does not affect established meaning. Rule 23.2
    explicitly incorporates Rule 23(e), and thus was already absorbed
    directly into the exceptions in Rule 41(a)(1). Rule 23.1 requires
    court approval of a compromise or dismissal in language parallel to
    Rule 23(e) and thus supersedes the apparent right to dismiss by
    notice of dismissal.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Consolidation. If actions before the court involve a common
    question of law or fact, the court may:
        (1) join for hearing or trial any or all matters at issue in
      the actions;
        (2) consolidate the actions; or
        (3) issue any other orders to avoid unnecessary cost or delay.

      (b) Separate Trials. For convenience, to avoid prejudice, or to
    expedite and economize, the court may order a separate trial of one
    or more separate issues, claims, crossclaims, counterclaims, or
    third-party claims. When ordering a separate trial, the court must
    preserve any federal right to a jury trial.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      In certain suits in admiralty separation for trial of the issues
    of liability and damages (or of the extent of liability other than
    damages, such as salvage and general average) has been conducive to
    expedition and economy, especially because of the statutory right
    to interlocutory appeal in admiralty cases (which is of course
    preserved by these Rules). While separation of issues for trial is
    not to be routinely ordered, it is important that it be encouraged
    where experience has demonstrated its worth. Cf. Weinstein, Routine
    Bifurcation of Negligence Trials, 14 Vand.L.Rev. 831 (1961).
      In cases (including some cases within the admiralty and maritime
    jurisdiction) in which the parties have a constitutional or
    statutory right of trial by jury, separation of issues may give
    rise to problems. See e.g., United Air Lines, Inc. v. Wiener, 286
    F.2d 302 (9th Cir. 1961). Accordingly, the proposed change in Rule
    42 reiterates the mandate of Rule 38 respecting preservation of the
    right to jury trial.

    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood

-HEAD-
    Rule 43. Taking Testimony

-STATUTE-
      (a) In Open Court. At trial, the witnesses' testimony must be
    taken in open court unless a federal statute, the Federal Rules of
    Evidence, these rules, or other rules adopted by the Supreme Court
    provide otherwise. For good cause in compelling circumstances and
    with appropriate safeguards, the court may permit testimony in open
    court by contemporaneous transmission from a different location.
      (b) Affirmation Instead of an Oath. When these rules require an
    oath, a solemn affirmation suffices.
      (c) Evidence on a Motion. When a motion relies on facts outside
    the record, the court may hear the matter on affidavits or may hear
    it wholly or partly on oral testimony or on depositions.
      (d) Interpreter. The court may appoint an interpreter of its
    choosing; fix reasonable compensation to be paid from funds
    provided by law or by one or more parties; and tax the compensation
    as costs.

      Note to Subdivision (a). The first sentence is a restatement of
    the substance of U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Sec. 635 (Proof in
    common-law actions), Sec. 637 [see 2072, 2073] (Proof in equity and
    admiralty), and [former] Equity Rule 46 (Trial - Testimony Usually
    Taken in Open Court - Rulings on Objections to Evidence). This rule
    abolishes in patent and trade-mark actions, the practice under
    [former] Equity Rule 48 of setting forth in affidavits the
    testimony in chief of expert witnesses whose testimony is directed
    to matters of opinion. The second and third sentences on
    admissibility of evidence and Subdivision (b) on contradiction and
    cross-examination modify U.S.C., Title 28, Sec. 725 [now 1652]
    (Laws of states as rules of decision) insofar as that statute has
    been construed to prescribe conformity to state rules of evidence.
    Compare Callihan and Ferguson, Evidence and the New Federal Rules
    of Civil Procedure, 45 Yale L.J. 622 (1936), and Same: 2, 47 Yale
    L.J. 195 (1937). The last sentence modifies to the extent indicated
    U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Sec. 631 (Competency of witnesses
    governed by State laws).

      NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE
                         REGARDING RULES 43 AND 44
      These rules have been criticized and suggested improvements
    offered by commentators. 1 Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed. 1940) 200-
    204; Green, The Admissibility of Evidence Under the Federal Rules
    (1941) 55 Harv.L.Rev. 197. Cases indicate, however, that the rule
    is working better than these commentators had expected. Boerner v.

    Case 1; Note (1946) 46 Col.L.Rev. 267. While consideration of a
    comprehensive and detailed set of rules of evidence seems very
    desirable, it has not been feasible for the Committee so far to
    undertake this important task. Such consideration should include
    the adaptability to federal practice of all or parts of the
    proposed Code of Evidence of the American Law Institute. See
    Armstrong, Proposed Amendments to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
    4 F.R.D. 124, 137-138.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      This new subdivision authorizes the court to appoint interpreters
    (including interpreters for the deaf), to provide for their
    compensation, and to tax the compensation as costs. Compare
    proposed subdivision (b) of Rule 28 of the Federal Rules of
    Criminal Procedure.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1972 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 43, entitled Evidence, has heretofore served as the basic
    rule of evidence for civil cases in federal courts. Its very
    general provisions are superseded by the detailed provisions of the
    new Rules of Evidence. The original title and many of the
    provisions of the rule are, therefore, no longer appropriate.
      Subdivision (a). The provision for taking testimony in open court
    is not duplicated in the Rules of Evidence and is retained. Those
    dealing with admissibility of evidence and competency of witnesses,
    however, are no longer needed or appropriate since those topics are
    covered at large in the Rules of Evidence. They are accordingly
    deleted. The language is broadened, however, to take account of
    acts of Congress dealing with the taking of testimony, as well as
    of the Rules of Evidence and any other rules adopted by the Supreme
    Court.
      Subdivision (b). The subdivision is no longer needed or
    appropriate since the matters with which it deals are treated in
    the Rules of Evidence. The use of leading questions, both generally
    and in the interrogation of an adverse party or witness identified
    with him, is the subject of Evidence Rule 611(c). Who may impeach
    is treated in Evidence Rule 601 and scope of cross-examination is
    covered in Evidence Rule 611(b). The subdivision is accordingly
    deleted.
      Subdivision (c). Offers of proof and making a record of excluded
    evidence are treated in Evidence Rule 103. The subdivision is no
    longer needed or appropriate and is deleted.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1996 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 43(a) is revised to conform to the style conventions adopted
    for simplifying the present Civil Rules. The only intended changes
    of meaning are described below.
      The requirement that testimony be taken "orally" is deleted. The
    deletion makes it clear that testimony of a witness may be given in
    open court by other means if the witness is not able to communicate
    orally. Writing or sign language are common examples. The
    development of advanced technology may enable testimony to be given
    by other means. A witness unable to sign or write by hand may be
    able to communicate through a computer or similar device.
      Contemporaneous transmission of testimony from a different
    location is permitted only on showing good cause in compelling
    circumstances. The importance of presenting live testimony in court
    cannot be forgotten. The very ceremony of trial and the presence of
    the factfinder may exert a powerful force for truthtelling. The
    opportunity to judge the demeanor of a witness face-to-face is
    accorded great value in our tradition. Transmission cannot be
    justified merely by showing that it is inconvenient for the witness
    to attend the trial.
      The most persuasive showings of good cause and compelling
    circumstances are likely to arise when a witness is unable to
    attend trial for unexpected reasons, such as accident or illness,
    but remains able to testify from a different place. Contemporaneous
    transmission may be better than an attempt to reschedule the trial,
    particularly if there is a risk that other - and perhaps more
    important - witnesses might not be available at a later time.
      Other possible justifications for remote transmission must be
    approached cautiously. Ordinarily depositions, including video
    depositions, provide a superior means of securing the testimony of
    a witness who is beyond the reach of a trial subpoena, or of
    resolving difficulties in scheduling a trial that can be attended
    by all witnesses. Deposition procedures ensure the opportunity of
    all parties to be represented while the witness is testifying. An
    unforeseen need for the testimony of a remote witness that arises
    during trial, however, may establish good cause and compelling
    circumstances. Justification is particularly likely if the need
    arises from the interjection of new issues during trial or from the
    unexpected inability to present testimony as planned from a
    different witness.
      Good cause and compelling circumstances may be established with
    relative ease if all parties agree that testimony should be
    presented by transmission. The court is not bound by a stipulation,
    however, and can insist on live testimony. Rejection of the
    parties' agreement will be influenced, among other factors, by the
    apparent importance of the testimony in the full context of the
    trial.
      A party who could reasonably foresee the circumstances offered to
    justify transmission of testimony will have special difficulty in
    showing good cause and the compelling nature of the circumstances.
    Notice of a desire to transmit testimony from a different location
    should be given as soon as the reasons are known, to enable other
    parties to arrange a deposition, or to secure an advance ruling on
    transmission so as to know whether to prepare to be present with
    the witness while testifying.
      No attempt is made to specify the means of transmission that may
    be used. Audio transmission without video images may be sufficient
    in some circumstances, particularly as to less important testimony.
    Video transmission ordinarily should be preferred when the cost is
    reasonable in relation to the matters in dispute, the means of the
    parties, and the circumstances that justify transmission.
    Transmission that merely produces the equivalent of a written
    statement ordinarily should not be used.
      Safeguards must be adopted that ensure accurate identification of
    the witness and that protect against influence by persons present
    with the witness. Accurate transmission likewise must be assured.
      Other safeguards should be employed to ensure that advance notice
    is given to all parties of foreseeable circumstances that may lead
    the proponent to offer testimony by transmission. Advance notice is
    important to protect the opportunity to argue for attendance of the
    witness at trial. Advance notice also ensures an opportunity to
    depose the witness, perhaps by video record, as a means of
    supplementing transmitted testimony.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 43 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE VI. TRIALS

-HEAD-
    Rule 44. Proving an Official Record

-STATUTE-
      (a) Means of Proving.
        (1) Domestic Record. Each of the following evidences an
      official record - or an entry in it - that is otherwise
      admissible and is kept within the United States, any state,
      district, or commonwealth, or any territory subject to the
      administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the United States:
          (A) an official publication of the record; or
          (B) a copy attested by the officer with legal custody of the
        record - or by the officer's deputy - and accompanied by a
        certificate that the officer has custody. The certificate must
        be made under seal:
            (i) by a judge of a court of record in the district or
          political subdivision where the record is kept; or
            (ii) by any public officer with a seal of office and with
          official duties in the district or political subdivision
          where the record is kept.

        (2) Foreign Record.
          (A) In General. Each of the following evidences a foreign
        official record - or an entry in it - that is otherwise
        admissible:
            (i) an official publication of the record; or
            (ii) the record - or a copy - that is attested by an
          authorized person and is accompanied either by a final
          certification of genuineness or by a certification under a
          treaty or convention to which the United States and the
          country where the record is located are parties.

          (B) Final Certification of Genuineness. A final certification
        must certify the genuineness of the signature and official
        position of the attester or of any foreign official whose
        certificate of genuineness relates to the attestation or is in
        a chain of certificates of genuineness relating to the
        attestation. A final certification may be made by a secretary
        of a United States embassy or legation; by a consul general,
        vice consul, or consular agent of the United States; or by a
        diplomatic or consular official of the foreign country assigned
        or accredited to the United States.
          (C) Other Means of Proof. If all parties have had a
        reasonable opportunity to investigate a foreign record's
        authenticity and accuracy, the court may, for good cause,
        either:
            (i) admit an attested copy without final certification; or
            (ii) permit the record to be evidenced by an attested
          summary with or without a final certification.

      (b) Lack of a Record. A written statement that a diligent search
    of designated records revealed no record or entry of a specified
    tenor is admissible as evidence that the records contain no such
    record or entry. For domestic records, the statement must be
    authenticated under Rule 44(a)(1). For foreign records, the
    statement must comply with (a)(2)(C)(ii).
      (c) Other Proof. A party may prove an official record - or an
    entry or lack of an entry in it - by any other method authorized by
    law.

      NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE
                         REGARDING RULES 43 AND 44
      For supplementary note of Advisory Committee on this rule, see
    note under rule 43.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a)(1). These provisions on proof of official records
    kept within the United States are similar in substance to those
    heretofore appearing in Rule 44. There is a more exact description
    of the geographical areas covered. An official record kept in one
    of the areas enumerated qualifies for proof under subdivision
    (a)(1) even though it is not a United States official record. For
    example, an official record kept in one of these areas by a
    government in exile falls within subdivision (a)(1). It also falls
    within subdivision (a)(2) which may be availed of alternatively.
    Cf. Banco de Espana v. Federal Reserve Bank, 114 F.2d 438 (2d Cir.
    1940).
      Subdivision (a)(2). Foreign official records may be proved, as
    heretofore, by means of official publications thereof. See United
    States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 1 F.R.D. 71 (S.D.N.Y. 1939).
    Under this rule, a document that, on its face, appears to be an
    official publication, is admissible, unless a party opposing its
    admission into evidence shows that it lacks that character.
      The rest of subdivision (a)(2) aims to provide greater clarity,
    efficiency, and flexibility in the procedure for authenticating
    copies of foreign official records.
      The reference to attestation by "the officer having the legal
    custody of the record," hitherto appearing in Rule 44, has been
    found inappropriate for official records kept in foreign countries
    where the assumed relation between custody and the authority to
    attest does not obtain. See 2B Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice
    & Procedure Sec. 992 (Wright ed. 1961). Accordingly it is provided
    that an attested copy may be obtained from any person authorized by
    the law of the foreign country to make the attestation without
    regard to whether he is charged with responsibility for maintaining
    the record or keeping it in his custody.
      Under Rule 44 a United States foreign service officer has been
    called on to certify to the authority of the foreign official
    attesting the copy as well as the genuineness of his signature and
    his official position. See Schlesinger, Comparative Law 57 (2d ed.
    1959); Smit, International Aspects of Federal Civil Procedure, 61
    Colum.L.Rev. 1031, 1063 (1961); 22 C.F.R. Sec. 92.41(a), (e)
    (1958). This has created practical difficulties. For example, the
    question of the authority of the foreign officer might raise issues
    of foreign law which were beyond the knowledge of the United States
    officer. The difficulties are met under the amended rule by
    eliminating the element of the authority of the attesting foreign
    official from the scope of the certifying process, and by
    specifically permitting use of the chain-certificate method. Under
    this method, it is sufficient if the original attestation purports
    to have been issued by an authorized person and is accompanied by a
    certificate of another foreign official whose certificate may in
    turn be followed by that of a foreign official of higher rank. The
    process continues until a foreign official is reached as to whom
    the United States foreign service official (or a diplomatic or
    consular officer of the foreign country assigned or accredited to
    the United States) has adequate information upon which to base a
    "final certification." See New York Life Ins. Co. v. Aronson, 38
    F.Supp. 687 (W.D.Pa. 1941); 22 C.F.R. Sec. 92.37 (1958).
      The final certification (a term used in contradistinction to the
    certificates prepared by the foreign officials in a chain) relates
    to the incumbency and genuineness of signature of the foreign
    official who attested the copy of the record or, where the chain-
    certificate method is used, of a foreign official whose
    certificate appears in the chain, whether that certificate is the
    last in the chain or not. A final certification may be prepared on
    the basis of material on file in the consulate or any other
    satisfactory information.
      Although the amended rule will generally facilitate proof of
    foreign official records, it is recognized that in some situations
    it may be difficult or even impossible to satisfy the basic
    requirements of the rule. There may be no United States consul in a
    particular foreign country; the foreign officials may not
    cooperate, peculiarities may exist or arise hereafter in the law or
    practice of a foreign country. See United States v. Grabina, 119
    F.2d 863 (2d Cir. 1941); and, generally, Jones, International
    Judicial Assistance: Procedural Chaos and a Program for Reform, 62
    Yale L.J. 515, 548-49 (1953). Therefore the final sentence of
    subdivision (a)(2) provides the court with discretion to admit an
    attested copy of a record without a final certification, or an
    attested summary of a record with or without a final certification.
    See Rep. of Comm. on Comparative Civ. Proc. & Prac., Proc. A.B.A.,
    Sec. Int'l & Comp. L. 123, 130-131 (1952); Model Code of Evidence
    Secs. 517, 519 (1942). This relaxation should be permitted only
    when it is shown that the party has been unable to satisfy the
    basic requirements of the amended rule despite his reasonable
    efforts. Moreover, it is specially provided that the parties must
    be given a reasonable opportunity in these cases to examine into
    the authenticity and accuracy of the copy or summary.
      Subdivision (b). This provision relating to proof of lack of
    record is accommodated to the changes made in subdivision (a).
      Subdivision (c). The amendment insures that international
    agreements of the United States are unaffected by the rule. Several
    consular conventions contain provisions for reception of copies or
    summaries of foreign official records. See, e.g., Consular Conv.
    with Italy, May 8, 1878, art. X, 20 Stat. 725, T.S. No. 178 (Dept.
    State 1878). See also 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1740-42, 1745; Fakouri v.
    Cadais, 149 F.2d 321 (5th Cir. 1945), cert. denied, 326 U.S. 742
    (1945); 5 Moore's Federal Practice, par. 44.05 (2d ed. 1951).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment to paragraph (a)(1) strikes the references to
    specific territories, two of which are no longer subject to the
    jurisdiction of the United States, and adds a generic term to
    describe governments having a relationship with the United States
    such that their official records should be treated as domestic
    records.
      The amendment to paragraph (a)(2) adds a sentence to dispense
    with the final certification by diplomatic officers when the United
    States and the foreign country where the record is located are
    parties to a treaty or convention that abolishes or displaces the
    requirement. In that event the treaty or convention is to be
    followed. This changes the former procedure for authenticating
    foreign official records only with respect to records from
    countries that are parties to the Hague Convention Abolishing the
    Requirement of Legalization for Foreign Public Documents. Moreover,
    it does not affect the former practice of attesting the records,
    but only changes the method of certifying the attestation.
      The Hague Public Documents Convention provides that the
    requirement of a final certification is abolished and replaced with
    a model apostille, which is to be issued by officials of the
    country where the records are located. See Hague Public Documents
    Convention, Arts. 2-4. The apostille certifies the signature,
    official position, and seal of the attesting officer. The authority
    who issues the apostille must maintain a register or card index
    showing the serial number of the apostille and other relevant
    information recorded on it. A foreign court can then check the
    serial number and information on the apostille with the issuing
    authority in order to guard against the use of fraudulent
    apostilles. This system provides a reliable method for maintaining
    the integrity of the authentication process, and the apostille can
    be accorded greater weight than the normal authentication procedure
    because foreign officials are more likely to know the precise
    capacity under their law of the attesting officer than would an
    American official. See generally Comment, The United States and the
    Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalization for
    Foreign Public Documents, 11 HARV. INT'L L.J. 476, 482, 488 (1970).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 44 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

-STATUTE-
      A party who intends to raise an issue about a foreign country's
    law must give notice by a pleading or other writing. In determining
    foreign law, the court may consider any relevant material or
    source, including testimony, whether or not submitted by a party or
    admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The court's
    determination must be treated as a ruling on a question of law.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966            
      Rule 44.1 is added by amendment to furnish Federal courts with a
    uniform and effective procedure for raising and determining an
    issue concerning the law of a foreign country.
      To avoid unfair surprise, the first sentence of the new rule
    requires that a party who intends to raise an issue of foreign law
    shall give notice thereof. The uncertainty under Rule 8(a) about
    whether foreign law must be pleaded - compare Siegelman v. Cunard
    White Star, Ltd., 221 F.2d 189 (2d Cir. 1955), and Pedersen v.
    United States, 191 F.Supp. 95 (D.Guam 1961), with Harrison v.
    United Fruit Co., 143 F.Supp. 598 (S.D.N.Y. 1956) - is eliminated
    by the provision that the notice shall be "written" and
    "reasonable." It may, but need not be, incorporated in the
    pleadings. In some situations the pertinence of foreign law is
    apparent from the outset; accordingly the necessary investigation
    of that law will have been accomplished by the party at the
    pleading stage, and the notice can be given conveniently in the
    pleadings. In other situations the pertinence of foreign law may
    remain doubtful until the case is further developed. A requirement
    that notice of foreign law be given only through the medium of the
    pleadings would tend in the latter instances to force the party to
    engage in a peculiarly burdensome type of investigation which might
    turn out to be unnecessary; and correspondingly the adversary would
    be forced into a possible wasteful investigation. The liberal
    provisions for amendment of the pleadings afford help if the
    pleadings are used as the medium of giving notice of the foreign
    law; but it seems best to permit a written notice to be given
    outside of and later than the pleadings, provided the notice is
    reasonable.
      The new rule does not attempt to set any definite limit on the
    party's time for giving the notice of an issue of foreign law; in
    some cases the issue may not become apparent until the trial and
    notice then given may still be reasonable. The stage which the case
    has reached at the time of the notice, the reason proffered by the
    party for his failure to give earlier notice, and the importance to
    the case as a whole of the issue of foreign law sought to be
    raised, are among the factors which the court should consider in
    deciding a question of the reasonableness of a notice. If notice is
    given by one party it need not be repeated by any other and serves
    as a basis for presentation of material on the foreign law by all
    parties.
      The second sentence of the new rule describes the materials to
    which the court may resort in determining an issue of foreign law.
    Heretofore the district courts, applying Rule 43(a), have looked in
    certain cases to State law to find the rules of evidence by which
    the content of foreign-country law is to be established. The State
    laws vary; some embody procedures which are inefficient, time
    consuming and expensive. See, generally, Nussbaum, Proving the Law
    of Foreign Countries, 3 Am.J.Comp.L. 60 (1954). In all events the
    ordinary rules of evidence are often inapposite to the problem of
    determining foreign law and have in the past prevented examination
    of material which could have provided a proper basis for the
    determination. The new rule permits consideration by the court of
    any relevant material, including testimony, without regard to its
    admissibility under Rule 43. Cf. N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law & Rules, R. 4511
    (effective Sept. 1, 1963); 2 Va.Code Ann. tit. 8, Sec. 8-273; 2
    W.Va.Code Ann. Sec. 5711.
      In further recognition of the peculiar nature of the issue of
    foreign law, the new rule provides that in determining this law the
    court is not limited by material presented by the parties; it may
    engage in its own research and consider any relevant material thus
    found. The court may have at its disposal better foreign law
    materials than counsel have presented, or may wish to reexamine and
    amplify material that has been presented by counsel in partisan
    fashion or in insufficient detail. On the other hand, the court is
    free to insist on a complete presentation by counsel.
      There is no requirement that the court give formal notice to the
    parties of its intention to engage in its own research on an issue
    of foreign law which has been raised by them, or of its intention
    to raise and determine independently an issue not raised by them.
    Ordinarily the court should inform the parties of material it has
    found diverging substantially from the material which they have
    presented; and in general the court should give the parties an
    opportunity to analyze and counter new points upon which it
    proposes to rely. See Schlesinger, Comparative Law 142 (2d ed.
    1959); Wyzanski, A Trial Judge's Freedom and Responsibility, 65
    Harv.L.Rev. 1281, 1296 (1952); cf. Siegelman v. Cunard White Star,
    Ltd., supra, 221 F.2d at 197. To require, however, that the court
    give formal notice from time to time as it proceeds with its study
    of the foreign law would add an element of undesirable rigidity to
    the procedure for determining issues of foreign law.
      The new rule refrains from imposing an obligation on the court to
    take "judicial notice" of foreign law because this would put an
    extreme burden on the court in many cases; and it avoids use of the
    concept of "judicial notice" in any form because of the uncertain
    meaning of that concept as applied to foreign law. See, e.g.,
    Stern, Foreign Law in the Courts: Judicial Notice and Proof, 45
    Calif.L.Rev. 23, 43 (1957). Rather the rule provides flexible
    procedures for presenting and utilizing material on issues of
    foreign law by which a sound result can be achieved with fairness
    to the parties.
      Under the third sentence, the court's determination of an issue
    of foreign law is to be treated as a ruling on a question of "law,"
    not "fact," so that appellate review will not be narrowly confined
    by the "clearly erroneous" standard of Rule 52(a). Cf. Uniform
    Judicial Notice of Foreign Law Act Sec. 3; Note, 72 Harv.L.Rev. 318
    (1958).
      The new rule parallels Article IV of the Uniform Interstate and
    International Procedure Act, approved by the Commissioners on
    Uniform State Laws in 1962, except that section 4.03 of Article IV
    states that "[t]he court, not the jury" shall determine foreign
    law. The new rule does not address itself to this problem, since
    the Rules refrain from allocating functions as between the court
    and the jury. See Rule 38(a). It has long been thought, however,
    that the jury is not the appropriate body to determine issues of
    foreign law. See, e.g., Story, Conflict of Laws, Sec. 638 (1st ed.
    1834, 8th ed. 1883); 1 Greenleaf, Evidence, Sec. 486 (1st ed. 1842,
    16th ed. 1899); 4 Wigmore, Evidence Sec. 2558 (1st ed. 1905); 9 id.
    Sec. 2558 (3d ed. 1940). The majority of the States have committed
    such issues to determination by the court. See Article 5 of the
    Uniform Judicial Notice of Foreign Law Act, adopted by twenty-six
    states, 9A U.L.A. 318 (1957) (Suppl. 1961, at 134);
    N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law & Rules, R. 4511 (effective Sept. 1, 1963);
    Wigmore, loc. cit. And Federal courts that have considered the
    problem in recent years have reached the same conclusion without

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1972 AMENDMENT       
      Since the purpose of the provision is to free the judge, in
    determining foreign law, from any restrictions imposed by evidence
    rules, a general reference to the Rules of Evidence is appropriate
    and is made.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 44.1 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE VI. TRIALS

-HEAD-
    Rule 45. Subpoena

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General.
        (1) Form and Contents.
          (A) Requirements - In General. Every subpoena must:
            (i) state the court from which it issued;
            (ii) state the title of the action, the court in which it
          is pending, and its civil-action number;
            (iii) command each person to whom it is directed to do the
          following at a specified time and place: attend and testify;
          produce designated documents, electronically stored
          information, or tangible things in that person's possession,
          custody, or control; or permit the inspection of premises;
          and
            (iv) set out the text of Rule 45(c) and (d).

          (B) Command to Attend a Deposition - Notice of the Recording
        Method. A subpoena commanding attendance at a deposition must
        state the method for recording the testimony.
          (C) Combining or Separating a Command to Produce or to Permit
        Inspection; Specifying the Form for Electronically Stored
        Information. A command to produce documents, electronically
        stored information, or tangible things or to permit the
        inspection of premises may be included in a subpoena commanding
        attendance at a deposition, hearing, or trial, or may be set
        out in a separate subpoena. A subpoena may specify the form or
        forms in which electronically stored information is to be
        produced.
          (D) Command to Produce; Included Obligations. A command in a
        subpoena to produce documents, electronically stored
        information, or tangible things requires the responding party
        to permit inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of the
        materials.

        (2) Issued from Which Court. A subpoena must issue as follows:
          (A) for attendance at a hearing or trial, from the court for
        the district where the hearing or trial is to be held;
          (B) for attendance at a deposition, from the court for the
        district where the deposition is to be taken; and
          (C) for production or inspection, if separate from a subpoena
        commanding a person's attendance, from the court for the
        district where the production or inspection is to be made.

        (3) Issued by Whom. The clerk must issue a subpoena, signed but
      otherwise in blank, to a party who requests it. That party must
      complete it before service. An attorney also may issue and sign a
      subpoena as an officer of:
          (A) a court in which the attorney is authorized to practice;
        or
          (B) a court for a district where a deposition is to be taken
        or production is to be made, if the attorney is authorized to
        practice in the court where the action is pending.

      (b) Service.
        (1) By Whom; Tendering Fees; Serving a Copy of Certain
      Subpoenas. Any person who is at least 18 years old and not a
      party may serve a subpoena. Serving a subpoena requires
      delivering a copy to the named person and, if the subpoena
      requires that person's attendance, tendering the fees for 1 day's
      attendance and the mileage allowed by law. Fees and mileage need
      not be tendered when the subpoena issues on behalf of the United
      States or any of its officers or agencies. If the subpoena
      commands the production of documents, electronically stored
      information, or tangible things or the inspection of premises
      before trial, then before it is served, a notice must be served
      on each party.
        (2) Service in the United States. Subject to Rule
      45(c)(3)(A)(ii), a subpoena may be served at any place:
          (A) within the district of the issuing court;
          (B) outside that district but within 100 miles of the place
        specified for the deposition, hearing, trial, production, or
        inspection;
          (C) within the state of the issuing court if a state statute
        or court rule allows service at that place of a subpoena issued
        by a state court of general jurisdiction sitting in the place
        specified for the deposition, hearing, trial, production, or
        inspection; or
          (D) that the court authorizes on motion and for good cause,
        if a federal statute so provides.

        (3) Service in a Foreign Country. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1783 governs
      issuing and serving a subpoena directed to a United States
      national or resident who is in a foreign country.
        (4) Proof of Service. Proving service, when necessary, requires
      filing with the issuing court a statement showing the date and
      manner of service and the names of the persons served. The
      statement must be certified by the server.

      (c) Protecting a Person Subject to a Subpoena.
        (1) Avoiding Undue Burden or Expense; Sanctions. A party or
      attorney responsible for issuing and serving a subpoena must take
      reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a
      person subject to the subpoena. The issuing court must enforce
      this duty and impose an appropriate sanction - which may include
      lost earnings and reasonable attorney's fees - on a party or
      attorney who fails to comply.
        (2) Command to Produce Materials or Permit Inspection.
          (A) Appearance Not Required. A person commanded to produce
        documents, electronically stored information, or tangible
        things, or to permit the inspection of premises, need not
        appear in person at the place of production or inspection
        unless also commanded to appear for a deposition, hearing, or
        trial.
          (B) Objections. A person commanded to produce documents or
        tangible things or to permit inspection may serve on the party
        or attorney designated in the subpoena a written objection to
        inspecting, copying, testing or sampling any or all of the
        materials or to inspecting the premises - or to producing
        electronically stored information in the form or forms
        requested. The objection must be served before the earlier of
        the time specified for compliance or 14 days after the subpoena
        is served. If an objection is made, the following rules apply:
            (i) At any time, on notice to the commanded person, the
          serving party may move the issuing court for an order
          compelling production or inspection.
            (ii) These acts may be required only as directed in the
          order, and the order must protect a person who is neither a
          party nor a party's officer from significant expense
          resulting from compliance.

        (3) Quashing or Modifying a Subpoena.
          (A) When Required. On timely motion, the issuing court must
        quash or modify a subpoena that:
            (i) fails to allow a reasonable time to comply;
            (ii) requires a person who is neither a party nor a party's
          officer to travel more than 100 miles from where that person
          resides, is employed, or regularly transacts business in
          person - except that, subject to Rule 45(c)(3)(B)(iii), the
          person may be commanded to attend a trial by traveling from
          any such place within the state where the trial is held;
            (iii) requires disclosure of privileged or other protected
          matter, if no exception or waiver applies; or
            (iv) subjects a person to undue burden.

          (B) When Permitted. To protect a person subject to or
        affected by a subpoena, the issuing court may, on motion, quash
        or modify the subpoena if it requires:
            (i) disclosing a trade secret or other confidential
          research, development, or commercial information;
            (ii) disclosing an unretained expert's opinion or
          information that does not describe specific occurrences in
          dispute and results from the expert's study that was not
          requested by a party; or
            (iii) a person who is neither a party nor a party's officer
          to incur substantial expense to travel more than 100 miles to
          attend trial.

          (C) Specifying Conditions as an Alternative. In the
        circumstances described in Rule 45(c)(3)(B), the court may,
        instead of quashing or modifying a subpoena, order appearance
        or production under specified conditions if the serving party:
            (i) shows a substantial need for the testimony or material
          that cannot be otherwise met without undue hardship; and
            (ii) ensures that the subpoenaed person will be reasonably
          compensated.

      (d) Duties in Responding to a Subpoena.
        (1) Producing Documents or Electronically Stored Information.
      These procedures apply to producing documents or electronically
      stored information:
          (A) Documents. A person responding to a subpoena to produce
        documents must produce them as they are kept in the ordinary
        course of business or must organize and label them to
        correspond to the categories in the demand.
          (B) Form for Producing Electronically Stored Information Not
        Specified. If a subpoena does not specify a form for producing
        electronically stored information, the person responding must
        produce it in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily
        maintained or in a reasonably usable form or forms.
          (C) Electronically Stored Information Produced in Only One
        Form. The person responding need not produce the same
        electronically stored information in more than one form.
          (D) Inaccessible Electronically Stored Information. The
        person responding need not provide discovery of electronically
        stored information from sources that the person identifies as
        not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. On
        motion to compel discovery or for a protective order, the
        person responding must show that the information is not
        reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that
        showing is made, the court may nonetheless order discovery from
        such sources if the requesting party shows good cause,
        considering the limitations of Rule 26(b)(2)(C). The court may
        specify conditions for the discovery.

        (2) Claiming Privilege or Protection.
          (A) Information Withheld. A person withholding subpoenaed
        information under a claim that it is privileged or subject to
        protection as trial-preparation material must:
            (i) expressly make the claim; and
            (ii) describe the nature of the withheld documents,
          communications, or tangible things in a manner that, without
          revealing information itself privileged or protected, will
          enable the parties to assess the claim.

          (B) Information Produced. If information produced in response
        to a subpoena is subject to a claim of privilege or of
        protection as trial-preparation material, the person making the
        claim may notify any party that received the information of the
        claim and the basis for it. After being notified, a party must
        promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified
        information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the
        information until the claim is resolved; must take reasonable
        steps to retrieve the information if the party disclosed it
        before being notified; and may promptly present the information
        to the court under seal for a determination of the claim. The
        person who produced the information must preserve the
        information until the claim is resolved.

      (e) Contempt. The issuing court may hold in contempt a person
    who, having been served, fails without adequate excuse to obey the
    subpoena. A nonparty's failure to obey must be excused if the
    subpoena purports to require the nonparty to attend or produce at a
    place outside the limits of Rule 45(c)(3)(A)(ii).

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      This rule applies to subpoenas ad testificandum and duces tecum
    issued by the district courts for attendance at a hearing or a
    trial, or to take depositions. It does not apply to the enforcement
    of subpoenas issued by administrative officers and commissions
    pursuant to statutory authority. The enforcement of such subpoenas
    by the district courts is regulated by appropriate statutes. Many
    of these statutes do not place any territorial limits on the
    validity of subpoenas so issued, but provide that they may be
    served anywhere within the United States. Among such statutes are
    the following:

     U.S.C., Title 7, Secs. 222 and 511n (Secretary of Agriculture)
     U.S.C., Title 15, Sec. 49 (Federal Trade Commission)
     U.S.C., Title 15, Secs. 77v(b), 78u(c), 79r(d) (Securities and
          Exchange Commission)
     U.S.C., Title 16, Secs. 797(g) and 825f (Federal Power Commission)
     U.S.C., Title 19, Sec. 1333(b) (Tariff Commission)
     U.S.C., Title 22, Secs. 268, 270d and 270e (International
          Commissions, etc.)
     U.S.C., Title 26, Secs. 614, 619(b) [see 7456] (Board of Tax
          Appeals)
     U.S.C., Title 26, Sec. 1523(a) [see 7608] (Internal Revenue
          Officers)
     U.S.C., Title 29, Sec. 161 (Labor Relations Board)
     U.S.C., Title 33, Sec. 506 (Secretary of Army)
     U.S.C., Title 35, Secs. 54-56 [now 24] (Patent Office proceedings)
     U.S.C., Title 38, [former] Sec. 133 (Veterans' Administration)
     U.S.C., Title 41, Sec. 39 (Secretary of Labor)
     U.S.C., Title 45, Sec. 157 Third. (h) (Board of Arbitration under
          Railway Labor Act)
     U.S.C., Title 45, Sec. 222(b) (Investigation Commission under
          Railroad Retirement Act of 1935)
     U.S.C., Title 46 [App.], Sec. 1124(b) (Maritime Commission)
     U.S.C., Title 47, Sec. 409(c) and (d) (Federal Communications
          Commission)
     U.S.C., Title 49, Sec. 12(2) and (3) [see 721(c) and 13301(c)]
          (Interstate Commerce Commission)
     U.S.C., Title 49, Sec. 173a [see 46104] (Secretary of Commerce)

      Note to Subdivisions (a) and (b). These simplify the form of
    subpoena as provided in U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Sec. 655
    (Witnesses; subpoena; form; attendance under); and broaden U.S.C.,
    Title 28, [former] Sec. 636 (Production of books and writings) to
    include all actions, and to extend to any person. With the
    provision for relief from an oppressive or unreasonable subpoena
    duces tecum, compare N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) Sec. 411.
      Note to Subdivision (c). This provides for the simple and
    convenient method of service permitted under many state codes;
    e.g., N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) Secs. 220, 404, J.Ct.Act, Sec. 191; 3
    Wash.Rev.Stat.Ann. (Remington, 1932) Sec. 1218. Compare Equity Rule
    15 (Process, by Whom Served).
      For statutes governing fees and mileage of witnesses see:

    U.S.C., Title 28:

     Sec. 600a [now 1871] (Per diem; mileage)
     Sec. 600c [now 1821, 1825] (Amount per diem and mileage for
          witnesses; subsistence)
     Sec. 600d [former] (Fees and mileage in certain states)
     Sec. 601 [former] (Witnesses; fees; enumeration)
     Sec. 602 [now 1824] (Fees and mileage of jurors and witnesses)
     Sec. 603 [see Title 5, Secs. 5515, 5537] (No officer of court to
          have witness fees)

      Note to Subdivision (d). The method provided in paragraph (1) for
    the authorization of the issuance of subpoenas has been employed in
    some districts. See Henning v. Boyle, 112 Fed. 397 (S.D.N.Y.,
    1901). The requirement of an order for the issuance of a subpoena
    duces tecum is in accordance with U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Sec.
    647 (Deposition under dedimus potestatem; subpoena duces tecum).
    The provisions of paragraph (2) are in accordance with common
    practice. See U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Sec. 648 (Deposition under
    dedimus potestatem; witnesses, when required to attend); N.Y.C.P.A.
    (1937) Sec. 300; 1 N.J.Rev.Stat. (1937) 2:27-174.
      Note to Subdivision (e). The first paragraph continues the
    substance of U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Sec. 654 (Witnesses;
    subpoenas; may run into another district). Compare U.S.C., Title
    11, [former] Sec. 69 (Referees in bankruptcy; contempts before)
    (production of books and writings) which is not affected by this
    rule. For examples of statutes which allow the court, upon proper
    application and cause shown, to authorize the clerk of the court to
    issue a subpoena for a witness who lives in another district and at
    a greater distance than 100 miles from the place of the hearing or
    trial, see:

    U.S.C., Title 15:

     Sec. 23 (Suits by United States; subpoenas for witnesses) (under
          antitrust laws).

    U.S.C., Title 38:

     Sec. 445 [now 1984] (Actions on claims; jurisdiction; parties;
          procedure; limitation; witnesses; definitions) (Veterans;
          insurance contracts).

      The second paragraph continues the present procedure applicable
    to certain witnesses who are in foreign countries. See U.S.C.,
    Title 28, Secs. 711 [now 1783] (Letters rogatory to take testimony
    of witness, addressed to court of foreign country; failure of
    witness to appear; subpoena) and 713 [now 1783] (Service of
    subpoena on witness in foreign country).
      Note to Subdivision (f). Compare [former] Equity Rule 52
    (Attendance of Witnesses Before Commissioner, Master, or Examiner).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b). The added words, "or tangible things" in
    subdivision (b) merely make the rule for the subpoena duces tecum
    at the trial conform to that of subdivision (d) for the subpoena at
    the taking of depositions.
      The insertion of the words "or modify" in clause (1) affords
    desirable flexibility.
      Subdivision (d). The added last sentence of amended subdivision
    (d)(1) properly gives the subpoena for documents or tangible things
    the same scope as provided in Rule 26(b), thus promoting
    uniformity. The requirement in the last sentence of original Rule
    45(d)(1) - to the effect that leave of court should be obtained for
    the issuance of such a subpoena - has been omitted. This
    requirement is unnecessary and oppressive on both counsel and
    court, and it has been criticized by district judges. There is no
    satisfactory reason for a differentiation between a subpoena for
    the production of documentary evidence by a witness at a trial
    (Rule 45(a)) and for the production of the same evidence at the
    taking of a deposition. Under this amendment, the person subpoenaed
    may obtain the protection afforded by any of the orders permitted
    under Rule 30(b) or Rule 45(b). See Application of Zenith Radio

      The changes in subdivision (d)(2) give the court the same power
    in the case of residents of the district as is conferred in the
    case of non-residents, and permit the court to fix a place for
    attendance which may be more convenient and accessible for the
    parties than that specified in the rule.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1948 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment substitutes the present statutory reference.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1970 AMENDMENT       
      At present, when a subpoena duces tecum is issued to a deponent,
    he is required to produce the listed materials at the deposition,
    but is under no clear compulsion to permit their inspection and
    copying. This results in confusion and uncertainty before the time
    the deposition is taken, with no mechanism provided whereby the
    court can resolve the matter. Rule 45(d)(1), as revised, makes
    clear that the subpoena authorizes inspection and copying of the
    materials produced. The deponent is afforded full protection since
    he can object, thereby forcing the party serving the subpoena to
    obtain a court order if he wishes to inspect and copy. The
    procedure is thus analogous to that provided in Rule 34.
      The changed references to other rules conform to changes made in
    those rules. The deletion of words in the clause describing the
    proper scope of the subpoena conforms to a change made in the
    language of Rule 34. The reference to Rule 26(b) is unchanged but
    encompasses new matter in that subdivision. The changes make it
    clear that the scope of discovery through a subpoena is the same as
    that applicable to Rule 34 and the other discovery rules.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1980 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (d)(1). The amendment defines the term "proof of
    service" as used in the first sentence of the present subdivision.
    For want of a definition, the district court clerks have been
    obliged to fashion their own, with results that vary from district
    to district. All that seems required is a simple certification on a
    copy of the notice to take a deposition that the notice has been
    served on every other party to the action. That is the proof of
    service required by Rule 25(d) of both the Federal Rules of
    Appellate Procedure and the Supreme Court Rules.
      Subdivision (e)(1). The amendment makes the reach of a subpoena
    of a district court at least as extensive as that of the state
    courts of general jurisdiction in the state in which the district
    court is held. Under the present rule the reach of a district court
    subpoena is often greater, since it extends throughout the
    district. No reason appears why it should be less, as it sometimes
    is because of the accident of district lines. Restrictions upon the
    reach of subpoenas are imposed to prevent undue inconvenience to
    witnesses. State statutes and rules of court are quite likely to
    reflect the varying degrees of difficulty and expense attendant
    upon local travel.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1985 AMENDMENT       
      Present Rule 45(d)(2) has two sentences setting forth the
    territorial scope of deposition subpoenas. The first sentence is
    directed to depositions taken in the judicial district in which the
    deponent resides; the second sentence addresses situations in which
    the deponent is not a resident of the district in which the
    deposition is to take place. The Rule, as currently constituted,
    creates anomalous situations that often cause logistical problems
    in conducting litigation.
      The first sentence of the present Rule states that a deponent may
    be required to attend only in the county wherein that person
    resides or is employed or transacts business in person, that is,
    where the person lives or works. Under this provision a deponent
    can be compelled, without court order, to travel from one end of
    that person's home county to the other, no matter how far that may
    be. The second sentence of the Rule is somewhat more flexible,
    stating that someone who does not reside in the district in which
    the deposition is to be taken can be required to attend in the
    county where the person is served with the subpoena, or within 40
    miles from the place of service.
      Under today's conditions there is no sound reason for
    distinguishing between residents of the district or county in which
    a deposition is to be taken and nonresidents, and the Rule is
    amended to provide that any person may be subpoenaed to attend a
    deposition within a specified radius from that person's residence,
    place of business, or where the person was served. The 40-mile
    radius has been increased to 100 miles.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Purposes of Revision. The purposes of this revision are (1) to
    clarify and enlarge the protections afforded persons who are
    required to assist the court by giving information or evidence; (2)
    to facilitate access outside the deposition procedure provided by
    Rule 30 to documents and other information in the possession of
    persons who are not parties; (3) to facilitate service of subpoenas
    for depositions or productions of evidence at places distant from
    the district in which an action is proceeding; (4) to enable the
    court to compel a witness found within the state in which the court
    sits to attend trial; (5) to clarify the organization of the text
    of the rule.
      Subdivision (a). This subdivision is amended in seven significant
    respects.
      First, Paragraph (a)(3) modifies the requirement that a subpoena
    be issued by the clerk of court. Provision is made for the issuance
    of subpoenas by attorneys as officers of the court. This revision
    perhaps culminates an evolution. Subpoenas were long issued by
    specific order of the court. As this became a burden to the court,
    general orders were made authorizing clerks to issue subpoenas on
    request. Since 1948, they have been issued in blank by the clerk of
    any federal court to any lawyer, the clerk serving as stationer to
    the bar. In allowing counsel to issue the subpoena, the rule is
    merely a recognition of present reality.
      Although the subpoena is in a sense the command of the attorney
    who completes the form, defiance of a subpoena is nevertheless an
    act in defiance of a court order and exposes the defiant witness to
    contempt sanctions. In ICC v. Brimson, 154 U.S. 447 (1894), the
    Court upheld a statute directing federal courts to issue subpoenas
    to compel testimony before the ICC. In CAB v. Hermann, 353 U.S. 322
    (1957), the Court approved as established practice the issuance of
    administrative subpoenas as a matter of absolute agency right. And
    in NLRB v. Warren Co., 350 U.S. 107 (1955), the Court held that the
    lower court had no discretion to withhold sanctions against a
    contemnor who violated such subpoenas. The 1948 revision of Rule 45
    put the attorney in a position similar to that of the
    administrative agency, as a public officer entitled to use the
    court's contempt power to investigate facts in dispute. Two courts
    of appeals have touched on the issue and have described lawyer-
    issued subpoenas as mandates of the court. Waste Conversion, Inc.
    v. Rollins Environmental Services (NJ), Inc., 893 F.2d 605 (3d
    cir., 1990); Fisher v. Marubent Cotton Corp., 526 F.2d 1338, 1340
    (8th cir., 1975). Cf. Young v. United States ex rel Vuitton et Fils
    S.A., 481 U.S. 787, 821 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring). This
    revision makes the rule explicit that the attorney acts as an
    officer of the court in issuing and signing subpoenas.
      Necessarily accompanying the evolution of this power of the
    lawyer as officer of the court is the development of increased
    responsibility and liability for the misuse of this power. The
    latter development is reflected in the provisions of subdivision
    (c) of this rule, and also in the requirement imposed by paragraph
    (3) of this subdivision that the attorney issuing a subpoena must
    sign it.
      Second, Paragraph (a)(3) authorizes attorneys in distant
    districts to serve as officers authorized to issue commands in the
    name of the court. Any attorney permitted to represent a client in
    a federal court, even one admitted pro hac vice, has the same
    authority as a clerk to issue a subpoena from any federal court for
    the district in which the subpoena is served and enforced. In
    authorizing attorneys to issue subpoenas from distant courts, the
    amended rule effectively authorizes service of a subpoena anywhere
    in the United States by an attorney representing any party. This
    change is intended to ease the administrative burdens of inter-
    district law practice. The former rule resulted in delay and
    expense caused by the need to secure forms from clerks' offices
    some distance from the place at which the action proceeds. This
    change does not enlarge the burden on the witness.
      Pursuant to Paragraph (a)(2), a subpoena for a deposition must
    still issue from the court in which the deposition or production
    would be compelled. Accordingly, a motion to quash such a subpoena
    if it overbears the limits of the subpoena power must, as under the
    previous rule, be presented to the court for the district in which
    the deposition would occur. Likewise, the court in whose name the
    subpoena is issued is responsible for its enforcement.
      Third, in order to relieve attorneys of the need to secure an
    appropriate seal to affix to a subpoena issued as an officer of a
    distant court, the requirement that a subpoena be under seal is
    abolished by the provisions of Paragraph (a)(1).
      Fourth, Paragraph (a)(1) authorizes the issuance of a subpoena to
    compel a non-party to produce evidence independent of any
    deposition. This revision spares the necessity of a deposition of
    the custodian of evidentiary material required to be produced. A
    party seeking additional production from a person subject to such a
    subpoena may serve an additional subpoena requiring additional
    production at the same time and place.
      Fifth, Paragraph (a)(2) makes clear that the person subject to
    the subpoena is required to produce materials in that person's
    control whether or not the materials are located within the
    district or within the territory within which the subpoena can be
    served. The non-party witness is subject to the same scope of
    discovery under this rule as that person would be as a party to
    whom a request is addressed pursuant to Rule 34.
      Sixth, Paragraph (a)(1) requires that the subpoena include a
    statement of the rights and duties of witnesses by setting forth in
    full the text of the new subdivisions (c) and (d).
      Seventh, the revised rule authorizes the issuance of a subpoena
    to compel the inspection of premises in the possession of a non-
    party. Rule 34 has authorized such inspections of premises in the
    possession of a party as discovery compelled under Rule 37, but
    prior practice required an independent proceeding to secure such
    relief ancillary to the federal proceeding when the premises were
    not in the possession of a party. Practice in some states has long
    authorized such use of a subpoena for this purpose without apparent
    adverse consequence.
      Subdivision (b). Paragraph (b)(1) retains the text of the former
    subdivision (c) with minor changes.
      The reference to the United States marshal and deputy marshal is
    deleted because of the infrequency of the use of these officers for
    this purpose. Inasmuch as these officers meet the age requirement,
    they may still be used if available.
      A provision requiring service of prior notice pursuant to Rule 5
    of compulsory pretrial production or inspection has been added to
    paragraph (b)(1). The purpose of such notice is to afford other
    parties an opportunity to object to the production or inspection,
    or to serve a demand for additional documents or things. Such
    additional notice is not needed with respect to a deposition
    because of the requirement of notice imposed by Rule 30 or 31. But
    when production or inspection is sought independently of a
    deposition, other parties may need notice in order to monitor the
    discovery and in order to pursue access to any information that may
    or should be produced.
      Paragraph (b)(2) retains language formerly set forth in
    subdivision (e) and extends its application to subpoenas for
    depositions or production.
      Paragraph (b)(3) retains language formerly set forth in paragraph
    (d)(1) and extends its applications to subpoenas for trial or
    hearing or production.
      Subdivision (c). This provision is new and states the rights of
    witnesses. It is not intended to diminish rights conferred by Rules
    26-37 or any other authority.
      Paragraph (c)(1) gives specific application to the principle
    stated in Rule 26(g) and specifies liability for earnings lost by a
    non-party witness as a result of a misuse of the subpoena. No
    change in existing law is thereby effected. Abuse of a subpoena is
    an actionable tort, Board of Ed. v. Farmingdale Classroom Teach.
    Ass'n, 38 N.Y.2d 397, 380 N.Y.S.2d 635, 343 N.E.2d 278 (1975), and
    the duty of the attorney to the non-party is also embodied in Model
    Rule of Professional Conduct 4.4. The liability of the attorney is
    correlative to the expanded power of the attorney to issue
    subpoenas. The liability may include the cost of fees to collect
    attorneys' fees owed as a result of a breach of this duty.
      Paragraph (c)(2) retains language from the former subdivision (b)
    and paragraph (d)(1). The 10-day period for response to a subpoena
    is extended to 14 days to avoid the complex calculations associated
    with short time periods under Rule 6 and to allow a bit more time
    for such objections to be made.
      A non-party required to produce documents or materials is
    protected against significant expense resulting from involuntary
    assistance to the court. This provision applies, for example, to a
    non-party required to provide a list of class members. The court is
    not required to fix the costs in advance of production, although
    this will often be the most satisfactory accommodation to protect
    the party seeking discovery from excessive costs. In some
    instances, it may be preferable to leave uncertain costs to be
    determined after the materials have been produced, provided that
    the risk of uncertainty is fully disclosed to the discovering
    party. See, e.g., United States v. Columbia Broadcasting Systems,
    Inc., 666 F.2d 364 (9th Cir. 1982).
      Paragraph (c)(3) explicitly authorizes the quashing of a subpoena
    as a means of protecting a witness from misuse of the subpoena
    power. It replaces and enlarges on the former subdivision (b) of
    this rule and tracks the provisions of Rule 26(c). While largely
    repetitious, this rule is addressed to the witness who may read it
    on the subpoena, where it is required to be printed by the revised
    paragraph (a)(1) of this rule.
      Subparagraph (c)(3)(A) identifies those circumstances in which a
    subpoena must be quashed or modified. It restates the former
    provisions with respect to the limits of mandatory travel that are
    set forth in the former paragraphs (d)(2) and (e)(1), with one
    important change. Under the revised rule, a federal court can
    compel a witness to come from any place in the state to attend
    trial, whether or not the local state law so provides. This
    extension is subject to the qualification provided in the next
    paragraph, which authorizes the court to condition enforcement of a
    subpoena compelling a non-party witness to bear substantial expense
    to attend trial. The traveling non-party witness may be entitled to
    reasonable compensation for the time and effort entailed.
      Clause (c)(3)(A)(iv) requires the court to protect all persons
    from undue burden imposed by the use of the subpoena power.
    Illustratively, it might be unduly burdensome to compel an
    adversary to attend trial as a witness if the adversary is known to
    have no personal knowledge of matters in dispute, especially so if
    the adversary would be required to incur substantial travel
    burdens.
      Subparagraph (c)(3)(B) identifies circumstances in which a
    subpoena should be quashed unless the party serving the subpoena
    shows a substantial need and the court can devise an appropriate
    accommodation to protect the interests of the witness. An
    additional circumstance in which such action is required is a
    request for costly production of documents; that situation is
    expressly governed by subparagraph (b)(2)(B).
      Clause (c)(3)(B)(i) authorizes the court to quash, modify, or
    condition a subpoena to protect the person subject to or affected
    by the subpoena from unnecessary or unduly harmful disclosures of
    confidential information. It corresponds to Rule 26(c)(7).
      Clause (c)(3)(B)(ii) provides appropriate protection for the
    intellectual property of the non-party witness; it does not apply
    to the expert retained by a party, whose information is subject to
    the provisions of Rule 26(b)(4). A growing problem has been the use
    of subpoenas to compel the giving of evidence and information by
    unretained experts. Experts are not exempt from the duty to give
    evidence, even if they cannot be compelled to prepare themselves to
    give effective testimony, e.g., Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Otte, 474
    F.2d 529 (2d Cir. 1972), but compulsion to give evidence may
    threaten the intellectual property of experts denied the
    opportunity to bargain for the value of their services. See
    generally Maurer, Compelling the Expert Witness: Fairness and
    Utility Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 19 GA.L.REV. 71
    (1984); Note, Discovery and Testimony of Unretained Experts, 1987
    DUKE L.J. 140. Arguably the compulsion to testify can be regarded
    as a "taking" of intellectual property. The rule establishes the
    right of such persons to withhold their expertise, at least unless
    the party seeking it makes the kind of showing required for a
    conditional denial of a motion to quash as provided in the final
    sentence of subparagraph (c)(3)(B); that requirement is the same as
    that necessary to secure work product under Rule 26(b)(3) and gives
    assurance of reasonable compensation. The Rule thus approves the
    accommodation of competing interests exemplified in United States
    v. Columbia Broadcasting Systems Inc., 666 F.2d 364 (9th Cir.
    1982). See also Wright v. Jeep Corporation, 547 F. Supp. 871 (E.D.
    Mich. 1982).
      As stated in Kaufman v. Edelstein, 539 F.2d 811, 822 (2d Cir.
    1976), the district court's discretion in these matters should be
    informed by "the degree to which the expert is being called because
    of his knowledge of facts relevant to the case rather than in order
    to give opinion testimony; the difference between testifying to a
    previously formed or expressed opinion and forming a new one; the
    possibility that, for other reasons, the witness is a unique
    expert; the extent to which the calling party is able to show the
    unlikelihood that any comparable witness will willingly testify;
    and the degree to which the witness is able to show that he has
    been oppressed by having continually to testify. . . ."
      Clause (c)(3)(B)(iii) protects non-party witnesses who may be
    burdened to perform the duty to travel in order to provide
    testimony at trial. The provision requires the court to condition a
    subpoena requiring travel of more than 100 miles on reasonable
    compensation.
      Subdivision (d). This provision is new. Paragraph (d)(1) extends
    to non-parties the duty imposed on parties by the last paragraph of
    Rule 34(b), which was added in 1980.
      Paragraph (d)(2) is new and corresponds to the new Rule 26(b)(5).
    Its purpose is to provide a party whose discovery is constrained by
    a claim of privilege or work product protection with information
    sufficient to evaluate such a claim and to resist if it seems
    unjustified. The person claiming a privilege or protection cannot
    decide the limits of that party's own entitlement.
      A party receiving a discovery request who asserts a privilege or
    protection but fails to disclose that claim is at risk of waiving
    the privilege or protection. A person claiming a privilege or
    protection who fails to provide adequate information about the
    privilege or protection claim to the party seeking the information
    is subject to an order to show cause why the person should not be
    held in contempt under subdivision (e). Motions for such orders and
    responses to motions are subject to the sanctions provisions of
    Rules 7 and 11.
      A person served a subpoena that is too broad may be faced with a
    burdensome task to provide full information regarding all that
    person's claims to privilege or work product protection. Such a
    person is entitled to protection that may be secured through an
    objection made pursuant to paragraph (c)(2).
      Subdivision (e). This provision retains most of the language of
    the former subdivision (f).
      "Adequate cause" for a failure to obey a subpoena remains
    undefined. In at least some circumstances, a non-party might be
    guilty of contempt for refusing to obey a subpoena even though the
    subpoena manifestly overreaches the appropriate limits of the
    subpoena power. E.g., Walker v. City of Birmingham, 388 U.S. 307
    (1967). But, because the command of the subpoena is not in fact one
    uttered by a judicial officer, contempt should be very sparingly
    applied when the non-party witness has been overborne by a party or
    attorney. The language added to subdivision (f) is intended to
    assure that result where a non-party has been commanded, on the
    signature of an attorney, to travel greater distances than can be
    compelled pursuant to this rule.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             
      This amendment closes a small gap in regard to notifying
    witnesses of the manner for recording a deposition. A deposition
    subpoena must state the method for recording the testimony.
      Rule 30(b)(2) directs that the party noticing a deposition state
    in the notice the manner for recording the testimony, but the
    notice need not be served on the deponent. The deponent learns of
    the recording method only if the deponent is a party or is informed
    by a party. Rule 30(b)(3) permits another party to designate an
    additional method of recording with prior notice to the deponent
    and the other parties. The deponent thus has notice of the
    recording method when an additional method is designated. This
    amendment completes the notice provisions to ensure that a nonparty
    deponent has notice of the recording method when the recording
    method is described only in the deposition notice.
      A subpoenaed witness does not have a right to refuse to proceed
    with a deposition due to objections to the manner of recording. But
    under rare circumstances, a nonparty witness might have a ground
    for seeking a protective order under Rule 26(c) with regard to the
    manner of recording or the use of the deposition if recorded in a
    certain manner. Should such a witness not learn of the manner of
    recording until the deposition begins, undesirable delay or
    complication might result. Advance notice of the recording method
    affords an opportunity to raise such protective issues.
      Other changes are made to conform Rule 45(a)(2) to current style
    conventions.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Only a small style
    change has been made in the proposal as published.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 45 is amended to conform the provisions for subpoenas to
    changes in other discovery rules, largely related to discovery of
    electronically stored information. Rule 34 is amended to provide in
    greater detail for the production of electronically stored
    information. Rule 45(a)(1)(C) is amended to recognize that
    electronically stored information, as defined in Rule 34(a), can
    also be sought by subpoena. Like Rule 34(b), Rule 45(a)(1) is
    amended to provide that the subpoena can designate a form or forms
    for production of electronic data. Rule 45(c)(2) is amended, like
    Rule 34(b), to authorize the person served with a subpoena to
    object to the requested form or forms. In addition, as under Rule
    34(b), Rule 45(d)(1)(B) is amended to provide that if the subpoena
    does not specify the form or forms for electronically stored
    information, the person served with the subpoena must produce
    electronically stored information in a form or forms in which it is
    usually maintained or in a form or forms that are reasonably
    usable. Rule 45(d)(1)(C) is added to provide that the person
    producing electronically stored information should not have to
    produce the same information in more than one form unless so
    ordered by the court for good cause.
      As with discovery of electronically stored information from
    parties, complying with a subpoena for such information may impose
    burdens on the responding person. Rule 45(c) provides protection
    against undue impositions on nonparties. For example, Rule 45(c)(1)
    directs that a party serving a subpoena "shall take reasonable
    steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subject
    to the subpoena," and Rule 45(c)(2)(B) permits the person served
    with the subpoena to object to it and directs that an order
    requiring compliance "shall protect a person who is neither a party
    nor a party's officer from significant expense resulting from"
    compliance. Rule 45(d)(1)(D) is added to provide that the
    responding person need not provide discovery of electronically
    stored information from sources the party identifies as not
    reasonably accessible, unless the court orders such discovery for
    good cause, considering the limitations of Rule 26(b)(2)(C), on
    terms that protect a nonparty against significant expense. A
    parallel provision is added to Rule 26(b)(2).
      Rule 45(a)(1)(B) is also amended, as is Rule 34(a), to provide
    that a subpoena is available to permit testing and sampling as well
    as inspection and copying. As in Rule 34, this change recognizes
    that on occasion the opportunity to perform testing or sampling may
    be important, both for documents and for electronically stored
    information. Because testing or sampling may present particular
    issues of burden or intrusion for the person served with the
    subpoena, however, the protective provisions of Rule 45(c) should
    be enforced with vigilance when such demands are made. Inspection
    or testing of certain types of electronically stored information or
    of a person's electronic information system may raise issues of
    confidentiality or privacy. The addition of sampling and testing to
    Rule 45(a) with regard to documents and electronically stored
    information is not meant to create a routine right of direct access
    to a person's electronic information system, although such access
    might be justified in some circumstances. Courts should guard
    against undue intrusiveness resulting from inspecting or testing
    such systems.
      Rule 45(d)(2) is amended, as is Rule 26(b)(5), to add a procedure
    for assertion of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation
    materials after production. The receiving party may submit the
    information to the court for resolution of the privilege claim, as
    under Rule 26(b)(5)(B).
      Other minor amendments are made to conform the rule to the
    changes described above.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. The Committee
    recommends a modified version of the proposal as published. The
    changes were made to maintain the parallels between Rule 45 and the
    other rules that address discovery of electronically stored
    information. These changes are fully described in the introduction
    to Rule 45 and in the discussions of the other rules. [Omitted]
      The changes from the published proposed amendment are shown
    below. [Omitted]

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 45 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      The reference to discovery of "books" in former Rule 45(a)(1)(C)
    was deleted to achieve consistent expression throughout the
    discovery rules. Books remain a proper subject of discovery.
      Former Rule 45(b)(1) required "prior notice" to each party of any
    commanded production of documents and things or inspection of
    premises. Courts have agreed that notice must be given "prior" to
    the return date, and have tended to converge on an interpretation
    that requires notice to the parties before the subpoena is served
    on the person commanded to produce or permit inspection. That
    interpretation is adopted in amended Rule 45(b)(1) to give clear
    notice of general present practice.
      The language of former Rule 45(d)(2) addressing the manner of
    asserting privilege is replaced by adopting the wording of Rule
    26(b)(5). The same meaning is better expressed in the same words.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. See Note to Rule 1,
    supra.

-STATUTE-
      A formal exception to a ruling or order is unnecessary. When the

    action that it wants the court to take or objects to, along with
    the grounds for the request or objection. Failing to object does
    not prejudice a party who had no opportunity to do so when the
    ruling or order was made.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      The revision of this subdivision brings it into line with the
    amendment of Rule 24(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
    That rule previously allowed four alternate jurors, as contrasted
    with the two allowed in civil cases, and the amendments increase
    the number of a maximum of six in all cases. The Advisory
    Committee's Note to amended Criminal Rule 24(c) points to
    experience demonstrating that four alternates may not be enough in
    some lengthy criminal trials; and the same may be said of civil
    trials. The Note adds:
      "The words 'or are found to be' are added to the second sentence
    to make clear that an alternate juror may be called in the
    situation where it is first discovered during the trial that a
    juror was unable or disqualified to perform his duties at the time
    he was sworn."

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b). The former provision for alternate jurors is
    stricken and the institution of the alternate juror abolished.
      The former rule reflected the long-standing assumption that a
    jury would consist of exactly twelve members. It provided for
    additional jurors to be used as substitutes for jurors who are for
    any reason excused or disqualified from service after the
    commencement of the trial. Additional jurors were traditionally
    designated at the outset of the trial, and excused at the close of
    the evidence if they had not been promoted to full service on
    account of the elimination of one of the original jurors.
      The use of alternate jurors has been a source of dissatisfaction
    with the jury system because of the burden it places on alternates
    who are required to listen to the evidence but denied the
    satisfaction of participating in its evaluation.
      Subdivision (c). This provision makes it clear that the court may
    in appropriate circumstances excuse a juror during the jury
    deliberations without causing a mistrial. Sickness, family
    emergency or juror misconduct that might occasion a mistrial are
    examples of appropriate grounds for excusing a juror. It is not
    grounds for the dismissal of a juror that the juror refuses to join
    with fellow jurors in reaching a unanimous verdict.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 47 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

      (a) Number of Jurors. A jury must begin with at least 6 and no

    verdict unless excused under Rule 47(c).
      (b) Verdict. Unless the parties stipulate otherwise, the verdict
    must be unanimous and must be returned by a jury of at least 6
    members.
      (c) Polling. After a verdict is returned but before the jury is
    discharged, the court must on a party's request, or may on its own,
    poll the jurors individually. If the poll reveals a lack of
    unanimity or lack of assent by the number of jurors that the
    parties stipulated to, the court may direct the jury to deliberate
    further or may order a new trial.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      For provisions in state codes, compare Utah Rev.Stat.Ann. (1933)
    Sec. 48-O-5 (In civil cases parties may agree in open court on
    lesser number of jurors); 2 Wash.Rev.Stat.Ann. (Remington, 1932)
    Sec. 323 (Parties may consent to any number of jurors not less than
    three).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      The former rule was rendered obsolete by the adoption in many
    districts of local rules establishing six as the standard size for
    a civil jury.
      It appears that the minimum size of a jury consistent with the
    Seventh Amendment is six. Cf. Ballew v. Georgia, 435 U.S. 223
    (1978) (holding that a conviction based on a jury of less than six
    is a denial of due process of law). If the parties agree to trial
    before a smaller jury, a verdict can be taken, but the parties
    should not other than in exceptional circumstances be encouraged to
    waive the right to a jury of six, not only because of the
    constitutional stature of the right, but also because smaller
    juries are more erratic and less effective in serving to distribute
    responsibility for the exercise of judicial power.
      Because the institution of the alternate juror has been abolished
    by the proposed revision of Rule 47, it will ordinarily be prudent
    and necessary, in order to provide for sickness or disability among
    jurors, to seat more than six jurors. The use of jurors in excess
    of six increases the representativeness of the jury and harms no
    interest of a party. Ray v. Parkside Surgery Center, 13 F.R. Serv.
    585 (6th cir. 1989).
      If the court takes the precaution of seating a jury larger than
    six, an illness occurring during the deliberation period will not
    result in a mistrial, as it did formerly, because all seated jurors
    will participate in the verdict and a sufficient number will remain
    to render a unanimous verdict of six or more.
      In exceptional circumstances, as where a jury suffers depletions
    during trial and deliberation that are greater than can reasonably
    be expected, the parties may agree to be bound by a verdict
    rendered by fewer than six jurors. The court should not, however,
    rely upon the availability of such an agreement, for the use of
    juries smaller than six is problematic for reasons fully explained
    in Ballew v. Georgia, supra.

-HEAD-
    Rule 49. Special Verdict; General Verdict and Questions

-STATUTE-
      (a) Special Verdict.
        (1) In General. The court may require a jury to return only a
      special verdict in the form of a special written finding on each
      issue of fact. The court may do so by:
          (A) submitting written questions susceptible of a categorical
        or other brief answer;
          (B) submitting written forms of the special findings that
        might properly be made under the pleadings and evidence; or
          (C) using any other method that the court considers
        appropriate.

        (2) Instructions. The court must give the instructions and
      explanations necessary to enable the jury to make its findings on
      each submitted issue.
        (3) Issues Not Submitted. A party waives the right to a jury
      trial on any issue of fact raised by the pleadings or evidence
      but not submitted to the jury unless, before the jury retires,
      the party demands its submission to the jury. If the party does
      not demand submission, the court may make a finding on the issue.
      If the court makes no finding, it is considered to have made a
      finding consistent with its judgment on the special verdict.

      (b) General Verdict with Answers to Written Questions.
        (1) In General. The court may submit to the jury forms for a
      general verdict, together with written questions on one or more
      issues of fact that the jury must decide. The court must give the
      instructions and explanations necessary to enable the jury to
      render a general verdict and answer the questions in writing, and
      must direct the jury to do both.
        (2) Verdict and Answers Consistent. When the general verdict
      and the answers are consistent, the court must approve, for entry
      under Rule 58, an appropriate judgment on the verdict and
      answers.
        (3) Answers Inconsistent with the Verdict. When the answers are
      consistent with each other but one or more is inconsistent with
      the general verdict, the court may:
          (A) approve, for entry under Rule 58, an appropriate judgment
        according to the answers, notwithstanding the general verdict;
          (B) direct the jury to further consider its answers and
        verdict; or
          (C) order a new trial.

        (4) Answers Inconsistent with Each Other and the Verdict. When
      the answers are inconsistent with each other and one or more is
      also inconsistent with the general verdict, judgment must not be
      entered; instead, the court must direct the jury to further
      consider its answers and verdict, or must order a new trial.

      Motion for a New Trial; Conditional Ruling

-STATUTE-
      (a) Judgment as a Matter of Law.
        (1) In General. If a party has been fully heard on an issue
      during a jury trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury
      would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for
      the party on that issue, the court may:
          (A) resolve the issue against the party; and
          (B) grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against
        the party on a claim or defense that, under the controlling
        law, can be maintained or defeated only with a favorable
        finding on that issue.

        (2) Motion. A motion for judgment as a matter of law may be
      made at any time before the case is submitted to the jury. The
      motion must specify the judgment sought and the law and facts
      that entitle the movant to the judgment.

      (b) Renewing the Motion After Trial; Alternative Motion for a New
    Trial. If the court does not grant a motion for judgment as a
    matter of law made under Rule 50(a), the court is considered to
    have submitted the action to the jury subject to the court's later
    deciding the legal questions raised by the motion. No later than 28
    days after the entry of judgment - or if the motion addresses a
    jury issue not decided by a verdict, no later than 28 days after
    the jury was discharged - the movant may file a renewed motion for
    judgment as a matter of law and may include an alternative or joint
    request for a new trial under Rule 59. In ruling on the renewed
    motion, the court may:
        (1) allow judgment on the verdict, if the jury returned a
      verdict;
        (2) order a new trial; or
        (3) direct the entry of judgment as a matter of law.

      (c) Granting the Renewed Motion; Conditional Ruling on a Motion
    for a New Trial.
        (1) In General. If the court grants a renewed motion for
      judgment as a matter of law, it must also conditionally rule on
      any motion for a new trial by determining whether a new trial
      should be granted if the judgment is later vacated or reversed.
      The court must state the grounds for conditionally granting or
      denying the motion for a new trial.
        (2) Effect of a Conditional Ruling. Conditionally granting the
      motion for a new trial does not affect the judgment's finality;
      if the judgment is reversed, the new trial must proceed unless
      the appellate court orders otherwise. If the motion for a new
      trial is conditionally denied, the appellee may assert error in
      that denial; if the judgment is reversed, the case must proceed
      as the appellate court orders.

      (d) Time for a Losing Party's New-Trial Motion. Any motion for a
    new trial under Rule 59 by a party against whom judgment as a
    matter of law is rendered must be filed no later than 28 days after
    the entry of the judgment.
      (e) Denying the Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law; Reversal
    on Appeal. If the court denies the motion for judgment as a matter
    of law, the prevailing party may, as appellee, assert grounds
    entitling it to a new trial should the appellate court conclude
    that the trial court erred in denying the motion. If the appellate
    court reverses the judgment, it may order a new trial, direct the
    trial court to determine whether a new trial should be granted, or
    direct the entry of judgment.

      Note to Subdivision (a). The present federal rule is changed to
    the extent that the formality of an express reservation of rights
    against waiver is no longer necessary. See Sampliner v. Motion
    Picture Patents Co., 254 U.S. 233 (1920); Union Indemnity Co. v.
    United States, 74 F.(2d) 645 (C.C.A.6th, 1935). The requirement
    that specific grounds for the motion for a directed verdict must be
    stated settles a conflict in the federal cases. See Simkins,
    Federal Practice (1934) Sec. 189.
      Note to Subdivision (b). For comparable state practice upheld
    under the conformity act, see Baltimore and Carolina Line v.
    Redman, 295 U.S. 654 (1935); compare Slocum v. New York Life Ins.
    Co., 228 U.S. 364 (1913).
      See Northern Ry. Co. v. Page, 274 U.S. 65 (1927), following the
    Massachusetts practice of alternative verdicts, explained in
    Thorndike, Trial by Jury in United States Courts, 26 Harv.L.Rev.
    732 (1913). See also Thayer, Judicial Administration, 63 U. of
    Pa.L.Rev. 585, 600-601, and note 32 (1915); Scott, Trial by Jury
    and the Reform of Civil Procedure, 31 Harv.L.Rev. 669, 685 (1918);
    Comment, 34 Mich.L.Rev. 93, 98 (1935).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The practice, after the court has granted a
    motion for a directed verdict, of requiring the jury to express
    assent to a verdict they did not reach by their own deliberations
    serves no useful purpose and may give offense to the members of the
    jury. See 2B Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec.
    1072, at 367 (Wright ed. 1961); Blume, Origin and Development of
    the Directed Verdict, 48 Mich.L.Rev. 555, 582-85, 589-90 (1950).
    The final sentence of the subdivision, added by amendment, provides
    that the court's order granting a motion for a directed verdict is
    effective in itself, and that no action need be taken by the
    foreman or other members of the jury. See Ariz.R.Civ.P. 50(c); cf.
    Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 (a). No change is intended in the standard to be
    applied in deciding the motion. To assure this interpretation, and
    in the interest of simplicity, the traditional term, "directed
    verdict," is retained.
      Subdivision (b). A motion for judgment notwithstanding the
    verdict will not lie unless it was preceded by a motion for a
    directed verdict made at the close of all the evidence.
      The amendment of the second sentence of this subdivision sets the
    time limit for making the motion for judgment n.o.v. at 10 days
    after the entry of judgment, rather than 10 days after the
    reception of the verdict. Thus the time provision is made
    consistent with that contained in Rule 59(b) (time for motion for
    new trial) and Rule 52(b) (time for motion to amend findings by the
    court).
      Subdivision (c) deals with the situation where a party joins a
    motion for a new trial with his motion for judgment n.o.v. or prays
    for a new trial in the alternative, and the motion for judgment
    n.o.v. is granted. The procedure to be followed in making rulings
    on the motion for the new trial, and the consequences of the
    rulings thereon, were partly set out in Montgomery Ward & Co. v.
    Duncan, 311 U.S. 243, 253, 61 S.Ct. 189, 85 L.Ed. 147 (1940), and
    have been further elaborated in later cases. See Cone v. West
    Virginia Pulp & Paper Co., 330 U.S. 212, 67 S.Ct. 752, 91 L.Ed. 849
    (1947); Globe Liquor Co., Inc. v. San Roman, 332 U.S. 571, 68 S.Ct.
    246, 92 L.Ed. 177 (1948); Fountain v. Filson, 336 U.S. 681, 69
    S.Ct. 754, 93 L.Ed. 971 (1949); Johnson v. New York, N.H. & H.R.R.
    Co., 344 U.S. 48, 73 S.Ct. 125, 97 L.Ed. 77 (1952). However, courts
    as well as counsel have often misunderstood the procedure, and it
    will be helpful to summarize the proper practice in the text of the
    rule. The amendments do not alter the effects of a jury verdict or
    the scope of appellate review.
      In the situation mentioned, subdivision (c)(1) requires that the
    court make a "conditional" ruling on the new-trial motion, i.e., a
    ruling which goes on the assumption that the motion for judgment
    n.o.v. was erroneously granted and will be reversed or vacated; and
    the court is required to state its grounds for the conditional
    ruling. Subdivision (c)(1) then spells out the consequences of a
    reversal of the judgment in the light of the conditional ruling on
    the new-trial motion.
      If the motion for new trial has been conditionally granted, and
    the judgment is reversed, "the new trial shall proceed unless the
    appellate court has otherwise ordered." The party against whom the
    judgment n.o.v. was entered below may, as appellant, besides
    seeking to overthrow that judgment, also attack the conditional
    grant of the new trial. And the appellate court, if it reverses the
    judgment n.o.v., may in an appropriate case also reverse the
    conditional grant of the new trial and direct that judgment be
    entered on the verdict. See Bailey v. Slentz, 189 F.2d 406 (10th
    Cir. 1951); Moist Cold Refrigerator Co. v. Lou Johnson Co., 249
    F.2d 246 (9th Cir. 1957), cert. denied, 356 U.S. 968, 78 S.Ct.
    1008, 2 L.Ed.2d 1074 (1958); Peters v. Smith, 221 F.2d 721 (3d
    Cir.1955); Dailey v. Timmer, 292 F.2d 824 (3d Cir. 1961),
    explaining Lind v. Schenley Industries, Inc., 278 F.2d 79 (3d
    Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 835, 81 S.Ct. 58, 5 L.Ed.2d 60
    (1960); Cox v. Pennsylvania R.R., 120 A.2d 214 (D.C.Mun.Ct.App.
    1956); 3 Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec.
    1302.1 at 346-47 (Wright ed. 1958); 6 Moore's Federal Practice
    &#182; 59.16 at 3915 n. 8a (2d ed. 1954).
      If the motion for a new trial has been conditionally denied, and
    the judgment is reversed, "subsequent proceedings shall be in
    accordance with the order of the appellate court." The party in
    whose favor judgment n.o.v. was entered below may, as appellee,
    besides seeking to uphold that judgment, also urge on the appellate
    court that the trial court committed error in conditionally denying
    the new trial. The appellee may assert this error in his brief,
    without taking a cross-appeal. Cf. Patterson v. Pennsylvania R.R.,
    238 F.2d 645, 650 (6th Cir. 1956); Hughes v. St. Louis Nat. L.
    Baseball Club, Inc., 359 Mo. 993, 997, 224 S.W.2d 989, 992 (1949).
    If the appellate court concludes that the judgment cannot stand,
    but accepts the appellee's contention that there was error in the
    conditional denial of the new trial, it may order a new trial in
    lieu of directing the entry of judgment upon the verdict.
      Subdivision (c)(2), which also deals with the situation where the
    trial court has granted the motion for judgment n.o.v., states that
    the verdict-winner may apply to the trial court for a new trial
    pursuant to Rule 59 after the judgment n.o.v. has been entered
    against him. In arguing to the trial court in opposition to the
    motion for judgment n.o.v., the verdict-winner may, and often will,
    contend that he is entitled, at the least, to a new trial, and the
    court has a range of discretion to grant a new trial or (where
    plaintiff won the verdict) to order a dismissal of the action
    without prejudice instead of granting judgment n.o.v. See Cone v.
    West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co., supra, 330 U.S. at 217, 218 67
    S.Ct. at 755, 756, 91 L.Ed. 849. Subdivision (c)(2) is a reminder
    that the verdict-winner is entitled, even after entry of judgment
    n.o.v. against him, to move for a new trial in the usual course. If
    in these circumstances the motion is granted, the judgment is
    superseded.
      In some unusual circumstances, however, the grant of the new-
    trial motion may be only conditional, and the judgment will not be
    superseded. See the situation in Tribble v. Bruin, 279 F.2d 424
    (4th Cir. 1960) (upon a verdict for plaintiff, defendant moves for
    and obtains judgment n.o.v.; plaintiff moves for a new trial on the
    ground of inadequate damages; trial court might properly have
    granted plaintiff's motion, conditional upon reversal of the
    judgment n.o.v.).
      Even if the verdict-winner makes no motion for a new trial, he is
    entitled upon his appeal from the judgment n.o.v. not only to urge
    that that judgment should be reversed and judgment entered upon the
    verdict, but that errors were committed during the trial which at
    the least entitle him to a new trial.
      Subdivision (d) deals with the situation where judgment has been
    entered on the jury verdict, the motion for judgment n.o.v. and any
    motion for a new trial having been denied by the trial court. The
    verdict-winner, as appellee, besides seeking to uphold the
    judgment, may urge upon the appellate court that in case the trial
    court is found to have erred in entering judgment on the verdict,
    there are grounds for granting him a new trial instead of directing
    the entry of judgment for his opponent. In appropriate cases the
    appellate court is not precluded from itself directing that a new
    trial be had. See Weade v. Dichmann, Wright & Pugh, Inc., 337 U.S.
    801, 69 S.Ct. 1326, 93 L.Ed. 1704 (1949). Nor is it precluded in
    proper cases from remanding the case for a determination by the
    trial court as to whether a new trial should be granted. The latter
    course is advisable where the grounds urged are suitable for the
    exercise of trial court discretion.
      Subdivision (d) does not attempt a regulation of all aspects of
    the procedure where the motion for judgment n.o.v. and any
    accompanying motion for a new trial are denied, since the problems
    have not been fully canvassed in the decisions and the procedure is
    in some respects still in a formative stage. It is, however,
    designed to give guidance on certain important features of the
    practice.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The revision of this subdivision aims to
    facilitate the exercise by the court of its responsibility to
    assure the fidelity of its judgment to the controlling law, a
    responsibility imposed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth
    Amendment. Cf. Galloway v. United States, 319 U.S. 372 (1943).
      The revision abandons the familiar terminology of direction of
    verdict for several reasons. The term is misleading as a
    description of the relationship between judge and jury. It is also
    freighted with anachronisms some of which are the subject of the
    text of former subdivision (a) of this rule that is deleted in this
    revision. Thus, it should not be necessary to state in the text of
    this rule that a motion made pursuant to it is not a waiver of the
    right to jury trial, and only the antiquities of directed verdict
    practice suggest that it might have been. The term "judgment as a
    matter of law" is an almost equally familiar term and appears in
    the text of Rule 56; its use in Rule 50 calls attention to the
    relationship between the two rules. Finally, the change enables the
    rule to refer to preverdict and post-verdict motions with a
    terminology that does not conceal the common identity of two
    motions made at different times in the proceeding.
      If a motion is denominated a motion for directed verdict or for
    judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the party's error is merely
    formal. Such a motion should be treated as a motion for judgment as
    a matter of law in accordance with this rule.
      Paragraph (a)(1) articulates the standard for the granting of a
    motion for judgment as a matter of law. It effects no change in the
    existing standard. That existing standard was not expressed in the
    former rule, but was articulated in long-standing case law. See
    generally Cooper, Directions for Directed Verdicts: A Compass for
    Federal Courts, 55 MINN. L. REV. 903 (1971). The expressed standard
    makes clear that action taken under the rule is a performance of
    the court's duty to assure enforcement of the controlling law and
    is not an intrusion on any responsibility for factual
    determinations conferred on the jury by the Seventh Amendment or
    any other provision of federal law. Because this standard is also
    used as a reference point for entry of summary judgment under
    56(a), it serves to link the two related provisions.
      The revision authorizes the court to perform its duty to enter
    judgment as a matter of law at any time during the trial, as soon
    as it is apparent that either party is unable to carry a burden of
    proof that is essential to that party's case. Thus, the second
    sentence of paragraph (a)(1) authorizes the court to consider a
    motion for judgment as a matter of law as soon as a party has
    completed a presentation on a fact essential to that party's case.
    Such early action is appropriate when economy and expedition will
    be served. In no event, however, should the court enter judgment
    against a party who has not been apprised of the materiality of the
    dispositive fact and been afforded an opportunity to present any
    available evidence bearing on that fact. In order further to
    facilitate the exercise of the authority provided by this rule,
    Rule 16 is also revised to encourage the court to schedule an order
    of trial that proceeds first with a presentation on an issue that
    is likely to be dispositive, if such an issue is identified in the
    course of pretrial. Such scheduling can be appropriate where the
    court is uncertain whether favorable action should be taken under
    Rule 56. Thus, the revision affords the court the alternative of
    denying a motion for summary judgment while scheduling a separate
    trial of the issue under Rule 42(b) or scheduling the trial to
    begin with a presentation on that essential fact which the opposing
    party seems unlikely to be able to maintain.
      Paragraph (a)(2) retains the requirement that a motion for
    judgment be made prior to the close of the trial, subject to
    renewal after a jury verdict has been rendered. The purpose of this
    requirement is to assure the responding party an opportunity to
    cure any deficiency in that party's proof that may have been
    overlooked until called to the party's attention by a late motion
    for judgment. Cf. Farley Transp. Co. v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co.,
    786 F.2d 1342 (9th Cir. 1986) ("If the moving party is then
    permitted to make a later attack on the evidence through a motion
    for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or an appeal, the opposing
    party may be prejudiced by having lost the opportunity to present
    additional evidence before the case was submitted to the jury");
    Benson v. Allphin, 786 F.2d 268 (7th Cir. 1986) ("the motion for
    directed verdict at the close of all the evidence provides the
    nonmovant an opportunity to do what he can to remedy the
    deficiencies in his case . . .); McLaughlin v. The Fellows Gear
    Shaper Co., 4 F.R.Serv. 3d 607 (3d Cir. 1986) (per Adams, J.,
    dissenting: "This Rule serves important practical purposes in
    ensuring that neither party is precluded from presenting the most
    persuasive case possible and in preventing unfair surprise after a
    matter has been submitted to the jury"). At one time, this
    requirement was held to be of constitutional stature, being
    compelled by the Seventh Amendment. Cf. Slocum v. New York
    Insurance Co., 228 U.S. 364 (1913). But cf. Baltimore & Carolina
    Line v. Redman, 295 U.S. 654 (1935).
      The second sentence of paragraph (a)(2) does impose a requirement
    that the moving party articulate the basis on which a judgment as a
    matter of law might be rendered. The articulation is necessary to
    achieve the purpose of the requirement that the motion be made
    before the case is submitted to the jury, so that the responding
    party may seek to correct any overlooked deficiencies in the proof.
    The revision thus alters the result in cases in which courts have
    used various techniques to avoid the requirement that a motion for
    a directed verdict be made as a predicate to a motion for judgment
    notwithstanding the verdict. E.g., Benson v. Allphin, 788 F.2d 268
    (7th cir. 1986) ("this circuit has allowed something less than a
    formal motion for directed verdict to preserve a party's right to
    move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict"). See generally 9
    WRIGHT & MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE Sec. 2537 (1971 and
    Supp.). The information required with the motion may be supplied by
    explicit reference to materials and argument previously supplied to
    the court.
      This subdivision deals only with the entry of judgment and not
    with the resolution of particular factual issues as a matter of
    law. The court may, as before, properly refuse to instruct a jury
    to decide an issue if a reasonable jury could on the evidence
    presented decide that issue in only one way.
      Subdivision (b). This provision retains the concept of the former
    rule that the post-verdict motion is a renewal of an earlier motion
    made at the close of the evidence. One purpose of this concept was
    to avoid any question arising under the Seventh Amendment.
    Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Duncan, 311 U.S. 243 (1940). It remains
    useful as a means of defining the appropriate issue posed by the
    post-verdict motion. A post-trial motion for judgment can be
    granted only on grounds advanced in the pre-verdict motion. E.g.,
    Kutner Buick, Inc. v. American Motors Corp., 848 F.2d 614 (3d cir.
    1989).
      Often it appears to the court or to the moving party that a
    motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of the
    evidence should be reserved for a post-verdict decision. This is so
    because a jury verdict for the moving party moots the issue and
    because a pre-verdict ruling gambles that a reversal may result in
    a new trial that might have been avoided. For these reasons, the
    court may often wisely decline to rule on a motion for judgment as
    a matter of law made at the close of the evidence, and it is not
    inappropriate for the moving party to suggest such a postponement
    of the ruling until after the verdict has been rendered.
      In ruling on such a motion, the court should disregard any jury
    determination for which there is no legally sufficient evidentiary
    basis enabling a reasonable jury to make it. The court may then
    decide such issues as a matter of law and enter judgment if all
    other material issues have been decided by the jury on the basis of
    legally sufficient evidence, or by the court as a matter of law.
      The revised rule is intended for use in this manner with Rule 49.
    Thus, the court may combine facts established as a matter of law
    either before trial under Rule 56 or at trial on the basis of the
    evidence presented with other facts determined by the jury under
    instructions provided under Rule 49 to support a proper judgment
    under this rule.
      This provision also retains the former requirement that a post-
    trial motion under the rule must be made within 10 days after
    entry of a contrary judgment. The renewed motion must be served and
    filed as provided by Rule 5. A purpose of this requirement is to
    meet the requirements of F.R.App.P. 4(a)(4).
      Subdivision (c). Revision of this subdivision conforms the
    language to the change in diction set forth in subdivision (a) of
    this revised rule.
      Subdivision (d). Revision of this subdivision conforms the
    language to that of the previous subdivisions.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      This technical amendment corrects an ambiguity in the text of the
    1991 revision of the rule, which, as indicated in the Notes, was
    not intended to change the existing standards under which "directed
    verdicts" could be granted. This amendment makes clear that
    judgments as a matter of law in jury trials may be entered against
    both plaintiffs and defendants and with respect to issues or
    defenses that may not be wholly dispositive of a claim or defense.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1995 AMENDMENT       
      The only change, other than stylistic, intended by this revision
    is to prescribe a uniform explicit time for filing of post-judgment
    motions under this rule - no later than 10 days after entry of the
    judgment. Previously, there was an inconsistency in the wording of
    Rules 50, 52, and 59 with respect to whether certain post-judgment
    motions had to be filed, or merely served, during that period. This
    inconsistency caused special problems when motions for a new trial
    were joined with other post-judgment motions. These motions affect
    the finality of the judgment, a matter often of importance to third
    persons as well as the parties and the court. The Committee
    believes that each of these rules should be revised to require
    filing before end of the 10-day period. Filing is an event that can
    be determined with certainty from court records. The phrase "no
    later than" is used - rather than "within" - to include post-
    judgment motions that sometimes are filed before actual entry of
    the judgment by the clerk. It should be noted that under Rule 6(a)
    Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are excluded in measuring
    the 10-day period, and that under Rule 5 the motions when filed are
    to contain a certificate of service on other parties.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 50(a) has been amended as part of the
    general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily
    understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout
    the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Rule 50(b) is amended to permit renewal of any Rule 50(a) motion
    for judgment as a matter of law, deleting the requirement that a
    motion be made at the close of all the evidence. Because the Rule
    50(b) motion is only a renewal of the preverdict motion, it can be
    granted only on grounds advanced in the preverdict motion. The
    earlier motion informs the opposing party of the challenge to the
    sufficiency of the evidence and affords a clear opportunity to
    provide additional evidence that may be available. The earlier
    motion also alerts the court to the opportunity to simplify the
    trial by resolving some issues, or even all issues, without
    submission to the jury. This fulfillment of the functional needs
    that underlie present Rule 50(b) also satisfies the Seventh
    Amendment. Automatic reservation of the legal questions raised by
    the motion conforms to the decision in Baltimore & Carolina Line v.
    Redman, 297 U.S. 654 (1935).
      This change responds to many decisions that have begun to move
    away from requiring a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the
    literal close of all the evidence. Although the requirement has
    been clearly established for several decades, lawyers continue to
    overlook it. The courts are slowly working away from the formal
    requirement. The amendment establishes the functional approach that
    courts have been unable to reach under the present rule and makes
    practice more consistent and predictable.
      Many judges expressly invite motions at the close of all the
    evidence. The amendment is not intended to discourage this useful
    practice.
      Finally, an explicit time limit is added for making a posttrial
    motion when the trial ends without a verdict or with a verdict that
    does not dispose of all issues suitable for resolution by verdict.
    The motion must be made no later than 10 days after the jury was
    discharged.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. This recommendation
    modifies the version of the proposal as published. The only changes
    made in the rule text after publication are matters of style. One
    sentence in the Committee Note was changed by adopting the wording
    of the 1991 Committee Note describing the grounds that may be used
    to support a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law. A
    paragraph also was added to the Committee Note to explain the style
    revisions in subdivision (a). The changes from the published rule
    text are set out below. [Omitted]

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 50 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Former Rule 50(b) stated that the court reserves ruling on a
    motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of all the
    evidence "[i]f, for any reason, the court does not grant" the
    motion. The words "for any reason" reflected the proposition that
    the reservation is automatic and inescapable. The ruling is
    reserved even if the court explicitly denies the motion. The same
    result follows under the amended rule. If the motion is not
    granted, the ruling is reserved.
      Amended Rule 50(e) identifies the appellate court's authority to
    direct the entry of judgment. This authority was not described in
    former Rule 50(d), but was recognized in Weisgram v. Marley Co.,
    528 U.S. 440 (2000), and in Neely v. Martin K. Eby Construction
    Company, 386 U.S. 317 (1967). When Rule 50(d) was drafted in 1963,
    the Committee Note stated that "[s]ubdivision (d) does not attempt
    a regulation of all aspects of the procedure where the motion for
    judgment n.o.v. and any accompanying motion for a new trial are
    denied * * *." Express recognition of the authority to direct entry
    of judgment does not otherwise supersede this caution.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Former Rules 50, 52, and 59 adopted 10-day periods for their
    respective post-judgment motions. Rule 6(b) prohibits any expansion
    of those periods. Experience has proved that in many cases it is
    not possible to prepare a satisfactory post-judgment motion in 10
    days, even under the former rule that excluded intermediate
    Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. These time periods are
    particularly sensitive because Appellate Rule 4 integrates the time
    to appeal with a timely motion under these rules. Rather than
    introduce the prospect of uncertainty in appeal time by amending
    Rule 6(b) to permit additional time, the former 10-day periods are
    expanded to 28 days. Rule 6(b) continues to prohibit expansion of
    the 28-day period.
      Changes Made after Publication and Comment. The 30-day period
    proposed in the August 2007 publication is shortened to 28 days.

-HEAD-
    Rule 51. Instructions to the Jury; Objections; Preserving a Claim
      of Error

-STATUTE-
      (a) Requests.
        (1) Before or at the Close of the Evidence. At the close of the
      evidence or at any earlier reasonable time that the court orders,
      a party may file and furnish to every other party written
      requests for the jury instructions it wants the court to give.
        (2) After the Close of the Evidence. After the close of the
      evidence, a party may:
          (A) file requests for instructions on issues that could not
        reasonably have been anticipated by an earlier time that the
        court set for requests; and
          (B) with the court's permission, file untimely requests for
        instructions on any issue.

      (b) Instructions. The court:
        (1) must inform the parties of its proposed instructions and
      proposed action on the requests before instructing the jury and
      before final jury arguments;
        (2) must give the parties an opportunity to object on the
      record and out of the jury's hearing before the instructions and
      arguments are delivered; and
        (3) may instruct the jury at any time before the jury is
      discharged.

      (c) Objections.
        (1) How to Make. A party who objects to an instruction or the
      failure to give an instruction must do so on the record, stating
      distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the
      objection.
        (2) When to Make. An objection is timely if:
          (A) a party objects at the opportunity provided under Rule
        51(b)(2); or
          (B) a party was not informed of an instruction or action on a
        request before that opportunity to object, and the party
        objects promptly after learning that the instruction or request
        will be, or has been, given or refused.

      (d) Assigning Error; Plain Error.
        (1) Assigning Error. A party may assign as error:
          (A) an error in an instruction actually given, if that party
        properly objected; or
          (B) a failure to give an instruction, if that party properly
        requested it and - unless the court rejected the request in a
        definitive ruling on the record - also properly objected.

        (2) Plain Error. A court may consider a plain error in the
      instructions that has not been preserved as required by Rule
      51(d)(1) if the error affects substantial rights.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      Supreme Court Rule 8 requires exceptions to the charge of the
    court to the jury which shall distinctly state the several matters
    of law in the charge to which exception is taken. Similar
    provisions appear in the rules of the various Circuit Courts of
    Appeals.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Although Rule 51 in its present form specifies that the court
    shall instruct the jury only after the arguments of the parties are
    completed, in some districts (typically those in states where the
    practice is otherwise) it is common for the parties to stipulate to
    instruction before the arguments. The purpose of the amendment is
    to give the court discretion to instruct the jury either before or
    after argument. Thus, the rule as revised will permit resort to the
    long-standing federal practice or to an alternative procedure,
    which has been praised because it gives counsel the opportunity to
    explain the instructions, argue their application to the facts and
    thereby give the jury the maximum assistance in determining the
    issues and arriving at a good verdict on the law and the evidence.
    As an ancillary benefit, this approach aids counsel by supplying a
    natural outline so that arguments may be directed to the essential
    fact issues which the jury must decide. See generally Raymond,
    Merits and Demerits of the Missouri System of Instructing Juries, 5
    St. Louis U.L.J. 317 (1959). Moreover, if the court instructs
    before an argument, counsel then know the precise words the court
    has chosen and need not speculate as to the words the court will
    later use in its instructions. Finally, by instructing ahead of
    argument the court has the attention of the jurors when they are
    fresh and can given their full attention to the court's
    instructions. It is more difficult to hold the attention of jurors
    after lengthy arguments.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 51 is revised to capture many of the interpretations that
    have emerged in practice. The revisions in text will make uniform
    the conclusions reached by a majority of decisions on each point.
    Additions also are made to cover some practices that cannot now be
    anchored in the text of Rule 51.
      Scope. Rule 51 governs instructions to the trial jury on the law
    that governs the verdict. A variety of other instructions cannot
    practicably be brought within Rule 51. Among these instructions are
    preliminary instructions to a venire, and cautionary or limiting
    instructions delivered in immediate response to events at trial.
      Requests. Subdivision (a) governs requests. Apart from the plain
    error doctrine recognized in subdivision (d)(2), a court is not
    obliged to instruct the jury on issues raised by the evidence
    unless a party requests an instruction. The revised rule recognizes
    the court's authority to direct that requests be submitted before
    trial.
      The close-of-the-evidence deadline may come before trial is
    completed on all potential issues. Trial may be formally bifurcated
    or may be sequenced in some less formal manner. The close of the
    evidence is measured by the occurrence of two events: completion of
    all intended evidence on an identified phase of the trial and
    impending submission to the jury with instructions.
      The risk in directing a pretrial request deadline is that trial
    evidence may raise new issues or reshape issues the parties thought
    they had understood. Courts need not insist on pretrial requests in
    all cases. Even if the request time is set before trial or early in
    the trial, subdivision (a)(2)(A) permits requests after the close
    of the evidence to address issues that could not reasonably have
    been anticipated at the earlier time for requests set by the court.
      Subdivision (a)(2)(B) expressly recognizes the court's discretion
    to act on an untimely request. The most important consideration in
    exercising the discretion confirmed by subdivision (a)(2)(B) is the
    importance of the issue to the case - the closer the issue lies to
    the "plain error" that would be recognized under subdivision
    (d)(2), the better the reason to give an instruction. The cogency
    of the reason for failing to make a timely request also should be
    considered. To be considered under subdivision (a)(2)(B) a request
    should be made before final instructions and before final jury
    arguments. What is a "final" instruction and argument depends on
    the sequence of submitting the case to the jury. If separate
    portions of the case are submitted to the jury in sequence, the
    final arguments and final instructions are those made on submitting
    to the jury the portion of the case addressed by the arguments and
    instructions.
      Instructions. Subdivision (b)(1) requires the court to inform the
    parties, before instructing the jury and before final jury
    arguments related to the instruction, of the proposed instructions
    as well as the proposed action on instruction requests. The time
    limit is addressed to final jury arguments to reflect the practice
    that allows interim arguments during trial in complex cases; it may
    not be feasible to develop final instructions before such interim
    arguments. It is enough that counsel know of the intended
    instructions before making final arguments addressed to the issue.
    If the trial is sequenced or bifurcated, the final arguments
    addressed to an issue may occur before the close of the entire
    trial.
      Subdivision (b)(2) complements subdivision (b)(1) by carrying
    forward the opportunity to object established by present Rule 51.
    It makes explicit the opportunity to object on the record, ensuring
    a clear memorial of the objection.
      Subdivision (b)(3) reflects common practice by authorizing
    instructions at any time after trial begins and before the jury is
    discharged.
      Objections. Subdivision (c) states the right to object to an
    instruction or the failure to give an instruction. It carries
    forward the formula of present Rule 51 requiring that the objection
    state distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the
    objection, and makes explicit the requirement that the objection be
    made on the record. The provisions on the time to object make clear
    that it is timely to object promptly after learning of an
    instruction or action on a request when the court has not provided
    advance information as required by subdivision (b)(1). The need to
    repeat a request by way of objection is continued by new
    subdivision (d)(1)(B) except where the court made a definitive
    ruling on the record.
      Preserving a claim of error and plain error. Many cases hold that
    a proper request for a jury instruction is not alone enough to
    preserve the right to appeal failure to give the instruction. The
    request must be renewed by objection. This doctrine is appropriate
    when the court may not have sufficiently focused on the request, or
    may believe that the request has been granted in substance although
    in different words. But this doctrine may also prove a trap for the
    unwary who fail to add an objection after the court has made it
    clear that the request has been considered and rejected on the
    merits. Subdivision (d)(1)(B) establishes authority to review the
    failure to grant a timely request, despite a failure to add an
    objection, when the court has made a definitive ruling on the
    record rejecting the request.
      Many circuits have recognized that an error not preserved under
    Rule 51 may be reviewed in exceptional circumstances. The language
    adopted to capture these decisions in subdivision (d)(2) is
    borrowed from Criminal Rule 52. Although the language is the same,
    the context of civil litigation often differs from the context of
    criminal prosecution; actual application of the plain-error
    standard takes account of the differences. The Supreme Court has
    summarized application of Criminal Rule 52 as involving four
    elements: (1) there must be an error; (2) the error must be plain;
    (3) the error must affect substantial rights; and (4) the error
    must seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation
    of judicial proceedings. Johnson v. U.S., 520 U.S. 461, 466-467,
    469-470 (1997). (The Johnson case quoted the fourth element from
    its decision in a civil action, U.S. v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157, 160
    (1936): "In exceptional circumstances, especially in criminal
    cases, appellate courts, in the public interest, may, of their own
    motion, notice errors to which no exception has been taken, if the
    errors are obvious, or if they otherwise substantially affect the
    fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial
    proceedings.")
      The court's duty to give correct jury instructions in a civil
    action is shaped by at least four factors.
      The factor most directly implied by a "plain" error rule is the
    obviousness of the mistake. The importance of the error is a second
    major factor. The costs of correcting an error reflect a third
    factor that is affected by a variety of circumstances. In a case
    that seems close to the fundamental error line, account also may be
    taken of the impact a verdict may have on nonparties.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. The changes made
    after publication and comment are indicated by double-underlining
    and overstriking on the texts that were published in August 2001.
      Rule 51(d) was revised to conform the plain-error provision to
    the approach taken in Criminal Rule 52(b). The Note was revised as
    described in the Recommendation.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 51 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE VI. TRIALS

-HEAD-
    Rule 52. Findings and Conclusions by the Court; Judgment on Partial
      Findings

-STATUTE-
      (a) Findings and Conclusions.
        (1) In General. In an action tried on the facts without a jury
      or with an advisory jury, the court must find the facts specially
      and state its conclusions of law separately. The findings and
      conclusions may be stated on the record after the close of the
      evidence or may appear in an opinion or a memorandum of decision
      filed by the court. Judgment must be entered under Rule 58.
        (2) For an Interlocutory Injunction. In granting or refusing an
      interlocutory injunction, the court must similarly state the
      findings and conclusions that support its action.
        (3) For a Motion. The court is not required to state findings
      or conclusions when ruling on a motion under Rule 12 or 56 or,
      unless these rules provide otherwise, on any other motion.
        (4) Effect of a Master's Findings. A master's findings, to the
      extent adopted by the court, must be considered the court's
      findings.
        (5) Questioning the Evidentiary Support. A party may later
      question the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the findings,
      whether or not the party requested findings, objected to them,
      moved to amend them, or moved for partial findings.
        (6) Setting Aside the Findings. Findings of fact, whether based
      on oral or other evidence, must not be set aside unless clearly
      erroneous, and the reviewing court must give due regard to the
      trial court's opportunity to judge the witnesses' credibility.

      (b) Amended or Additional Findings. On a party's motion filed no
    later than 28 days after the entry of judgment, the court may amend
    its findings - or make additional findings - and may amend the
    judgment accordingly. The motion may accompany a motion for a new
    trial under Rule 59.
      (c) Judgment on Partial Findings. If a party has been fully heard
    on an issue during a nonjury trial and the court finds against the
    party on that issue, the court may enter judgment against the party
    on a claim or defense that, under the controlling law, can be
    maintained or defeated only with a favorable finding on that issue.
    The court may, however, decline to render any judgment until the
    close of the evidence. A judgment on partial findings must be
    supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by
    Rule 52(a).

    of issues of fact; by court) and [former] 875 (Review in cases
    tried without a jury) are superseded insofar as they provide a
    different method of finding facts and a different method of
    appellate review. The rule stated in the third sentence of
    Subdivision (a) accords with the decisions on the scope of the
    review in modern federal equity practice. It is applicable to all
    classes of findings in cases tried without a jury whether the
    finding is of a fact concerning which there was conflict of
    testimony, or of a fact deduced or inferred from uncontradicted
    testimony. See Silver King Coalition Mines, Co. v. Silver King

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The amended rule makes clear that the
    requirement for findings of fact and conclusions of law thereon
    applies in a case with an advisory jury. This removes an ambiguity
    in the rule as originally stated, but carries into effect what has
    been considered its intent. 3 Moore's Federal Practice (1938) 3119;
    Hurwitz v. Hurwitz (App.D.C. 1943) 136 F.(2d) 796.
      The two sentences added at the end of Rule 52(a) eliminate
    certain difficulties which have arisen concerning findings and
    conclusions. The first of the two sentences permits findings of
    fact and conclusions of law to appear in an opinion or memorandum
    of decision. See, e.g., United States v. One 1941 Ford Sedan
    (S.D.Tex. 1946) 65 F.Supp. 84. Under original Rule 52(a) some
    courts have expressed the view that findings and conclusions could
    not be incorporated in an opinion. Detective Comics, Inc. v. Bruns
    Publications (S.D.N.Y. 1939) 28 F.Supp. 399; Pennsylvania Co. for
    Insurance on Lives & Granting Annuities v. Cincinnati & L. E. R.

    F.Supp. 161; Green Valley Creamery, Inc. v. United States
    (C.C.A.1st, 1939) 108 F.(2d) 342. See also Matton Oil Transfer
    Corp. v. The Dynamic (C.C.A.2d, 1941) 123 F.(2d) 999; Carter Coal

    Findings of fact aid in the process of judgment and in defining for
    future cases the precise limitations of the issues and the
    determination thereon. Thus they not only aid the appellate court
    on review (Hurwitz v. Hurwitz (App.D.C. 1943) 136 F.(2d) 796) but
    they are an important factor in the proper application of the
    doctrines of res judicata and estoppel by judgment. Nordbye,
    Improvements in Statement of Findings of Fact and Conclusions of
    Law, 1 F.R.D. 25, 26-27; United States v. Forness (C.C.A.2d, 1942)
    125 F.(2d) 928, cert. den. (1942) 316 U.S. 694. These findings
    should represent the judge's own determination and not the long,
    often argumentative statements of successful counsel. United States
    v. Forness, supra; United States v. Crescent Amusement Co. (1944)
    323 U.S. 173. Consequently, they should be a part of the judge's
    opinion and decision, either stated therein or stated separately.
    Matton Oil Transfer Corp. v. The Dynamic, supra. But the judge need
    only make brief, definite, pertinent findings and conclusions upon
    the contested matters; there is no necessity for over-elaboration
    of detail or particularization of facts. United States v. Forness,
    supra; United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., supra. See also

    other grounds (1945) 325 U.S. 797; Young v. Murphy (N.D.Ohio 1946)
    9 Fed.Rules Serv. 52a.11, Case 2.
      The last sentence of Rule 52(a) as amended will remove any doubt
    that findings and conclusions are unnecessary upon decision of a
    motion, particularly one under Rule 12 or Rule 56, except as
    provided in amended Rule 41(b). As so holding, see Thomas v. Peyser
    (App.D.C. 1941) 118 F.(2d) 369; Schad v. Twentieth Century-Fox
    Corp. (C.C.A.3d, 1943) 136 F.(2d) 991; Prudential Ins. Co. of
    America v. Goldstein (E.D.N.Y. 1942) 43 F.Supp. 767; Somers Coal

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      This amendment conforms to the amendment of Rule 58. See the
    Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 58, as amended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 52(a) has been amended to revise its penultimate sentence to
    provide explicitly that the district judge may make the findings of
    fact and conclusions of law required in nonjury cases orally.
    Nothing in the prior text of the rule forbids this practice, which
    is widely utilized by district judges. See Christensen, A Modest
    Proposal for Immeasurable Improvement, 64 A.B.A.J. 693 (1978). The
    objective is to lighten the burden on the trial court in preparing
    findings in nonjury cases. In addition, the amendment should reduce
    the number of published district court opinions that embrace
    written findings.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1985 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 52(a) has been amended (1) to avoid continued confusion and
    conflicts among the circuits as to the standard of appellate review
    of findings of fact by the court, (2) to eliminate the disparity
    between the standard of review as literally stated in Rule 52(a)
    and the practice of some courts of appeals, and (3) to promote
    nationwide uniformity. See Note, Rule 52(a): Appellate Review of
    Findings of Fact Based on Documentary or Undisputed Evidence, 49
    Va. L. Rev. 506, 536 (1963).
      Some courts of appeal have stated that when a trial court's
    findings do not rest on demeanor evidence and evaluation of a
    witness' credibility, there is no reason to defer to the trial
    court's findings and the appellate court more readily can find them
    to be clearly erroneous. See, e.g., Marcum v. United States, 621
    F.2d 142, 144-45 (5th Cir. 1980). Others go further, holding that
    appellate review may be had without application of the "clearly
    erroneous" test since the appellate court is in as good a position
    as the trial court to review a purely documentary record. See,
    e.g., Atari, Inc. v. North American Philips Consumer Electronics
    Corp., 672 F.2d 607, 614 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 880
    (1982); Lydle v. United States, 635 F.2d 763, 765 n. 1 (6th Cir.
    1981); Swanson v. Baker Indus., Inc., 615 F.2d 479, 483 (8th Cir.
    1980); Taylor v. Lombard, 606 F.2d 371, 372 (2d Cir. 1979), cert.
    denied, 445 U.S. 946 (1980); Jack Kahn Music Co. v. Baldwin Piano &
    Organ Co., 604 F.2d 755, 758 (2d Cir. 1979); John R. Thompson Co.
    v. United States, 477 F.2d 164, 167 (7th Cir. 1973).
      A third group has adopted the view that the "clearly erroneous"
    rule applies in all nonjury cases even when findings are based
    solely on documentary evidence or on inferences from undisputed
    facts. See, e.g., Maxwell v. Sumner, 673 F.2d 1031, 1036 (9th
    Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 976 (1982); United States v. Texas
    Education Agency, 647 F.2d 504, 506-07 (5th Cir. 1981), cert.
    denied, 454 U.S. 1143 (1982); Constructora Maza, Inc. v. Banco de
    Ponce, 616 F.2d 573, 576 (1st Cir. 1980); In re Sierra Trading
    Corp., 482 F.2d 333, 337 (10th Cir. 1973); Case v. Morrisette, 475
    F.2d 1300, 1306-07 (D.C. Cir. 1973).
      The commentators also disagree as to the proper interpretation of
    the Rule. Compare Wright, The Doubtful Omniscience of Appellate
    Courts, 41 Minn. L. Rev. 751, 769-70 (1957) (language and intent of
    Rule support view that "clearly erroneous" test should apply to all
    forms of evidence), and 9 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice
    and Procedure: Civil Sec. 2587, at 740 (1971) (language of the Rule
    is clear), with 5A J. Moore, Federal Practice &#182; 52.04, 2687-88
    (2d ed. 1982) (Rule as written supports broader review of findings
    based on non-demeanor testimony).
      The Supreme Court has not clearly resolved the issue. See, Bose
    Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 104
    S. Ct. 1949, 1958 (1984); Pullman Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273,
    293 (1982); United States v. General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 127,
    141 n. 16 (1966); United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333
    U.S. 364, 394-96 (1948).
      The principal argument advanced in favor of a more searching
    appellate review of findings by the district court based solely on
    documentary evidence is that the rationale of Rule 52(a) does not
    apply when the findings do not rest on the trial court's assessment
    of credibility of the witnesses but on an evaluation of documentary
    proof and the drawing of inferences from it, thus eliminating the
    need for any special deference to the trial court's findings. These
    considerations are outweighed by the public interest in the
    stability and judicial economy that would be promoted by
    recognizing that the trial court, not the appellate tribunal,
    should be the finder of the facts. To permit courts of appeals to
    share more actively in the fact-finding function would tend to
    undermine the legitimacy of the district courts in the eyes of
    litigants, multiply appeals by encouraging appellate retrial of
    some factual issues, and needlessly reallocate judicial authority.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (c) is added. It parallels the revised Rule 50(a),
    but is applicable to non-jury trials. It authorizes the court to
    enter judgment at any time that it can appropriately make a
    dispositive finding of fact on the evidence.
      The new subdivision replaces part of Rule 41(b), which formerly
    authorized a dismissal at the close of the plaintiff's case if the
    plaintiff had failed to carry an essential burden of proof.
    Accordingly, the reference to Rule 41 formerly made in subdivision
    (a) of this rule is deleted.
      As under the former Rule 41(b), the court retains discretion to
    enter no judgment prior to the close of the evidence.
      Judgment entered under this rule differs from a summary judgment
    under Rule 56 in the nature of the evaluation made by the court. A
    judgment on partial findings is made after the court has heard all
    the evidence bearing on the crucial issue of fact, and the finding
    is reversible only if the appellate court finds it to be "clearly
    erroneous." A summary judgment, in contrast, is made on the basis
    of facts established on account of the absence of contrary evidence
    or presumptions; such establishments of fact are rulings on
    questions of law as provided in Rule 56(a) and are not shielded by
    the "clear error" standard of review.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      This technical amendment corrects an ambiguity in the text of the
    1991 revision of the rule, similar to the revision being made to
    Rule 50. This amendment makes clear that judgments as a matter of
    law in nonjury trials may be entered against both plaintiffs and
    defendants and with respect to issues or defenses that may not be
    wholly dispositive of a claim or defense.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1995 AMENDMENT       
      The only change, other than stylistic, intended by this revision
    is to require that any motion to amend or add findings after a
    nonjury trial must be filed no later than 10 days after entry of
    the judgment. Previously, there was an inconsistency in the wording
    of Rules 50, 52, and 59 with respect to whether certain post-
    judgment motions had to be filed, or merely served, during that
    period. This inconsistency caused special problems when motions for
    a new trial were joined with other post-judgment motions. These
    motions affect the finality of the judgment, a matter often of
    importance to third persons as well as the parties and the court.
    The Committee believes that each of these rules should be revised
    to require filing before end of the 10-day period. Filing is an
    event that can be determined with certainty from court records. The
    phrase "no later than" is used - rather than "within" - to include
    post-judgment motions that sometimes are filed before actual entry
    of the judgment by the clerk. It should be noted that under Rule
    6(a) Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are excluded in
    measuring the 10-day period, and that under Rule 5 the motions when
    filed are to contain a certificate of service on other parties.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 52 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Former Rule 52(a) said that findings are unnecessary on decisions
    of motions "except as provided in subdivision (c) of this rule."
    Amended Rule 52(a)(3) says that findings are unnecessary "unless
    these rules provide otherwise." This change reflects provisions in
    other rules that require Rule 52 findings on deciding motions.
    Rules 23(e), 23(h), and 54(d)(2)(C) are examples.
      Amended Rule 52(a)(5) includes provisions that appeared in former
    Rule 52(a) and 52(b). Rule 52(a) provided that requests for
    findings are not necessary for purposes of review. It applied both
    in an action tried on the facts without a jury and also in granting
    or refusing an interlocutory injunction. Rule 52(b), applicable to
    findings "made in actions tried without a jury," provided that the
    sufficiency of the evidence might be "later questioned whether or
    not in the district court the party raising the question objected
    to the findings, moved to amend them, or moved for partial
    findings." Former Rule 52(b) did not explicitly apply to decisions
    granting or refusing an interlocutory injunction. Amended Rule
    52(a)(5) makes explicit the application of this part of former Rule
    52(b) to interlocutory injunction decisions.
      Former Rule 52(c) provided for judgment on partial findings, and
    referred to it as "judgment as a matter of law." Amended Rule 52(c)
    refers only to "judgment," to avoid any confusion with a Rule 50
    judgment as a matter of law in a jury case. The standards that
    govern judgment as a matter of law in a jury case have no bearing
    on a decision under Rule 52(c).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Former Rules 50, 52, and 59 adopted 10-day periods for their
    respective post-judgment motions. Rule 6(b) prohibits any expansion
    of those periods. Experience has proved that in many cases it is
    not possible to prepare a satisfactory post-judgment motion in 10
    days, even under the former rule that excluded intermediate
    Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. These time periods are
    particularly sensitive because Appellate Rule 4 integrates the time
    to appeal with a timely motion under these rules. Rather than
    introduce the prospect of uncertainty in appeal time by amending
    Rule 6(b) to permit additional time, the former 10-day periods are
    expanded to 28 days. Rule 6(b) continues to prohibit expansion of
    the 28-day period.
      Changes Made after Publication and Comment. The 30-day period
    proposed in the August 2007 publication is shortened to 28 days.

-HEAD-
    Rule 53. Masters

-STATUTE-
      (a) Appointment.
        (1) Scope. Unless a statute provides otherwise, a court may
      appoint a master only to:
          (A) perform duties consented to by the parties;
          (B) hold trial proceedings and make or recommend findings of
        fact on issues to be decided without a jury if appointment is
        warranted by:
            (i) some exceptional condition; or
            (ii) the need to perform an accounting or resolve a
          difficult computation of damages; or

          (C) address pretrial and posttrial matters that cannot be
        effectively and timely addressed by an available district judge
        or magistrate judge of the district.

        (2) Disqualification. A master must not have a relationship to
      the parties, attorneys, action, or court that would require
      disqualification of a judge under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 455, unless the
      parties, with the court's approval, consent to the appointment
      after the master discloses any potential grounds for
      disqualification.
        (3) Possible Expense or Delay. In appointing a master, the
      court must consider the fairness of imposing the likely expenses
      on the parties and must protect against unreasonable expense or
      delay.

      (b) Order Appointing a Master.
        (1) Notice. Before appointing a master, the court must give the
      parties notice and an opportunity to be heard. Any party may
      suggest candidates for appointment.
        (2) Contents. The appointing order must direct the master to
      proceed with all reasonable diligence and must state:
          (A) the master's duties, including any investigation or
        enforcement duties, and any limits on the master's authority
        under Rule 53(c);
          (B) the circumstances, if any, in which the master may
        communicate ex parte with the court or a party;
          (C) the nature of the materials to be preserved and filed as
        the record of the master's activities;
          (D) the time limits, method of filing the record, other
        procedures, and standards for reviewing the master's orders,
        findings, and recommendations; and
          (E) the basis, terms, and procedure for fixing the master's
        compensation under Rule 53(g).

        (3) Issuing. The court may issue the order only after:
          (A) the master files an affidavit disclosing whether there is
        any ground for disqualification under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 455; and
          (B) if a ground is disclosed, the parties, with the court's
        approval, waive the disqualification.

        (4) Amending. The order may be amended at any time after notice
      to the parties and an opportunity to be heard.

      (c) Master's Authority.
        (1) In General. Unless the appointing order directs otherwise,
      a master may:
          (A) regulate all proceedings;
          (B) take all appropriate measures to perform the assigned
        duties fairly and efficiently; and
          (C) if conducting an evidentiary hearing, exercise the
        appointing court's power to compel, take, and record evidence.

        (2) Sanctions. The master may by order impose on a party any
      noncontempt sanction provided by Rule 37 or 45, and may recommend
      a contempt sanction against a party and sanctions against a
      nonparty.

      (d) Master's Orders. A master who issues an order must file it
    and promptly serve a copy on each party. The clerk must enter the
    order on the docket.
      (e) Master's Reports. A master must report to the court as
    required by the appointing order. The master must file the report
    and promptly serve a copy on each party, unless the court orders
    otherwise.
      (f) Action on the Master's Order, Report, or Recommendations.
        (1) Opportunity for a Hearing; Action in General. In acting on
      a master's order, report, or recommendations, the court must give
      the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard; may receive
      evidence; and may adopt or affirm, modify, wholly or partly
      reject or reverse, or resubmit to the master with instructions.
        (2) Time to Object or Move to Adopt or Modify. A party may file
      objections to - or a motion to adopt or modify - the master's
      order, report, or recommendations no later than 21 days after a
      copy is served, unless the court sets a different time.
        (3) Reviewing Factual Findings. The court must decide de novo
      all objections to findings of fact made or recommended by a
      master, unless the parties, with the court's approval, stipulate
      that:
          (A) the findings will be reviewed for clear error; or
          (B) the findings of a master appointed under Rule 53(a)(1)(A)
        or (C) will be final.

        (4) Reviewing Legal Conclusions. The court must decide de novo
      all objections to conclusions of law made or recommended by a
      master.
        (5) Reviewing Procedural Matters. Unless the appointing order
      establishes a different standard of review, the court may set
      aside a master's ruling on a procedural matter only for an abuse
      of discretion.

      (g) Compensation.
        (1) Fixing Compensation. Before or after judgment, the court
      must fix the master's compensation on the basis and terms stated
      in the appointing order, but the court may set a new basis and
      terms after giving notice and an opportunity to be heard.
        (2) Payment. The compensation must be paid either:
          (A) by a party or parties; or
          (B) from a fund or subject matter of the action within the
        court's control.

        (3) Allocating Payment. The court must allocate payment among
      the parties after considering the nature and amount of the
      controversy, the parties' means, and the extent to which any
      party is more responsible than other parties for the reference to
      a master. An interim allocation may be amended to reflect a
      decision on the merits.

      (h) Appointing a Magistrate Judge. A magistrate judge is subject
    to this rule only when the order referring a matter to the
    magistrate judge states that the reference is made under this rule.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      These changes are designed to preserve the admiralty practice
    whereby difficult computations are referred to a commissioner or
    assessor, especially after an interlocutory judgment determining
    liability. As to separation of issues for trial see Rule 42(b).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The creation of full-time magistrates, who serve
    at government expense and have no nonjudicial duties competing for
    their time, eliminates the need to appoint standing masters. Thus
    the prior provision in Rule 53(a) authorizing the appointment of
    standing masters is deleted. Additionally, the definition of
    "master" in subdivision (a) now eliminates the superseded office of
    commissioner.
      The term "special master" is retained in Rule 53 in order to
    maintain conformity with 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(2), authorizing a
    judge to designate a magistrate "to serve as a special master
    pursuant to the applicable provisions of this title and the Federal
    Rules of Civil Procedure for the United States District Courts."
    Obviously, when a magistrate serves as a special master, the
    provisions for compensation of masters are inapplicable, and the
    amendment to subdivision (a) so provides.
      Although the existence of magistrates may make the appointment of
    outside masters unnecessary in many instances, see, e.g., Gautreaux
    v. Chicago Housing Authority, 384 F.Supp. 37 (N.D.Ill. 1974),
    mandamus denied sub nom., Chicago Housing Authority v. Austin, 511
    F.2d 82 (7th Cir. 1975); Avco Corp. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 68
    F.R.D. 532 (S.D. Ohio 1975), such masters may prove useful when
    some special expertise is desired or when a magistrate is
    unavailable for lengthy and detailed supervision of a case.
      Subdivision (b). The provisions of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(2) not
    only permit magistrates to serve as masters under Rule 53(b) but
    also eliminate the exceptional condition requirement of Rule 53(b)
    when the reference is made with the consent of the parties. The
    amendment to subdivision (b) brings Rule 53 into harmony with the
    statute by exempting magistrates, appointed with the consent of the
    parties, from the general requirement that some exceptional
    condition requires the reference. It should be noted that
    subdivision (b) does not address the question, raised in recent
    decisional law and commentary, as to whether the exceptional
    condition requirement is applicable when private masters who are
    not magistrates are appointed with the consent of the parties. See
    Silberman, Masters and Magistrates Part II: The American Analogue,
    50 N.Y.U. L.Rev. 1297, 1354 (1975).
      Subdivision (c). The amendment recognizes the abrogation of
    Federal Rule 43(c) by the Federal Rules of Evidence.
      Subdivision (f). The new subdivision responds to confusion
    flowing from the dual authority for references of pretrial matters
    to magistrates. Such references can be made, with or without the
    consent of the parties, pursuant to Rule 53 or under 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    636(b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B). There are a number of distinctions
    between references made under the statute and under the rule. For
    example, under the statute nondispositive pretrial matters may be
    referred to a magistrate, without consent, for final determination
    with reconsideration by the district judge if the magistrate's
    order is clearly erroneous or contrary to law. Under the rule,
    however, the appointment of a master, without consent of the
    parties, to supervise discovery would require some exceptional
    condition (Rule 53(b)) and would subject the proceedings to the
    report procedures of Rule 53(e). If an order of reference does not
    clearly articulate the source of the court's authority the
    resulting proceedings could be subject to attack on grounds of the
    magistrate's noncompliance with the provisions of Rule 53. This
    subdivision therefore establishes a presumption that the
    limitations of Rule 53 are not applicable unless the reference is
    specifically made subject to Rule 53.
      A magistrate serving as a special master under 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    636(b)(2) is governed by the provisions of Rule 53, with the
    exceptional condition requirement lifted in the case of a
    consensual reference.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      The purpose of the revision is to expedite proceedings before a
    master. The former rule required only a filing of the master's
    report, with the clerk then notifying the parties of the filing. To
    receive a copy, a party would then be required to secure it from
    the clerk. By transmitting directly to the parties, the master can
    save some efforts of counsel. Some local rules have previously
    required such action by the master.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      This revision is made to conform the rule to changes made by the
    Judicial Improvements Act of 1990.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 53 is revised extensively to reflect changing practices in
    using masters. From the beginning in 1938, Rule 53 focused
    primarily on special masters who perform trial functions. Since
    then, however, courts have gained experience with masters appointed
    to perform a variety of pretrial and post-trial functions. See
    Willging, Hooper, Leary, Miletich, Reagan, & Shapard, Special
    Masters' Incidence and Activity (Federal Judicial Center 2000).
    This revised Rule 53 recognizes that in appropriate circumstances
    masters may properly be appointed to perform these functions and
    regulates such appointments. Rule 53 continues to address trial
    masters as well, but permits appointment of a trial master in an
    action to be tried to a jury only if the parties consent. The new
    rule clarifies the provisions that govern the appointment and
    function of masters for all purposes. Rule 53(g) also changes the
    standard of review for findings of fact made or recommended by a
    master. The core of the original Rule 53 remains, including its
    prescription that appointment of a master must be the exception and
    not the rule.
      Special masters are appointed in many circumstances outside the
    Civil Rules. Rule 53 applies only to proceedings that Rule 1 brings
    within its reach.
      Subdivision (a)(1). District judges bear primary responsibility
    for the work of their courts. A master should be appointed only in
    limited circumstances. Subdivision (a)(1) describes three different
    standards, relating to appointments by consent of the parties,
    appointments for trial duties, and appointments for pretrial or
    post-trial duties.
      Consent Masters. Subparagraph (a)(1)(A) authorizes appointment of
    a master with the parties' consent. Party consent does not require
    that the court make the appointment; the court retains unfettered
    discretion to refuse appointment.
      Trial Masters. Use of masters for the core functions of trial has
    been progressively limited. These limits are reflected in the
    provisions of subparagraph (a)(1)(B) that restrict appointments to
    exercise trial functions. The Supreme Court gave clear direction to
    this trend in La Buy v. Howes Leather Co., 352 U.S. 249 (1957);
    earlier roots are sketched in Los Angeles Brush Mfg. Corp. v.
    James, 272 U.S. 701 (1927). As to nonjury trials, this trend has
    developed through elaboration of the "exceptional condition"
    requirement in present Rule 53(b). This phrase is retained, and
    will continue to have the same force as it has developed. Although
    the provision that a reference "shall be the exception and not the
    rule" is deleted, its meaning is embraced for this setting by the
    exceptional condition requirement.
      Subparagraph (a)(1)(B)(ii) carries forward the approach of
    present Rule 53(b), which exempts from the "exceptional condition"
    requirement "matters of account and of difficult computation of
    damages." This approach is justified only as to essentially
    ministerial determinations that require mastery of much detailed
    information but that do not require extensive determinations of
    credibility. Evaluations of witness credibility should only be
    assigned to a trial master when justified by an exceptional
    condition.
      The use of a trial master without party consent is abolished as
    to matters to be decided by a jury unless a statute provides for
    this practice.
      Abolition of the direct power to appoint a trial master as to
    issues to be decided by a jury leaves the way free to appoint a
    trial master with the consent of all parties. A trial master should
    be appointed in a jury case, with consent of the parties and
    concurrence of the court, only if the parties waive jury trial with
    respect to the issues submitted to the master or if the master's
    findings are to be submitted to the jury as evidence in the manner
    provided by former Rule 53(e)(3). In no circumstance may a master
    be appointed to preside at a jury trial.
      The central function of a trial master is to preside over an
    evidentiary hearing on the merits of the claims or defenses in the
    action. This function distinguishes the trial master from most
    functions of pretrial and post-trial masters. If any master is to
    be used for such matters as a preliminary injunction hearing or a
    determination of complex damages issues, for example, the master
    should be a trial master. The line, however, is not distinct. A
    pretrial master might well conduct an evidentiary hearing on a
    discovery dispute, and a post-trial master might conduct
    evidentiary hearings on questions of compliance.
      Rule 53 has long provided authority to report the evidence
    without recommendations in nonjury trials. This authority is
    omitted from Rule 53(a)(1)(B). In some circumstances a master may
    be appointed under Rule 53(a)(1)(A) or (C) to take evidence and
    report without recommendations.
      For nonjury cases, a master also may be appointed to assist the
    court in discharging trial duties other than conducting an
    evidentiary hearing.
      Pretrial and Post-Trial Masters. Subparagraph (a)(1)(C)
    authorizes appointment of a master to address pretrial or post-
    trial matters. Appointment is limited to matters that cannot be
    addressed effectively and in a timely fashion by an available
    district judge or magistrate judge of the district. A master's
    pretrial or post-trial duties may include matters that could be
    addressed by a judge, such as reviewing discovery documents for
    privilege, or duties that might not be suitable for a judge. Some
    forms of settlement negotiations, investigations, or administration
    of an organization are familiar examples of duties that a judge
    might not feel free to undertake.
      Magistrate Judges. Particular attention should be paid to the
    prospect that a magistrate judge may be available for special
    assignments. United States magistrate judges are authorized by
    statute to perform many pretrial functions in civil actions. 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(1). Ordinarily a district judge who delegates
    these functions should refer them to a magistrate judge acting as
    magistrate judge.
      There is statutory authority to appoint a magistrate judge as
    special master. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(2). In special circumstances,
    or when expressly authorized by a statute other than Sec.
    636(b)(2), it may be appropriate to appoint a magistrate judge as a
    master when needed to perform functions outside those listed in
    Sec. 636(b)(1). There is no apparent reason to appoint a magistrate
    judge to perform as master duties that could be performed in the
    role of magistrate judge. Party consent is required for trial
    before a magistrate judge, moreover, and this requirement should
    not be undercut by resort to Rule 53 unless specifically authorized
    by statute; see 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5(f)(5).
      Pretrial Masters. The appointment of masters to participate in
    pretrial proceedings has developed extensively over the last two
    decades as some district courts have felt the need for additional
    help in managing complex litigation. This practice is not well
    regulated by present Rule 53, which focuses on masters as trial
    participants. Rule 53 is amended to confirm the authority to
    appoint - and to regulate the use of - pretrial masters.
      A pretrial master should be appointed only when the need is
    clear. Direct judicial performance of judicial functions may be
    particularly important in cases that involve important public
    issues or many parties. At the extreme, a broad delegation of
    pretrial responsibility as well as a delegation of trial
    responsibilities can run afoul of Article III.
      A master also may be appointed to address matters that blur the
    divide between pretrial and trial functions. The court's
    responsibility to interpret patent claims as a matter of law, for
    example, may be greatly assisted by appointing a master who has
    expert knowledge of the field in which the patent operates. Review
    of the master's findings will be de novo under Rule 53(g)(4), but
    the advantages of initial determination by a master may make the
    process more effective and timely than disposition by the judge
    acting alone. Determination of foreign law may present comparable
    difficulties. The decision whether to appoint a master to address
    such matters is governed by subdivision (a)(1)(C), not the trial-
    master provisions of subdivision (a)(1)(B).
      Post-Trial Masters. Courts have come to rely on masters to assist
    in framing and enforcing complex decrees. Present Rule 53 does not
    directly address this practice. Amended Rule 53 authorizes
    appointment of post-trial masters for these and similar purposes.
    The constraint of subdivision (a)(1)(C) limits this practice to
    cases in which the master's duties cannot be performed effectively
    and in a timely fashion by an available district judge or
    magistrate judge of the district.
      Reliance on a master is appropriate when a complex decree
    requires complex policing, particularly when a party has proved
    resistant or intransigent. This practice has been recognized by the
    Supreme Court, see Local 28, Sheet Metal Workers' Internat. Assn.
    v. EEOC, 478 U.S. 421, 481-482 (1986). The master's role in
    enforcement may extend to investigation in ways that are quite
    unlike the traditional role of judicial officers in an adversary
    system.
      Expert Witness Overlap. This rule does not address the
    difficulties that arise when a single person is appointed to
    perform overlapping roles as master and as court-appointed expert
    witness under Evidence Rule 706. Whatever combination of functions
    is involved, the Rule 53(a)(1)(B) limit that confines trial masters
    to issues to be decided by the court does not apply to a person who
    also is appointed as an expert witness under Evidence Rule 706.
      Subdivision (a)(2) and (3). Masters are subject to the Code of
    Conduct for United States Judges, with exceptions spelled out in
    the Code. Special care must be taken to ensure that there is no
    actual or apparent conflict of interest involving a master. The
    standard of disqualification is established by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 455.
    The affidavit required by Rule 53(b)(3) provides an important
    source of information about possible grounds for disqualification,
    but careful inquiry should be made at the time of making the
    initial appointment. The disqualification standards established by
    Sec. 455 are strict. Because a master is not a public judicial
    officer, it may be appropriate to permit the parties to consent to
    appointment of a particular person as master in circumstances that
    would require disqualification of a judge. The judge must be
    careful to ensure that no party feels any pressure to consent, but
    with such assurances - and with the judge's own determination that
    there is no troubling conflict of interests or disquieting
    appearance of impropriety - consent may justify an otherwise barred
    appointment.
      One potential disqualification issue is peculiar to the master's
    role. It may happen that a master who is an attorney represents a
    client whose litigation is assigned to the judge who appointed the
    attorney as master. Other parties to the litigation may fear that
    the attorney-master will gain special respect from the judge. A
    flat prohibition on appearance before the appointing judge during
    the time of service as master, however, might in some circumstances
    unduly limit the opportunity to make a desirable appointment. These
    matters may be regulated to some extent by state rules of
    professional responsibility. The question of present conflicts, and
    the possibility of future conflicts, can be considered at the time
    of appointment. Depending on the circumstances, the judge may
    consider it appropriate to impose a non-appearance condition on the
    lawyer-master, and perhaps on the master's firm as well.
      Subdivision (b). The order appointing a pretrial master is
    vitally important in informing the master and the parties about the
    nature and extent of the master's duties and authority. Care must
    be taken to make the order as precise as possible. The parties must
    be given notice and opportunity to be heard on the question whether
    a master should be appointed and on the terms of the appointment.
    To the extent possible, the notice should describe the master's
    proposed duties, time to complete the duties, standards of review,
    and compensation. Often it will be useful to engage the parties in
    the process of identifying the master, inviting nominations, and
    reviewing potential candidates. Party involvement may be
    particularly useful if a pretrial master is expected to promote
    settlement.
      The hearing requirement of Rule 53(b)(1) can be satisfied by an
    opportunity to make written submissions unless the circumstances
    require live testimony.
      Rule 53(b)(2) requires precise designation of the master's duties
    and authority. Clear identification of any investigating or
    enforcement duties is particularly important. Clear delineation of
    topics for any reports or recommendations is also an important part
    of this process. And it is important to protect against delay by
    establishing a time schedule for performing the assigned duties.
    Early designation of the procedure for fixing the master's
    compensation also may provide useful guidance to the parties.
      Ex parte communications between a master and the court present
    troubling questions. Ordinarily the order should prohibit such
    communications, assuring that the parties know where authority is
    lodged at each step of the proceedings. Prohibiting ex parte
    communications between master and court also can enhance the role
    of a settlement master by assuring the parties that settlement can
    be fostered by confidential revelations that will not be shared
    with the court. Yet there may be circumstances in which the
    master's role is enhanced by the opportunity for ex parte
    communications with the court. A master assigned to help coordinate
    multiple proceedings, for example, may benefit from off-the-record
    exchanges with the court about logistical matters. The rule does
    not directly regulate these matters. It requires only that the
    court exercise its discretion and address the topic in the order of
    appointment.
      Similarly difficult questions surround ex parte communications
    between a master and the parties. Ex parte communications may be
    essential in seeking to advance settlement. Ex parte communications
    also may prove useful in other settings, as with in camera review
    of documents to resolve privilege questions. In most settings,
    however, ex parte communications with the parties should be
    discouraged or prohibited. The rule requires that the court address
    the topic in the order of appointment.
      Subdivision (b)(2)(C) provides that the appointment order must
    state the nature of the materials to be preserved and filed as the
    record of the master's activities, and (b)(2)(D) requires that the
    order state the method of filing the record. It is not feasible to
    prescribe the nature of the record without regard to the nature of
    the master's duties. The records appropriate to discovery duties
    may be different from those appropriate to encouraging settlement,
    investigating possible violations of a complex decree, or making
    recommendations for trial findings. A basic requirement, however,
    is that the master must make and file a complete record of the
    evidence considered in making or recommending findings of fact on
    the basis of evidence. The order of appointment should routinely
    include this requirement unless the nature of the appointment
    precludes any prospect that the master will make or recommend
    evidence-based findings of fact. In some circumstances it may be
    appropriate for a party to file materials directly with the court
    as provided by Rule 5(e), but in many circumstances filing with the
    court may be inappropriate. Confidentiality is important with
    respect to many materials that may properly be considered by a
    master. Materials in the record can be transmitted to the court,
    and filed, in connection with review of a master's order, report,
    or recommendations under subdivisions (f) and (g). Independently of
    review proceedings, the court may direct filing of any materials
    that it wishes to make part of the public record.
      The provision in subdivision (b)(2)(D) that the order must state
    the standards for reviewing the master's orders, findings, or
    recommendations is a reminder of the provisions of subdivision
    (g)(3) that recognize stipulations for review less searching than
    the presumptive requirement of de novo decision by the court.
    Subdivision (b)(2)(D) does not authorize the court to supersede the
    limits of subdivision (g)(3).
      In setting the procedure for fixing the master's compensation, it
    is useful at the outset to establish specific guidelines to control
    total expense. The court has power under subdivision (h) to change
    the basis and terms for determining compensation after notice to
    the parties.
      Subdivision (b)(3) permits entry of the order appointing a master
    only after the master has filed an affidavit disclosing whether
    there is any ground for disqualification under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 455.
    If the affidavit discloses a possible ground for disqualification,
    the order can enter only if the court determines that there is no
    ground for disqualification or if the parties, knowing of the
    ground for disqualification, consent with the court's approval to
    waive the disqualification.
      The provision in Rule 53(b)(4) for amending the order of
    appointment is as important as the provisions for the initial
    order. Anything that could be done in the initial order can be done
    by amendment. The hearing requirement can be satisfied by an
    opportunity to make written submissions unless the circumstances
    require live testimony.
      Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) is a simplification of the
    provisions scattered throughout present Rule 53. It is intended to
    provide the broad and flexible authority necessary to discharge the
    master's responsibilities. The most important delineation of a
    master's authority and duties is provided by the Rule 53(b)
    appointing order.
      Subdivision (d). The subdivision (d) provisions for evidentiary
    hearings are reduced from the extensive provisions in current Rule
    53. This simplification of the rule is not intended to diminish the
    authority that may be delegated to a master. Reliance is placed on
    the broad and general terms of subdivision (c).
      Subdivision (e). Subdivision (e) provides that a master's order
    must be filed and entered on the docket. It must be promptly served
    on the parties, a task ordinarily accomplished by mailing or other
    means as permitted by Rule 5(b). In some circumstances it may be
    appropriate to have the clerk's office assist the master in mailing
    the order to the parties.
      Subdivision (f). Subdivision (f) restates some of the provisions
    of present Rule 53(e)(1). The report is the master's primary means
    of communication with the court. The materials to be provided to
    support review of the report will depend on the nature of the
    report. The master should provide all portions of the record
    preserved under Rule 53(b)(2)(C) that the master deems relevant to
    the report. The parties may designate additional materials from the
    record, and may seek permission to supplement the record with
    evidence. The court may direct that additional materials from the
    record be provided and filed. Given the wide array of tasks that
    may be assigned to a pretrial master, there may be circumstances
    that justify sealing a report or review record against public
    access - a report on continuing or failed settlement efforts is the
    most likely example. A post-trial master may be assigned duties in
    formulating a decree that deserve similar protection. Such
    circumstances may even justify denying access to the report or
    review materials by the parties, although this step should be taken
    only for the most compelling reasons. Sealing is much less likely
    to be appropriate with respect to a trial master's report.
      Before formally making an order, report, or recommendations, a
    master may find it helpful to circulate a draft to the parties for
    review and comment. The usefulness of this practice depends on the
    nature of the master's proposed action.
      Subdivision (g). The provisions of subdivision (g)(1), describing
    the court's powers to afford a hearing, take evidence, and act on a
    master's order, report, or recommendations are drawn from present
    Rule 53(e)(2), but are not limited, as present Rule 53(e)(2) is
    limited, to the report of a trial master in a nonjury action. The
    requirement that the court must afford an opportunity to be heard
    can be satisfied by taking written submissions when the court acts
    on the report without taking live testimony.
      The subdivision (g)(2) time limits for objecting to - or seeking
    adoption or modification of - a master's order, report, or
    recommendations, are important. They are not jurisdictional.
    Although a court may properly refuse to entertain untimely review
    proceedings, the court may excuse the failure to seek timely
    review. The basic time period is lengthened to 20 days because the
    present 10-day period may be too short to permit thorough study and
    response to a complex report dealing with complex litigation. If no
    party asks the court to act on a master's report, the court is free
    to adopt the master's action or to disregard it at any relevant
    point in the proceedings.
      Subdivision (g)(3) establishes the standards of review for a
    master's findings of fact or recommended findings of fact. The
    court must decide de novo all objections to findings of fact made
    or recommended by the master unless the parties stipulate, with the
    court's consent, that the findings will be reviewed for clear error
    or - with respect to a master appointed on the parties' consent or
    appointed to address pretrial or post-trial matters - that the
    findings will be final. Clear-error review is more likely to be
    appropriate with respect to findings that do not go to the merits
    of the underlying claims or defenses, such as findings of fact
    bearing on a privilege objection to a discovery request. Even if no
    objection is made, the court is free to decide the facts de novo;
    to review for clear error if an earlier approved stipulation
    provided clear-error review; or to withdraw its consent to a
    stipulation for clear-error review or finality, and then to decide
    de novo. If the court withdraws its consent to a stipulation for
    finality or clear-error review, it may reopen the opportunity to
    object.
      Under Rule 53(g)(4), the court must decide de novo all objections
    to conclusions of law made or recommended by a master. As with
    findings of fact, the court also may decide conclusions of law de
    novo when no objection is made.
      Apart from factual and legal questions, masters often make
    determinations that, when made by a trial court, would be treated
    as matters of procedural discretion. The court may set a standard
    for review of such matters in the order of appointment, and may
    amend the order to establish the standard. If no standard is set by
    the original or amended order appointing the master, review of
    procedural matters is for abuse of discretion. The subordinate role
    of the master means that the trial court's review for abuse of
    discretion may be more searching than the review that an appellate
    court makes of a trial court.
      If a master makes a recommendation on any matter that does not
    fall within Rule 53(g)(3), (4), or (5), the court may act on the
    recommendation under Rule 53(g)(1).
      Subdivision (h). The need to pay compensation is a substantial
    reason for care in appointing private persons as masters.
      Payment of the master's fees must be allocated among the parties
    and any property or subject-matter within the court's control. The
    amount in controversy and the means of the parties may provide some
    guidance in making the allocation. The nature of the dispute also
    may be important - parties pursuing matters of public interest, for
    example, may deserve special protection. A party whose unreasonable
    behavior has occasioned the need to appoint a master, on the other
    hand, may properly be charged all or a major portion of the
    master's fees. It may be proper to revise an interim allocation
    after decision on the merits. The revision need not await a
    decision that is final for purposes of appeal, but may be made to
    reflect disposition of a substantial portion of the case.
      The basis and terms for fixing compensation should be stated in
    the order of appointment. The court retains power to alter the
    initial basis and terms, after notice and an opportunity to be
    heard, but should protect the parties against unfair surprise.
      The provision of former Rule 53(a) that the "provision for
    compensation shall not apply when a United States Magistrate Judge
    is designated to serve as a master" is deleted as unnecessary.
    Other provisions of law preclude compensation.
      Subdivision (i). Rule 53(i) carries forward unchanged former Rule
    53(f).
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Subdivision (a)(3),
    barring appearance by a master as attorney before the appointing
    judge during the period of the appointment, is deleted. Subdivision
    (a)(4) is renumbered as (a)(3).
      Subdivision (b)(2) is amended by adding new material to the
    subparagraph (A), (B,) (C), and (D) specifications of issues that
    must be addressed in the order appointing a master. (A) now
    requires a statement of any investigation or enforcement duties.
    (B) now establishes a presumption that ex parte communications
    between master and court are limited to administrative matters; the
    court may, in its discretion, permit ex parte communications on
    other matters. (C) directs that the order address not only
    preservation but also filing of the record. (D) requires that the
    order state the method of filing the record.
      Subdivision (b)(3) is changed by requiring an opportunity to be
    heard on an order amending an appointment order. It also is
    renumbered as (b)(4).
      Subdivision (b)(4), renumbered as (b)(3), is redrafted to express
    the original meaning more clearly.
      Subdivision (c) has a minor style change.
      Subdivision (g)(1) is amended to state that in acting on a
    master's recommendations the court "must" afford an opportunity to
    be heard.
      Subdivision (g)(3) is changed to narrow still further the
    opportunities to depart from de novo determination of objections to
    a master's findings or recommendations for findings of fact.
      Subdivision (g)(4) is changed by deleting the opportunity of the
    parties to stipulate that a master's conclusions of law will be
    final.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 53 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The time set in the former rule at 20 days has been revised to 21
    days. See the Note to Rule 6.

-EXPCITE-
    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE VII. JUDGMENT

-HEAD-
    Rule 54. Judgment; Costs

-STATUTE-
      (a) Definition; Form. "Judgment" as used in these rules includes
    a decree and any order from which an appeal lies. A judgment should
    not include recitals of pleadings, a master's report, or a record
    of prior proceedings.
      (b) Judgment on Multiple Claims or Involving Multiple Parties.
    When an action presents more than one claim for relief - whether as
    a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim - or when
    multiple parties are involved, the court may direct entry of a
    final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or
    parties only if the court expressly determines that there is no
    just reason for delay. Otherwise, any order or other decision,
    however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or
    the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties does not
    end the action as to any of the claims or parties and may be
    revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all
    the claims and all the parties' rights and liabilities.
      (c) Demand for Judgment; Relief to Be Granted. A default judgment
    must not differ in kind from, or exceed in amount, what is demanded
    in the pleadings. Every other final judgment should grant the
    relief to which each party is entitled, even if the party has not
    demanded that relief in its pleadings.
      (d) Costs; Attorney's Fees.
        (1) Costs Other Than Attorney's Fees. Unless a federal statute,
      these rules, or a court order provides otherwise, costs - other
      than attorney's fees - should be allowed to the prevailing party.
      But costs against the United States, its officers, and its
      agencies may be imposed only to the extent allowed by law. The
      clerk may tax costs on 14 days' notice. On motion served within
      the next 7 days, the court may review the clerk's action.
        (2) Attorney's Fees.
          (A) Claim to Be by Motion. A claim for attorney's fees and
        related nontaxable expenses must be made by motion unless the
        substantive law requires those fees to be proved at trial as an
        element of damages.
          (B) Timing and Contents of the Motion. Unless a statute or a
        court order provides otherwise, the motion must:
            (i) be filed no later than 14 days after the entry of
          judgment;
            (ii) specify the judgment and the statute, rule, or other
          grounds entitling the movant to the award;
            (iii) state the amount sought or provide a fair estimate of
          it; and
            (iv) disclose, if the court so orders, the terms of any
          agreement about fees for the services for which the claim is
          made.

          (C) Proceedings. Subject to Rule 23(h), the court must, on a
        party's request, give an opportunity for adversary submissions
        on the motion in accordance with Rule 43(c) or 78. The court
        may decide issues of liability for fees before receiving
        submissions on the value of services. The court must find the
        facts and state its conclusions of law as provided in Rule
        52(a).
          (D) Special Procedures by Local Rule; Reference to a Master
        or a Magistrate Judge. By local rule, the court may establish
        special procedures to resolve fee-related issues without
        extensive evidentiary hearings. Also, the court may refer
        issues concerning the value of services to a special master
        under Rule 53 without regard to the limitations of Rule
        53(a)(1), and may refer a motion for attorney's fees to a
        magistrate judge under Rule 72(b) as if it were a dispositive
        pretrial matter.
          (E) Exceptions. Subparagraphs (A)-(D) do not apply to claims
        for fees and expenses as sanctions for violating these rules or
        as sanctions under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1927.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      Note to Subdivision (a). The second sentence is derived
    substantially from [former] Equity Rule 71 (Form of Decree).
      Note to Subdivision (b). This provides for the separate judgment
    of equity and code practice. See Wis.Stat. (1935) Sec. 270.54;
    Compare N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) Sec. 476.
      Note to Subdivision (c). For the limitation on default contained
    in the first sentence, see 2 N.D.Comp.Laws Ann. (1913) Sec. 7680;
    N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) Sec. 479. Compare English Rules Under the
    Judicature Act (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 13, r.r. 3-12. The
    remainder is a usual code provision. It makes clear that a judgment
    should give the relief to which a party is entitled, regardless of
    whether it is legal or equitable or both. This necessarily includes
    the deficiency judgment in foreclosure cases formerly provided for
    by Equity Rule 10 (Decree for Deficiency in Foreclosures, Etc.).
      Note to Subdivision (d). For the present rule in common law
    actions, see Ex parte Peterson, 253 U.S. 300, 40 S.Ct. 543, 64
    L.Ed. 919 (1920); Payne, Costs in Common Law Actions in the Federal
    Courts (1935), 21 Va.L.Rev. 397.
      The provisions as to costs in actions in forma pauperis contained
    in U.S.C., Title 28, Secs. 832-836 [now 1915] are unaffected by
    this rule. Other sections of U.S.C., Title 28, which are unaffected
    by this rule are: Secs. 815 [former] (Costs; plaintiff not entitled
    to, when), 821 [now 1928] (Costs; infringement of patent;
    disclaimer), 825 (Costs; several actions), 829 [now 1927] (Costs;
    attorney liable for, when), and 830 [now 1920] (Costs; bill of;
    taxation).
      The provisions of the following and similar statutes as to costs
    against the United States and its officers and agencies are
    specifically continued:

     U.S.C., Title 15, Secs. 77v(a), 78aa, 79y (Securities and Exchange
          Commission)
     U.S.C., Title 16, Sec. 825p (Federal Power Commission)
     U.S.C., Title 26, [former] Secs. 1569(d) and 1645(d) (Internal
          revenue actions)

          actions)
     U.S.C., Title 47, Sec. 401 (Communications Commission)

      The provisions of the following and similar statutes as to costs
    are unaffected:

     U.S.C., Title 7, Sec. 210(f) (Actions for damages based on an
          order of the Secretary of Agriculture under Stockyards Act)
     U.S.C., Title 7, Sec. 499g(c) (Appeals from reparations orders of
          Secretary of Agriculture under Perishable Commodities Act)
     U.S.C., Title 8, [former] Sec. 45 (Action against district
          attorneys in certain cases)
     U.S.C., Title 15, Sec. 15 (Actions for injuries due to violation
          of antitrust laws)
     U.S.C., Title 15, Sec. 72 (Actions for violation of law forbidding
          importation or sale of articles at less than market value or
          wholesale prices)
     U.S.C., Title 15, Sec. 77k (Actions by persons acquiring
          securities registered with untrue statements under Securities
          Act of 1933)
     U.S.C., Title 15, Sec. 78i(e) (Certain actions under the
          Securities Exchange Act of 1934)
     U.S.C., Title 15, Sec. 78r (Similar to 78i(e))
     U.S.C., Title 15, Sec. 96 (Infringement of trade-mark - damages)

          injunctions)
     U.S.C., Title 15, Sec. 124 (Infringement of trade-mark - damages)
     U.S.C., Title 19, Sec. 274 (Certain actions under customs law)

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      The historic rule in the federal courts has always prohibited
    piecemeal disposal of litigation and permitted appeals only from
    final judgments except in those special instances covered by
    statute. Hohorst v. Hamburg-American Packet Co. (1893) 148 U.S.
    262; Rexford v. Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co. (1913) 228 U.S. 339;
    Collins v. Miller (1920) 252 U.S. 364. Rule 54(b) was originally
    adopted in view of the wide scope and possible content of the newly
    created "civil action" in order to avoid the possible injustice of
    a delay in judgment of a distinctly separate claim to await
    adjudication of the entire case. It was not designed to overturn
    the settled federal rule stated above, which, indeed, has more
    recently been reiterated in Catlin v. United States (1945) 324 U.S.
    229. See also United States v. Florian (1941) 312 U.S. 656, rev'g
    (and restoring the first opinion in) Florian v. United States
    (C.C.A.7th, 1940) 114 F.(2d) 990; Reeves v. Beardall (1942) 316
    U.S. 283.
      Unfortunately, this was not always understood, and some confusion
    ensued. Hence situations arose where district courts made a
    piecemeal disposition of an action and entered what the parties
    thought amounted to a judgment, although a trial remained to be had
    on other claims similar or identical with those disposed of. In the
    interim the parties did not know their ultimate rights, and
    accordingly took an appeal, thus putting the finality of the
    partial judgment in question. While most appellate courts have
    reached a result generally in accord with the intent of the rule,
    yet there have been divergent precedents and division of views
    which have served to render the issues more clouded to the parties
    appellant. It hardly seems a case where multiplicity of precedents
    will tend to remove the problem from debate. The problem is
    presented and discussed in the following cases: Atwater v. North
    American Coal Corp. (C.C.A.2d, 1940) 111 F.(2d) 125; Rosenblum v.
    Dingfelder (C.C.A.2d, 1940) 111 F.(2d) 406; Audi-Vision, Inc. v.
    RCA Mfg. Co., Inc. (C.C.A.2d, 1943) 136 F.(2d) 621; Zalkind v.
    Scheinman (C.C.A.2d, 1943) 139 F.(2d) 895; Oppenheimer v. F. J.
    Young & Co., Inc. (C.C.A.2d, 1944) 144 F.(2d) 387; Libbey-Owens-
    Ford Glass Co. v. Sylvania Industrial Corp. (C.C.A.2d, 1946) 154
    F.(2d) 814, cert. den. (1946) 66 S.Ct. 1353; Zarati Steamship Co.
    v. Park Bridge Corp. (C.C.A.2d, 1946) 154 F.(2d) 377; Baltimore and
    Ohio R. Co. v. United Fuel Gas Co. (C.C.A.4th, 1946) 154 F.(2d)
    545; Jefferson Electric Co. v. Sola Electric Co. (C.C.A.7th, 1941)
    122 F.(2d) 124; Leonard v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. (C.C.A.7th, 1942)
    130 F.(2d) 535; Markham v. Kasper (C.C.A.7th, 1945) 152 F.(2d) 270;
    Hanney v. Franklin Fire Ins. Co. of Philadelphia (C.C.A.9th, 1944)
    142 F.(2d) 864; Toomey v. Toomey (App.D.C. 1945) 149 F.(2d) 19.
      In view of the difficulty thus disclosed, the Advisory Committee
    in its two preliminary drafts of proposed amendments attempted to
    redefine the original rule with particular stress upon the
    interlocutory nature of partial judgments which did not adjudicate
    all claims arising out of a single transaction or occurrence. This
    attempt appeared to meet with almost universal approval from those
    of the profession commenting upon it, although there were, of
    course, helpful suggestions for additional changes in language or
    clarification of detail. But cf. Circuit Judge Frank's dissenting
    opinion in Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Co. v. Sylvania Industrial
    Corp., supra, n. 21 of the dissenting opinion. The Committee,
    however, became convinced on careful study of its own proposals
    that the seeds of ambiguity still remained, and that it had not
    completely solved the problem of piecemeal appeals. After extended
    consideration, it concluded that a retention of the older federal
    rule was desirable, and that this rule needed only the exercise of
    a discretionary power to afford a remedy in the infrequent harsh
    case to provide a simple, definite, workable rule. This is afforded
    by amended Rule 54(b). It re-establishes an ancient policy with
    clarity and precision. For the possibility of staying execution
    where not all claims are disposed of under Rule 54(b), see amended
    Rule 62(h).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1961 AMENDMENT       
      This rule permitting appeal, upon the trial court's determination
    of "no just reason for delay," from a judgment upon one or more but
    fewer than all the claims in an action, has generally been given a
    sympathetic construction by the courts and its validity is settled.
    Reeves v. Beardall, 316 U.S. 283 (1942); Sears, Roebuck & Co. v.
    Mackey, 351 U.S. 427 (1956); Cold Metal Process Co. v. United
    Engineering & Foundry Co., 351 U.S. 445 (1956).
      A serious difficulty has, however, arisen because the rule speaks
    of claims but nowhere mentions parties. A line of cases has
    developed in the circuits consistently holding the rule to be
    inapplicable to the dismissal, even with the requisite trial court
    determination, of one or more but fewer than all defendants jointly
    charged in an action, i.e. charged with various forms of concerted
    or related wrongdoing or related liability. See Mull v. Ackerman,
    279 F.2d 25 (2d Cir. 1960); Richards v. Smith, 276 F.2d 652 (5th
    Cir. 1960); Hardy v. Bankers Life & Cas. Co., 222 F.2d 827 (7th
    Cir. 1955); Steiner v. 20th Century-Fox Film Corp., 220 F.2d 105
    (9th Cir. 1955). For purposes of Rule 54(b) it was arguable that
    there were as many "claims" as there were parties defendant and
    that the rule in its present text applied where less than all of
    the parties were dismissed, cf. United Artists Corp. v. Masterpiece
    Productions, Inc., 221 F.2d 213, 215 (2d Cir. 1955); Bowling
    Machines, Inc. v. First Nat. Bank, 283 F.2d 39 (1st Cir. 1960); but
    the Courts of Appeals are now committed to an opposite view.
      The danger of hardship through delay of appeal until the whole
    action is concluded may be at least as serious in the multiple-
    parties situations as in multiple-claims cases, see Pabellon v.
    Grace Line, Inc., 191 F.2d 169, 179 (2d Cir. 1951), cert. denied,
    342 U.S. 893 (1951), and courts and commentators have urged that
    Rule 54(b) be changed to take in the former. See Reagan v. Traders
    & General Ins. Co., 255 F.2d 845 (5th Cir. 1958); Meadows v.
    Greyhound Corp., 235 F.2d 233 (5th Cir. 1956); Steiner v. 20th
    Century-Fox Film Corp., supra; 6 Moore's Federal Practice &#182;
    54.34[2] (2d ed. 1953); 3 Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice &
    Procedure Sec. 1193.2 (Wright ed. 1958); Developments in the Law -
    Multiparty Litigation, 71 Harv.L.Rev. 874, 981 (1958); Note, 62
    Yale L.J. 263, 271 (1953); Ill.Ann.Stat. ch. 110, Sec. 50(2) (Smith-
    Hurd 1956). The amendment accomplishes this purpose by referring
    explicitly to parties.
      There has been some recent indication that interlocutory appeal
    under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(b), added in 1958, may
    now be available for the multiple-parties cases here considered.
    See Jaftex Corp. v. Randolph Mills, Inc., 282 F.2d 508 (2d Cir.
    1960). The Rule 54(b) procedure seems preferable for those cases,
    and Sec. 1292(b) should be held inapplicable to them when the rule
    is enlarged as here proposed. See Luckenbach Steamship Co., Inc.,
    v. H. Muehlstein & Co., Inc., 280 F.2d 755, 757 (2d Cir. 1960); 1
    Barron & Holtzoff, supra, Sec. 58.1, p. 321 (Wright ed. 1960).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (d). This revision adds paragraph (2) to this
    subdivision to provide for a frequently recurring form of
    litigation not initially contemplated by the rules - disputes over
    the amount of attorneys' fees to be awarded in the large number of
    actions in which prevailing parties may be entitled to such awards
    or in which the court must determine the fees to be paid from a
    common fund. This revision seeks to harmonize and clarify
    procedures that have been developed through case law and local
    rules.
      Paragraph (1). Former subdivision (d), providing for taxation of
    costs by the clerk, is renumbered as paragraph (1) and revised to
    exclude applications for attorneys' fees.
      Paragraph (2). This new paragraph establishes a procedure for
    presenting claims for attorneys' fees, whether or not denominated
    as "costs." It applies also to requests for reimbursement of
    expenses, not taxable as costs, when recoverable under governing
    law incident to the award of fees. Cf. West Virginia Univ. Hosp. v.
    Casey, __ U.S. __ (1991), holding, prior to the Civil Rights Act of
    1991, that expert witness fees were not recoverable under 42 U.S.C.
    Sec. 1988. As noted in subparagraph (A), it does not, however,
    apply to fees recoverable as an element of damages, as when sought
    under the terms of a contract; such damages typically are to be
    claimed in a pleading and may involve issues to be resolved by a
    jury. Nor, as provided in subparagraph (E), does it apply to awards
    of fees as sanctions authorized or mandated under these rules or
    under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1927.
      Subparagraph (B) provides a deadline for motions for attorneys'
    fees - 14 days after final judgment unless the court or a statute
    specifies some other time. One purpose of this provision is to
    assure that the opposing party is informed of the claim before the
    time for appeal has elapsed. Prior law did not prescribe any
    specific time limit on claims for attorneys' fees. White v. New
    Hampshire Dep't of Employment Sec., 455 U.S. 445 (1982). In many
    nonjury cases the court will want to consider attorneys' fee issues
    immediately after rendering its judgment on the merits of the case.
    Note that the time for making claims is specifically stated in some
    legislation, such as the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 2412(d)(1)(B) (30-day filing period).
      Prompt filing affords an opportunity for the court to resolve fee
    disputes shortly after trial, while the services performed are
    freshly in mind. It also enables the court in appropriate
    circumstances to make its ruling on a fee request in time for any
    appellate review of a dispute over fees to proceed at the same time
    as review on the merits of the case.
      Filing a motion for fees under this subdivision does not affect
    the finality or the appealability of a judgment, though revised
    Rule 58 provides a mechanism by which prior to appeal the court can
    suspend the finality to resolve a motion for fees. If an appeal on
    the merits of the case is taken, the court may rule on the claim
    for fees, may defer its ruling on the motion, or may deny the
    motion without prejudice, directing under subdivision (d)(2)(B) a
    new period for filing after the appeal has been resolved. A notice
    of appeal does not extend the time for filing a fee claim based on
    the initial judgment, but the court under subdivision (d)(2)(B) may
    effectively extend the period by permitting claims to be filed
    after resolution of the appeal. A new period for filing will
    automatically begin if a new judgment is entered following a
    reversal or remand by the appellate court or the granting of a
    motion under Rule 59.
      The rule does not require that the motion be supported at the
    time of filing with the evidentiary material bearing on the fees.
    This material must of course be submitted in due course, according
    to such schedule as the court may direct in light of the
    circumstances of the case. What is required is the filing of a
    motion sufficient to alert the adversary and the court that there
    is a claim for fees and the amount of such fees (or a fair
    estimate).
      If directed by the court, the moving party is also required to
    disclose any fee agreement, including those between attorney and
    client, between attorneys sharing a fee to be awarded, and between
    adversaries made in partial settlement of a dispute where the
    settlement must be implemented by court action as may be required
    by Rules 23(e) and 23.1 or other like provisions. With respect to
    the fee arrangements requiring court approval, the court may also
    by local rule require disclosure immediately after such
    arrangements are agreed to. E.g., Rule 5 of United States District
    Court for the Eastern District of New York; cf. In re "Agent
    Orange" Product Liability Litigation (MDL 381), 611 F. Supp. 1452,
    1464 (E.D.N.Y. 1985).
      In the settlement of class actions resulting in a common fund
    from which fees will be sought, courts frequently have required
    that claims for fees be presented in advance of hearings to
    consider approval of the proposed settlement. The rule does not
    affect this practice, as it permits the court to require
    submissions of fee claims in advance of entry of judgment.
      Subparagraph (C) assures the parties of an opportunity to make an
    appropriate presentation with respect to issues involving the
    evaluation of legal services. In some cases, an evidentiary hearing
    may be needed, but this is not required in every case. The amount
    of time to be allowed for the preparation of submissions both in
    support of and in opposition to awards should be tailored to the
    particular case.
      The court is explicitly authorized to make a determination of the
    liability for fees before receiving submissions by the parties
    bearing on the amount of an award. This option may be appropriate
    in actions in which the liability issue is doubtful and the
    evaluation issues are numerous and complex.
      The court may order disclosure of additional information, such as
    that bearing on prevailing local rates or on the appropriateness of
    particular services for which compensation is sought.
      On rare occasion, the court may determine that discovery under
    Rules 26-37 would be useful to the parties. Compare Rules Governing
    Section 2254 Cases in the U.S. District Courts, Rule 6. See Note,
    Determining the Reasonableness of Attorneys' Fees - the
    Discoverability of Billing Records, 64 B.U.L. Rev. 241 (1984). In
    complex fee disputes, the court may use case management techniques
    to limit the scope of the dispute or to facilitate the settlement
    of fee award disputes.
      Fee awards should be made in the form of a separate judgment
    under Rule 58 since such awards are subject to review in the court
    of appeals. To facilitate review, the paragraph provides that the
    court set forth its findings and conclusions as under Rule 52(a),
    though in most cases this explanation could be quite brief.
      Subparagraph (D) explicitly authorizes the court to establish
    procedures facilitating the efficient and fair resolution of fee
    claims. A local rule, for example, might call for matters to be
    presented through affidavits, or might provide for issuance of
    proposed findings by the court, which would be treated as accepted
    by the parties unless objected to within a specified time. A court
    might also consider establishing a schedule reflecting customary
    fees or factors affecting fees within the community, as implicitly
    suggested by Justice O'Connor in Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley
    Citizens' Council, 483 U.S. 711, 733 (1987) (O'Connor, J.,
    concurring) (how particular markets compensate for contingency).
    Cf. Thompson v. Kennickell, 710 F. Supp. 1 (D.D.C. 1989) (use of
    findings in other cases to promote consistency). The parties, of
    course, should be permitted to show that in the circumstances of
    the case such a schedule should not be applied or that different
    hourly rates would be appropriate.
      The rule also explicitly permits, without need for a local rule,
    the court to refer issues regarding the amount of a fee award in a
    particular case to a master under Rule 53. The district judge may
    designate a magistrate judge to act as a master for this purpose or
    may refer a motion for attorneys' fees to a magistrate judge for
    proposed findings and recommendations under Rule 72(b). This
    authorization eliminates any controversy as to whether such
    references are permitted under Rule 53(b) as "matters of account
    and of difficult computation of damages" and whether motions for
    attorneys' fees can be treated as the equivalent of a dispositive
    pretrial matter that can be referred to a magistrate judge. For
    consistency and efficiency, all such matters might be referred to
    the same magistrate judge.
      Subparagraph (E) excludes from this rule the award of fees as
    sanctions under these rules or under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1927.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (d)(2)(C) is amended to delete the requirement that
    judgment on a motion for attorney fees be set forth in a separate
    document. This change complements the amendment of Rule 58(a)(1),
    which deletes the separate document requirement for an order
    disposing of a motion for attorney fees under Rule 54. These
    changes are made to support amendment of Rule 4 of the Federal
    Rules of Appellate Procedure. It continues to be important that a
    district court make clear its meaning when it intends an order to
    be the final disposition of a motion for attorney fees.
      The requirement in subdivision (d)(2)(B) that a motion for
    attorney fees be not only filed but also served no later than 14
    days after entry of judgment is changed to require filing only, to
    establish a parallel with Rules 50, 52, and 59. Service continues
    to be required under Rule 5(a).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 54(d)(2)(D) is revised to reflect amendments to Rule 53.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 54 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      The words "or class member" have been removed from Rule
    54(d)(2)(C) because Rule 23(h)(2) now addresses objections by class
    members to attorney-fee motions. Rule 54(d)(2)(C) is amended to
    recognize that Rule 23(h) now controls those aspects of attorney-
    fee motions in class actions to which it is addressed.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Former Rule 54(d)(1) provided that the clerk may tax costs on 1
    day's notice. That period was unrealistically short. The new 14-day
    period provides a better opportunity to prepare and present a
    response. The former 5-day period to serve a motion to review the
    clerk's action is extended to 7 days to reflect the change in the
    Rule 6(a) method for computing periods of less than 11 days.

    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE VII. JUDGMENT

-HEAD-
    Rule 55. Default; Default Judgment

-STATUTE-
      (a) Entering a Default. When a party against whom a judgment for
    affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise
    defend, and that failure is shown by affidavit or otherwise, the
    clerk must enter the party's default.
      (b) Entering a Default Judgment.
        (1) By the Clerk. If the plaintiff's claim is for a sum certain
      or a sum that can be made certain by computation, the clerk - on
      the plaintiff's request, with an affidavit showing the amount due
      - must enter judgment for that amount and costs against a
      defendant who has been defaulted for not appearing and who is
      neither a minor nor an incompetent person.
        (2) By the Court. In all other cases, the party must apply to
      the court for a default judgment. A default judgment may be
      entered against a minor or incompetent person only if represented
      by a general guardian, conservator, or other like fiduciary who
      has appeared. If the party against whom a default judgment is
      sought has appeared personally or by a representative, that party
      or its representative must be served with written notice of the
      application at least 7 days before the hearing. The court may
      conduct hearings or make referrals - preserving any federal
      statutory right to a jury trial - when, to enter or effectuate
      judgment, it needs to:
          (A) conduct an accounting;
          (B) determine the amount of damages;
          (C) establish the truth of any allegation by evidence; or
          (D) investigate any other matter.

      (c) Setting Aside a Default or a Default Judgment. The court may

    a default judgment under Rule 60(b).
      (d) Judgment Against the United States. A default judgment may be
    entered against the United States, its officers, or its agencies
    only if the claimant establishes a claim or right to relief by
    evidence that satisfies the court.

      NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE  
      Note. The operation of Rule 55(b) (Judgment) is directly affected
    by the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50 U.S.C.
    [App.] Sec. 501 et seq.). Section 200 of the Act [50 U.S.C.
    Appendix, Sec. 520] imposes specific requirements which must be
    fulfilled before a default judgment can be entered (e.g., Ledwith
    v. Storkan (D.Neb. 1942) 6 Fed.Rules Serv. 60b.24, Case 2, 2 F.R.D.
    539, and also provides for the vacation of a judgment in certain
    circumstances. See discussion in Commentary, Effect of Conscription
    Legislation on the Federal Rules (1940) 3 Fed.Rules Serv. 725; 3
    Moore's Federal Practice (1938) Cum.Supplement Sec. 55.02.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 55 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Former Rule 55(a) directed the clerk to enter a default when a
    party failed to plead or otherwise defend "as provided by these
    rules." The implication from the reference to defending "as
    provided by these rules" seemed to be that the clerk should enter a
    default even if a party did something showing an intent to defend,
    but that act was not specifically described by the rules. Courts in
    fact have rejected that implication. Acts that show an intent to
    defend have frequently prevented a default even though not
    connected to any particular rule. "[A]s provided by these rules" is
    deleted to reflect Rule 55(a)'s actual meaning.
      Amended Rule 55 omits former Rule 55(d), which included two
    provisions. The first recognized that Rule 55 applies to described
    claimants. The list was incomplete and unnecessary. Rule 55(a)
    applies Rule 55 to any party against whom a judgment for
    affirmative relief is requested. The second provision was a
    redundant reminder that Rule 54(c) limits the relief available by
    default judgment.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The time set in the former rule at 3 days has been revised to 7
    days. See the Note to Rule 6.

-EXPCITE-
    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE VII. JUDGMENT

-HEAD-
    Rule 56. Summary Judgment

-STATUTE-
      (a) By a Claiming Party. A party claiming relief may move, with
    or without supporting affidavits, for summary judgment on all or
    part of the claim.
      (b) By a Defending Party. A party against whom relief is sought
    may move, with or without supporting affidavits, for summary
    judgment on all or part of the claim.
      (c) Time for a Motion, Response, and Reply; Proceedings.
        (1) These times apply unless a different time is set by local
      rule or the court orders otherwise:
          (A) a party may move for summary judgment at any time until
        30 days after the close of all discovery;
          (B) a party opposing the motion must file a response within
        21 days after the motion is served or a responsive pleading is
        due, whichever is later; and
          (C) the movant may file a reply within 14 days after the
        response is served.

        (2) The judgment sought should be rendered if the pleadings,
      the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any
      affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material
      fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of
      law.

      (d) Case Not Fully Adjudicated on the Motion.
        (1) Establishing Facts. If summary judgment is not rendered on
      the whole action, the court should, to the extent practicable,
      determine what material facts are not genuinely at issue. The
      court should so determine by examining the pleadings and evidence
      before it and by interrogating the attorneys. It should then
      issue an order specifying what facts - including items of damages
      or other relief - are not genuinely at issue. The facts so
      specified must be treated as established in the action.
        (2) Establishing Liability. An interlocutory summary judgment
      may be rendered on liability alone, even if there is a genuine
      issue on the amount of damages.

      (e) Affidavits; Further Testimony.
        (1) In General. A supporting or opposing affidavit must be made
      on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in
      evidence, and show that the affiant is competent to testify on
      the matters stated. If a paper or part of a paper is referred to
      in an affidavit, a sworn or certified copy must be attached to or
      served with the affidavit. The court may permit an affidavit to
      be supplemented or opposed by depositions, answers to
      interrogatories, or additional affidavits.
        (2) Opposing Party's Obligation to Respond. When a motion for
      summary judgment is properly made and supported, an opposing
      party may not rely merely on allegations or denials in its own
      pleading; rather, its response must - by affidavits or as
      otherwise provided in this rule - set out specific facts showing
      a genuine issue for trial. If the opposing party does not so
      respond, summary judgment should, if appropriate, be entered
      against that party.

      (f) When Affidavits Are Unavailable. If a party opposing the
    motion shows by affidavit that, for specified reasons, it cannot
    present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may:
        (1) deny the motion;
        (2) order a continuance to enable affidavits to be obtained,
      depositions to be taken, or other discovery to be undertaken; or
        (3) issue any other just order.

      (g) Affidavit Submitted in Bad Faith. If satisfied that an
    affidavit under this rule is submitted in bad faith or solely for
    delay, the court must order the submitting party to pay the other
    party the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, it
    incurred as a result. An offending party or attorney may also be
    held in contempt.

      This rule is applicable to all actions, including those against
    the United States or an officer or agency thereof.
      Summary judgment procedure is a method for promptly disposing of
    actions in which there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.
    It has been extensively used in England for more than 50 years and
    has been adopted in a number of American states. New York, for
    example, has made great use of it. During the first nine years
    after its adoption there, the records of New York county alone show
    5,600 applications for summary judgments. Report of the Commission
    on the Administration of Justice in New York State (1934), p. 383.
    See also Third Annual Report of the Judicial Council of the State
    of New York (1937), p. 30.
      In England it was first employed only in cases of liquidated
    claims, but there has been a steady enlargement of the scope of the
    remedy until it is now used in actions to recover land or chattels
    and in all other actions at law, for liquidated or unliquidated
    claims, except for a few designated torts and breach of promise of
    marriage. English Rules Under the Judicature Act (The Annual
    Practice, 1937) O. 3, r. 6; Orders 14, 14A, and 15; see also O. 32,
    r. 6, authorizing an application for judgment at any time upon
    admissions. In Michigan (3 Comp.Laws (1929) Sec. 14260) and
    Illinois (Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937) ch. 110, Secs. 181, 259.15, 259.16),
    it is not limited to liquidated demands. New York (N.Y.R.C.P.
    (1937) Rule 113; see also Rule 107) has brought so many classes of
    actions under the operation of the rule that the Commission on
    Administration of Justice in New York State (1934) recommend that
    all restrictions be removed and that the remedy be available "in
    any action" (p. 287). For the history and nature of the summary
    judgment procedure and citations of state statutes, see Clark and
    Samenow, The Summary Judgment (1929), 38 Yale L.J. 423.
      Note to Subdivision (d). See Rule 16 (Pre-Trial Procedure;
    Formulating Issues) and the Note thereto.
      Note to Subdivisions (e) and (f). These are similar to rules in
    Michigan. Mich.Court Rules Ann. (Searl, 1933) Rule 30.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The amendment allows a claimant to move for a
    summary judgment at any time after the expiration of 20 days from
    the commencement of the action or after service of a motion for
    summary judgment by the adverse party. This will normally operate
    to permit an earlier motion by the claimant than under the original
    rule, where the phrase "at any time after the pleading in answer
    thereto has been served" operates to prevent a claimant from moving
    for summary judgment, even in a case clearly proper for its
    exercise, until a formal answer has been filed. Thus in Peoples
    Bank v. Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (N.D.Cal. 1944) 58
    F.Supp. 25, the plaintiff's counter-motion for a summary judgment
    was stricken as premature, because the defendant had not filed an
    answer. Since Rule 12(a) allows at least 20 days for an answer,
    that time plus the 10 days required in Rule 56(c) means that under
    original Rule 56(a) a minimum period of 30 days necessarily has to
    elapse in every case before the claimant can be heard on his right
    to a summary judgment. An extension of time by the court or the
    service of preliminary motions of any kind will prolong that period
    even further. In many cases this merely represents unnecessary
    delay. See United States v. Adler's Creamery, Inc. (C.C.A.2d, 1939)
    107 F.(2d) 987. The changes are in the interest of more expeditious
    litigation. The 20-day period, as provided, gives the defendant an
    opportunity to secure counsel and determine a course of action. But
    in a case where the defendant himself serves a motion for summary
    judgment within that time, there is no reason to restrict the
    plaintiff and the amended rule so provides.
      Subdivision (c). The amendment of Rule 56(c), by the addition of
    the final sentence, resolves a doubt expressed in Sartor v.
    Arkansas Natural Gas Corp. (1944) 321 U.S. 620. See also
    Commentary, Summary Judgment as to Damages (1944) 7 Fed.Rules Serv.
    974; Madeirense Do Brasil S/A v. Stulman-Emrick Lumber Co.
    (C.C.A.2d, 1945) 147 F.(2d) 399, cert. den. (1945) 325 U.S. 861. It
    makes clear that although the question of recovery depends on the
    amount of damages, the summary judgment rule is applicable and
    summary judgment may be granted in a proper case. If the case is
    not fully adjudicated it may be dealt with as provided in
    subdivision (d) of Rule 56, and the right to summary recovery
    determined by a preliminary order, interlocutory in character, and
    the precise amount of recovery left for trial.
      Subdivision (d). Rule 54(a) defines "judgment" as including a
    decree and "any order from which an appeal lies." Subdivision (d)
    of Rule 56 indicates clearly, however, that a partial summary
    "judgment" is not a final judgment, and, therefore, that it is not
    appealable, unless in the particular case some statute allows an
    appeal from the interlocutory order involved. The partial summary
    judgment is merely a pretrial adjudication that certain issues
    shall be deemed established for the trial of the case. This
    adjudication is more nearly akin to the preliminary order under
    Rule 16, and likewise serves the purpose of speeding up litigation
    by eliminating before trial matters wherein there is no genuine
    issue of fact. See Leonard v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. (C.C.A.7th,
    1942) 130 F.(2d) 535; Biggins v. Oltmer Iron Works (C.C.A.7th,
    1946) 154 F.(2d) 214; 3 Moore's Federal Practice (1938). 3190-3192.
    Since interlocutory appeals are not allowed, except where
    specifically provided by statute (see 3 Moore, op. cit. supra, 3155-
    3156) this interpretation is in line with that policy, Leonard v.
    Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., supra. See also Audi Vision Inc., v. RCA
    Mfg. Co. (C.C.A.2d, 1943) 136 F.(2d) 621; Toomey v. Toomey
    (App.D.C. 1945) 149 F.(2d) 19; Biggins v. Oltmer Iron Works, supra;
    Catlin v. United States (1945) 324 U.S. 229.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (c). By the amendment "answers to interrogatories"
    are included among the materials which may be considered on motion
    for summary judgment. The phrase was inadvertently omitted from the
    rule, see 3 Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure 159-
    60 (Wright ed. 1958), and the courts have generally reached by
    interpretation the result which will hereafter be required by the
    text of the amended rule. See Annot., 74 A.L.R.2d 984 (1960).
      Subdivision (e). The words "answers to interrogatories" are added
    in the third sentence of this subdivision to conform to the
    amendment of subdivision (c).
      The last two sentences are added to overcome a line of cases,
    chiefly in the Third Circuit, which has impaired the utility of the
    summary judgment device. A typical case is as follows: A party
    supports his motion for summary judgment by affidavits or other
    evidentiary matters sufficient to show that there is no genuine
    issue as to a material fact. The adverse party, in opposing the
    motion, does not produce any evidentiary matter, or produces some
    but not enough to establish that there is a genuine issue for
    trial. Instead, the adverse party rests on averments of his
    pleadings which on their face present an issue. In this situation
    Third Circuit cases have taken the view that summary judgment must
    be denied, at least if the averments are "well-pleaded," and not
    suppositious, conclusory, or ultimate. See Frederick Hart & Co.,
    Inc. v. Recordgraph Corp., 169 F.2d 580 (3d Cir. 1948); United
    States ex rel. Kolton v. Halpern, 260 F.2d 590 (3d Cir. 1958);
    United States ex rel. Nobles v. Ivey Bros. Constr. Co., Inc., 191
    F.Supp. 383 (D.Del. 1961); Jamison v. Pennsylvania Salt Mfg. Co.,
    22 F.R.D. 238 (W.D.Pa. 1958); Bunny Bear, Inc. v. Dennis Mitchell
    Industries, 139 F.Supp. 542 (E.D.Pa. 1956); Levy v. Equitable Life
    Assur. Society, 18 F.R.D. 164 (E.D.Pa. 1955).
      The very mission of the summary judgment procedure is to pierce
    the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there
    is a genuine need for trial. The Third Circuit doctrine, which
    permits the pleadings themselves to stand in the way of granting an
    otherwise justified summary judgment, is incompatible with the
    basic purpose of the rule. See 6 Moore's Federal Practice 2069 (2d
    ed. 1953); 3 Barron & Holtzoff, supra, Sec. 1235.1.
      It is hoped that the amendment will contribute to the more
    effective utilization of the salutary device of summary judgment.
      The amendment is not intended to derogate from the solemnity of
    the pleadings. Rather it recognizes that, despite the best efforts
    of counsel to make his pleadings accurate, they may be
    overwhelmingly contradicted by the proof available to his
    adversary.
      Nor is the amendment designed to affect the ordinary standards
    applicable to the summary judgment motion. So, for example: Where
    an issue as to a material fact cannot be resolved without
    observation of the demeanor of witnesses in order to evaluate their
    credibility, summary judgment is not appropriate. Where the
    evidentiary matter in support of the motion does not establish the
    absence of a genuine issue, summary judgment must be denied even if
    no opposing evidentiary matter is presented. And summary judgment
    may be inappropriate where the party opposing it shows under
    subdivision (f) that he cannot at the time present facts essential
    to justify his opposition.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 56 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Former Rule 56(a) and (b) referred to summary-judgment motions on
    or against a claim, counterclaim, or crossclaim, or to obtain a
    declaratory judgment. The list was incomplete. Rule 56 applies to
    third-party claimants, intervenors, claimants in interpleader, and
    others. Amended Rule 56(a) and (b) carry forward the present
    meaning by referring to a party claiming relief and a party against
    whom relief is sought.
      Former Rule 56(c), (d), and (e) stated circumstances in which
    summary judgment "shall be rendered," the court "shall if
    practicable" ascertain facts existing without substantial
    controversy, and "if appropriate, shall" enter summary judgment. In
    each place "shall" is changed to "should." It is established that
    although there is no discretion to enter summary judgment when
    there is a genuine issue as to any material fact, there is
    discretion to deny summary judgment when it appears that there is
    no genuine issue as to any material fact. Kennedy v. Silas Mason
    Co., 334 U.S. 249, 256-257 (1948). Many lower court decisions are
    gathered in 10A Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice &
    Procedure: Civil 3d, Sec. 2728. "Should" in amended Rule 56(c)
    recognizes that courts will seldom exercise the discretion to deny
    summary judgment when there is no genuine issue as to any material
    fact. Similarly sparing exercise of this discretion is appropriate
    under Rule 56(e)(2). Rule 56(d)(1), on the other hand, reflects the
    more open-ended discretion to decide whether it is practicable to
    determine what material facts are not genuinely at issue.
      Former Rule 56(d) used a variety of different phrases to express
    the Rule 56(c) standard for summary judgment - that there is no
    genuine issue as to any material fact. Amended Rule 56(d) adopts
    terms directly parallel to Rule 56(c).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The timing provisions for summary judgment are outmoded. They are
    consolidated and substantially revised in new subdivision (c)(1).
    The new rule allows a party to move for summary judgment at any
    time, even as early as the commencement of the action. If the
    motion seems premature both subdivision (c)(1) and Rule 6(b) allow
    the court to extend the time to respond. The rule does set a
    presumptive deadline at 30 days after the close of all discovery.
      The presumptive timing rules are default provisions that may be
    altered by an order in the case or by local rule. Scheduling orders
    are likely to supersede the rule provisions in most cases,
    deferring summary-judgment motions until a stated time or
    establishing different deadlines. Scheduling orders tailored to the
    needs of the specific case, perhaps adjusted as it progresses, are
    likely to work better than default rules. A scheduling order may be
    adjusted to adopt the parties' agreement on timing, or may require
    that discovery and motions occur in stages - including separation
    of expert-witness discovery from other discovery.
      Local rules may prove useful when local docket conditions or
    practices are incompatible with the general Rule 56 timing
    provisions.
      If a motion for summary judgment is filed before a responsive
    pleading is due from a party affected by the motion, the time for
    responding to the motion is 21 days after the responsive pleading
    is due.

    Rule 57. Declaratory Judgment

-STATUTE-
      These rules govern the procedure for obtaining a declaratory
    judgment under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2201. Rules 38 and 39 govern a demand
    for a jury trial. The existence of another adequate remedy does not
    preclude a declaratory judgment that is otherwise appropriate. The
    court may order a speedy hearing of a declaratory-judgment action.

      The fact that a declaratory judgment may be granted "whether or
    not further relief is or could be prayed" indicates that
    declaratory relief is alternative or cumulative and not exclusive
    or extraordinary. A declaratory judgment is appropriate when it
    will "terminate the controversy" giving rise to the proceeding.
    Inasmuch as it often involves only an issue of law on undisputed or
    relatively undisputed facts, it operates frequently as a summary
    proceeding, justifying docketing the case for early hearing as on a
    motion, as provided for in California (Code Civ.Proc. (Deering,
    1937) Sec. 1062a), Michigan (3 Comp.Laws (1929) Sec. 13904), and
    Kentucky (Codes (Carroll, 1932) Civ.Pract. Sec. 639a-3).
      The "controversy" must necessarily be "of a justiciable nature,
    thus excluding an advisory decree upon a hypothetical state of
    facts." Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288, 325,
    56 S.Ct. 466, 473, 80 L.Ed. 688, 699 (1936). The existence or
    nonexistence of any right, duty, power, liability, privilege,
    disability, or immunity or of any fact upon which such legal
    relations depend, or of a status, may be declared. The petitioner
    must have a practical interest in the declaration sought and all
    parties having an interest therein or adversely affected must be
    made parties or be cited. A declaration may not be rendered if a
    special statutory proceeding has been provided for the adjudication
    of some special type of case, but general ordinary or extraordinary
    legal remedies, whether regulated by statute or not, are not deemed
    special statutory proceedings.
      When declaratory relief will not be effective in settling the
    controversy, the court may decline to grant it. But the fact that
    another remedy would be equally effective affords no ground for
    declining declaratory relief. The demand for relief shall state
    with precision the declaratory judgment desired, to which may be
    joined a demand for coercive relief, cumulatively or in the
    alternative; but when coercive relief only is sought but is deemed
    ungrantable or inappropriate, the court may sua sponte, if it
    serves a useful purpose, grant instead a declaration of rights.

    be construed before or after breach at the petition of a properly
    interested party, process being served on the private parties or

    of the Federal act. Compare Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Haworth,

    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE VII. JUDGMENT

-HEAD-
    Rule 58. Entering Judgment

-STATUTE-
      (a) Separate Document. Every judgment and amended judgment must
    be set out in a separate document, but a separate document is not
    required for an order disposing of a motion:
        (1) for judgment under Rule 50(b);
        (2) to amend or make additional findings under Rule 52(b);
        (3) for attorney's fees under Rule 54;
        (4) for a new trial, or to alter or amend the judgment, under
      Rule 59; or
        (5) for relief under Rule 60.

      (b) Entering Judgment.
        (1) Without the Court's Direction. Subject to Rule 54(b) and
      unless the court orders otherwise, the clerk must, without
      awaiting the court's direction, promptly prepare, sign, and enter
      the judgment when:
          (A) the jury returns a general verdict;
          (B) the court awards only costs or a sum certain; or
          (C) the court denies all relief.

        (2) Court's Approval Required. Subject to Rule 54(b), the court
      must promptly approve the form of the judgment, which the clerk
      must promptly enter, when:
          (A) the jury returns a special verdict or a general verdict
        with answers to written questions; or
          (B) the court grants other relief not described in this
        subdivision (b).

      (c) Time of Entry. For purposes of these rules, judgment is
    entered at the following times:
        (1) if a separate document is not required, when the judgment
      is entered in the civil docket under Rule 79(a); or
        (2) if a separate document is required, when the judgment is
      entered in the civil docket under Rule 79(a) and the earlier of
      these events occurs:
          (A) it is set out in a separate document; or
          (B) 150 days have run from the entry in the civil docket.

      (d) Request for Entry. A party may request that judgment be set
    out in a separate document as required by Rule 58(a).
      (e) Cost or Fee Awards. Ordinarily, the entry of judgment may not
    be delayed, nor the time for appeal extended, in order to tax costs
    or award fees. But if a timely motion for attorney's fees is made
    under Rule 54(d)(2), the court may act before a notice of appeal
    has been filed and become effective to order that the motion have
    the same effect under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4)
    as a timely motion under Rule 59.

    verdict of jury unless otherwise ordered), Sec. 270.65 (where trial
    is by the court, entered by direction of the court), Sec. 270.63
    (entered by clerk on judgment on admitted claim for money). Compare
    1 Idaho Code Ann. (1932) Sec. 7-1101, and 4 Mont.Rev.Codes Ann.
    (1935) Sec. 9403, which provides that judgment in jury cases be
    entered by clerk within 24 hours after verdict unless court
    otherwise directs. Conn. Practice Book (1934) Sec. 200, provides
    that all judgments shall be entered within one week after
    rendition. In some States such as Washington, 2 Rev.Stat.Ann.
    (Remington, 1932) Sec. 431, in jury cases the judgment is entered
    two days after the return of verdict to give time for making motion
    for new trial; Sec. 435 (ibid.), provides that all judgments shall
    be entered by the clerk, subject to the court's direction.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      The reference to Rule 54(b) is made necessary by the amendment of
    that rule.
      Two changes have been made in Rule 58 in order to clarify the
    practice. The substitution of the more inclusive phrase "all relief
    be denied" for the words "there be no recovery", makes it clear
    that the clerk shall enter the judgment forthwith in the situations
    specified without awaiting the filing of a formal judgment approved
    by the court. The phrase "all relief be denied" covers cases such
    as the denial of a bankrupt's discharge and similar situations
    where the relief sought is refused but there is literally no denial
    of a "recovery".
      The addition of the last sentence in the rule emphasizes that
    judgments are to be entered promptly by the clerk without waiting
    for the taxing of costs. Certain district court rules, for example,
    Civil Rule 22 of the Southern District of New York - until its
    annulment Oct. 1, 1945, for conflict with this rule - and the like
    rule of the Eastern District of New York, are expressly in conflict
    with this provision, although the federal law is of long standing
    and well settled. Fowler v. Hamill (1891) 139 U.S. 549; Craig v.
    The Hartford (C.C.Cal. 1856) Fed.Case No. 3,333; Tuttle v. Claflin
    (C.C.A.2d, 1895) 60 Fed. 7, cert. den. (1897) 166 U.S. 721;
    Prescott & A. C. Ry. Co. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. (C.C.A.2d,
    1897) 84 Fed. 213; Stallo v. Wagner (C.C.A.2d, 1917) 245 Fed. 636,
    639-40; Brown v. Parker (C.C.A.8th, 1899) 97 Fed. 446; Allis-
    Chalmers v. United States (C.C.A.7th, 1908) 162 Fed. 679. And this
    applies even though state law is to the contrary. United States v.
    Nordbye (C.C.A.8th, 1935) 75 F.(2d) 744, 746, cert. den. (1935) 296
    U.S. 572. Inasmuch as it has been held that failure of the clerk
    thus enter judgment is a "misprision" "not to be excused" (The
    Washington (C.C.A.2d, 1926) 16 F.(2d) 206), such a district court
    rule may have serious consequences for a district court clerk.
    Rules of this sort also provide for delay in entry of the judgment
    contrary to Rule 58. See Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.
    Bedford's Estate (1945) 325 U.S. 283.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      Under the present rule a distinction has sometimes been made
    between judgments on general jury verdicts, on the one hand, and,
    on the other, judgments upon decisions of the court that a party
    shall recover only money or costs or that all relief shall be
    denied. In the first situation, it is clear that the clerk should
    enter the judgment without awaiting a direction by the court unless
    the court otherwise orders. In the second situation it was intended
    that the clerk should similarly enter the judgment forthwith upon
    the court's decision; but because of the separate listing in the
    rule, and the use of the phrase "upon receipt . . . of the
    direction," the rule has sometimes been interpreted as requiring
    the clerk to await a separate direction of the court. All these
    judgments are usually uncomplicated, and should be handled in the
    same way. The amended rule accordingly deals with them as a single
    group in clause (1) (substituting the expression "only a sum
    certain" for the present expression "only money"), and requires the
    clerk to prepare, sign, and enter them forthwith, without awaiting
    court direction, unless the court makes a contrary order. (The
    clerk's duty is ministerial and may be performed by a deputy clerk
    in the name of the clerk. See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 956; cf. Gilbertson v.
    United States, 168 Fed. 672 (7th Cir. 1909).) The more complicated
    judgments described in clause (2) must be approved by the court
    before they are entered.
      Rule 58 is designed to encourage all reasonable speed in
    formulating and entering the judgment when the case has been
    decided. Participation by the attorneys through the submission of
    forms of judgment involves needless expenditure of time and effort
    and promotes delay, except in special cases where counsel's
    assistance can be of real value. See Matteson v. United States, 240
    F.2d 517, 518-19 (2d Cir. 1956). Accordingly, the amended rule
    provides that attorneys shall not submit forms of judgment unless
    directed to do so by the court. This applies to the judgments
    mentioned in clause (2) as well as clause (1).
      Hitherto some difficulty has arisen, chiefly where the court has
    written an opinion or memorandum containing some apparently
    directive or dispositive words, e.g., "the plaintiff's motion [for
    summary judgment] is granted," see United States v. F. & M.
    Schaefer Brewing Co., 356 U.S. 227, 229, 78 S.Ct. 674, 2 L.Ed.2d
    721 (1958). Clerks on occasion have viewed these opinions or
    memoranda as being in themselves a sufficient basis for entering
    judgment in the civil docket as provided by Rule 79(a). However,
    where the opinion or memorandum has not contained all the elements
    of a judgment, or where the judge has later signed a formal
    judgment, it has become a matter of doubt whether the purported
    entry of judgment was effective, starting the time running for
    postverdict motions and for the purpose of appeal. See id.; and
    compare Blanchard v. Commonwealth Oil Co., 294 F.2d 834 (5th Cir.
    1961); United States v. Higginson, 238 F.2d 439 (1st Cir. 1956);
    Danzig v. Virgin Isle Hotel, Inc., 278 F.2d 580 (3d Cir. 1960);
    Sears v. Austin, 282 F.2d 340 (9th Cir. 1960), with Matteson v.
    United States, supra; Erstling v. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co.,
    255 F.2d 93 (5th Cir. 1958); Barta v. Oglala Sioux Tribe, 259 F.2d
    553 (8th Cir. 1958), cert. denied, 358 U.S. 932, 79 S.Ct. 320, 3
    L.Ed.2d 304 (1959); Beacon Fed. S. & L. Assn. v. Federal Home L.
    Bank Bd., 266 F.2d 246 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 823, 80

    F.2d 191 (4th Cir. 1960).
      The amended rule eliminates these uncertainties by requiring that
    there be a judgment set out on a separate document - distinct from
    any opinion or memorandum - which provides the basis for the entry
    of judgment. That judgments shall be on separate documents is also
    indicated in Rule 79(b); and see General Rule 10 of the U.S.
    District Courts for the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York;
    Ram v. Paramount Film D. Corp., supra, at 194.
      See the amendment of Rule 79(a) and the new specimen forms of
    judgment, Forms 31 and 32.
      See also Rule 55(b)(1) and (2) covering the subject of judgments
    by default.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Ordinarily the pendency or post-judgment filing of a claim for
    attorney's fees will not affect the time for appeal from the
    underlying judgment. See Budinich v. Becton Dickinson & Co., 486
    U.S. 196 (1988). Particularly if the claim for fees involves
    substantial issues or is likely to be affected by the appellate
    decision, the district court may prefer to defer consideration of
    the claim for fees until after the appeal is resolved. However, in
    many cases it may be more efficient to decide fee questions before
    an appeal is taken so that appeals relating to the fee award can be
    heard at the same time as appeals relating to the merits of the
    case. This revision permits, but does not require, the court to
    delay the finality of the judgment for appellate purposes under
    revised Fed. R. App. P. 4(a) until the fee dispute is decided. To
    accomplish this result requires entry of an order by the district
    court before the time a notice of appeal becomes effective for
    appellate purposes. If the order is entered, the motion for
    attorney's fees is treated in the same manner as a timely motion
    under Rule 59.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 58 has provided that a judgment is effective only when set
    forth on a separate document and entered as provided in Rule 79(a).
    This simple separate document requirement has been ignored in many
    cases. The result of failure to enter judgment on a separate
    document is that the time for making motions under Rules 50, 52,
    54(d)(2)(B), 59, and some motions under Rule 60, never begins to
    run. The time to appeal under Appellate Rule 4(a) also does not
    begin to run. There have been few visible problems with respect to
    Rule 50, 52, 54(d)(2)(B), 59, or 60 motions, but there have been
    many and horridly confused problems under Appellate Rule 4(a).
    These amendments are designed to work in conjunction with Appellate
    Rule 4(a) to ensure that appeal time does not linger on
    indefinitely, and to maintain the integration of the time periods
    set for Rules 50, 52, 54(d)(2)(B), 59, and 60 with Appellate Rule
    4(a).
      Rule 58(a) preserves the core of the present separate document
    requirement, both for the initial judgment and for any amended
    judgment. No attempt is made to sort through the confusion that
    some courts have found in addressing the elements of a separate
    document. It is easy to prepare a separate document that recites
    the terms of the judgment without offering additional explanation
    or citation of authority. Forms 31 and 32 provide examples.
      Rule 58 is amended, however, to address a problem that arises
    under Appellate Rule 4(a). Some courts treat such orders as those
    that deny a motion for new trial as a "judgment," so that appeal
    time does not start to run until the order is entered on a separate
    document. Without attempting to address the question whether such
    orders are appealable, and thus judgments as defined by Rule 54(a),
    the amendment provides that entry on a separate document is not
    required for an order disposing of the motions listed in Appellate
    Rule 4(a). The enumeration of motions drawn from the Appellate Rule
    4(a) list is generalized by omitting details that are important for
    appeal time purposes but that would unnecessarily complicate the
    separate document requirement. As one example, it is not required
    that any of the enumerated motions be timely. Many of the
    enumerated motions are frequently made before judgment is entered.
    The exemption of the order disposing of the motion does not excuse
    the obligation to set forth the judgment itself on a separate
    document. And if disposition of the motion results in an amended
    judgment, the amended judgment must be set forth on a separate
    document.
      Rule 58(b) discards the attempt to define the time when a
    judgment becomes "effective." Taken in conjunction with the Rule
    54(a) definition of a judgment to include "any order from which an
    appeal lies," the former Rule 58 definition of effectiveness could
    cause strange difficulties in implementing pretrial orders that are
    appealable under interlocutory appeal provisions or under expansive
    theories of finality. Rule 58(b) replaces the definition of
    effectiveness with a new provision that defines the time when
    judgment is entered. If judgment is promptly set forth on a
    separate document, as should be done when required by Rule
    58(a)(1), the new provision will not change the effect of Rule 58.
    But in the cases in which court and clerk fail to comply with this
    simple requirement, the motion time periods set by Rules 50, 52,
    54, 59, and 60 begin to run after expiration of 150 days from entry
    of the judgment in the civil docket as required by Rule 79(a).
      A companion amendment of Appellate Rule 4(a)(7) integrates these
    changes with the time to appeal.
      The new all-purpose definition of the entry of judgment must be
    applied with common sense to other questions that may turn on the
    time when judgment is entered. If the 150-day provision in Rule
    58(b)(2)(B) - designed to integrate the time for post-judgment
    motions with appeal time - serves no purpose, or would defeat the
    purpose of another rule, it should be disregarded. In theory, for
    example, the separate document requirement continues to apply to an
    interlocutory order that is appealable as a final decision under
    collateral-order doctrine. Appealability under collateral-order
    doctrine should not be complicated by failure to enter the order as
    a judgment on a separate document - there is little reason to force
    trial judges to speculate about the potential appealability of
    every order, and there is no means to ensure that the trial judge
    will always reach the same conclusion as the court of appeals.
    Appeal time should start to run when the collateral order is
    entered without regard to creation of a separate document and
    without awaiting expiration of the 150 days provided by Rule
    58(b)(2). Drastic surgery on Rules 54(a) and 58 would be required
    to address this and related issues, however, and it is better to
    leave this conundrum to the pragmatic disregard that seems its
    present fate. The present amendments do not seem to make matters
    worse, apart from one false appearance. If a pretrial order is set
    forth on a separate document that meets the requirements of Rule
    58(b), the time to move for reconsideration seems to begin to run,
    perhaps years before final judgment. And even if there is no
    separate document, the time to move for reconsideration seems to
    begin 150 days after entry in the civil docket. This apparent
    problem is resolved by Rule 54(b), which expressly permits revision
    of all orders not made final under Rule 54(b) "at any time before
    the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights
    and liabilities of all the parties."
      New Rule 58(d) replaces the provision that attorneys shall not
    submit forms of judgment except on direction of the court. This
    provision was added to Rule 58 to avoid the delays that were
    frequently encountered by the former practice of directing the
    attorneys for the prevailing party to prepare a form of judgment,
    and also to avoid the occasionally inept drafting that resulted
    from attorney-prepared judgments. See 11 Wright, Miller & Kane,
    Federal Practice & Procedure: Civil 2d, Sec. 2786. The express
    direction in Rule 58(a)(2) for prompt action by the clerk, and by
    the court if court action is required, addresses this concern. The
    new provision allowing any party to move for entry of judgment on a
    separate document will protect all needs for prompt commencement of
    the periods for motions, appeals, and execution or other
    enforcement.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. Minor style changes
    were made. The definition of the time of entering judgment in Rule
    58(b) was extended to reach all Civil Rules, not only the Rules
    described in the published version - Rules 50, 52, 54(d)(2)(B), 59,
    60, and 62. And the time of entry was extended from 60 days to 150
    days after entry in the civil docket without a required separate
    document.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 58 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE VII. JUDGMENT

-HEAD-
    Rule 59. New Trial; Altering or Amending a Judgment

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General.
        (1) Grounds for New Trial. The court may, on motion, grant a
      new trial on all or some of the issues - and to any party - as
      follows:
          (A) after a jury trial, for any reason for which a new trial
        has heretofore been granted in an action at law in federal
        court; or
          (B) after a nonjury trial, for any reason for which a
        rehearing has heretofore been granted in a suit in equity in
        federal court.

        (2) Further Action After a Nonjury Trial. After a nonjury
      trial, the court may, on motion for a new trial, open the
      judgment if one has been entered, take additional testimony,
      amend findings of fact and conclusions of law or make new ones,
      and direct the entry of a new judgment.

      (b) Time to File a Motion for a New Trial. A motion for a new
    trial must be filed no later than 28 days after the entry of
    judgment.
      (c) Time to Serve Affidavits. When a motion for a new trial is
    based on affidavits, they must be filed with the motion. The
    opposing party has 14 days after being served to file opposing
    affidavits. The court may permit reply affidavits.
      (d) New Trial on the Court's Initiative or for Reasons Not in the
    Motion. No later than 28 days after the entry of judgment, the
    court, on its own, may order a new trial for any reason that would
    justify granting one on a party's motion. After giving the parties
    notice and an opportunity to be heard, the court may grant a timely
    motion for a new trial for a reason not stated in the motion. In
    either event, the court must specify the reasons in its order.
      (e) Motion to Alter or Amend a Judgment. A motion to alter or
    amend a judgment must be filed no later than 28 days after the
    entry of the judgment.

      This rule represents an amalgamation of the petition for
    rehearing of [former] Equity Rule 69 (Petition for Rehearing) and
    the motion for new trial of U.S.C., Title 28, Sec. 391 [see 2111]
    (New trials; harmless error), made in the light of the experience
    and provision of the code States. Compare Calif.Code Civ.Proc.
    (Deering, 1937) Secs. 656-663a, U.S.C., Title 28, Sec. 391 [see
    2111] (New trials; harmless error) is thus substantially continued
    in this rule. U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Sec. 840 (Executions; stay
    on conditions) is modified insofar as it contains time provisions
    inconsistent with Subdivision (b). For the effect of the motion for
    new trial upon the time for taking an appeal see Morse v. United
    States, 270 U.S. 151 (1926); Aspen Mining and Smelting Co. v.
    Billings, 150 U.S. 31 (1893).
      For partial new trials which are permissible under Subdivision
    (a), see Gasoline Products Co., Inc., v. Champlin Refining Co., 283
    U.S. 494 (1931); Schuerholz v. Roach, 58 F.(2d) 32 (C.C.A.4th,
    1932); Simmons v. Fish, 210 Mass. 563, 97 N.E. 102, Ann.Cas.1912D,

    Federal cases and cases in accord from about sixteen States and
    contra from three States). The procedure in several States provides
    specifically for partial new trials. Ariz.Rev.Code Ann.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b). With the time for appeal to a circuit court of
    appeals reduced in general to 30 days by the proposed amendment of
    Rule 73(a), the utility of the original "except" clause, which
    permits a motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered
    evidence to be made before the expiration of the time for appeal,
    would have been seriously restricted. It was thought advisable,
    therefore, to take care of this matter in another way. By amendment
    of Rule 60(b), newly discovered evidence is made the basis for
    relief from a judgment, and the maximum time limit has been
    extended to one year. Accordingly the amendment of Rule 59(b)
    eliminates the "except" clause and its specific treatment of newly
    discovered evidence as a ground for a motion for new trial. This
    ground remains, however, as a basis for a motion for new trial
    served not later than 10 days after the entry of judgment. See also
    Rule 60(b).
      As to the effect of a motion under subdivision (b) upon the
    running of appeal time, see amended Rule 73(a) and Note.
      Subdivision (e). This subdivision has been added to care for a
    situation such as that arising in Boaz v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of
    New York (C.C.A.8th, 1944) 146 F.(2d) 321, and makes clear that the
    district court possesses the power asserted in that case to alter
    or amend a judgment after its entry. The subdivision deals only
    with alteration or amendment of the original judgment in a case and
    does not relate to a judgment upon motion as provided in Rule
    50(b). As to the effect of a motion under subdivision (e) upon the
    running of appeal time, see amended Rule 73(a) and Note.
      The title of Rule 59 has been expanded to indicate the inclusion
    of this subdivision.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      By narrow interpretation of Rule 59(b) and (d), it has been held
    that the trial court is without power to grant a motion for a new
    trial, timely served, by an order made more than 10 days after the
    entry of judgment, based upon a ground not stated in the motion but
    perceived and relied on by the trial court sua sponte. Freid v.
    McGrath, 133 F.2d 350 (D.C.Cir. 1942); National Farmers Union Auto.
    & Cas. Co. v. Wood, 207 F.2d 659 (10th Cir. 1953); Bailey v.
    Slentz, 189 F.2d 406 (10th Cir. 1951); Marshall's U.S. Auto Supply,
    Inc. v. Cashman, 111 F.2d 140 (10th Cir. 1940), cert. denied, 311
    U.S. 667 (1940); but see Steinberg v. Indemnity Ins. Co., 36 F.R.D.
    253 (E.D.La. 1964).
      The result is undesirable. Just as the court has power under Rule
    59(d) to grant a new trial of its own initiative within the 10
    days, so it should have power, when an effective new trial motion
    has been made and is pending, to decide it on grounds thought
    meritorious by the court although not advanced in the motion. The
    second sentence added by amendment to Rule 59(d) confirms the
    court's power in the latter situation, with provision that the
    parties be afforded a hearing before the power is exercised. See 6
    Moore's Federal Practice, par. 59.09[2] (2d ed. 1953).
      In considering whether a given ground has or has not been
    advanced in the motion made by the party, it should be borne in
    mind that the particularity called for in stating the grounds for a
    new trial motion is the same as that required for all motions by
    Rule 7(b)(1). The latter rule does not require ritualistic detail
    but rather a fair indication to court and counsel of the substance
    of the grounds relied on. See Lebeck v. William A. Jarvis Co., 250
    F.2d 285 (3d Cir. 1957); Tsai v. Rosenthal, 297 F.2d 614 (8th Cir.
    1961); General Motors Corp. v. Perry, 303 F.2d 544 (7th Cir. 1962);
    cf. Grimm v. California Spray-Chemical Corp., 264 F.2d 145 (9th
    Cir. 1959); Cooper v. Midwest Feed Products Co., 271 F.2d 177 (8th
    Cir. 1959).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1995 AMENDMENT       
      The only change, other than stylistic, intended by this revision
    is to add explicit time limits for filing motions for a new trial,
    motions to alter or amend a judgment, and affidavits opposing a new
    trial motion. Previously, there was an inconsistency in the wording
    of Rules 50, 52, and 59 with respect to whether certain post-
    judgment motions had to be filed, or merely served, during the
    prescribed period. This inconsistency caused special problems when
    motions for a new trial were joined with other post-judgment
    motions. These motions affect the finality of the judgment, a
    matter often of importance to third persons as well as the parties
    and the court. The Committee believes that each of these rules
    should be revised to require filing before end of the 10-day
    period. Filing is an event that can be determined with certainty
    from court records. The phrase "no later than" is used - rather
    than "within" - to include post-judgment motions that sometimes are
    filed before actual entry of the judgment by the clerk. It should
    be noted that under Rule 5 the motions when filed are to contain a
    certificate of service on other parties. It also should be noted
    that under Rule 6(a) Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are
    excluded in measuring the 10-day period, but that Bankruptcy Rule
    9006(a) excludes intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
    holidays only in computing periods less than 8 days.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 59 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Former Rules 50, 52, and 59 adopted 10-day periods for their
    respective post-judgment motions. Rule 6(b) prohibits any expansion
    of those periods. Experience has proved that in many cases it is
    not possible to prepare a satisfactory post-judgment motion in 10
    days, even under the former rule that excluded intermediate
    Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. These time periods are
    particularly sensitive because Appellate Rule 4 integrates the time
    to appeal with a timely motion under these rules. Rather than
    introduce the prospect of uncertainty in appeal time by amending
    Rule 6(b) to permit additional time, the former 10-day periods are
    expanded to 28 days. Rule 6(b) continues to prohibit expansion of
    the 28-day period.
      Former Rule 59(c) set a 10-day period after being served with a
    motion for new trial to file opposing affidavits. It also provided
    that the period could be extended for up to 20 days for good cause
    or by stipulation. The apparent 20-day limit on extending the time
    to file opposing affidavits seemed to conflict with the Rule 6(b)
    authority to extend time without any specific limit. This tension
    between the two rules may have been inadvertent. It is resolved by
    deleting the former Rule 59(c) limit. Rule 6(b) governs. The
    underlying 10-day period was extended to 14 days to reflect the
    change in the Rule 6(a) method for computing periods of less than
    11 days.
      Changes Made after Publication and Comment. The 30-day period
    proposed in the August 2007 publication is shortened to 28 days.

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE VII. JUDGMENT

-HEAD-
    Rule 60. Relief from a Judgment or Order

-STATUTE-
      (a) Corrections Based on Clerical Mistakes; Oversights and
    Omissions. The court may correct a clerical mistake or a mistake
    arising from oversight or omission whenever one is found in a
    judgment, order, or other part of the record. The court may do so
    on motion or on its own, with or without notice. But after an
    appeal has been docketed in the appellate court and while it is
    pending, such a mistake may be corrected only with the appellate
    court's leave.
      (b) Grounds for Relief from a Final Judgment, Order, or
    Proceeding. On motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party
    or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or
    proceeding for the following reasons:
        (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;
        (2) newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence,
      could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial
      under Rule 59(b);
        (3) fraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic),
      misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party;
        (4) the judgment is void;
        (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged;
      it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or
      vacated; or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable; or
        (6) any other reason that justifies relief.

      (c) Timing and Effect of the Motion.
        (1) Timing. A motion under Rule 60(b) must be made within a
      reasonable time - and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) no more than
      a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the date of
      the proceeding.
        (2) Effect on Finality. The motion does not affect the
      judgment's finality or suspend its operation.

      (d) Other Powers to Grant Relief. This rule does not limit a
    court's power to:
        (1) entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a
      judgment, order, or proceeding;
        (2) grant relief under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1655 to a defendant who
      was not personally notified of the action; or
        (3) set aside a judgment for fraud on the court.

      (e) Bills and Writs Abolished. The following are abolished: bills
    of review, bills in the nature of bills of review, and writs of
    coram nobis, coram vobis, and audita querela.

      Note to Subdivision (a). See [former] Equity Rule 72 (Correction
    of Clerical Mistakes in Orders and Decrees); Mich.Court Rules Ann.
    (Searl, 1933) Rule 48, Sec. 3; 2 Wash.Rev.Stat.Ann. (Remington,

    correction of clerical errors and for amendment after judgment, see
    Va.Code Ann. (Michie, 1936) Secs. 6329, 6333.
      Note to Subdivision (b). Application to the court under this
    subdivision does not extend the time for taking an appeal, as
    distinguished from the motion for new trial. This section is based
    upon Calif.Code Civ.Proc. (Deering, 1937) Sec. 473. See also
    N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) Sec. 108; 2 Minn.Stat. (Mason, 1927) Sec. 9283.
      For the independent action to relieve against mistake, etc., see
    Dobie, Federal Procedure, pages 760-765, compare 639; and Simkins,

    834), compare Sec. 214.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The amendment incorporates the view expressed in
    Perlman v. 322 West Seventy-Second Street Co., Inc. (C.C.A.2d,
    1942) 127 F.(2d) 716; 3 Moore's Federal Practice (1938) 3276, and
    further permits correction after docketing, with leave of the
    appellate court. Some courts have thought that upon the taking of
    an appeal the district court lost its power to act. See Schram v.
    Safety Investment Co. (E.D.Mich. 1942) 45 F.Supp. 636; also Miller
    v. United States (C.C.A.7th, 1940) 114 F.(2d) 267.
      Subdivision (b). When promulgated, the rules contained a number
    of provisions, including those found in Rule 60(b), describing the
    practice by a motion to obtain relief from judgments, and these
    rules, coupled with the reservation in Rule 60(b) of the right to
    entertain a new action to relieve a party from a judgment, were
    generally supposed to cover the field. Since the rules have been in
    force, decisions have been rendered that the use of bills of
    review, coram nobis, or audita querela, to obtain relief from final
    judgments is still proper, and that various remedies of this kind
    still exist although they are not mentioned in the rules and the
    practice is not prescribed in the rules. It is obvious that the
    rules should be complete in this respect and define the practice
    with respect to any existing rights or remedies to obtain relief
    from final judgments. For extended discussion of the old common law
    writs and equitable remedies, the interpretation of Rule 60, and
    proposals for change, see Moore and Rogers, Federal Relief from
    Civil Judgments (1946) 55 Yale L.J. 623. See also 3 Moore's Federal
    Practice (1938) 3254 et seq.; Commentary, Effect of Rule 60b on
    Other Methods of Relief From Judgment (1941) 4 Fed.Rules Serv. 942,
    945; Wallace v. United States (C.C.A.2d, 1944) 142 F.(2d) 240,
    cert. den. (1944) 323 U.S. 712.
      The reconstruction of Rule 60(b) has for one of its purposes a
    clarification of this situation. Two types of procedure to obtain
    relief from judgments are specified in the rules as it is proposed
    to amend them. One procedure is by motion in the court and in the
    action in which the judgment was rendered. The other procedure is
    by a new or independent action to obtain relief from a judgment,
    which action may or may not be begun in the court which rendered
    the judgment. Various rules, such as the one dealing with a motion
    for new trial and for amendment of judgments, Rule 59, one for
    amended findings, Rule 52, and one for judgment notwithstanding the
    verdict, Rule 50(b), and including the provisions of Rule 60(b) as
    amended, prescribe the various types of cases in which the practice
    by motion is permitted. In each case there is a limit upon the time
    within which resort to a motion is permitted, and this time limit
    may not be enlarged under Rule 6(b). If the right to make a motion
    is lost by the expiration of the time limits fixed in these rules,
    the only other procedural remedy is by a new or independent action
    to set aside a judgment upon those principles which have heretofore
    been applied in such an action. Where the independent action is
    resorted to, the limitations of time are those of laches or
    statutes of limitations. The Committee has endeavored to ascertain
    all the remedies and types of relief heretofore available by coram
    nobis, coram vobis, audita querela, bill of review, or bill in the
    nature of a bill of review. See Moore and Rogers, Federal Relief
    from Civil Judgments (1946) 55 Yale L.J. 623, 659-682. It
    endeavored then to amend the rules to permit, either by motion or
    by independent action, the granting of various kinds of relief from
    judgments which were permitted in the federal courts prior to the
    adoption of these rules, and the amendment concludes with a
    provision abolishing the use of bills of review and the other
    common law writs referred to, and requiring the practice to be by
    motion or by independent action.
      To illustrate the operation of the amendment, it will be noted
    that under Rule 59(b) as it now stands, without amendment, a motion
    for new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence is
    permitted within ten days after the entry of the judgment, or after
    that time upon leave of the court. It is proposed to amend Rule
    59(b) by providing that under that rule a motion for new trial
    shall be served not later than ten days after the entry of the
    judgment, whatever the ground be for the motion, whether error by
    the court or newly discovered evidence. On the other hand, one of
    the purposes of the bill of review in equity was to afford relief
    on the ground of newly discovered evidence long after the entry of
    the judgment. Therefore, to permit relief by a motion similar to
    that heretofore obtained on bill of review, Rule 60(b) as amended
    permits an application for relief to be made by motion, on the
    ground of newly discovered evidence, within one year after
    judgment. Such a motion under Rule 60(b) does not affect the
    finality of the judgment, but a motion under Rule 59, made within
    10 days, does affect finality and the running of the time for
    appeal.
      If these various amendments, including principally those to Rule
    60(b), accomplish the purpose for which they are intended, the
    federal rules will deal with the practice in every sort of case in
    which relief from final judgments is asked, and prescribe the
    practice. With reference to the question whether, as the rules now
    exist, relief by coram nobis, bills of review, and so forth, is
    permissible, the generally accepted view is that the remedies are
    still available, although the precise relief obtained in a
    particular case by use of these ancillary remedies is shrouded in
    ancient lore and mystery. See Wallace v. United States (C.C.A.2d,
    1944) 142 F.(2d) 240, cert. den. (1944) 323 U.S. 712; Fraser v.

      The transposition of the words "the court" and the addition of
    the word "and" at the beginning of the first sentence are merely
    verbal changes. The addition of the qualifying word "final"
    emphasizes the character of the judgments, orders or proceedings
    from which Rule 60(b) affords relief; and hence interlocutory
    judgments are not brought within the restrictions of the rule, but
    rather they are left subject to the complete power of the court
    rendering them to afford such relief from them as justice requires.
      The qualifying pronoun "his" has been eliminated on the basis
    that it is too restrictive, and that the subdivision should include
    the mistake or neglect of others which may be just as material and
    call just as much for supervisory jurisdiction as where the
    judgment is taken against the party through his mistake,
    inadvertence, etc.
      Fraud, whether intrinsic or extrinsic, misrepresentation, or
    other misconduct of an adverse party are express grounds for relief
    by motion under amended subdivision (b). There is no sound reason
    for their exclusion. The incorporation of fraud and the like within
    the scope of the rule also removes confusion as to the proper
    procedure. It has been held that relief from a judgment obtained by
    extrinsic fraud could be secured by motion within a "reasonable
    time," which might be after the time stated in the rule had run.
    Fiske v. Buder (C.C.A.8th, 1942) 125 F.(2d) 841; see also
    inferentially Bucy v. Nevada Construction Co. (C.C.A.9th, 1942) 125
    F.(2d) 213. On the other hand, it has been suggested that in view
    of the fact that fraud was omitted from original Rule 60(b) as a
    ground for relief, an independent action was the only proper
    remedy. Commentary, Effect of Rule 60b on Other Methods of Relief
    From Judgment (1941) 4 Fed.Rules Serv. 942, 945. The amendment
    settles this problem by making fraud an express ground for relief
    by motion; and under the saving clause, fraud may be urged as a
    basis for relief by independent action insofar as established
    doctrine permits. See Moore and Rogers, Federal Relief from Civil
    Judgments (1946) 55 Yale L.J. 623, 653-659; 3 Moore's Federal
    Practice (1938) 3267 et seq. And the rule expressly does not limit
    the power of the court, when fraud has been perpetrated upon it, to
    give relief under the saving clause. As an illustration of this
    situation, see Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford Empire Co. (1944)
    322 U.S. 238.
      The time limit for relief by motion in the court and in the
    action in which the judgment was rendered has been enlarged from
    six months to one year.
      It should be noted that Rule 60(b) does not assume to define the
    substantive law as to the grounds for vacating judgments, but
    merely prescribes the practice in proceedings to obtain relief.
      It should also be noted that under Sec. 200(4) of the Soldiers'
    and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50 U.S.C. [App.] Sec. 501 et
    seq. [Sec. 520(4)]), a judgment rendered in any action or
    proceeding governed by the section may be vacated under certain
    specified circumstances upon proper application to the court.

      The final sentence of former Rule 60(b) said that the procedure
    for obtaining any relief from a judgment was by motion as
    prescribed in the Civil Rules or by an independent action. That
    provision is deleted as unnecessary. Relief continues to be
    available only as provided in the Civil Rules or by independent
    action.

    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE VII. JUDGMENT

-HEAD-
    Rule 62. Stay of Proceedings to Enforce a Judgment

-STATUTE-
      (a) Automatic Stay; Exceptions for Injunctions, Receiverships,
    and Patent Accountings. Except as stated in this rule, no execution
    may issue on a judgment, nor may proceedings be taken to enforce
    it, until 14 days have passed after its entry. But unless the court
    orders otherwise, the following are not stayed after being entered,
    even if an appeal is taken:
        (1) an interlocutory or final judgment in an action for an
      injunction or a receivership; or
        (2) a judgment or order that directs an accounting in an action
      for patent infringement.

      (b) Stay Pending the Disposition of a Motion. On appropriate
    terms for the opposing party's security, the court may stay the
    execution of a judgment - or any proceedings to enforce it -
    pending disposition of any of the following motions:
        (1) under Rule 50, for judgment as a matter of law;
        (2) under Rule 52(b), to amend the findings or for additional
      findings;
        (3) under Rule 59, for a new trial or to alter or amend a
      judgment; or
        (4) under Rule 60, for relief from a judgment or order.

      (c) Injunction Pending an Appeal. While an appeal is pending from
    an interlocutory order or final judgment that grants, dissolves, or
    denies an injunction, the court may suspend, modify, restore, or
    grant an injunction on terms for bond or other terms that secure
    the opposing party's rights. If the judgment appealed from is
    rendered by a statutory three-judge district court, the order must
    be made either:
        (1) by that court sitting in open session; or
        (2) by the assent of all its judges, as evidenced by their
      signatures.

      (d) Stay with Bond on Appeal. If an appeal is taken, the
    appellant may obtain a stay by supersedeas bond, except in an
    action described in Rule 62(a)(1) or (2). The bond may be given
    upon or after filing the notice of appeal or after obtaining the
    order allowing the appeal. The stay takes effect when the court
    approves the bond.
      (e) Stay Without Bond on an Appeal by the United States, Its
    Officers, or Its Agencies. The court must not require a bond,
    obligation, or other security from the appellant when granting a
    stay on an appeal by the United States, its officers, or its
    agencies or on an appeal directed by a department of the federal
    government.
      (f) Stay in Favor of a Judgment Debtor Under State Law. If a
    judgment is a lien on the judgment debtor's property under the law
    of the state where the court is located, the judgment debtor is
    entitled to the same stay of execution the state court would give.
      (g) Appellate Court's Power Not Limited. This rule does not limit
    the power of the appellate court or one of its judges or justices:
        (1) to stay proceedings - or suspend, modify, restore, or grant
      an injunction - while an appeal is pending; or
        (2) to issue an order to preserve the status quo or the
      effectiveness of the judgment to be entered.

      (h) Stay with Multiple Claims or Parties. A court may stay the
    enforcement of a final judgment entered under Rule 54(b) until it
    enters a later judgment or judgments, and may prescribe terms
    necessary to secure the benefit of the stayed judgment for the
    party in whose favor it was entered.

      Subdivision (a). [This subdivision not amended]. Sections 203 and
    204 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50
    U.S.C. [App.] Sec. 501 et seq. [Secs. 523, 524]) provide under
    certain circumstances for the issuance and continuance of a stay of
    execution of any judgment or order entered against a person in
    military service. See Bowsman v. Peterson (D.Neb. 1942) 45 F.Supp.
    741. Section 201 of the Act [50 U.S.C. App. Sec. 521] permits under
    certain circumstances the issuance of a stay of any action or
    proceeding at any stage thereof, where either the plaintiff or
    defendant is a person in military service. See also Note to Rule 64

      Section 210 of the Judicial Code, as amended, U.S.C., Title 28,
    Sec. 47a, is repealed by revised Title 28 and its provisions that
    stays pending appeals to the Supreme Court in Interstate Commerce
    Commission cases may be granted only by that court or a justice
    thereof are not included in revised Title 28. Prior to this repeal
    the additional general reference in subdivision (g) to "other
    statutes of the United States", was needed as a safety residual
    provision due to the specific reference to Section 210 of the
    Judicial Code. With the repeal of this latter section there is no
    need for the residual provision, which has no present
    applicability; and to the extent that any statute is enacted
    providing "that stays pending appeals to the Supreme Court may be
    granted only by that court or a justice thereof" it will govern and
    will not be inconsistent or repugnant to subdivision (g) as

    Rule 62.1. Indicative Ruling on a Motion for Relief That is Barred
      by a Pending Appeal

-STATUTE-
      (a) Relief Pending Appeal. If a timely motion is made for relief
    that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that
    has been docketed and is pending, the court may:
        (1) defer considering the motion;
        (2) deny the motion; or
        (3) state either that it would grant the motion if the court of
      appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a
      substantial issue.

      (b) Notice to the Court of Appeals. The movant must promptly
    notify the circuit clerk under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure
    12.1 if the district court states that it would grant the motion or
    that the motion raises a substantial issue.
      (c) Remand. The district court may decide the motion if the court
    of appeals remands for that purpose.

-MISC1-
                      COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009                  
      This new rule adopts for any motion that the district court
    cannot grant because of a pending appeal the practice that most
    courts follow when a party makes a Rule 60(b) motion to vacate a
    judgment that is pending on appeal. After an appeal has been
    docketed and while it remains pending, the district court cannot
    grant a Rule 60(b) motion without a remand. But it can entertain
    the motion and deny it, defer consideration, or state that it would
    grant the motion if the the [sic] court of appeals remands for that
    purpose or state that the motion raises a substantial issue.
    Experienced lawyers often refer to the suggestion for remand as an
    "indicative ruling." (Appellate Rule 4(a)(4) lists six motions
    that, if filed within the relevant time limit, suspend the effect
    of a notice of appeal filed before or after the motion is filed
    until the last such motion is disposed of. The district court has
    authority to grant the motion without resorting to the indicative
    ruling procedure.)
      This clear procedure is helpful whenever relief is sought from an
    order that the court cannot reconsider because the order is the
    subject of a pending appeal. Rule 62.1 does not attempt to define
    the circumstances in which an appeal limits or defeats the district
    court's authority to act in the face of a pending appeal. The rules
    that govern the relationship between trial courts and appellate
    courts may be complex, depending in part on the nature of the order
    and the source of appeal jurisdiction. Rule 62.1 applies only when
    those rules deprive the district court of authority to grant relief
    without appellate permission. If the district court concludes that
    it has authority to grant relief without appellate permission, it
    can act without falling back on the indicative ruling procedure.
      To ensure proper coordination of proceedings in the district
    court and in the appellate court, the movant must notify the
    circuit clerk under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 12.1 if the
    district court states that it would grant the motion or that the
    motion raises a substantial issue. Remand is in the court of
    appeals' discretion under Appellate Rule 12.1.
      Often it will be wise for the district court to determine whether
    it in fact would grant the motion if the court of appeals remands
    for that purpose. But a motion may present complex issues that
    require extensive litigation and that may either be mooted or be
    presented in a different context by decision of the issues raised
    on appeal. In such circumstances the district court may prefer to
    state that the motion raises a substantial issue, and to state the
    reasons why it prefers to decide only if the court of appeals
    agrees that it would be useful to decide the motion before decision
    of the pending appeal. The district court is not bound to grant the
    motion after stating that the motion raises a substantial issue;
    further proceedings on remand may show that the motion ought not be
    granted.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. The rule text is
    changed by substituting "for that purpose" for "further
    proceedings"; the reason is discussed above.
      Minor changes are made in the Committee Note to make it conform
    to the Committee Note for proposed Appellate Rule 12.1.

    Rule 63. Judge's Inability to Proceed

-STATUTE-
      If a judge conducting a hearing or trial is unable to proceed,
    any other judge may proceed upon certifying familiarity with the
    record and determining that the case may be completed without
    prejudice to the parties. In a hearing or a nonjury trial, the
    successor judge must, at a party's request, recall any witness
    whose testimony is material and disputed and who is available to
    testify again without undue burden. The successor judge may also
    recall any other witness.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      This rule adapts and extends the provisions of U.S.C., Title 28,
    [former] Sec. 776 (Bill of exceptions; authentication; signing of
    by judge) to include all duties to be performed by the judge after
    verdict or judgment. The statute is therefore superseded.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      The revision substantially displaces the former rule. The former
    rule was limited to the disability of the judge, and made no
    provision for disqualification or possible other reasons for the
    withdrawal of the judge during proceedings. In making provision for
    other circumstances, the revision is not intended to encourage
    judges to discontinue participation in a trial for any but
    compelling reasons. Cf. United States v. Lane, 708 F.2d 1394, 1395-
    1397 (9th cir. 1983). Manifestly, a substitution should not be
    made for the personal convenience of the court, and the reasons for
    a substitution should be stated on the record.
      The former rule made no provision for the withdrawal of the judge
    during the trial, but was limited to disqualification after trial.
    Several courts concluded that the text of the former rule
    prohibited substitution of a new judge prior to the points
    described in the rule, thus requiring a new trial, whether or not a
    fair disposition was within reach of a substitute judge. E.g.,
    Whalen v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 684 F.2d 272 (4th Cir. 1982, en
    banc) cert. denied, 459 U.S. 910 (1982) (jury trial); Arrow-Hart,
    Inc. v. Philip Carey Co., 552 F.2d 711 (6th Cir. 1977) (non-jury
    trial). See generally Comment, The Case of the Dead Judge:
    Fed.R.Civ.P. 63: Whalen v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 67 MINN. L. REV.
    827 (1983).
      The increasing length of federal trials has made it likely that
    the number of trials interrupted by the disability of the judge
    will increase. An efficient mechanism for completing these cases
    without unfairness is needed to prevent unnecessary expense and
    delay. To avoid the injustice that may result if the substitute
    judge proceeds despite unfamiliarity with the action, the new Rule
    provides, in language similar to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure
    25(a), that the successor judge must certify familiarity with the
    record and determine that the case may be completed before that
    judge without prejudice to the parties. This will necessarily
    require that there be available a transcript or a videotape of the
    proceedings prior to substitution. If there has been a long but
    incomplete jury trial, the prompt availability of the transcript or
    videotape is crucial to the effective use of this rule, for the
    jury cannot long be held while an extensive transcript is prepared
    without prejudice to one or all parties.
      The revised text authorizes the substitute judge to make a
    finding of fact at a bench trial based on evidence heard by a
    different judge. This may be appropriate in limited circumstances.
    First, if a witness has become unavailable, the testimony recorded
    at trial can be considered by the successor judge pursuant to
    F.R.Ev. 804, being equivalent to a recorded deposition available
    for use at trial pursuant to Rule 32. For this purpose, a witness
    who is no longer subject to a subpoena to compel testimony at trial
    is unavailable. Secondly, the successor judge may determine that
    particular testimony is not material or is not disputed, and so
    need not be reheard. The propriety of proceeding in this manner may
    be marginally affected by the availability of a videotape record; a
    judge who has reviewed a trial on videotape may be entitled to
    greater confidence in his or her ability to proceed.
      The court would, however, risk error to determine the credibility
    of a witness not seen or heard who is available to be recalled. Cf.
    Anderson v. City of Bessemer City NC, 470 U.S. 564, 575 (1985);
    Marshall v. Jerrico Inc, 446 U.S. 238, 242 (1980). See also United
    States v. Radatz, 447 U.S. 667 (1980).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 63 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Remedies Under State Law - In General. At the commencement of
    and throughout an action, every remedy is available that, under the
    law of the state where the court is located, provides for seizing a
    person or property to secure satisfaction of the potential
    judgment. But a federal statute governs to the extent it applies.
      (b) Specific Kinds of Remedies. The remedies available under this
    rule include the following - however designated and regardless of
    whether state procedure requires an independent action:
        -- arrest;
        -- attachment;
        -- garnishment;
        -- replevin;
        -- sequestration; and
        -- other corresponding or equivalent remedies.

      This rule adopts the existing Federal law, except that it
    specifies the applicable State law to be that of the time when the
    remedy is sought. Under U.S.C., Title 28, [former] Sec. 726
    (Attachments as provided by State laws) the plaintiff was entitled
    to remedies by attachment or other process which were on June 1,
    1872, provided by the applicable State law, and the district courts
    might, from time to time, by general rules, adopt such State laws
    as might be in force. This statute is superseded as are district
    court rules which are rendered unnecessary by the rule.
      Lis pendens. No rule concerning lis pendens is stated, for this
    would appear to be a matter of substantive law affecting State laws
    of property. It has been held that in the absence of a State
    statute expressly providing for the recordation of notice of the
    pendency of Federal actions, the commencement of a Federal action
    is notice to all persons affected. King v. Davis, 137 Fed. 198
    (W.D.Va., 1903). It has been held, however, that when a State
    statute does so provide expressly, its provisions are binding.
    United States v. Calcasieu Timber Co., 236 Fed. 196 (C.C.A.5th,
    1916).

    against a person in military service, or the vacation or stay of
    any attachment or garnishment directed against such person's

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 64 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Former Rule 64 stated that the Civil Rules govern an action in
    which any remedy available under Rule 64(a) is used. The Rules were
    said to govern from the time the action is commenced if filed in
    federal court, and from the time of removal if removed from state
    court. These provisions are deleted as redundant. Rule 1
    establishes that the Civil Rules apply to all actions in a district
    court, and Rule 81(c)(1) adds reassurance that the Civil Rules
    apply to a removed action "after it is removed."

    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE VIII. PROVISIONAL AND FINAL REMEDIES

-HEAD-
    Rule 65. Injunctions and Restraining Orders

-STATUTE-
      (a) Preliminary Injunction.
        (1) Notice. The court may issue a preliminary injunction only
      on notice to the adverse party.
        (2) Consolidating the Hearing with the Trial on the Merits.
      Before or after beginning the hearing on a motion for a
      preliminary injunction, the court may advance the trial on the
      merits and consolidate it with the hearing. Even when
      consolidation is not ordered, evidence that is received on the
      motion and that would be admissible at trial becomes part of the
      trial record and need not be repeated at trial. But the court
      must preserve any party's right to a jury trial.

      (b) Temporary Restraining Order.
        (1) Issuing Without Notice. The court may issue a temporary
      restraining order without written or oral notice to the adverse
      party or its attorney only if:
          (A) specific facts in an affidavit or a verified complaint
        clearly show that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or
        damage will result to the movant before the adverse party can
        be heard in opposition; and
          (B) the movant's attorney certifies in writing any efforts
        made to give notice and the reasons why it should not be
        required.

        (2) Contents; Expiration. Every temporary restraining order
      issued without notice must state the date and hour it was issued;
      describe the injury and state why it is irreparable; state why
      the order was issued without notice; and be promptly filed in the
      clerk's office and entered in the record. The order expires at
      the time after entry - not to exceed 14 days - that the court
      sets, unless before that time the court, for good cause, extends
      it for a like period or the adverse party consents to a longer
      extension. The reasons for an extension must be entered in the
      record.
        (3) Expediting the Preliminary-Injunction Hearing. If the order
      is issued without notice, the motion for a preliminary injunction
      must be set for hearing at the earliest possible time, taking
      precedence over all other matters except hearings on older
      matters of the same character. At the hearing, the party who
      obtained the order must proceed with the motion; if the party
      does not, the court must dissolve the order.
        (4) Motion to Dissolve. On 2 days' notice to the party who
      obtained the order without notice - or on shorter notice set by
      the court - the adverse party may appear and move to dissolve or
      modify the order. The court must then hear and decide the motion
      as promptly as justice requires.

      (c) Security. The court may issue a preliminary injunction or a
    temporary restraining order only if the movant gives security in an
    amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages
    sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or
    restrained. The United States, its officers, and its agencies are
    not required to give security.
      (d) Contents and Scope of Every Injunction and Restraining Order.
        (1) Contents. Every order granting an injunction and every
      restraining order must:
          (A) state the reasons why it issued;
          (B) state its terms specifically; and
          (C) describe in reasonable detail - and not by referring to
        the complaint or other document - the act or acts restrained or
        required.

        (2) Persons Bound. The order binds only the following who
      receive actual notice of it by personal service or otherwise:
          (A) the parties;
          (B) the parties' officers, agents, servants, employees, and
        attorneys; and
          (C) other persons who are in active concert or participation
        with anyone described in Rule 65(d)(2)(A) or (B).

      (e) Other Laws Not Modified. These rules do not modify the
    following:
        (1) any federal statute relating to temporary restraining
      orders or preliminary injunctions in actions affecting employer
      and employee;
        (2) 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2361, which relates to preliminary
      injunctions in actions of interpleader or in the nature of
      interpleader; or
        (3) 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2284, which relates to actions that must be
      heard and decided by a three-judge district court.

      (f) Copyright Impoundment. This rule applies to copyright-
    impoundment proceedings.

    its favor whether there is an express statutory exception from such
    security requirements or not.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      It has been held that in actions on preliminary injunction bonds
    the district court has discretion to grant relief in the same
    proceeding or to require the institution of a new action on the
    bond. Russell v. Farley (1881) 105 U.S. 433, 466. It is believed,
    however, that in all cases the litigant should have a right to
    proceed on the bond in the same proceeding, in the manner provided
    in Rule 73(f) for a similar situation. The paragraph added to Rule
    65(c) insures this result and is in the interest of efficiency.
    There is no reason why Rules 65(c) and 73(f) should operate
    differently. Compare Sec. 50(n) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.
    Sec. 78(n), under which actions on all bonds furnished pursuant to
    the Act may be proceeded upon summarily in the bankruptcy court.
    See 2 Collier on Bankruptcy (14th ed. by Moore and Oglebay) 1853-
    1854.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1948 AMENDMENT       
      Specific enumeration of statutes dealing with labor injunctions
    is undesirable due to the enactment of amendatory or new
    legislation from time to time. The more general and inclusive
    reference, "any statute of the United States", does not change the
    intent of subdivision (e) of Rule 65, and the subdivision will have
    continuing applicability without the need of subsequent
    readjustment to labor legislation.
      The amendment relative to actions of interpleader or in the
    nature of interpleader substitutes the present statutory reference
    and will embrace any future amendment to statutory interpleader
    provided for in Title 28, U.S.C., Sec. 2361.
      The Act of August 24, 1937, provided for a district court of
    three judges to hear and determine an action to enjoin the
    enforcement of any Act of Congress for repugnance to the
    Constitution of the United States. The provisions of that Act
    dealing with the procedure for the issuance of temporary
    restraining orders and interlocutory and final injunctions have
    been included in revised Title 28, U.S.C., Sec. 2284, which,
    however, has been broadened to apply to all actions required to be
    heard and determined by a district court of three judges. The
    amendatory saving clause of subdivision (e) of Rule 65 has been
    broadened accordingly.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a)(2). This new subdivision provides express
    authority for consolidating the hearing of an application for a
    preliminary injunction with the trial on the merits. The authority
    can be exercised with particular profit when it appears that a
    substantial part of evidence offered on the application will be
    relevant to the merits and will be presented in such form as to
    qualify for admission on the trial proper. Repetition of evidence
    is thereby avoided. The fact that the proceedings have been
    consolidated should cause no delay in the disposition of the
    application for the preliminary injunction, for the evidence will
    be directed in the first instance to that relief, and the
    preliminary injunction, if justified by the proof, may be issued in
    the course of the consolidated proceedings. Furthermore, to
    consolidate the proceedings will tend to expedite the final
    disposition of the action. It is believed that consolidation can be
    usefully availed of in many cases.
      The subdivision further provides that even when consolidation is
    not ordered, evidence received in connection with an application
    for a preliminary injunction for a preliminary injunction which
    would be admissible on the trial on the merits forms part of the
    trial record. This evidence need not be repeated on the trial. On
    the the other hand, repetition is not altogether prohibited. That
    would be impractical and unwise. For example, a witness testifying
    comprehensively on the trial who has previously testified upon the
    application for a preliminary injunction might sometimes be
    hamstrung in telling his story if he could not go over some part of
    his prior testimony to connect it with his present testimony. So
    also, some repetition of testimony may be called for where the
    trial is conducted by a judge who did not hear the application for
    the preliminary injunction. In general, however, repetition can be
    avoided with an increase of efficiency in the conduct of the case
    and without any distortion of the presentation of evidence by the
    parties.
      Since an application for a preliminary injunction may be made in
    an action in which, with respect to all or part of the merits,
    there is a right to trial by jury, it is appropriate to add the
    caution appearing in the last sentence of the subdivision. In such
    a case the jury will have to hear all the evidence bearing on its
    verdict, even if some part of the evidence has already been heard
    by the judge alone on the application for the preliminary
    injunction.
      The subdivision is believed to reflect the substance of the best
    current practice and introduces no novel conception.
      Subdivision (b). In view of the possibly drastic consequence of a
    temporary restraining order, the opposition should be heard, if
    feasible, before the order is granted. Many judges have properly
    insisted that, when time does not permit of formal notice of the
    application to the adverse party, some expedient, such as
    telephonic notice to the attorney for the adverse party, be
    resorted to if this can reasonably be done. On occasion, however,
    temporary restraining orders have been issued without any notice
    when it was feasible for some fair, although informal, notice to be
    given. See the emphatic criticisms in Pennsylvania Rd. Co. v.
    Transport Workers Union, 278 F.2d 693, 694 (3d Cir. 1960); Arvida
    Corp. v. Sugarman, 259 F.2d 428, 429 (2d Cir. 1958); Lummus Co. v.
    Commonwealth Oil Ref. Co., Inc., 297 F.2d 80, 83 (2d Cir. 1961),
    cert. denied, 368 U.S. 986 (1962).
      Heretofore the first sentence of subdivision (b), in referring to
    a notice "served" on the "adverse party" on which a "hearing" could
    be held, perhaps invited the interpretation that the order might be
    granted without notice if the circumstances did not permit of a
    formal hearing on the basis of a formal notice. The subdivision is
    amended to make it plain that informal notice, which may be
    communicated to the attorney rather than the adverse party, is to
    be preferred to no notice at all.
      Before notice can be dispensed with, the applicant's counsel must
    give his certificate as to any efforts made to give notice and the
    reasons why notice should not be required. This certificate is in
    addition to the requirement of an affidavit or verified complaint
    setting forth the facts as to the irreparable injury which would
    result before the opposition could be heard.
      The amended subdivision continues to recognize that a temporary
    restraining order may be issued without any notice when the
    circumstances warrant.
      Subdivision (c). Original Rules 65 and 73 contained substantially
    identical provisions for summary proceedings against sureties on
    bonds required or permitted by the rules. There was fragmentary
    coverage of the same subject in the Admiralty Rules. Clearly, a
    single comprehensive rule is required, and is incorporated as Rule
    65.1.

      New subdivision (f) is added in conjunction with abrogation of
    the antiquated Copyright Rules of Practice adopted for proceedings
    under the 1909 Copyright Act. Courts have naturally turned to Rule
    65 in response to the apparent inconsistency of the former
    Copyright Rules with the discretionary impoundment procedure
    adopted in 1976, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 503(a). Rule 65 procedures also
    have assuaged well-founded doubts whether the Copyright Rules
    satisfy more contemporary requirements of due process. See, e.g.,
    Religious Technology Center v. Netcom On-Line Communications
    Servs., Inc., 923 F.Supp. 1231, 1260-1265 (N.D.Cal.1995); Paramount
    Pictures Corp. v. Doe, 821 F.Supp. 82 (E.D.N.Y.1993); WPOW, Inc. v.
    MRLJ Enterprises, 584 F.Supp. 132 (D.D.C.1984).
      A common question has arisen from the experience that notice of a
    proposed impoundment may enable an infringer to defeat the court's
    capacity to grant effective relief. Impoundment may be ordered on
    an ex parte basis under subdivision (b) if the applicant makes a
    strong showing of the reasons why notice is likely to defeat
    effective relief. Such no-notice procedures are authorized in
    trademark infringement proceedings, see 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1116(d), and
    courts have provided clear illustrations of the kinds of showings
    that support ex parte relief. See Matter of Vuitton et Fils S.A.,
    606 F.2d 1 (2d Cir.1979); Vuitton v. White, 945 F.2d 569 (3d
    Cir.1991). In applying the tests for no-notice relief, the court
    should ask whether impoundment is necessary, or whether adequate
    protection can be had by a less intrusive form of no-notice relief
    shaped as a temporary restraining order.
      This new subdivision (f) does not limit use of trademark
    procedures in cases that combine trademark and copyright claims.
    Some observers believe that trademark procedures should be adopted
    for all copyright cases, a proposal better considered by
    Congressional processes than by rulemaking processes.

    a comma that made clear the common doctrine that a party must have
    actual notice of an injunction in order to be bound by it.Amended
    Rule 65(d) restores the meaning of the earlier statute, and also
    makes clear the proposition that an injunction can be enforced
    against a person who acts in concert with a party's officer, agent,
    servant, employee, or attorney.

    Rule 66. Receivers

-STATUTE-
      These rules govern an action in which the appointment of a
    receiver is sought or a receiver sues or is sued. But the practice
    in administering an estate by a receiver or a similar court-
    appointed officer must accord with the historical practice in
    federal courts or with a local rule. An action in which a receiver
    has been appointed may be dismissed only by court order.

-SOURCE-
    (As amended Dec. 27, 1946, eff. Mar. 19, 1948; Dec. 29, 1948, eff.

-MISC1-
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      The title of Rule 66 has been expanded to make clear the subject
    of the rule, i.e., federal equity receivers.
      The first sentence added to Rule 66 prevents a dismissal by any
    party, after a federal equity receiver has been appointed, except
    upon leave of court. A party should not be permitted to oust the
    court and its officer without the consent of that court. See Civil
    Rule 31(e), Eastern District of Washington.
      The second sentence added at the beginning of the rule deals with
    suits by or against a federal equity receiver. The first clause
    thereof eliminates the formal ceremony of an ancillary appointment
    before suit can be brought by a receiver, and is in accord with the
    more modern state practice, and with more expeditious and less
    expensive judicial administration. 2 Moore's Federal Practice
    (1938) 2088-2091. For the rule necessitating ancillary appointment,
    see Sterrett v. Second Nat. Bank (1918) 248 U.S. 73; Kelley v.
    Queeney (W.D.N.Y. 1941) 41 F.Supp. 1015; see also McCandless v.
    Furlaud (1934) 293 U.S. 67. This rule has been extensively
    criticized. First, Extraterritorial Powers of Receivers (1932) 27
    Ill.L.Rev. 271; Rose, Extraterritorial Actions by Receivers (1933)
    17 Minn.L.Rev. 704; Laughlin, The Extraterritorial Powers of
    Receivers (1932) 45 Harv.L.Rev. 429; Clark and Moore, A New Federal
    Civil Procedure - II, Pleadings and Parties (1935) 44 Yale L.J.
    1291, 1312-1315; Note (1932) 30 Mich.L.Rev. 1322. See also comment
    in Bicknell v. Lloyd-Smith (C.C.A.2d, 1940) 109 F.(2d) 527, cert.
    den. (1940) 311 U.S. 650. The second clause of the sentence merely
    incorporates the well-known and general rule that, absent statutory
    authorization, a federal receiver cannot be sued without leave of
    the court which appointed him, applied in the federal courts since
    Barton v. Barbour (1881) 104 U.S. 126. See also 1 Clark on
    Receivers (2d ed.) Sec. 549. Under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 125, leave of
    court is unnecessary when a receiver is sued "in respect of any act
    or transaction of his in carrying on the business" connected with
    the receivership property, but such suit is subject to the general
    equity jurisdiction of the court in which the receiver was
    appointed, so far as justice necessitates.
      Capacity of a state court receiver to sue or be sued in federal
    court is governed by Rule 17(b).
      The last sentence added to Rule 66 assures the application of the
    rules in all matters except actual administration of the
    receivership estate itself. Since this implicitly carries with it
    the applicability of those rules relating to appellate procedure,
    the express reference thereto contained in Rule 66 has been
    stricken as superfluous. Under Rule 81(a)(1) the rules do not apply
    to bankruptcy proceedings except as they may be made applicable by
    order of the Supreme Court. Rule 66 is applicable to what is
    commonly known as a federal "chancery" or "equity" receiver, or
    similar type of court officer. It is not designed to regulate or
    affect receivers in bankruptcy, which are governed by the
    Bankruptcy Act and the General Orders. Since the Federal Rules are
    applicable in bankruptcy by virtue of General Orders in Bankruptcy
    36 and 37 [following section 53 of Title 11, U.S.C.] only to the
    extent that they are not inconsistent with the Bankruptcy Act or
    the General Orders, Rule 66 is not applicable to bankruptcy
    receivers. See 1 Collier on Bankruptcy (14th ed. by Moore and
    Oglebay) &#182;&#182; 2.23-2.36.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1948 AMENDMENT

    undesirable. See also Note to Rule 17(b), supra.

      This rule provides for deposit in court generally, continuing
    similar special provisions contained in such statutes as U.S.C.,
    Title 28, Sec. 41(26) [now 1335, 1397, 2361] (Original jurisdiction
    of bills of interpleader, and of bills in the nature of
    interpleader). See generally Howard v. United States, 184 U.S. 676
    (1902); United States Supreme Court Admiralty Rules (1920), Rules
    37 (Bringing Funds into Court), 41 (Funds in Court Registry), and
    42 (Claims Against Proceeds in Registry). With the first sentence,
    compare English Rules Under the Judicature Act (The Annual
    Practice, 1937) O. 22, r. 1(1).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1948 AMENDMENT       
      The first amendment substitutes the present statutory reference.
      Since the Act of June 26, 1934, was amended by Act of December
    21, 1944, 58 Stat. 845, correcting references are made.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 67 has been amended in three ways. The first change is the
    addition of the clause in the first sentence. Some courts have
    construed the present rule to permit deposit only when the party
    making it claims no interest in the fund or thing deposited. E.g.,
    Blasin-Stern v. Beech-Nut Life Savers Corp., 429 F.Supp. 533 (D.
    Puerto Rico 1975); Dinkins v. General Aniline & Film Corp., 214
    F.Supp. 281 (S.D.N.Y. 1963). However, there are situations in which
    a litigant may wish to be relieved of responsibility for a sum or
    thing, but continue to claim an interest in all or part of it. In
    these cases the deposit-in-court procedure should be available; in
    addition to the advantages to the party making the deposit, the
    procedure gives other litigants assurance that any judgment will be
    collectable. The amendment is intended to accomplish that.
      The second change is the addition of a requirement that the order
    of deposit be served on the clerk of the court in which the sum or
    thing is to be deposited. This is simply to assure that the clerk
    knows what is being deposited and what his responsibilities are
    with respect to the deposit. The latter point is particularly
    important since the rule as amended contemplates that deposits will
    be placed in interest-bearing accounts; the clerk must know what
    treatment has been ordered for the particular deposit.
      The third change is to require that any money be deposited in an
    interest-bearing account or instrument approved by the court.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 67 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

-HEAD-
    Rule 68. Offer of Judgment

-STATUTE-
      (a) Making an Offer; Judgment on an Accepted Offer. At least 14
    days before the date set for trial, a party defending against a
    claim may serve on an opposing party an offer to allow judgment on
    specified terms, with the costs then accrued. If, within 14 days
    after being served, the opposing party serves written notice
    accepting the offer, either party may then file the offer and
    notice of acceptance, plus proof of service. The clerk must then
    enter judgment.
      (b) Unaccepted Offer. An unaccepted offer is considered
    withdrawn, but it does not preclude a later offer. Evidence of an
    unaccepted offer is not admissible except in a proceeding to
    determine costs.
      (c) Offer After Liability is Determined. When one party's
    liability to another has been determined but the extent of
    liability remains to be determined by further proceedings, the
    party held liable may make an offer of judgment. It must be served
    within a reasonable time - but at least 14 days - before the date
    set for a hearing to determine the extent of liability.
      (d) Paying Costs After an Unaccepted Offer. If the judgment that
    the offeree finally obtains is not more favorable than the
    unaccepted offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the
    offer was made.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      The third sentence of Rule 68 has been altered to make clear that
    evidence of an unaccepted offer is admissible in a proceeding to
    determine the costs of the action but is not otherwise admissible.
      The two sentences substituted for the deleted last sentence of
    the rule assure a party the right to make a second offer where the
    situation permits - as, for example, where a prior offer was not
    accepted but the plaintiff's judgment is nullified and a new trial
    ordered, whereupon the defendant desires to make a second offer. It
    is implicit, however, that as long as the case continues - whether
    there be a first, second or third trial - and the defendant makes
    no further offer, his first and only offer will operate to save him
    the costs from the time of that offer if the plaintiff ultimately
    obtains a judgment less than the sum offered. In the case of
    successive offers not accepted, the offeror is saved the costs
    incurred after the making of the offer which was equal to or
    greater than the judgment ultimately obtained. These provisions
    should serve to encourage settlements and avoid protracted
    litigation.
      The phrase "before the trial begins", in the first sentence of
    the rule, has been construed in Cover v. Chicago Eye Shield Co.
    (C.C.A.7th, 1943) 136 F.(2d) 374, cert. den. (1943) 320 U.S. 749.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      This logical extension of the concept of offer of judgment is
    suggested by the common admiralty practice of determining liability
    before the amount of liability is determined.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 68 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Former Rule 68 allowed service of an offer of judgment more than
    10 days before the trial begins, or - if liability has been
    determined - at least 10 days before a hearing to determine the
    extent of liability. It may be difficult to know in advance when
    trial will begin or when a hearing will be held. The time is now
    measured from the date set for trial or hearing; resetting the date
    establishes a new time for serving the offer.
      The former 10-day periods are extended to 14 days to reflect the
    change in the Rule 6(a) method for computing periods less than 11
    days.

-HEAD-
    Rule 69. Execution

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General.
        (1) Money Judgment; Applicable Procedure. A money judgment is
      enforced by a writ of execution, unless the court directs
      otherwise. The procedure on execution - and in proceedings
      supplementary to and in aid of judgment or execution - must
      accord with the procedure of the state where the court is
      located, but a federal statute governs to the extent it applies.
        (2) Obtaining Discovery. In aid of the judgment or execution,
      the judgment creditor or a successor in interest whose interest
      appears of record may obtain discovery from any person -
      including the judgment debtor - as provided in these rules or by
      the procedure of the state where the court is located.

      (b) Against Certain Public Officers. When a judgment has been
    entered against a revenue officer in the circumstances stated in 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 2006, or against an officer of Congress in the
    circumstances stated in 2 U.S.C. Sec. 118, the judgment must be
    satisfied as those statutes provide.

      NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE  
      With respect to the provisions of the Soldiers' and Sailors'
    Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50 U.S.C. [App.] Sec. 501 et seq.) see
    Notes to Rules 62 and 64 herein.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1948 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment substitutes the present statutory reference.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1970 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment assures that, in aid of execution on a judgment,
    all discovery procedures provided in the rules are available and
    not just discovery via the taking of a deposition. Under the
    present language, one court has held that Rule 34 discovery is
    unavailable to the judgment creditor. M. Lowenstein & Sons, Inc. v.
    American Underwear Mfg. Co., 11 F.R.D. 172 (E.D.Pa. 1951).
    Notwithstanding the language, and relying heavily on legislative
    history referring to Rule 33, the Fifth Circuit has held that a
    judgment creditor may invoke Rule 33 interrogatories. United States
    v. McWhirter, 376 F.2d 102 (5th Cir. 1967). But the court's
    reasoning does not extend to discovery except as provided in Rules
    26-33. One commentator suggests that the existing language might
    properly be stretched to all discovery, 7 Moore's Federal Practice
    &#182; 69.05[1] (2d ed. 1966), but another believes that a rules
    amendment is needed. 3 Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice and
    Procedure 1484 (Wright ed. 1958). Both commentators and the court
    in McWhirter are clear that, as a matter of policy, Rule 69 should
    authorize the use of all discovery devices provided in the rules.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 69 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Amended Rule 69(b) incorporates directly the provisions of 2
    U.S.C. Sec. 118 and 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2006, deleting the incomplete
    statement in former Rule 69(b) of the circumstances in which
    execution does not issue against an officer.

-HEAD-
    Rule 70. Enforcing a Judgment for a Specific Act

-STATUTE-
      (a) Party's Failure to Act; Ordering Another to Act. If a
    judgment requires a party to convey land, to deliver a deed or
    other document, or to perform any other specific act and the party
    fails to comply within the time specified, the court may order the
    act to be done - at the disobedient party's expense - by another
    person appointed by the court. When done, the act has the same
    effect as if done by the party.
      (b) Vesting Title. If the real or personal property is within the
    district, the court - instead of ordering a conveyance - may enter
    a judgment divesting any party's title and vesting it in others.
    That judgment has the effect of a legally executed conveyance.
      (c) Obtaining a Writ of Attachment or Sequestration. On
    application by a party entitled to performance of an act, the clerk
    must issue a writ of attachment or sequestration against the
    disobedient party's property to compel obedience.
      (d) Obtaining a Writ of Execution or Assistance. On application
    by a party who obtains a judgment or order for possession, the
    clerk must issue a writ of execution or assistance.
      (e) Holding in Contempt. The court may also hold the disobedient
    party in contempt.

    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE IX. SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS

-HEAD-
    Rule 71.1. Condemning Real or Personal Property

-STATUTE-
      (a) Applicability of Other Rules. These rules govern proceedings
    to condemn real and personal property by eminent domain, except as
    this rule provides otherwise.
      (b) Joinder of Properties. The plaintiff may join separate pieces
    of property in a single action, no matter whether they are owned by
    the same persons or sought for the same use.
      (c) Complaint.
        (1) Caption. The complaint must contain a caption as provided
      in Rule 10(a). The plaintiff must, however, name as defendants
      both the property - designated generally by kind, quantity, and
      location - and at least one owner of some part of or interest in
      the property.
        (2) Contents. The complaint must contain a short and plain
      statement of the following:
          (A) the authority for the taking;
          (B) the uses for which the property is to be taken;
          (C) a description sufficient to identify the property;
          (D) the interests to be acquired; and
          (E) for each piece of property, a designation of each
        defendant who has been joined as an owner or owner of an
        interest in it.

        (3) Parties. When the action commences, the plaintiff need join
      as defendants only those persons who have or claim an interest in
      the property and whose names are then known. But before any
      hearing on compensation, the plaintiff must add as defendants all
      those persons who have or claim an interest and whose names have
      become known or can be found by a reasonably diligent search of
      the records, considering both the property's character and value
      and the interests to be acquired. All others may be made
      defendants under the designation "Unknown Owners."
        (4) Procedure. Notice must be served on all defendants as
      provided in Rule 71.1(d), whether they were named as defendants
      when the action commenced or were added later. A defendant may
      answer as provided in Rule 71.1(e). The court, meanwhile, may
      order any distribution of a deposit that the facts warrant.
        (5) Filing; Additional Copies. In addition to filing the
      complaint, the plaintiff must give the clerk at least one copy
      for the defendants' use and additional copies at the request of
      the clerk or a defendant.

      (d) Process.
        (1) Delivering Notice to the Clerk. On filing a complaint, the
      plaintiff must promptly deliver to the clerk joint or several
      notices directed to the named defendants. When adding defendants,
      the plaintiff must deliver to the clerk additional notices
      directed to the new defendants.
        (2) Contents of the Notice.
          (A) Main Contents. Each notice must name the court, the title
        of the action, and the defendant to whom it is directed. It
        must describe the property sufficiently to identify it, but
        need not describe any property other than that to be taken from
        the named defendant. The notice must also state:
            (i) that the action is to condemn property;
            (ii) the interest to be taken;
            (iii) the authority for the taking;
            (iv) the uses for which the property is to be taken;
            (v) that the defendant may serve an answer on the
          plaintiff's attorney within 21 days after being served with
          the notice;
            (vi) that the failure to so serve an answer constitutes
          consent to the taking and to the court's authority to proceed
          with the action and fix the compensation; and
            (vii) that a defendant who does not serve an answer may
          file a notice of appearance.

          (B) Conclusion. The notice must conclude with the name,
        telephone number, and e-mail address of the plaintiff's
        attorney and an address within the district in which the action
        is brought where the attorney may be served.

        (3) Serving the Notice.
          (A) Personal Service. When a defendant whose address is known
        resides within the United States or a territory subject to the
        administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the United States,
        personal service of the notice (without a copy of the
        complaint) must be made in accordance with Rule 4.
          (B) Service by Publication.
            (i) A defendant may be served by publication only when the
          plaintiff's attorney files a certificate stating that the
          attorney believes the defendant cannot be personally served,
          because after diligent inquiry within the state where the
          complaint is filed, the defendant's place of residence is
          still unknown or, if known, that it is beyond the territorial
          limits of personal service. Service is then made by
          publishing the notice - once a week for at least 3 successive
          weeks - in a newspaper published in the county where the
          property is located or, if there is no such newspaper, in a
          newspaper with general circulation where the property is
          located. Before the last publication, a copy of the notice
          must also be mailed to every defendant who cannot be
          personally served but whose place of residence is then known.
          Unknown owners may be served by publication in the same
          manner by a notice addressed to "Unknown Owners."
            (ii) Service by publication is complete on the date of the
          last publication. The plaintiff's attorney must prove
          publication and mailing by a certificate, attach a printed
          copy of the published notice, and mark on the copy the
          newspaper's name and the dates of publication.

        (4) Effect of Delivery and Service. Delivering the notice to
      the clerk and serving it have the same effect as serving a
      summons under Rule 4.
        (5) Amending the Notice; Proof of Service and Amending the
      Proof. Rule 4(a)(2) governs amending the notice. Rule 4(l)
      governs proof of service and amending it.

      (e) Appearance or Answer.
        (1) Notice of Appearance. A defendant that has no objection or
      defense to the taking of its property may serve a notice of
      appearance designating the property in which it claims an
      interest. The defendant must then be given notice of all later
      proceedings affecting the defendant.
        (2) Answer. A defendant that has an objection or defense to the
      taking must serve an answer within 21 days after being served
      with the notice. The answer must:
          (A) identify the property in which the defendant claims an
        interest;
          (B) state the nature and extent of the interest; and
          (C) state all the defendant's objections and defenses to the
        taking.

        (3) Waiver of Other Objections and Defenses; Evidence on
      Compensation. A defendant waives all objections and defenses not
      stated in its answer. No other pleading or motion asserting an
      additional objection or defense is allowed. But at the trial on
      compensation, a defendant - whether or not it has previously
      appeared or answered - may present evidence on the amount of
      compensation to be paid and may share in the award.

      (f) Amending Pleadings. Without leave of court, the plaintiff may
    - as often as it wants - amend the complaint at any time before the
    trial on compensation. But no amendment may be made if it would
    result in a dismissal inconsistent with Rule 71.1(i)(1) or (2). The
    plaintiff need not serve a copy of an amendment, but must serve
    notice of the filing, as provided in Rule 5(b), on every affected
    party who has appeared and, as provided in Rule 71.1(d), on every
    affected party who has not appeared. In addition, the plaintiff
    must give the clerk at least one copy of each amendment for the
    defendants' use, and additional copies at the request of the clerk
    or a defendant. A defendant may appear or answer in the time and
    manner and with the same effect as provided in Rule 71.1(e).
      (g) Substituting Parties. If a defendant dies, becomes
    incompetent, or transfers an interest after being joined, the court
    may, on motion and notice of hearing, order that the proper party
    be substituted. Service of the motion and notice on a nonparty must
    be made as provided in Rule 71.1(d)(3).
      (h) Trial of the Issues.
        (1) Issues Other Than Compensation; Compensation. In an action
      involving eminent domain under federal law, the court tries all
      issues, including compensation, except when compensation must be
      determined:
          (A) by any tribunal specially constituted by a federal
        statute to determine compensation; or
          (B) if there is no such tribunal, by a jury when a party
        demands one within the time to answer or within any additional
        time the court sets, unless the court appoints a commission.

        (2) Appointing a Commission; Commission's Powers and Report.
          (A) Reasons for Appointing. If a party has demanded a jury,
        the court may instead appoint a three-person commission to
        determine compensation because of the character, location, or
        quantity of the property to be condemned or for other just
        reasons.
          (B) Alternate Commissioners. The court may appoint up to two
        additional persons to serve as alternate commissioners to hear
        the case and replace commissioners who, before a decision is
        filed, the court finds unable or disqualified to perform their
        duties. Once the commission renders its final decision, the
        court must discharge any alternate who has not replaced a
        commissioner.
          (C) Examining the Prospective Commissioners. Before making
        its appointments, the court must advise the parties of the
        identity and qualifications of each prospective commissioner
        and alternate, and may permit the parties to examine them. The
        parties may not suggest appointees, but for good cause may
        object to a prospective commissioner or alternate.
          (D) Commission's Powers and Report. A commission has the
        powers of a master under Rule 53(c). Its action and report are
        determined by a majority. Rule 53(d), (e), and (f) apply to its
        action and report.

      (i) Dismissal of the Action or a Defendant.
        (1) Dismissing the Action.
          (A) By the Plaintiff. If no compensation hearing on a piece
        of property has begun, and if the plaintiff has not acquired
        title or a lesser interest or taken possession, the plaintiff
        may, without a court order, dismiss the action as to that
        property by filing a notice of dismissal briefly describing the
        property.
          (B) By Stipulation. Before a judgment is entered vesting the
        plaintiff with title or a lesser interest in or possession of
        property, the plaintiff and affected defendants may, without a
        court order, dismiss the action in whole or in part by filing a
        stipulation of dismissal. And if the parties so stipulate, the
        court may vacate a judgment already entered.
          (C) By Court Order. At any time before compensation has been
        determined and paid, the court may, after a motion and hearing,
        dismiss the action as to a piece of property. But if the
        plaintiff has already taken title, a lesser interest, or
        possession as to any part of it, the court must award
        compensation for the title, lesser interest, or possession
        taken.

        (2) Dismissing a Defendant. The court may at any time dismiss a
      defendant who was unnecessarily or improperly joined.
        (3) Effect. A dismissal is without prejudice unless otherwise
      stated in the notice, stipulation, or court order.

      (j) Deposit and Its Distribution.
        (1) Deposit. The plaintiff must deposit with the court any
      money required by law as a condition to the exercise of eminent
      domain and may make a deposit when allowed by statute.
        (2) Distribution; Adjusting Distribution. After a deposit, the
      court and attorneys must expedite the proceedings so as to
      distribute the deposit and to determine and pay compensation. If
      the compensation finally awarded to a defendant exceeds the
      amount distributed to that defendant, the court must enter
      judgment against the plaintiff for the deficiency. If the
      compensation awarded to a defendant is less than the amount
      distributed to that defendant, the court must enter judgment
      against that defendant for the overpayment.

      (k) Condemnation Under a State's Power of Eminent Domain. This
    rule governs an action involving eminent domain under state law.
    But if state law provides for trying an issue by jury - or for
    trying the issue of compensation by jury or commission or both -
    that law governs.
      (l) Costs. Costs are not subject to Rule 54(d).

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1951            

      Supplementary report
      The Court will remember that at its conference on December 2,
    1948, the discussion was confined to subdivision (h) of the rule (*
    * *), the particular question being whether the tribunal to award
    compensation should be a commission or a jury in cases where the
    Congress has not made specific provision on the subject. The
    Advisory Committee was agreed from the outset that a rule should
    not be promulgated which would overturn the decision of the
    Congress as to the kind of tribunal to fix compensation, provided
    that the system established by Congress was found to be working
    well. We found two instances where the Congress had specified the
    kind of tribunal to fix compensation. One case was the District of
    Columbia (U.S.C., [former] Title 40, Secs. 361-386) where a rather
    unique system exists under which the court is required in all cases
    to order the selection of a "jury" of five from among not less than
    twenty names drawn from "the special box provided by law." They
    must have the usual qualifications of jurors and in addition must
    be freeholders of the District and not in the service of the United
    States or the District. That system has been in effect for many
    years, and our inquiry revealed that it works well under the
    conditions prevailing in the District, and is satisfactory to the
    courts of the District, the legal profession and to property
    owners.
      The other instance is that of the Tennessee Valley Authority,
    where the act of Congress (U.S.C., Title 16, Sec. 831x) provides
    that compensation is fixed by three disinterested commissioners
    appointed by the court, whose award goes before the District Court
    for confirmation or modification. The Advisory Committee made a
    thorough inquiry into the practical operation of the TVA commission
    system. We obtained from counsel for the TVA the results of their
    experience, which afforded convincing proof that the commission
    system is preferable under the conditions affecting TVA and that
    the jury system would not work satisfactorily. We then, under date
    of February 6, 1947, wrote every Federal judge who had ever sat in
    a TVA condemnation case, asking his views as to whether the
    commission system is satisfactory and whether a jury system should
    be preferred. Of 21 responses from the judges 17 approved the
    commission system and opposed the substitution of a jury system for
    the TVA. Many of the judges went further and opposed the use of
    juries in any condemnation cases. Three of the judges preferred the
    jury system, and one dealt only with the TVA provision for a three
    judge district court. The Advisory Committee has not considered
    abolition of the three judge requirement of the TVA Act, because it
    seemed to raise a question of jurisdiction, which cannot be altered
    by rule. Nevertheless the Department of Justice continued its
    advocacy of the jury system for its asserted expedition and
    economy; and others favored a uniform procedure. In consequence of
    these divided counsels the Advisory Committee was itself divided,
    but in its May 1948 Report to the Court recommended the following
    rule as approved by a majority (* * *):
      (h) Trial. If the action involves the exercise of the power of
    eminent domain under the law of the United States, any tribunal
    specially constituted by an Act of Congress governing the case for
    the trial of the issue of just compensation shall be the tribunal
    for the determination of that issue; but if there is no such
    specially constituted tribunal any party may have a trial by jury
    of the issue of just compensation by filing a demand therefor
    within the time allowed for answer or within such further time as
    the court may fix. Trial of all issues shall otherwise be by the
    court.
      The effect of this was to preserve the existing systems in the
    District of Columbia and in TVA cases, but to provide for a jury to
    fix compensation in all other cases.
      Before the Court's conference of December 2, 1948, the Chief
    Justice informed the Committee that the Court was particularly
    interested in the views expressed by Judge John Paul, judge of the
    United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia,
    in a letter from him to the chairman of the Advisory Committee,
    dated February 13, 1947. Copies of all the letters from judges who
    had sat in TVA cases had been made available to the Court, and this
    letter from Judge Paul is one of them. Judge Paul strongly opposed
    jury trials and recommended the commission system in large projects
    like the TVA, and his views seemed to have impressed the Court and
    to have been the occasion for the conference.
      The reasons which convinced the Advisory Committee that the use
    of commissioners instead of juries is desirable in TVA cases were
    these:
      1. The TVA condemns large areas of land of similar kind,
    involving many owners. Uniformity in awards is essential. The
    commission system tends to prevent discrimination and provide for
    uniformity in compensation. The jury system tends to lack of
    uniformity. Once a reasonable and uniform standard of values for
    the area has been settled by a commission, litigation ends and
    settlements result.
      2. Where large areas are involved many small landowners reside at
    great distances from the place where a court sits. It is a great
    hardship on humble people to have to travel long distances to
    attend a jury trial. A commission may travel around and receive the
    evidence of the owner near his home.
      3. It is impracticable to take juries long distances to view the
    premises.
      4. If the cases are tried by juries the burden on the time of the
    courts is excessive.
      These considerations are the very ones Judge Paul stressed in his
    letter. He pointed out that they applied not only to the TVA but to
    other large governmental projects, such as flood control,
    hydroelectric power, reclamation, national forests, and others. So
    when the representatives of the Advisory Committee appeared at the
    Court's conference December 2, 1948, they found it difficult to
    justify the proposed provision in subdivision (h) of the rule that
    a jury should be used to fix compensation in all cases where
    Congress had not specified the tribunal. If our reasons for
    preserving the TVA system were sound, provision for a jury in
    similar projects of like magnitude seemed unsound.
      Aware of the apparent inconsistency between the acceptance of the
    TVA system and the provision for a jury in all other cases, the
    members of the Committee attending the conference of December 2,
    1948, then suggested that in the other cases the choice of jury or
    commission be left to the discretion of the District Court, going
    back to a suggestion previously made by Committee members and
    reported at page 15 of the Preliminary Draft of June 1947. They
    called the attention of the Court to the fact that the entire
    Advisory Committee had not been consulted about this suggestion and
    proposed that the draft be returned to the Committee for further
    consideration, and that was done.
      The proposal we now make for subdivision (h) is as follows:
      (h) Trial. If the action involves the exercise of the power of
    eminent domain under the law of the United States, any tribunal
    specially constituted by an Act of Congress governing the case for
    the trial of the issue of just compensation shall be the tribunal
    for the determination of that issue; but if there is no such
    specially constituted tribunal any party may have a trial by jury
    of the issue of just compensation by filing a demand therefor
    within the time allowed for answer or within such further time as
    the court may fix, unless the court in its discretion orders that,
    because of the character, location, or quantity of the property to
    be condemned, or for other reasons in the interest of justice, the
    issue of compensation shall be determined by a commission of three
    persons appointed by it. If a commission is appointed it shall have
    the powers of a master provided in subdivision (c) of Rule 53
    proceedings before it shall be governed by the provisions of
    paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (d) of Rule 53. Its action
    and report shall be determined by a majority and its findings and
    report shall have the effect, and be dealt with by the court in
    accordance with the practice, prescribed in paragraph (2) of
    subdivision (e) of Rule 53. Trial of all issues shall otherwise be
    by the court.
      In the 1948 draft the Committee had been almost evenly divided as
    between jury or commission and that made it easy for us to agree on
    the present draft. It would be difficult to state in a rule the
    various conditions to control the District Court in its choice and
    we have merely stated generally the matters which should be
    considered by the District Court.
      The rule as now drafted seems to meet Judge Paul's objection. In
    large projects like the TVA the court may decide to use a
    commission. In a great number of cases involving only sites for
    buildings or other small areas, where use of a jury is appropriate,
    a jury may be chosen. The District Court's discretion may also be
    influenced by local preference or habit, and the preference of the
    Department of Justice and the reasons for its preference will
    doubtless be given weight. The Committee is convinced that there
    are some types of cases in which use of a commission is preferable
    and others in which a jury may be appropriately used, and that it
    would be a mistake to provide that the same kind of tribunal should
    be used in all cases. We think the available evidence clearly leads
    to that conclusion.
      When this suggestion was made at the conference of December 2,
    1948, representatives of the Department of Justice opposed it,
    expressing opposition to the use of a commission in any case. Their
    principal ground for opposition to commissions was then based on
    the assertion that the commission system is too expensive because
    courts allow commissioners too large compensation. The obvious
    answer to that is that the compensation of commissioners ought to
    be fixed or limited by law, as was done in the TVA Act, and the
    agency dealing with appropriations - either the Administrative
    Office or some other interested department of the government -
    should correct that evil, if evil there be, by obtaining such
    legislation. Authority to promulgate rules of procedure does not
    include power to fix compensation of government employees. The
    Advisory Committee is not convinced that even without such
    legislation the commission system is more expensive than the jury
    system. The expense of jury trials includes not only the per diem
    and mileage of the jurors impaneled for a case but like items for
    the entire venire. In computing cost of jury trials, the salaries
    of court officials, judges, clerks, marshals and deputies must be
    considered. No figures have been given to the Committee to
    establish that the cost of the commission system is the greater.
      We earnestly recommend the rule as now drafted for promulgation
    by the Court, in the public interest.
      The Advisory Committee have given more time to this rule,
    including time required for conferences with the Department of
    Justice to hear statements of its representatives, than has been
    required by any other rule. The rule may not be perfect but if
    faults develop in practice they may be promptly cured. Certainly
    the present conformity system is atrocious.
      Under state practices, just compensation is normally determined
    by one of three methods: by commissioners; by commissioners with a
    right of appeal to and trial de novo before a jury; and by a jury,
    without a commission. A trial to the court or to the court
    including a master are, however, other methods that are
    occasionally used. Approximately 5 states use only commissioners;
    23 states use commissioners with a trial de novo before a jury; and
    18 states use only the jury. This classification is advisedly
    stated in approximate terms, since the same state may utilize
    diverse methods, depending upon different types of condemnations or
    upon the locality of the property, and since the methods used in a
    few states do not permit of a categorical classification. To reject
    the proposed rule and leave the situation as it is would not
    satisfy the views of the Department of Justice. The Department and
    the Advisory Committee agree that the use of a commission, with
    appeal to a jury, is a wasteful system.
      The Department of Justice has a voluminous "Manual on Federal
    Eminent Domain," the 1940 edition of which has 948 pages with an
    appendix of 73 more pages. The title page informs us the
    preparation of the manual was begun during the incumbency of
    Attorney General Cummings, was continued under Attorney General
    Murphy, and completed during the incumbency of Attorney General
    Jackson. The preface contains the following statement:
      It should also be mentioned that the research incorporated in the
    manual would be of invaluable assistance in the drafting of a new
    uniform code, or rules of court, for federal condemnation
    proceedings, which are now greatly confused, not only by the
    existence of over seventy federal statutes governing condemnations
    for different purposes - statutes which sometimes conflict with one
    another - but also by the countless problems occasioned by the
    requirements of conformity to state law. Progress of the work has
    already demonstrated that the need for such reform exists.
      It is not surprising that more than once Attorneys General have
    asked the Advisory Committee to prepare a federal rule and rescue
    the government from this morass.
      The Department of Justice has twice tried and failed to persuade
    the Congress to provide that juries shall be used in all
    condemnation cases. The debates in Congress show that part of the
    opposition to the Department of Justice's bills came from
    representatives opposed to jury trials in all cases, and in part
    from a preference for the conformity system. Our present proposal
    opens the door for district judges to yield to local preferences on
    the subject. It does much for the Department's points of view. It
    is a great improvement over the present so-called conformity
    system. It does away with the wasteful "double" system prevailing
    in 23 states where awards by commissions are followed by jury
    trials.
      Aside from the question as to the choice of a tribunal to award
    compensation, the proposed rule would afford a simple and improved
    procedure.
      We turn now to an itemized explanation of the other changes we
    have made in the 1948 draft. Some of these result from recent
    amendments to the Judicial Code. Others result from a
    reconsideration by the Advisory Committee of provisions which we
    thought could be improved.
      1. In the amended Judicial Code, the district courts are
    designated as "United States District Courts" instead of "District
    Courts of the United States," and a corresponding change has been
    made in the rule.
      2. After the 1948 draft was referred back to the committee, the
    provision in subdivision (c)(2), relating to naming defendants, * *
    * which provided that the plaintiff shall add as defendants all
    persons having or claiming an interest in that property whose names
    can be ascertained by a search of the records to the extent
    commonly made by competent searchers of title in the vicinity "in
    light of the type and value of the property involved," the phrase
    in quotation marks was changed to read "in the light of the
    character and value of the property involved and the interests to
    be acquired."
      The Department of Justice made a counter proposal * * * that
    there be substituted the words "reasonably diligent search of the
    records, considering the type." When the American Bar Association
    thereafter considered the draft, it approved the Advisory
    Committee's draft of this subdivision, but said that it had no
    objection to the Department's suggestion. Thereafter, in an effort
    to eliminate controversy, the Advisory Committee accepted the
    Department's suggestion as to (c)(2), using the word "character"
    instead of the word "type."
      The Department of Justice also suggested that in subdivision
    (d)(3)(2) relating to service by publication, the search for a
    defendant's residence as a preliminary to publication be limited to
    the state in which the complaint is filed. Here again the American
    Bar Association's report expressed the view that the Department's
    suggestion was unobjectionable and the Advisory Committee thereupon
    adopted it.
      3. Subdivision (k) of the 1948 draft is as follows:
      (k) Condemnation Under a State's Power of Eminent Domain. If the
    action involves the exercise of the power of eminent domain under
    the law of a state, the practice herein prescribed may be altered
    to the extent necessary to observe and enforce any condition
    affecting the substantial rights of a litigant attached by the
    state law to the exercise of the state's power of eminent domain.
      Occasionally condemnation cases under a state's power of eminent
    domain reach a United States District Court because of diversity of
    citizenship. Such cases are rare, but provision should be made for
    them.
      The 1948 draft of (k) required a district court to decide whether
    a provision of state law specifying the tribunal to award
    compensation is or is not a "condition" attached to the exercise of
    the state's power. On reconsideration we concluded that it would be
    wise to redraft (k) so as to avoid that troublesome question. As to
    conditions in state laws which affect the substantial rights of a
    litigant, the district courts would be bound to give them effect
    without any rule on the subject. Accordingly we present two
    alternative revisions. One suggestion supported by a majority of
    the Advisory Committee is as follows:
      (k) Condemnation Under a State's Power of Eminent Domain. The
    practice herein prescribed governs in actions involving the
    exercise of the power of eminent domain under the law of a state,
    provided that if the state law makes provision for trial of any
    issue by jury, or for trial of the issue of compensation by jury or
    commission or both, that provision shall be followed.
      The other is as follows:
      (k) Condemnation Under a State's Power of Eminent Domain. The
    practice herein prescribed governs in actions involving the
    exercise of the power of eminent domain under the law of a state,
    provided that if the state law gives a right to a trial by jury
    such a trial shall in any case be allowed to the party demanding it
    within the time permitted by these rules, and in that event no
    hearing before a commission shall be had.
      The first proposal accepts the state law as to the tribunals to
    fix compensation, and in that respect leaves the parties in
    precisely the same situation as if the case were pending in a state
    court, including the use of a commission with appeal to a jury, if
    the state law so provides. It has the effect of avoiding any
    question as to whether the decisions in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins and
    later cases have application to a situation of this kind.
      The second proposal gives the parties a right to a jury trial if
    that is provided for by state law, but prevents the use of both
    commission and jury. Those members of the Committee who favor the
    second proposal do so because of the obvious objections to the
    double trial, with a commission and appeal to a jury. As the
    decisions in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins and later cases may have a
    bearing on this point, and the Committee is divided, we think both
    proposals should be placed before the Court.
      4. The provision * * * of the 1948 draft * * * prescribing the
    effective date of the rule was drafted before the recent amendment
    of the Judicial Code on that subject. On May 10, 1950, the
    President approved an act which amended section 2072 of Title 28,
    United States Code, to read as follows:
      Such rules shall not take effect until they have been reported to
    Congress by the Chief Justice at or after the beginning of a
    regular session thereof but not later than the first day of May,
    and until the expiration of 90 days after they have been thus
    reported.
      To conform to the statute now in force, we suggest a provision as
    follows:
      Effective Date. This Rule 71A and the amendment to Rule 81(a)
    will take effect on August 1, 1951. Rule 71A governs all
    proceedings in actions brought after it takes effect and also all
    further proceedings in actions then pending, except to the extent
    that in the opinion of the court its application in a particular
    action pending when the rule takes effect would not be feasible or
    would work injustice, in which event the former procedure applies.
      If the rule is not reported to Congress by May 1, 1951, this
    provision must be altered.
      5. We call attention to the fact that the proposed rule does not
    contain a provision for the procedure to be followed in order to
    exercise the right of the United States to take immediate
    possession or title, when the condemnation proceeding is begun.
    There are several statutes conferring such a right which are cited
    in the original notes to the May 1948 draft * * *. The existence of
    this right is taken into account in the rule. In paragraph (c)(2),
    * * * it is stated: "Upon the commencement of the action, the
    plaintiff need join as defendants only the persons having or
    claiming an interest in the property whose names are then known."
    That is to enable the United States to exercise the right to
    immediate title or possession without the delay involved in
    ascertaining the names of all interested parties. The right is also
    taken into account in the provision relating to dismissal
    (paragraph (i) subdivisions (1), (2), and (3), * * *); also in
    paragraph (j) relating to deposits and their distribution.
      The Advisory Committee considered whether the procedure for
    exercising the right should be specified in the rule and decided
    against it, as the procedure now being followed seems to be giving
    no trouble, and to draft a rule to fit all the statutes on the
    subject might create confusion.
      The American Bar Association has taken an active interest in a
    rule for condemnation cases. In 1944 its House of Delegates adopted
    a resolution which among other things resolved:
      That before adoption by the Supreme Court of the United States of
    any redraft of the proposed rule, time and opportunity should be
    afforded to the bar to consider and make recommendations concerning
    any such redraft.
      Accordingly, in 1950 the revised draft was submitted to the
    American Bar Association and its section of real property, probate
    and trust law appointed a committee to consider it. That committee
    was supplied with copies of the written statement from the
    Department of Justice giving the reasons relied on by the
    Department for preferring a rule to use juries in all cases. The
    Advisory Committee's report was approved at a meeting of the
    section of real property law, and by the House of Delegates at the
    annual meeting of September 1950. The American Bar Association
    report gave particular attention to the question whether juries or
    commissions should be used to fix compensation, approved the
    Advisory Committee's solution appearing in their latest draft
    designed to allow use of commissions in projects comparable to the
    TVA, and rejected the proposal for use of juries in all cases.
      In November 1950 a committee of the Federal Bar Association, the
    chairman of which was a Special Assistant to the Attorney General,
    made a report which reflected the attitude of the Department of
    Justice on the condemnation rule.
      Aside from subdivision (h) about the tribunal to award
    compensation the final draft of the condemnation rule here
    presented has the approval of the American Bar Association and, we
    understand, the Department of Justice, and we do not know of any
    opposition to it. Subdivision (h) has the unanimous approval of the
    Advisory Committee and has been approved by the American Bar
    Association. The use of commissions in TVA cases, and, by fair
    inference, in cases comparable to the TVA, is supported by 17 out
    of 20 judges who up to 1947 had sat in TVA cases. The legal staff
    of the TVA has vigorously objected to the substitution of juries
    for commissions in TVA cases. We regret to report that the
    Department of Justice still asks that subdivision (h) be altered to
    provide for jury trials in all cases where Congress has not
    specified the tribunal. We understand that the Department approves
    the proposal that the system prevailing in 23 states for the
    "double" trial, by commission with appeal to and trial de novo
    before a jury, should be abolished, and also asks that on demand a
    jury should be substituted for a commission, in those states where
    use of a commission alone is now required. The Advisory Committee
    has no evidence that commissions do not operate satisfactorily in
    the case of projects comparable to the TVA.

      Original report
      General Statement. 1. Background. When the Advisory Committee was
    formulating its recommendations to the Court concerning rules of
    procedure, which subsequently became the Federal Rules of 1938, the
    Committee concluded at an early stage not to fix the procedure in
    condemnation cases. This is a matter principally involving the
    exercise of the federal power of eminent domain, as very few
    condemnation cases involving the state's power reach the United
    States District Courts. The Committee's reasons at that time were
    that inasmuch as condemnation proceedings by the United States are
    governed by statutes of the United States, prescribing different
    procedure for various agencies and departments of the government,
    or, in the absence of such statutes, by local state practice under
    the Conformity Act ([former] 40 U.S.C. sec. 258), it would be
    extremely difficult to draft a uniform rule satisfactory to the
    various agencies and departments of the government and to private
    parties; and that there was no general demand for a uniform rule.
    The Committee continued in that belief until shortly before the
    preparation of the April 1937 Draft of the Rules, when the
    officials of the Department of Justice having to do with
    condemnation cases urgently requested the Committee to propose
    rules on this subject. The Committee undertook the task and drafted
    a Condemnation Rule which appeared for the first time as Rule 74 of
    the April 1937 Draft. After the publication and distribution of
    this initial draft many objections were urged against it by counsel
    for various governmental agencies, whose procedure in condemnation
    cases was prescribed by federal statutes. Some of these agencies
    wanted to be excepted in whole or in part from the operation of the
    uniform rule proposed in April 1937. And the Department of Justice
    changed its position and stated that it preferred to have
    government condemnations conducted by local attorneys familiar with
    the state practice, which was applied under the Conformity Act
    where the Acts of Congress do not prescribe the practice; that it
    preferred to work under the Conformity Act without a uniform rule
    of procedure. The profession generally showed little interest in
    the proposed uniform rule. For these reasons the Advisory Committee
    in its Final Report to the Court in November 1937 proposed that all
    of Rule 74 be stricken and that the Federal Rules be made
    applicable only to appeals in condemnation cases. See note to Rule
    74 of the Final Report.
      Some six or seven years later when the Advisory Committee was
    considering the subject of amendments to the Federal Rules both
    government officials and the profession generally urged the
    adoption of some uniform procedure. This demand grew out of the
    volume of condemnation proceedings instituted during the war, and
    the general feeling of dissatisfaction with the diverse
    condemnation procedures that were applicable in the federal courts.
    A strongly held belief was that both the sovereign's power to
    condemn and the property owner's right to compensation could be
    promoted by a simplified rule. As a consequence the Committee
    proposed a Rule 71A on the subject of condemnation in its
    Preliminary Draft of May 1944. In the Second Preliminary Draft of
    May 1945 this earlier proposed Rule 71A was, however, omitted. The
    Committee did not then feel that it had sufficient time to prepare
    a revised draft satisfactorily to it which would meet legitimate
    objections made to the draft of May 1944. To avoid unduly delaying
    the proposed amendments to existing rules the Committee concluded
    to proceed in the regular way with the preparation of the
    amendments to these rules and deal with the question of a
    condemnation rule as an independent matter. As a consequence it
    made no recommendations to the Court on condemnation in its Final
    Report of Proposed Amendments of June 1946; and the amendments
    which the Court adopted in December 1946 did not deal with
    condemnation. After concluding its task relative to amendments, the
    Committee returned to a consideration of eminent domain, its
    proposed Rule 71A of May 1944, the suggestions and criticisms that
    had been presented in the interim, and in June 1947 prepared and
    distributed to the profession another draft of a proposed
    condemnation rule. This draft contained several alternative
    provisions, specifically called attention to and asked for opinion
    relative to these matters, and in particular as to the constitution
    of the tribunal to award compensation. The present draft was based
    on the June 1947 formulation, in light of the advice of the
    profession on both matters of substance and form.
      2. Statutory Provisions. The need for a uniform condemnation rule
    in the federal courts arises from the fact that by various statutes
    Congress has prescribed diverse procedures for certain condemnation
    proceedings, and, in the absence of such statutes, has prescribed
    conformity to local state practice under [former] 40 U.S.C. Sec.
    258. This general conformity adds to the diversity of procedure
    since in the United States there are multifarious methods of
    procedure in existence. Thus in 1931 it was said that there were
    269 different methods of judicial procedure in different classes of
    condemnation cases and 56 methods of nonjudicial or administrative
    procedure. First Report of Judicial Council of Michigan, 1931, Sec.
    46, pp. 55-56. These numbers have not decreased. Consequently, the
    general requirement of conformity to state practice and procedure,
    particularly where the condemnor is the United States, leads to
    expense, delay and uncertainty. In advocacy of a uniform federal
    rule, see Armstrong, Proposed Amendments to Federal Rules for Civil
    Procedure 1944, 4 F.R.D. 124, 134; id., Report of the Advisory
    Committee on Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Recommending
    Amendments, 1946, 5 F.R.D. 339, 357.
      There are a great variety of Acts of Congress authorizing the
    exercise of the power of eminent domain by the United States and
    its officers and agencies. These statutes for the most part do not
    specify the exact procedure to be followed, but where procedure is
    prescribed, it is by no means uniform.
      The following are instances of Acts which merely authorize the
    exercise of the power without specific declaration as to the
    procedure:

    U.S.C., Title 16:

       Sec. 404c-11 (Mammoth Cave National Park; acquisition of lands,
        interests in lands or other property for park by the Secretary
        of the Interior).
       Sec. 426d (Stones River National Park; acquisition of land for
        parks by the Secretary of the Army).
       Sec. 450aa (George Washington Carver National Monument;
        acquisition of land by the Secretary of the Interior).
       Sec. 517 (National forest reservation; title to lands to be
        acquired by the Secretary of Agriculture).

    U.S.C., Title 42:

       Secs. 1805(b)(5), 1813(b) (Atomic Energy Act).

      The following are instances of Acts which authorized condemnation
    and declare that the procedure is to conform with that of similar
    actions in state courts:

    U.S.C., Title 16:

       Sec. 423k (Richmond National Battlefield Park; acquisition of
        lands by the Secretary of the Interior).
       Sec. 714 (Exercise by water power licensee of power of eminent
        domain).

    U.S.C., Title 24:

       Sec. 78 (Condemnation of land for the former National Home for
        Disabled Volunteer Soldiers).

    U.S.C., Title 33:

       Sec. 591 (Condemnation of lands and materials for river and
        harbor improvement by the Secretary of the Army).

    U.S.C., Title 40:

       Sec. 257 [now 3113] (Condemnation of realty for sites for public
        building and for other public uses by the Secretary of the
        Treasury authorized).
       Sec. 258 [former] (Same procedure).

    U.S.C., Title 50:

       Sec. 171 (Acquisition of land by the Secretary of the Army for
        national defense).
       Sec. 172 (Acquisition of property by the Secretary of the Army,
        etc., for production of lumber).
       Sec. 632 App. (Second War Powers Act, 1942; acquisition of real
        property for war purposes by the Secretary of the Army, the
        Secretary of the Navy and others).

      The following are Acts in which a more or less complete code of
    procedure is set forth in connection with the taking:

    U.S.C., Title 16:

       Sec. 831x (Condemnation by Tennessee Valley Authority).

    U.S.C., Title 40:

       Secs. 361-386 [former] (Acquisition of lands in District of
        Columbia for use of United States; condemnation).

      3. Adjustment of Rule to Statutory Provisions. While it was
    apparent that the principle of uniformity should be the basis for a
    rule to replace the multiple diverse procedures set out above,
    there remained a serious question as to whether an exception could
    properly be made relative to the method of determining
    compensation. Where Congress had provided for conformity to state
    law the following were the general methods in use: an initial
    determination by commissioners, with appeal to a judge; an initial
    award, likewise made by commissioners, but with the appeal to a
    jury; and determination by a jury without a previous award by
    commissioners. In two situations Congress had specified the
    tribunal to determine the issue of compensation: condemnation by
    the Tennessee Valley Authority; and condemnation in the District of
    Columbia. Under the TVA procedure the initial determination of
    value is by three disinterested commissioners, appointed by the
    court, from a locality other than the one in which the land lies.
    Either party may except to the award of the commission; in that
    case the exceptions are to be heard by three district judges
    (unless the parties stipulate for a lesser number), with a right of
    appeal to the circuit court of appeals. The TVA is a regional
    agency. It is faced with the necessity of acquiring a very
    substantial acreage within a relatively small area, and charged
    with the task of carrying on within the Tennessee Valley and in
    cooperation with the local people a permanent program involving
    navigation and flood control, electric power, soil conservation,
    and general regional development. The success of this program is
    partially dependent upon the good will and cooperation of the
    people of the Tennessee Valley, and this in turn partially depends
    upon the land acquisition program. Disproportionate awards among
    landowners would create dissatisfaction and ill will. To secure
    uniformity in treatment Congress provided the rather unique
    procedure of the three-judge court to review de novo the initial
    award of the commissioners. This procedure has worked to the
    satisfaction of the property owners and the TVA. A full statement
    of the TVA position and experience is set forth in Preliminary
    Draft of Proposed Rule to Govern Condemnation Cases (June, 1947) 15-
    19. A large majority of the district judges with experience under
    this procedure approve it, subject to some objection to the
    requirement for a three-judge district court to review
    commissioners' awards. A statutory three-judge requirement is,
    however, jurisdictional and must be strictly followed. Stratton v.
    St. Louis, Southwestern Ry. Co., 1930, 51 S.Ct. 8, 282 U.S. 10, 75
    L.Ed. 135; Ayrshire Collieries Corp. v. United States, 1947, 67
    S.Ct. 1168, 331 U.S. 132, 91 L.Ed. 1391. Hence except insofar as
    the TVA statute itself authorizes the parties to stipulate for a
    court of less than three judges, the requirement must be followed,
    and would seem to be beyond alteration by court rule even if change
    were thought desirable. Accordingly the TVA procedure is retained
    for the determination of compensation in TVA condemnation cases. It
    was also thought desirable to retain the specific method Congress
    had prescribed for the District of Columbia, which is a so-called
    jury of five appointed by the court. This is a local matter and the
    specific treatment accorded by Congress has given local
    satisfaction.
      Aside from the foregoing limited exceptions dealing with the TVA
    and the District of Columbia, the question was whether a uniform
    method for determining compensation should be a commission with
    appeal to a district judge, or a commission with appeal to a jury,
    or a jury without a commission. Experience with the commission on a
    nationwide basis, and in particular with the utilization of a
    commission followed by an appeal to a jury, has been that the
    commission is time consuming and expensive. Furthermore, it is
    largely a futile procedure where it is preparatory to jury trial.
    Since in the bulk of states a land owner is entitled eventually to
    a jury trial, since the jury is a traditional tribunal for the
    determination of questions of value, and since experience with
    juries has proved satisfactory to both government and land owner,
    the right to jury trial is adopted as the general rule.
    Condemnation involving the TVA and the District of Columbia are the
    two exceptions. See Note to Subdivision (h), infra.
      Note to Subdivision (a). As originally promulgated the Federal
    Rules governed appeals in condemnation proceedings but were not
    otherwise applicable. Rule 81(a)(7). Pre-appeal procedure, in the
    main, conformed to state procedure. See statutes and discussion,
    supra. The purpose of Rule 71A is to provide a uniform procedure
    for condemnation in the federal district courts, including the
    District of Columbia. To achieve this purpose Rule 71A prescribes
    such specialized procedure as is required by condemnation
    proceedings, otherwise it utilizes the general framework of the
    Federal Rules where specific detail is unnecessary. The adoption of
    Rule 71A, of course, renders paragraph (7) of Rule 81(a)
    unnecessary.
      The promulgation of a rule for condemnation procedure is within
    the rule-making power. The Enabling Act [Act of June 19, 1934, c.
    651, Secs. 1, 2 (48 Stat. 1064), 28 U.S.C. Secs. 723b, 723c [see
    2072]] gives the Supreme Court "the power to prescribe, by general
    rules * * * the forms of process, writs, pleadings, and motions,
    and the practice and procedure in civil actions at law." Such
    rules, however, must not abridge, enlarge, or modify substantive
    rights. In Kohl v. United States, 1875, 91 U.S. 367, 23 L.Ed. 449,
    a proceeding instituted by the United States to appropriate land
    for a post-office site under a statute enacted for such purpose,
    the Supreme Court held that "a proceeding to take land in virtue of
    the government's eminent domain, and determining the compensation
    to be made for it, is * * * a suit at common law, when initiated in
    a court." See also Madisonville Traction Co. v. Saint Bernard
    Mining Co., 1905, 25 S.Ct. 251, 196 U.S. 239, 23 L.Ed. 449, infra,
    under subdivision (k). And the Conformity Act, [former] 40 U.S.C.
    Sec. 258, which is superseded by Rule 71A, deals only with
    "practice, pleadings, forms and proceedings and not with matters of
    substantive laws." United States v. 243.22 Acres of Land in Village
    of Farmingdale, Town of Babylon, Suffolk County, N.Y., D.C.N.Y.
    1942, 43 F.Supp. 561, affirmed 129 F.2d 678, certiorari denied, 63
    S.Ct. 441, 317 U.S. 698, 87 L.Ed. 558.
      Rule 71A affords a uniform procedure for all cases of
    condemnation invoking the national power of eminent domain, and, to
    the extent stated in subdivision (k), for cases invoking a state's
    power of eminent domain; and supplants all statutes prescribing a
    different procedure. While the almost exclusive utility of the rule
    is for the condemnation of real property, it also applies to the
    condemnation of personal property, either as an incident to real
    property or as the sole object of the proceeding, when permitted or
    required by statute. See 38 U.S.C. [former] Sec. 438j (World War
    Veterans' Relief Act); 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1805, 1811, 1813 (Atomic
    Energy Act); 50 U.S.C. Sec. 79 (Nitrates Act); 50 U.S.C. Secs. 161-
    166 (Helium Gas Act). Requisitioning of personal property with the
    right in the owner to sue the United States, where the compensation
    cannot be agreed upon (see 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1813, supra, for example)
    will continue to be the normal method of acquiring personal
    property and Rule 71A in no way interferes with or restricts any
    such right. Only where the law requires or permits the formal
    procedure of condemnation to be utilized will the rule have any
    applicability to the acquisition of personal property.
      Rule 71A is not intended to and does not supersede the Act of
    February 26, 1931, ch. 307, Secs. 1-5 (46 Stat. 1421), 40 U.S.C.
    Secs. 258a-258e [now 40 U.S.C. 3114, 3115, 3118], which is a
    supplementary condemnation statute, permissive in its nature and
    designed to permit the prompt acquisition of title by the United
    States, pending the condemnation proceeding, upon a deposit in
    court. See United States v. 76,800 Acres, More or Less, of Land, in
    Bryan and Liberty Counties, Ga., D.C.Ga. 1942, 44 F.Supp. 653;
    United States v. 17,280 Acres of Land, More or Less, Situated in
    Saunders County, Nebr., D.C.Neb. 1942, 47 F.Supp. 267. The same is
    true insofar as the following or any other statutes authorize the
    acquisition of title or the taking of immediate possession:

    U.S.C., Title 33:

       Sec. 594 (When immediate possession of land may be taken; for a
        work of river and harbor improvements).

    U.S.C., Title 42:

       Sec. 1813(b) (When immediate possession may be taken under
        Atomic Energy Act).

    U.S.C., Title 50:

       Sec. 171 (Acquisition of land by the Secretary of the Army for
        national defense).
       Sec. 632 App. (Second War Powers Act, 1942; acquisition of real
        property for war purposes by the Secretary of the Army, the
        Secretary of the Navy, and others).

      Note to Subdivision (b). This subdivision provides for broad
    joinder in accordance with the tenor of other rules such as Rule
    18. To require separate condemnation proceedings for each piece of
    property separately owned would be unduly burdensome and would
    serve no useful purpose. And a restriction that only properties may
    be joined which are to be acquired for the same public use would
    also cause difficulty. For example, a unified project to widen a
    street, construct a bridge across a navigable river, and for the
    construction of approaches to the level of the bridge on both sides
    of the river might involve acquiring property for different public
    uses. Yet it is eminently desirable that the plaintiff may in one
    proceeding condemn all the property interests and rights necessary
    to carry out this project. Rule 21 which allows the court to sever
    and proceed separately with any claim against a party, and Rule
    42(b) giving the court broad discretion to order separate trials
    give adequate protection to all defendants in condemnation
    proceedings.
      Note to Subdivision (c). Since a condemnation proceeding is in
    rem and since a great many property owners are often involved,
    paragraph (1) requires the property to be named and only one of the
    owners. In other respects the caption will contain the name of the
    court, the title of the action, file number, and a designation of
    the pleading as a complaint in accordance with Rule 10(a).
      Since the general standards of pleading are stated in other
    rules, paragraph (2) prescribes only the necessary detail for
    condemnation proceedings. Certain statutes allow the United States
    to acquire title or possession immediately upon commencement of an
    action. See the Act of February 26, 1931, ch. 307 Secs. 1-5 (46
    Stat. 1421), 40 U.S.C. Secs. 258a-258e [now 40 U.S.C. 3114, 3115,
    3118], supra; and 33 U.S.C. Sec. 594, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1813(b), 50
    U.S.C. Secs. 171, 632, supra. To carry out the purpose of such
    statutes and to aid the condemnor in instituting the action even
    where title is not acquired at the outset, the plaintiff is
    initially required to join as defendants only the persons having or
    claiming an interest in the property whose names are then known.
    This in no way prejudices the property owner, who must eventually
    be joined as a defendant, served with process, and allowed to
    answer before there can be any hearing involving the compensation
    to be paid for his piece of property. The rule requires the
    plaintiff to name all persons having or claiming an interest in the
    property of whom the plaintiff has learned and, more importantly,
    those appearing of record. By charging the plaintiff with the
    necessity to make "a search of the records of the extent commonly
    made by competent searchers of title in the vicinity in light of
    the type and value of the property involved" both the plaintiff and
    property owner are protected. Where a short term interest in
    property of little value is involved, as a two or three year
    easement over a vacant land for purposes of ingress and egress to
    other property, a search of the records covering a long period of
    time is not required. Where on the other hand fee simple title in
    valuable property is being condemned the search must necessarily
    cover a much longer period of time and be commensurate with the
    interests involved. But even here the search is related to the type
    made by competent title searchers in the vicinity. A search that
    extends back to the original patent may be feasible in some
    midwestern and western states and be proper under certain
    circumstances. In the Atlantic seaboard states such a search is
    normally not feasible nor desirable. There is a common sense
    business accommodation of what title searchers can and should do.
    For state statutes requiring persons appearing as owners or
    otherwise interested in the property to be named as defendants, see
    3 Colo. Stat. Ann., 1935, c. 61, Sec. 2; Ill. Ann. Stat. (Smith-
    Hurd) c. 47, Sec. 2; 1 Iowa Code, 1946, Sec. 472.3; Kans. Stat.
    Ann., 1935, Sec. 26-101; 2 Mass. Laws Ann., 1932, ch. 80A, Sec. 4;
    7 Mich. Stat. Ann., 1936, Sec. 8.2; 2 Minn. Stat., Mason, 1927,
    Sec. 6541; 20 N.J. Stat. Ann., 1939, Sec. 1-2; 3 Wash. Revised
    Stat., Remington, 1932, Title 6, Sec. 891. For state provisions
    allowing persons whose names are not known to be designated under
    the descriptive term of "unknown owner", see Hawaii Revised Laws,
    1945, c. 8, Sec. 310 ("such [unknown] defendant may be joined in
    the petition under a fictitious name."; Ill. Ann. Stat., Smith-
    Hurd), c. 47, Sec. 2 ("Persons interested, whose names are
    unknown, may be made parties defendant by the description of the
    unknown owners; . . ."); Maryland Code Ann., 1939, Ar. 33A, Sec. 1
    ("In case any owner or owners is or are not known, he or they may
    be described in such petition as the unknown owner or owners, or
    the unknown heir or heirs of a deceased owner."); 2 Mass. Laws
    Ann., 1932, c. 80A, Sec. 4 ("Persons not in being, unascertained or
    unknown who may have an interest in any of such land shall be made
    parties respondent by such description as seems appropriate, * *
    *"); New Mex. Stat. Ann., 1941, Sec. 25-901 ("the owners * * *
    shall be parties defendant, by name, if the names are known, and by
    description of the unknown owners of the land therein described, if
    their names are unknown."); Utah Code Ann., 1943, Sec. 104-61-7
    ("The names of all owners and claimants of the property, if known,
    or a statement that they are unknown, who must be styled
    defendants").
      The last sentence of paragraph (2) enables the court to expedite
    the distribution of a deposit, in whole or in part, as soon as
    pertinent facts of ownership, value and the like are established.
    See also subdivision (j).
      The signing of the complaint is governed by Rule 11.
      Note to Subdivision (d). In lieu of a summons, which is the
    initial process in other civil actions under Rule 4 (a),
    subdivision (d) provides for a notice which is to contain
    sufficient information so that the defendant in effect obtains the
    plaintiff's statement of his claim against the defendant to whom
    the notice is directed. Since the plaintiff's attorney is an
    officer of the court and to prevent unduly burdening the clerk of
    the court, paragraph (1) of subdivision (d) provides that
    plaintiff's attorney shall prepare and deliver a notice or notices
    to the clerk. Flexibility is provided by the provision for joint or
    several notices, and for additional notices. Where there are only a
    few defendants it may be convenient to prepare but one notice
    directed to all the defendants. In other cases where there are many
    defendants it will be more convenient to prepare two or more
    notices; but in any event a notice must be directed to each named
    defendant. Paragraph (2) provides that the notice is to be signed
    by the plaintiff's attorney. Since the notice is to be delivered to
    the clerk, the issuance of the notice will appear of record in the
    court. The clerk should forthwith deliver the notice or notices for
    service to the marshal or to a person specially appointed to serve
    the notice. Rule 4 (a). The form of the notice is such that, in
    addition to informing the defendant of the plaintiff's statement of
    claim, it tells the defendant precisely what his rights are.
    Failure on the part of the defendant to serve an answer constitutes
    a consent to the taking and to the authority of the court to
    proceed to fix compensation therefor, but it does not preclude the
    defendant from presenting evidence as to the amount of compensation
    due him or in sharing the award of distribution. See subdivision
    (e); Form 28.
      While under Rule 4(f) the territorial limits of a summons are
    normally the territorial limits of the state in which the district
    court is held, the territorial limits for personal service of a
    notice under Rule 71A (d)(3) are those of the nation. This
    extension of process is here proper since the aim of the
    condemnation proceeding is not to enforce any personal liability
    and the property owner is helped, not imposed upon, by the best
    type of service possible. If personal service cannot be made either
    because the defendant's whereabouts cannot be ascertained, or, if
    ascertained, the defendant cannot be personally served, as where he
    resides in a foreign country such as Canada or Mexico, then service
    by publication is proper. The provisions for this type of service
    are set forth in the rule and are in no way governed by 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 118.
      Note to Subdivision (e). Departing from the scheme of Rule 12,
    subdivision (e) requires all defenses and objections to be
    presented in an answer and does not authorize a preliminary motion.
    There is little need for the latter in condemnation proceedings.
    The general standard of pleading is governed by other rules,
    particularly Rule 8, and this subdivision (e) merely prescribes
    what matters the answer should set forth. Merely by appearing in
    the action a defendant can receive notice of all proceedings
    affecting him. And without the necessity of answering a defendant
    may present evidence as to the amount of compensation due him, and
    he may share in the distribution of the award. See also subdivision
    (d)(2); Form 28.
      Note to Subdivision (f). Due to the number of persons who may be
    interested in the property to be condemned, there is a likelihood
    that the plaintiff will need to amend his complaint, perhaps many
    times, to add new parties or state new issues. This subdivision
    recognizes that fact and does not burden the court with
    applications by the plaintiff for leave to amend. At the same time
    all defendants are adequately protected; and their need to amend
    the answer is adequately protected by Rule 15, which is applicable
    by virtue of subdivision (a) of this Rule 71A.
      Note to Subdivision (g). A condemnation action is a proceeding in
    rem. Commencement of the action as against a defendant by virtue of
    his joinder pursuant to subdivision (c)(2) is the point of cut-off
    and there is no mandatory requirement for substitution because of a
    subsequent change of interest, although the court is given ample
    power to require substitution. Rule 25 is inconsistent with
    subdivision (g) and hence inapplicable. Accordingly, the time
    periods of Rule 25 do not govern to require dismissal nor to
    prevent substitution.
      Note to Subdivision (h). This subdivision prescribes the method
    for determining the issue of just compensation in cases involving
    the federal power of eminent domain. The method of jury trial
    provided by subdivision (h) will normally apply in cases involving
    the state power by virtue of subdivision (k).
      Congress has specially constituted a tribunal for the trial of
    the issue of just compensation in two instances: condemnation under
    the Tennessee Valley Authority Act; and condemnation in the
    District of Columbia. These tribunals are retained for reasons set
    forth in the General Statement: 3. Adjustment of Rule to Statutory
    Provisions, supra. Subdivision (h) also has prospective application
    so that if Congress should create another special tribunal, that
    tribunal will determine the issue of just compensation. Subject to
    these exceptions the general method of trial of that issue is to be
    by jury if any party demands it, otherwise that issue, as well as
    all other issues, are to be tried by the court.
      As to the TVA procedure that is continued, U.S.C., Title 16, Sec.
    831x requires that three commissioners be appointed to fix the
    compensation; that exceptions to their award are to be heard by
    three district judges (unless the parties stipulate for a lesser
    number) and that the district judges try the question de novo; that
    an appeal to the circuit court of appeals may be taken within 30
    days from the filing of the decision of the district judges; and
    that the circuit court of appeals shall on the record fix
    compensation "without regard to the awards of findings theretofore
    made by the commissioners or the district judges." The mode of
    fixing compensation in the District of Columbia, which is also
    continued, is prescribed in U.S.C., [former] Title 40, Secs. 361-
    386. Under Sec. 371 the court is required in all cases to order
    the selection of a jury of five from among not less than 20 names,
    drawn "from the special box provided by law." They must have the
    usual qualifications of jurors and in addition must be freeholders
    of the District, and not in the service of the United States or the
    District. A special oath is administered to the chosen jurors. The
    trial proceeds in the ordinary way, except that the jury is allowed
    to separate after they have begun to consider their verdict.
      There is no constitutional right to jury trial in a condemnation
    proceeding. Bauman v. Ross, 1897, 17 S.Ct. 966, 167 U.S. 548, 42
    L.Ed. 270. See, also, Hines, Does the Seventh Amendment to the
    Constitution of the United States Require Jury Trials in all
    Condemnation Proceedings? 1925, 11 Va.L.Rev. 505; Blair, Federal
    Condemnation Proceedings and the Seventh Amendment 1927, 41
    Harv.L.Rev. 29; 3 Moore's Federal Practice 1938, 3007. Prior to
    Rule 71A, jury trial in federal condemnation proceedings was,
    however, enjoyed under the general conformity statute, [former] 40
    U.S.C. Sec. 258, in states which provided for jury trial. See
    generally, 2 Lewis, Eminent Domain 3d ed. 1909, Secs. 509, 510; 3
    Moore, op. cit. supra. Since the general conformity statute is
    superseded by Rule 71A, see supra under subdivision (a), and since
    it was believed that the rule to be substituted should likewise
    give a right to jury trial, subdivision (h) establishes that method
    as the general one for determining the issue of just compensation.
      Note to Subdivision (i). Both the right of the plaintiff to
    dismiss by filing a notice of dismissal and the right of the court
    to permit a dismissal are circumscribed to the extent that where
    the plaintiff has acquired the title or a lesser interest or
    possession, viz, any property interest for which just compensation
    should be paid, the action may not be dismissed, without the
    defendant's consent, and the property owner remitted to another
    court, such as the Court of Claims, to recover just compensation
    for the property right taken. Circuity of action is thus prevented
    without increasing the liability of the plaintiff to pay just
    compensation for any interest that is taken. Freedom of dismissal
    is accorded, where both the condemnor and condemnee agree, up to
    the time of the entry of judgment vesting plaintiff with title. And
    power is given to the court, where the parties agree, to vacate the
    judgment and thus revest title in the property owner. In line with
    Rule 21, the court may at any time drop a defendant who has been
    unnecessarily or improperly joined as where it develops that he has
    no interest.
      Note to Subdivision (j). Whatever the substantive law is
    concerning the necessity of making a deposit will continue to
    govern. For statutory provisions concerning deposit in court in
    condemnation proceedings by the United States, see U.S.C., Title
    40, Sec. 258a [now 40 U.S.C. 3114(a)-(d)]; U.S.C., Title 33, Sec.
    594 - acquisition of title and possession statutes referred to in
    note to subdivision (a), supra. If the plaintiff is invoking the
    state's power of eminent domain the necessity of deposit will be
    governed by the state law. For discussion of such law, see 1
    Nichols, Eminent Domain, 2d ed. 1917, Secs. 209-216. For discussion
    of the function of deposit and the power of the court to enter
    judgment in cases both of deficiency and overpayment, see United
    States v. Miller, 1943, 63 S.Ct. 276, 317 U.S. 369, 87 L.Ed. 336,
    147 A.L.R. 55, rehearing denied, 63 S.Ct. 557, 318 U.S. 798, 87
    L.Ed. 1162 (judgment in favor of plaintiff for overpayment
    ordered).
      The court is to make distribution of the deposit as promptly as
    the facts of the case warrant. See also subdivision (c)(2).
      Note to Subdivision (k). While the overwhelming number of cases
    that will be brought in the federal courts under this rule will be
    actions involving the federal power of eminent domain, a small
    percentage of cases may be instituted in the federal court or
    removed thereto on the basis of diversity or alienage which will
    involve the power of eminent domain under the law of a state. See
    Boom Co. v. Patterson, 1878, 98 U.S. 403, 25 L.Ed. 206; Searl v.
    School District No. 2, 1888, 8 S.Ct. 460, 124 U.S. 197, 31 L.Ed.
    415; Madisonville Traction Co. v. Saint Bernard Mining Co., 1905,
    25 S.Ct. 251, 196 U.S. 239, 49 L.Ed. 462. In the Madisonville case,
    and in cases cited therein, it has been held that condemnation
    actions brought by state corporations in the exercise of a power
    delegated by the state might be governed by procedure prescribed by
    the laws of the United States, whether the cases were begun in or
    removed to the federal court. See also Franzen v. Chicago, M. & St.
    P. Ry. Co., C.C.A.7th, 1921, 278 F. 370, 372.
      Any condition affecting the substantial right of a litigant
    attached by state law is to be observed and enforced, such as
    making a deposit in court where the power of eminent domain is
    conditioned upon so doing. (See also subdivision (j)). Subject to
    this qualification, subdivision (k) provides that in cases
    involving the state power of eminent domain, the practice
    prescribed by other subdivisions of Rule 71A shall govern.
      Note to Subdivision (l). Since the condemnor will normally be the
    prevailing party and since he should not recover his costs against
    the property owner, Rule 54(d), which provides generally that costs
    shall go to the prevailing party, is made inapplicable. Without
    attempting to state what the rule on costs is, the effect of
    subdivision (1) is that costs shall be awarded in accordance with
    the law that has developed in condemnation cases. This has been
    summarized as follows: "Costs of condemnation proceedings are not
    assessable against the condemnee, unless by stipulation he agrees
    to assume some or all of them. Such normal expenses of the
    proceeding as bills for publication of notice, commissioners' fees,
    the cost of transporting commissioners and jurors to take a view,
    fees for attorneys to represent defendants who have failed to
    answer, and witness' fees, are properly charged to the government,
    though not taxed as costs. Similarly, if it is necessary that a
    conveyance be executed by a commissioner, the United States pay his
    fees and those for recording the deed. However, the distribution of
    the award is a matter in which the United States has no legal
    interest. Expenses incurred in ascertaining the identity of
    distributees and deciding between conflicting claimants are
    properly chargeable against the award, not against the United
    States, although United States attorneys are expected to aid the
    court in such matters as amici curiae." Lands Division Manual 861.
    For other discussion and citation, see Grand River Dam Authority v.
    Jarvis, C.C.A.10th, 1942, 124 F.2d 914. Costs may not be taxed
    against the United States except to the extent permitted by law.
    United States v. 125.71 Acres of Land in Loyalhanna Tp.,
    Westmoreland County, Pa., D.C.Pa. 1944, 54 F.Supp. 193; Lands
    Division Manual 859. Even if it were thought desirable to allow the
    property owner's costs to be taxed against the United States, this
    is a matter for legislation and not court rule.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       

      This amendment conforms to the amendment of Rule 4(f).
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1985 AMENDMENT       

      Rule 71A(h) provides that except when Congress has provided
    otherwise, the issue of just compensation in a condemnation case
    may be tried by a jury if one of the parties so demands, unless the
    court in its discretion orders the issue determined by a commission
    of three persons. In 1980, the Comptroller General of the United
    States in a Report to Congress recommended that use of the
    commission procedure should be encouraged in order to improve and
    expedite the trial of condemnation cases. The Report noted that
    long delays were being caused in many districts by such factors as
    crowded dockets, the precedence given criminal cases, the low
    priority accorded condemnation matters, and the high turnover of
    Assistant United States Attorneys. The Report concluded that
    revising Rule 71A to make the use of the commission procedure more
    attractive might alleviate the situation.
      Accordingly, Rule 71A(h) is being amended in a number of respects
    designed to assure the quality and utility of a Rule 71A
    commission. First, the amended Rule will give the court discretion
    to appoint, in addition to the three members of a commission, up to
    two additional persons as alternate commissioners who would hear
    the case and be available, at any time up to the filing of the
    decision by the three-member commission, to replace any
    commissioner who becomes unable or disqualified to continue. The
    discretion to appoint alternate commissioners can be particularly
    useful in protracted cases, avoiding expensive retrials that have
    been required in some cases because of the death or disability of a
    commissioner. Prior to replacing a commissioner an alternate would
    not be present at, or participate in, the commission's
    deliberations.
      Second, the amended Rule requires the court, before appointment,
    to advise the parties of the identity and qualifications of each
    prospective commissioner and alternate. The court then may
    authorize the examination of prospective appointees by the parties
    and each party has the right to challenge for cause. The objective
    is to insure that unbiased and competent commissioners are
    appointed.
      The amended Rule does not prescribe a qualification standard for
    appointment to a commission, although it is understood that only
    persons possessing background and ability to appraise real estate
    valuation testimony and to award fair and just compensation on the
    basis thereof would be appointed. In most situations the
    chairperson should be a lawyer and all members should have some
    background qualifying them to weigh proof of value in the real
    estate field and, when possible, in the particular real estate
    market embracing the land in question.
      The amended Rule should give litigants greater confidence in the
    commission procedure by affording them certain rights to
    participate in the appointment of commission members that are
    roughly comparable to the practice with regard to jury selection.
    This is accomplished by giving the court permission to allow the
    parties to examine prospective commissioners and by recognizing the
    right of each party to object to the appointment of any person for
    cause.

      The language of Rule 71A has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Former Rule 71A has been redesignated as Rule 71.1 to conform to
    the designations used for all other rules added within the original
    numbering system.
      Rule 71.1(e) allows a defendant to appear without answering.
    Former form 28 (now form 60) includes information about this right
    in the Rule 71.1(d)(2) notice. It is useful to confirm this
    practice in the rule.
      The information that identifies the attorney is changed to
    include telephone number and electronic-mail address, in line with
    similar amendments to Rules 11(a) and 26(g)(1).

    Rule 72. Magistrate Judges: Pretrial Order

-STATUTE-
      (a) Nondispositive Matters. When a pretrial matter not
    dispositive of a party's claim or defense is referred to a
    magistrate judge to hear and decide, the magistrate judge must
    promptly conduct the required proceedings and, when appropriate,
    issue a written order stating the decision. A party may serve and
    file objections to the order within 14 days after being served with
    a copy. A party may not assign as error a defect in the order not
    timely objected to. The district judge in the case must consider
    timely objections and modify or set aside any part of the order
    that is clearly erroneous or is contrary to law.
      (b) Dispositive Motions and Prisoner Petitions.
        (1) Findings and Recommendations. A magistrate judge must
      promptly conduct the required proceedings when assigned, without
      the parties' consent, to hear a pretrial matter dispositive of a
      claim or defense or a prisoner petition challenging the
      conditions of confinement. A record must be made of all
      evidentiary proceedings and may, at the magistrate judge's
      discretion, be made of any other proceedings. The magistrate
      judge must enter a recommended disposition, including, if
      appropriate, proposed findings of fact. The clerk must promptly
      mail a copy to each party.
        (2) Objections. Within 14 days after being served with a copy
      of the recommended disposition, a party may serve and file
      specific written objections to the proposed findings and
      recommendations. A party may respond to another party's
      objections within 14 days after being served with a copy. Unless
      the district judge orders otherwise, the objecting party must
      promptly arrange for transcribing the record, or whatever
      portions of it the parties agree to or the magistrate judge
      considers sufficient.
        (3) Resolving Objections. The district judge must determine de
      novo any part of the magistrate judge's disposition that has been
      properly objected to. The district judge may accept, reject, or
      modify the recommended disposition; receive further evidence; or
      return the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Subdivision (a). This subdivision addresses court-ordered
    referrals of nondispositive matters under 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    636(b)(1)(A). The rule calls for a written order of the
    magistrate's disposition to preserve the record and facilitate
    review. An oral order read into the record by the magistrate will
    satisfy this requirement.
      No specific procedures or timetables for raising objections to
    the magistrate's rulings on nondispositive matters are set forth in
    the Magistrates Act. The rule fixes a 10-day period in order to
    avoid uncertainty and provide uniformity that will eliminate the
    confusion that might arise if different periods were prescribed by
    local rule in different districts. It also is contemplated that a
    party who is successful before the magistrate will be afforded an
    opportunity to respond to objections raised to the magistrate's
    ruling.
      The last sentence of subdivision (a) specifies that
    reconsideration of a magistrate's order, as provided for in the
    Magistrates Act, shall be by the district judge to whom the case is
    assigned. This rule does not restrict experimentation by the
    district courts under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(3) involving references
    of matters other than pretrial matters, such as appointment of
    counsel, taking of default judgments, and acceptance of jury
    verdicts when the judge is unavailable.
      Subdivision (b). This subdivision governs court-ordered referrals
    of dispositive pretrial matters and prisoner petitions challenging
    conditions of confinement, pursuant to statutory authorization in
    28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(1)(B). This rule does not extend to habeas
    corpus petitions, which are covered by the specific rules relating
    to proceedings under Sections 2254 and 2255 of Title 28.
      This rule implements the statutory procedures for making
    objections to the magistrate's proposed findings and
    recommendations. The 10-day period, as specified in the statute, is
    subject to Rule 6(e) which provides for an additional 3-day period
    when service is made by mail. Although no specific provision
    appears in the Magistrates Act, the rule specifies a 10-day period
    for a party to respond to objections to the magistrate's
    recommendation.
      Implementing the statutory requirements, the rule requires the
    district judge to whom the case is assigned to make a de novo
    determination of those portions of the report, findings, or
    recommendations to which timely objection is made. The term "de
    novo" signifies that the magistrate's findings are not protected by
    the clearly erroneous doctrine, but does not indicate that a second
    evidentiary hearing is required. See United States v. Raddatz, 417
    U.S. 667 (1980). See also Silberman, Masters and Magistrates Part
    II: The American Analogue, 50 N.Y.U. L.Rev. 1297, 1367 (1975). When
    no timely objection is filed, the court need only satisfy itself
    that there is no clear error on the face of the record in order to
    accept the recommendation. See Campbell v. United States Dist.
    Court, 501 F.2d 196, 206 (9th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S.
    879, quoted in House Report No. 94-1609, 94th Cong. 2d Sess. (1976)
    at 3. Compare Park Motor Mart, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 616 F.2d 603
    (1st Cir. 1980). Failure to make timely objection to the
    magistrate's report prior to its adoption by the district judge may
    constitute a waiver of appellate review of the district judge's
    order. See United States v. Walters, 638 F.2d 947 (6th Cir. 1981).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This amendment is intended to eliminate a discrepancy in
    measuring the 10 days for serving and filing objections to a
    magistrate's action under subdivisions (a) and (b) of this Rule.
    The rule as promulgated in 1983 required objections to the
    magistrate's handling of nondispositive matters to be served and
    filed within 10 days of entry of the order, but required objections
    to dispositive motions to be made within 10 days of being served
    with a copy of the recommended disposition. Subdivision (a) is here
    amended to conform to subdivision (b) to avoid any confusion or
    technical defaults, particularly in connection with magistrate
    orders that rule on both dispositive and nondispositive matters.
      The amendment is also intended to assure that objections to
    magistrate's orders that are not timely made shall not be
    considered. Compare Rule 51.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      This revision is made to conform the rule to changes made by the
    Judicial Improvements Act of 1990.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 72 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The times set in the former rule at 10 days have been revised to
    14 days. See the Note to Rule 6.

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
    TITLE IX. SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS

-HEAD-
    Rule 73. Magistrate Judges: Trial by Consent; Appeal

-STATUTE-
      (a) Trial by Consent. When authorized under 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    636(c), a magistrate judge may, if all parties consent, conduct a
    civil action or proceeding, including a jury or nonjury trial. A
    record must be made in accordance with 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(c)(5).
      (b) Consent Procedure.
        (1) In General. When a magistrate judge has been designated to
      conduct civil actions or proceedings, the clerk must give the
      parties written notice of their opportunity to consent under 28
      U.S.C. Sec. 636(c). To signify their consent, the parties must
      jointly or separately file a statement consenting to the
      referral. A district judge or magistrate judge may be informed of
      a party's response to the clerk's notice only if all parties have
      consented to the referral.
        (2) Reminding the Parties About Consenting. A district judge,
      magistrate judge, or other court official may remind the parties
      of the magistrate judge's availability, but must also advise them
      that they are free to withhold consent without adverse
      substantive consequences.
        (3) Vacating a Referral. On its own for good cause - or when a
      party shows extraordinary circumstances - the district judge may
      vacate a referral to a magistrate judge under this rule.

      (c) Appealing a Judgment. In accordance with 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    636(c)(3), an appeal from a judgment entered at a magistrate
    judge's direction may be taken to the court of appeals as would any
    other appeal from a district-court judgment.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Subdivision (a). This subdivision implements the broad authority
    of the 1979 amendments to the Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    636(c), which permit a magistrate to sit in lieu of a district
    judge and exercise civil jurisdiction over a case, when the parties
    consent. See McCabe, The Federal Magistrate Act of 1979, 16 Harv.
    J. Legis. 343, 364-79 (1979). In order to exercise this
    jurisdiction, a magistrate must be specially designated under 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 636(c)(1) by the district court or courts he serves.
    The only exception to a magistrate's exercise of civil
    jurisdiction, which includes the power to conduct jury and nonjury
    trials and decide dispositive motions, is the contempt power. A
    hearing on contempt is to be conducted by the district judge upon
    certification of the facts and an order to show cause by the
    magistrate. See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 639(e). In view of 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    636(c)(1) and this rule, it is unnecessary to amend Rule 58 to
    provide that the decision of a magistrate is a "decision by the
    court" for the purposes of that rule and a "final decision of the
    district court" for purposes of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291 governing
    appeals.
      Subdivision (b). This subdivision implements the blind consent
    provision of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(c)(2) and is designed to ensure
    that neither the judge nor the magistrate attempts to induce a
    party to consent to reference of a civil matter under this rule to
    a magistrate. See House Rep. No. 96-444, 96th Cong. 1st Sess. 8
    (1979).
      The rule opts for a uniform approach in implementing the consent
    provision by directing the clerk to notify the parties of their
    opportunity to elect to proceed before a magistrate and by
    requiring the execution and filing of a consent form or forms
    setting forth the election. However, flexibility at the local level
    is preserved in that local rules will determine how notice shall be
    communicated to the parties, and local rules will specify the time
    period within which an election must be made.
      The last paragraph of subdivision (b) reiterates the provision in
    28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(c)(6) for vacating a reference to the
    magistrate.
      Subdivision (c). Under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(c)(3), the normal route
    of appeal from the judgment of a magistrate - the only route that
    will be available unless the parties otherwise agree in advance -
    is an appeal by the aggrieved party "directly to the appropriate
    United States court of appeals from the judgment of the magistrate
    in the same manner as an appeal from any other judgment of a
    district court." The quoted statutory language indicates Congress'
    intent that the same procedures and standards of appealability that
    govern appeals from district court judgments govern appeals from
    magistrates' judgments.
      Subdivision (d). 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(c)(4) offers parties who
    consent to the exercise of civil jurisdiction by a magistrate an
    alternative appeal route to that provided in subdivision (c) of
    this rule. This optional appellate route was provided by Congress
    in recognition of the fact that not all civil cases warrant the
    same appellate treatment. In cases where the amount in controversy
    is not great and there are no difficult questions of law to be
    resolved, the parties may desire to avoid the expense and delay of
    appeal to the court of appeals by electing an appeal to the
    district judge. See McCabe, The Federal Magistrate Act of 1979, 16
    Harv. J. Legis. 343, 388 (1979). This subdivision provides that the
    parties may elect the optional appeal route at the time of
    reference to a magistrate. To this end, the notice by the clerk
    under subdivision (b) of this rule shall explain the appeal option
    and the corollary restriction on review by the court of appeals.
    This approach will avoid later claims of lack of consent to the
    avenue of appeal. The choice of the alternative appeal route to the
    judge of the district court should be made by the parties in their
    forms of consent. Special appellate rules to govern appeals from a
    magistrate to a district judge appear in new Rules 74 through 76.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      This revision is made to conform the rule to changes made by the
    Judicial Improvements Act of 1990. The Act requires that, when
    being reminded of the availability of a magistrate judge, the
    parties be advised that withholding of consent will have no
    "adverse substantive consequences." They may, however, be advised
    if the withholding of consent will have the adverse procedural
    consequence of a potential delay in trial.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       
      The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996 repealed the former
    provisions of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(c)(4) and (5) that enabled parties
    that had agreed to trial before a magistrate judge to agree also
    that appeal should be taken to the district court. Rule 73 is
    amended to conform to this change. Rules 74, 75, and 76 are
    abrogated for the same reason. The portions of Form 33 and Form 34
    that referred to appeals to the district court also are deleted.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 73 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

-STATUTE-
      (a) When Court Is Open. Every district court is considered always
    open for filing any paper, issuing and returning process, making a
    motion, or entering an order.
      (b) Place for Trial and Other Proceedings. Every trial on the
    merits must be conducted in open court and, so far as convenient,
    in a regular courtroom. Any other act or proceeding may be done or
    conducted by a judge in chambers, without the attendance of the
    clerk or other court official, and anywhere inside or outside the
    district. But no hearing - other than one ex parte - may be
    conducted outside the district unless all the affected parties
    consent.
      (c) Clerk's Office Hours; Clerk's Orders.
        (1) Hours. The clerk's office - with a clerk or deputy on duty -
       must be open during business hours every day except Saturdays,
      Sundays, and legal holidays. But a court may, by local rule or
      order, require that the office be open for specified hours on
      Saturday or a particular legal holiday other than one listed in
      Rule 6(a)(4)(A).
        (2) Orders. Subject to the court's power to suspend, alter, or
      rescind the clerk's action for good cause, the clerk may:
          (A) issue process;
          (B) enter a default;
          (C) enter a default judgment under Rule 55(b)(1); and
          (D) act on any other matter that does not require the court's
        action.

      (d) Serving Notice of an Order or Judgment.
        (1) Service. Immediately after entering an order or judgment,
      the clerk must serve notice of the entry, as provided in Rule
      5(b), on each party who is not in default for failing to appear.
      The clerk must record the service on the docket. A party also may
      serve notice of the entry as provided in Rule 5(b).
        (2) Time to Appeal Not Affected by Lack of Notice. Lack of
      notice of the entry does not affect the time for appeal or
      relieve - or authorize the court to relieve - a party for failing
      to appeal within the time allowed, except as allowed by Federal
      Rule of Appellate Procedure (4)(a).

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1937            
      This rule states the substance of U.S.C., Title 28, Sec. 13 [now
    452] (Courts open as courts of admiralty and equity). Compare
    [former] Equity Rules 1 (District Court Always Open For Certain
    Purposes - Orders at Chambers), 2 (Clerk's Office Always Open,
    Except, Etc.), 4 (Notice of Orders), and 5 (Motions Grantable of
    Course by Clerk).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 77(d) has been amended to avoid such situations as the one
    arising in Hill v. Hawes (1944) 320 U.S. 520. In that case, an
    action instituted in the District Court for the District of
    Columbia, the clerk failed to give notice of the entry of a
    judgment for defendant as required by Rule 77(d). The time for
    taking an appeal then was 20 days under Rule 10 of the Court of
    Appeals (later enlarged by amendment to thirty days), and due to
    lack of notice of the entry of judgment the plaintiff failed to
    file his notice of appeal within the prescribed time. On this basis
    the trial court vacated the original judgment and then reentered
    it, whereupon notice of appeal was filed. The Court of Appeals
    dismissed the appeal as taken too late. The Supreme Court, however,
    held that although Rule 77(d) did not purport to attach any
    consequence to the clerk's failure to give notice as specified, the
    terms of the rule were such that the appellant was entitled to rely
    on it, and the trial court in such a case, in the exercise of a
    sound discretion, could vacate the former judgment and enter a new
    one, so that the appeal would be within the allowed time.
      Because of Rule 6(c), which abolished the old rule that the
    expiration of the term ends a court's power over its judgment, the
    effect of the decision in Hill v. Hawes is to give the district
    court power, in its discretion and without time limit, and long
    after the term may have expired, to vacate a judgment and reenter
    it for the purpose of reviving the right of appeal. This seriously
    affects the finality of judgments. See also proposed Rule 6(c) and
    Note; proposed Rule 60(b) and Note; and proposed Rule 73(a) and
    Note.
      Rule 77(d) as amended makes it clear that notification by the
    clerk of the entry of a judgment has nothing to do with the
    starting of the time for appeal; that time starts to run from the
    date of entry of judgment and not from the date of notice of the
    entry. Notification by the clerk is merely for the convenience of
    litigants. And lack of such notification in itself has no effect
    upon the time for appeal; but in considering an application for
    extension of time for appeal as provided in Rule 73(a), the court
    may take into account, as one of the factors affecting its
    decision, whether the clerk failed to give notice as provided in
    Rule 77(d) or the party failed to receive the clerk's notice. It
    need not, however, extend the time for appeal merely because the
    clerk's notice was not sent or received. It would, therefore, be
    entirely unsafe for a party to rely on absence of notice from the
    clerk of the entry of a judgment, or to rely on the adverse party's
    failure to serve notice of the entry of a judgment. Any party may,
    of course, serve timely notice of the entry of a judgment upon the
    adverse party and thus preclude a successful application, under
    Rule 73(a), for the extension of the time for appeal.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (c). The amendment authorizes closing of the clerk's
    office on Saturday as far as civil business is concerned. However,
    a district court may require its clerk's office to remain open for
    specified hours on Saturdays or "legal holidays" other than those
    enumerated. ("Legal holiday" is defined in Rule 6(a), as amended.)
    The clerk's offices of many district courts have customarily
    remained open on some of the days appointed as holidays by State
    law. This practice could be continued by local rule or order.
      Subdivision (d). This amendment conforms to the amendment of Rule
    5(a). See the Advisory Committee's Note to that amendment.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1968 AMENDMENT       
      The provisions of Rule 73(a) are incorporated in Rule 4(a) of the
    Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This revision is a companion to the concurrent amendment to Rule
    4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. The purpose of the
    revisions is to permit district courts to ease strict sanctions now
    imposed on appellants whose notices of appeal are filed late
    because of their failure to receive notice of entry of a judgment.
    See, e.g. Tucker v. Commonwealth Land Title Ins. Co., 800 F.2d 1054
    (11th Cir. 1986); Ashby Enterprises, Ltd. v. Weitzman, Dym &
    Associates, 780 F.2d 1043 (D.C. Cir. 1986); In re OPM Leasing
    Services, Inc., 769 F.2d 911 (2d Cir. 1985); Spika v. Village of
    Lombard, Ill., 763 F.2d 282 (7th Cir. 1985); Hall v. Community
    Mental Health Center of Beaver County, 772 F.2d 42 (3d Cir. 1985);
    Wilson v. Atwood v. Stark, 725 F.2d 255 (5th Cir. en banc), cert
    dismissed, 105 S.Ct. 17 (1984); Case v. BASF Wyandotte, 727 F.2d
    1034 (Fed. Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 105 S.Ct. 386 (1984); Hensley
    v. Chesapeake & Ohio R.R.Co., 651 F.2d 226 (4th Cir. 1981); Buckeye
    Cellulose Corp. v. Electric Construction Co., 569 F.2d 1036 (8th
    Cir. 1978).
      Failure to receive notice may have increased in frequency with
    the growth in the caseload in the clerks' offices. The present
    strict rule imposes a duty on counsel to maintain contact with the
    court while a case is under submission. Such contact is more
    difficult to maintain if counsel is outside the district, as is
    increasingly common, and can be a burden to the court as well as
    counsel.
      The effect of the revisions is to place a burden on prevailing
    parties who desire certainty that the time for appeal is running.
    Such parties can take the initiative to assure that their
    adversaries receive effective notice. An appropriate procedure for
    such notice is provided in Rule 5.
      The revised rule lightens the responsibility but not the workload
    of the clerks' offices, for the duty of that office to give notice
    of entry of judgment must be maintained.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2001 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 77(d) is amended to reflect changes in Rule 5(b). A few
    courts have experimented with serving Rule 77(d) notices by
    electronic means on parties who consent to this procedure. The
    success of these experiments warrants express authorization.
    Because service is made in the manner provided in Rule 5(b), party
    consent is required for service by electronic or other means
    described in Rule 5(b)(2)(D). The same provision is made for a
    party who wishes to ensure actual communication of the Rule 77(d)
    notice by also serving notice.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments Rule 77(d) was
    amended to correct an oversight in the published version. The clerk
    is to note "service," not "mailing," on the docket.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 77 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

-HEAD-
    Rule 79. Records Kept by the Clerk

-STATUTE-
      (a) Civil Docket.
        (1) In General. The clerk must keep a record known as the
      "civil docket" in the form and manner prescribed by the Director
      of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts with the
      approval of the Judicial Conference of the United States. The
      clerk must enter each civil action in the docket. Actions must be
      assigned consecutive file numbers, which must be noted in the
      docket where the first entry of the action is made.
        (2) Items to be Entered. The following items must be marked
      with the file number and entered chronologically in the docket:
          (A) papers filed with the clerk;
          (B) process issued, and proofs of service or other returns
        showing execution; and
          (C) appearances, orders, verdicts, and judgments.

        (3) Contents of Entries; Jury Trial Demanded. Each entry must
      briefly show the nature of the paper filed or writ issued, the
      substance of each proof of service or other return, and the
      substance and date of entry of each order and judgment. When a
      jury trial has been properly demanded or ordered, the clerk must
      enter the word "jury" in the docket.

      (b) Civil Judgments and Orders. The clerk must keep a copy of
    every final judgment and appealable order; of every order affecting
    title to or a lien on real or personal property; and of any other
    order that the court directs to be kept. The clerk must keep these
    in the form and manner prescribed by the Director of the
    Administrative Office of the United States Courts with the approval
    of the Judicial Conference of the United States.
      (c) Indexes; Calendars. Under the court's direction, the clerk
    must:
        (1) keep indexes of the docket and of the judgments and orders
      described in Rule 79(b); and
        (2) prepare calendars of all actions ready for trial,
      distinguishing jury trials from nonjury trials.

      (d) Other Records. The clerk must keep any other records required
    by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States
    Courts with the approval of the Judicial Conference of the United
    States.

    Therein). In connection with this rule, see also the following
    statutes of the United States:

    U.S.C., Title 5:

     Sec. 301 [see Title 28, Sec. 526] (Officials for investigation of
          official acts, records and accounts of marshals, attorneys,
          clerks of courts, United States commissioners, referees and

          inspection)

     Sec. 568 [now 751] (Same; reports and accounts of moneys received;
          dockets)
     Sec. 813 [former] (Indices of judgment debtors to be kept by
          clerks)

      And see "Instructions to United States Attorneys, Marshals,
    Clerks and Commissioners" issued by the Attorney General of the
    United States.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). The amendment substitutes the Director of the
    Administrative Office of the United States Courts, acting subject
    to the approval of the Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit
    Judges, in the place of the Attorney General as a consequence of
    and in accordance with the provisions of the act establishing the
    Administrative Office and transferring functions thereto. Act of
    August 7, 1939, c. 501, Secs. 1-7, 53 Stat. 1223, 28 U.S.C. Secs.
    444-450 [now 601-610].
      Subdivision (b). The change in this subdivision does not alter
    the nature of the judgments and orders to be recorded in permanent
    form but it does away with the express requirement that they be
    recorded in a book. This merely gives latitude for the preservation
    of court records in other than book form, if that shall seem
    advisable, and permits with the approval of the Judicial Conference
    the adoption of such modern, space-saving methods as
    microphotography. See Proposed Improvements in the Administration
    of the Offices of Clerks of United States District Courts, prepared
    by the Bureau of the Budget (1941) 38-42. See also Rule 55, Federal
    Rules of Criminal Procedure [following section 687 of Title 18
    U.S.C.].
      Subdivision (c). The words "Separate and" have been deleted as
    unduly rigid. There is no sufficient reason for requiring that the
    indices in all cases be separate; on the contrary, the requirement
    frequently increases the labor of persons searching the records as
    well as the labor of the clerk's force preparing them. The matter
    should be left to administrative discretion.
      The other changes in the subdivision merely conform with those
    made in subdivision (b) of the rule.
      Subdivision (d). Subdivision (d) is a new provision enabling the
    Administrative Office, with the approval of the Judicial
    Conference, to carry out any improvements in clerical procedure
    with respect to books and records which may be deemed advisable.
    See report cited in Note to subdivision (b), supra.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1948 AMENDMENT       
      The change in nomenclature conforms to the official designation
    in Title 28, U.S.C., Sec. 231.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      The terminology is clarified without any change of the prescribed
    practice. See amended Rule 58, and the Advisory Committee's Note

      The language of Rule 79 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood

      (a) Applicability to Particular Proceedings.
        (1) Prize Proceedings. These rules do not apply to prize
      proceedings in admiralty governed by 10 U.S.C. Secs. 7651-7681.
        (2) Bankruptcy. These rules apply to bankruptcy proceedings to

        Governing Section 2254 Cases, or the Rules Governing Section
        2255 Cases; and

      proceedings to compel testimony or the production of documents
      through a subpoena issued by a United States officer or agency
      under a federal statute, except as otherwise provided by statute,
      by local rule, or by court order in the proceedings.
        (6) Other Proceedings. These rules, to the extent applicable,
      govern proceedings under the following laws, except as these laws
      provide other procedures:
          (A) 7 U.S.C. Secs. 292, 499g(c), for reviewing an order of
        the Secretary of Agriculture;
          (B) 9 U.S.C., relating to arbitration;
          (C) 15 U.S.C. Sec. 522, for reviewing an order of the
        Secretary of the Interior;
          (D) 15 U.S.C. Sec. 715d(c), for reviewing an order denying a
        certificate of clearance;
          (E) 29 U.S.C. Secs. 159, 160, for enforcing an order of the
        National Labor Relations Board;
          (F) 33 U.S.C. Secs. 918, 921, for enforcing or reviewing a
        compensation order under the Longshore and Harbor Workers'
        Compensation Act; and
          (G) 45 U.S.C. Sec. 159, for reviewing an arbitration award in
        a railway-labor dispute.

      (b) Scire Facias and Mandamus. The writs of scire facias and
    mandamus are abolished. Relief previously available through them
    may be obtained by appropriate action or motion under these rules.
      (c) Removed Actions.
        (1) Applicability. These rules apply to a civil action after it
      is removed from a state court.
        (2) Further Pleading. After removal, repleading is unnecessary
      unless the court orders it. A defendant who did not answer before
      removal must answer or present other defenses or objections under
      these rules within the longest of these periods:
          (A) 21 days after receiving - through service or otherwise -
        a copy of the initial pleading stating the claim for relief;
          (B) 21 days after being served with the summons for an
        initial pleading on file at the time of service; or
          (C) 7 days after the notice of removal is filed.

        (3) Demand for a Jury Trial.
          (A) As Affected by State Law. A party who, before removal,
        expressly demanded a jury trial in accordance with state law
        need not renew the demand after removal. If the state law did
        not require an express demand for a jury trial, a party need
        not make one after removal unless the court orders the parties
        to do so within a specified time. The court must so order at a
        party's request and may so order on its own. A party who fails
        to make a demand when so ordered waives a jury trial.
          (B) Under Rule 38. If all necessary pleadings have been
        served at the time of removal, a party entitled to a jury trial
        under Rule 38 must be given one if the party serves a demand
        within 14 days after:
            (i) it files a notice of removal; or
            (ii) it is served with a notice of removal filed by another
          party.

      (d) Law Applicable.
        (1) "State Law" Defined. When these rules refer to state law,
      the term "law" includes the state's statutes and the state's
      judicial decisions.
        (2) "State" Defined. The term "state" includes, where
      appropriate, the District of Columbia and any United States
      commonwealth or territory.
        (3) "Federal Statute" Defined in the District of Columbia. In
      the United States District Court for the District of Columbia,
      the term "federal statute" includes any Act of Congress that
      applies locally to the District.

    (1937), ch. 110, Sec. 179; Calif. Code Civ. Proc. (Deering, 1937)
    Sec. 802.
      Note to Subdivision (c). Such statutes as the following dealing
    with the removal of actions are substantially continued and made
    subject to these rules:

    U.S.C., Title 28:

     Sec. 71 [now 1441, 1445, 1447] (Removal of suits from state
          courts)
     Sec. 72 [now 1446, 1447] (Same; procedure)

      U.S.C., Title 28, Sec. 72 [now 1446, 1447], supra, however, is
    modified by shortening the time for pleading in removed actions.
      Note to Subdivision (e). The last sentence of this subdivision
    modifies U.S.C., Title 28, Sec. 725 [now 1652] (Laws of States as
    rules of decision) in so far as that statute has been construed to
    govern matters of procedure and to exclude state judicial decisions
    relative thereto.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). Despite certain dicta to the contrary [Lynn v.
    United States (C.C.A.5th, 1940) 110 F.(2d) 586; Mount Tivy Winery,
    Inc. v. Lewis (N.D.Cal. 1942) 42 F.Supp. 636], it is manifest that
    the rules apply to actions against the United States under the
    Tucker Act [28 U.S.C., Secs. 41(20), 250, 251, 254, 257, 258, 287,
    289, 292, 761-765 [now 791, 1346, 1401, 1402, 1491, 1493, 1496,
    1501, 1503, 2071, 2072, 2411, 2412, 2501, 2506, 2509, 2510]]. See
    United States to use of Foster Wheeler Corp. v. American Surety Co.
    of New York (E.D.N.Y. 1939) 25 F.Supp. 700; Boerner v. United
    States (E.D.N.Y. 1939) 26 F.Supp. 769; United States v. Gallagher
    (C.C.A.9th, 1945) 151 F.(2d) 556. Rules 1 and 81 provide that the
    rules shall apply to all suits of a civil nature, whether
    cognizable as cases at law or in equity, except those specifically
    excepted; and the character of the various proceedings excepted by
    express statement in Rule 81, as well as the language of the rules
    generally, shows that the term "civil action" [Rule 2] includes
    actions against the United States. Moreover, the rules in many
    places expressly make provision for the situation wherein the
    United States is a party as either plaintiff or defendant. See
    Rules 4(d)(4), 12(a), 13(d), 25(d), 37(f), 39(c), 45(c), 54(d),
    55(e), 62(e), and 65(c). In United States v. Sherwood (1941) 312
    U.S. 584, the Solicitor General expressly conceded in his brief for
    the United States that the rules apply to Tucker Act cases. The
    Solicitor General stated: "The Government, of course, recognizes
    that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply to cases brought
    under the Tucker Act." (Brief for the United States, p. 31).
    Regarding Lynn v. United States, supra, the Solicitor General said:
    "In Lynn v. United States . . . the Circuit Court of Appeals for
    the Fifth Circuit went beyond the Government's contention there,
    and held that an action under the Tucker Act is neither an action
    at law nor a suit in equity and, seemingly, that the Federal Rules
    of Civil Procedure are, therefore, inapplicable. We think the
    suggestion is erroneous. Rules 4(d), 12(a), 39(c), and 55(e)
    expressly contemplate suits against the United States, and nothing
    in the enabling Act (48 Stat. 1064) [see 28 U.S.C. 2072] suggests
    that the Rules are inapplicable to Tucker Act proceedings, which in
    terms are to accord with court rules and their subsequent
    modifications (Sec. 4, Act of March 3, 1887, 24 Stat. 505) [see 28
    U.S.C. 2071, 2072]." (Brief for the United States, p. 31, n. 17.)
      United States v. Sherwood, supra, emphasizes, however, that the
    application of the rules in Tucker Act cases affects only matters
    of procedure and does not operate to extend jurisdiction. See also
    Rule 82. In the Sherwood case, the New York Supreme Court, acting
    under Sec. 795 of the New York Civil Practice Act, made an order
    authorizing Sherwood, as a judgment creditor, to maintain a suit
    under the Tucker Act to recover damages from the United States for
    breach of its contract with the judgment debtor, Kaiser, for
    construction of a post office building. Sherwood brought suit
    against the United States and Kaiser in the District Court for the
    Eastern District of New York. The question before the United States
    Supreme Court was whether a United States District Court had
    jurisdiction to entertain a suit against the United States wherein
    private parties were joined as parties defendant. It was contended
    that either the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or the Tucker Act,
    or both, embodied the consent of the United States to be sued in
    litigations in which issues between the plaintiff and third persons
    were to be adjudicated. Regarding the effect of the Federal Rules,
    the Court declared that nothing in the rules, so far as they may be
    applicable in Tucker Act cases, authorized the maintenance of any
    suit against the United States to which it had not otherwise
    consented. The matter involved was not one of procedure but of
    jurisdiction, the limits of which were marked by the consent of the
    United States to be sued. The jurisdiction thus limited is
    unaffected by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
      Subdivision (a)(2). The added sentence makes it clear that the
    rules have not superseded the requirements of U.S.C., Title 28,
    Sec. 466 [now 2253]. Schenk v. Plummer (C.C.A. 9th, 1940) 113
    F.(2d) 726.
      For correct application of the rules in proceedings for
    forfeiture of property for violation of a statute of the United
    States, such as under U.S.C., Title 22, Sec. 405 (seizure of war
    materials intended for unlawful export) or U.S.C., Title 21, Sec.
    334(b) (Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; formerly Title 21,
    Sec. 14, Pure Food and Drug Act), see Reynal v. United States
    (C.C.A. 5th, 1945) 153 F.(2d) 929; United States v. 108 Boxes of
    Cheddar Cheese (S.D.Iowa 1943) 3 F.R.D. 40.
      Subdivision (a)(3). The added sentence makes it clear that the
    rules apply to appeals from proceedings to enforce administrative
    subpoenas. See Perkins v. Endicott Johnson Corp. (C.C.A. 2d 1942)
    128 F.(2d) 208, aff'd on other grounds (1943) 317 U.S. 501; Walling
    v. News Printing, Inc. (C.C.A. 3d, 1945) 148 F.(2d) 57; McCrone v.
    United States (1939) 307 U.S. 61. And, although the provision
    allows full recognition of the fact that the rigid application of
    the rules in the proceedings themselves may conflict with the
    summary determination desired [Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v.
    National Labor Relations Board (C.C.A. 6th, 1941) 122 F.(2d) 450;
    Cudahy Packing Co. v. National Labor Relations Board (C.C.A. 10th,
    1941) 117 F.(2d) 692], it is drawn so as to permit application of
    any of the rules in the proceedings whenever the district court
    deems them helpful. See, e.g., Peoples Natural Gas Co. v. Federal
    Power Commission (App. D.C. 1942) 127 F.(2d) 153, cert. den. (1942)
    316 U.S. 700; Martin v. Chandis Securities Co. (C.C.A. 9th, 1942)
    128 F.(2d) 731. Compare the application of the rules in summary
    proceedings in bankruptcy under General Order 37. See 1 Collier on
    Bankruptcy (14th ed. by Moore and Oglebay) 326-327; 2 Collier, op.
    cit. supra, 1401-1402; 3 Collier, op. cit. supra, 228-231; 4
    Collier, op. cit. supra, 1199-1202.
      Subdivision (a)(6). Section 405 of U.S.C., Title 8 originally
    referred to in the last sentence of paragraph (6), has been
    repealed and Sec. 738 [see 1451], U.S.C., Title 8, has been enacted
    in its stead. The last sentence of paragraph (6) has, therefore,
    been amended in accordance with this change. The sentence has also
    been amended so as to refer directly to the statute regarding the
    provision of time for answer, thus avoiding any confusion attendant
    upon a change in the statute.
      That portion of subdivision (a)(6) making the rules applicable to
    proceedings for enforcement or review of compensation orders under
    the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act [33 U.S.C.
    Sec. 901 et seq.] was added by an amendment made pursuant to order
    of the Court, December 28, 1939, effective three months subsequent
    to the adjournment of the 76th Congress, January 3, 1941.
      Subdivision (c). The change in subdivision (c) effects more
    speedy trials in removed actions. In some states many of the courts
    have only two terms a year. A case, if filed 20 days before a term,
    is returnable to that term, but if filed less than 20 days before a
    term, is returnable to the following term, which convenes six
    months later. Hence, under the original wording of Rule 81(c),
    where a case is filed less than 20 days before the term and is
    removed within a few days but before answer, it is possible for the
    defendant to delay interposing his answer or presenting his
    defenses by motion for six months or more. The rule as amended
    prevents this result.
      Subdivision (f). The use of the phrase "the United States or an
    officer or agency thereof" in the rules (as e.g., in Rule 12(a) and
    amended Rule 73(a)) could raise the question of whether "officer"
    includes a collector of internal revenue, a former collector, or
    the personal representative of a deceased collector, against whom
    suits for tax refunds are frequently instituted. Difficulty might
    ensue for the reason that a suit against a collector or his
    representative has been held to be a personal action. Sage v.
    United States (1919) 250 U.S. 33; Smietanka v. Indiana Steel Co.
    (1921) 257 U.S. 1; United States v. Nunnally Investment Co. (1942)
    316 U.S. 258. The addition of subdivision (f) to Rule 81 dispels
    any doubts on the matter and avoids further litigation.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1948 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) - Paragraph (1). - The Copyright Act of March 4,
    1909, as amended, was repealed and Title 17, U.S.C., enacted into
    positive law by the Act of July 30, 1947, c. 391, Secs. 1, 2, 61
    Stat. 652. The first amendment, therefore, reflects this change.
    The second amendment involves a matter of nomenclature and reflects
    the official designation of the United States District Court for
    the District of Columbia in Title 28, U.S.C. Secs. 88, 132.
      Paragraph (2). - The amendment substitutes the present statutory
    reference.
      Paragraph (3). - The Arbitration Act of February 12, 1925, was
    repealed and Title 9, U.S.C., enacted into positive law by the Act
    of July 30, 1947, c. 392, Secs. 1, 2, 61 Stat. 669, and the
    amendment reflects this change. The Act of May 20, 1926, c. 347,
    Sec. 9 (44 Stat. 585), U.S.C., Title 45, Sec. 159, deals with the
    review by the district court of an award of a board of arbitration
    under the Railway Labor Act, and provides, inter alia, for an
    appeal within 10 days from a final judgment of the district court
    to the court of appeals. It is not clear whether Title 28, U.S.C.,
    repealed this time period and substituted the time periods provided
    for in Title 28, U.S.C., Sec. 2107, normally a minimum of 30 days.
    If there has been no repeal, then the 10-day time period of 45
    U.S.C., Sec. 159, applies by virtue of the "unless" clause in Rule
    73(a); if there has been a repeal, then the other time periods
    stated in Rule 73(a), normally a minimum of 30 days, apply. For
    discussion, see Note to Rule 73 (Sec. ), supra.
      Paragraph (4). - The nomenclature of the district courts is
    changed to conform to the official designation in Title 28, U.S.C.,
    Sec. 132(a).
      Paragraph (5). - The nomenclature of the district courts is
    changed to conform to the official designation in Title 28, U.S.C.,
    Sec. 132(a). The Act of July 5, 1935, c. 372, Secs. 9 and 10, was
    amended by Act of June 23, 1947, c. 120, 61 Stat. 143, 146, and
    will probably be amended from time to time. Insertion in Rule
    81(a)(5) of the words "as amended", and deletion of the subsection
    reference "(e), (g), and (i)" of U.S.C., Title 29, Sec. 160, make
    correcting references and are sufficiently general to include
    future statutory amendment.
      Paragraph (6). - The Chinese Exclusion Acts were repealed by the
    Act of December 17, 1943, c. 344, Sec. 1, 57 Stat. 600, and hence
    the reference to the Act of September 13, 1888, as amended, is
    deleted. The Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act of
    March 4, 1927, was amended by Act of June 25, 1936, c. 804, 49
    Stat. 1921, and hence the words "as amended" have been added to
    reflect this change and, as they are sufficiently general, to
    include future statutory amendment. The Nationality Act of October
    14, 1940, c. 876, 54 Stat. 1137, 1172, repealed and replaced the
    Act of June 29, 1906, as amended, and correcting statutory
    references are, therefore, made.
      Subdivision (c). - In the first sentence the change in
    nomenclature conforms to the official designation of district
    courts in Title 28, U.S.C., Sec. 132(a); and the word "all" is
    deleted as superfluous. The need for revision of the third sentence
    is occasioned by the procedure for removal set forth in revised
    Title 28, U.S.C., Sec. 1446. Under the prior removal procedure
    governing civil actions, 28 U.S.C., Sec. 72 (1946), the petition
    for removal had to be first presented to and filed with the state
    court, except in the case of removal on the basis of prejudice or
    local influence, within the time allowed "to answer or plead to the
    declaration or complaint of the plaintiff"; and the defendant had
    to file a transcript of the record in the federal court within
    thirty days from the date of filing his removal petition. Under
    Sec. 1446(a) removal is effected by a defendant filing with the
    proper United States district court "a verified petition containing
    a short and plain statement of the facts which entitled him or them
    to removal together with a copy of all process, pleadings, and
    orders served upon him or them in such action." And Sec. 1446(b)
    provides: "The petition for removal of a civil action or proceeding
    may be filed within twenty days after commencement of the action or
    service of process, whichever is later." This subsection (b) gives
    trouble in states where an action may be both commenced and service
    of process made without serving or otherwise giving the defendant a
    copy of the complaint or other initial pleading. To cure this
    statutory defect, the Judge's Committee appointed pursuant to
    action of the Judicial Conference and headed by Judge Albert B.
    Maris is proposing an amendment to Sec. 1446(b) to read
    substantially as follows: "The petition for removal of a civil
    action or proceedings shall be filed within 20 days after the
    receipt through service or otherwise by the defendant of a copy of
    the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief upon which
    the action or proceeding is based." The revised third sentence of
    Rule 81(c) is geared to this proposed statutory amendment; and it
    gives the defendant at least 5 days after removal within which to
    present his defenses.*

      The change in the last sentence of subdivision (c) reflects the
    fact that a transcript of the record is no longer required under
    Sec. 1446, and safeguards the right to demand a jury trial, where
    the right has not already been waived and where the parties are at
    issue - "all necessary pleadings have been served." Only, rarely
    will the last sentence of Rule 81(c) have any applicability, since
    removal will normally occur before the pleadings are closed, and in
    this usual situation Rule 38(b) applies and safeguards the right to
    jury trial. See Moore's Federal practice (1st ed.) 3020.
      Subdivision (d). - This subdivision is abrogated because it is
    obsolete and unnecessary under Title 28, U.S.C. Sections 88, 132,
    and 133 provide that the District of Columbia constitutes a
    judicial district, the district court of that district is the
    United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and the
    personnel of that court are district judges. Sections 41, 43, and
    44 provide that the District of Columbia is a judicial circuit, the
    court of appeals of that circuit is the United States Court of
    Appeals for the District of Columbia, and the personnel of that
    court are circuit judges.
      Subdivision (e). - The change in nomenclature conforms to the
    official designation of the United States District Court for the
    District of Columbia in Title 28, U.S.C., Secs. 132(a), 88.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1963 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a)(4). This change reflects the transfer of
    functions from the Secretary of Commerce to the Secretary of the
    Interior made by 1939 Reorganization Plan No. II, Sec. 4(e), 53
    Stat. 1433.
      Subdivision (a)(6). The proper current reference is to the 1952
    statute superseding the 1940 statute.
      Subdivision (c). Most of the cases have held that a party who has
    made a proper express demand for jury trial in the State court is
    not required to renew the demand after removal of the action.
    Zakoscielny v. Waterman Steamship Corp., 16 F.R.D. 314 (D.Md.
    1954); Talley v. American Bakeries Co., 15 F.R.D. 391 (E.D.Tenn.
    1954); Rehrer v. Service Trucking Co., 15 F.R.D. 113 (D.Del. 1953);
    5 Moore's Federal Practice &#182; 38.39[3] (2d ed. 1951); 1 Barron
    & Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 132 (Wright ed.
    1960). But there is some authority to the contrary. Petsel v.
    Chicago, B. & Q.R. Co., 101 F.Supp. 1006 (S.D.Iowa 1951) Nelson v.
    American Nat. Bank & Trust Co., 9 F.R.D. 680 (E.D.Tenn. 1950). The
    amendment adopts the preponderant view.
      In order still further to avoid unintended waivers of jury trial,
    the amendment provides that where by State law applicable in the
    court from which the case is removed a party is entitled to jury
    trial without making an express demand, he need not make a demand
    after removal. However, the district court for calendar or other
    purposes may on its own motion direct the parties to state whether
    they demand a jury, and the court must make such a direction upon
    the request of any party. Under the amendment a district court may
    find it convenient to establish a routine practice of giving these
    directions to the parties in appropriate cases.
      Subdivision (f). The amendment recognizes the change of
    nomenclature made by Treasury Dept. Order 150-26(2), 18 Fed. Reg.
    3499 (1953).
      As to a special problem arising under Rule 25 (Substitution of
    parties) in actions for refund of taxes, see the Advisory
    Committee's Note to the amendment of Rule 25(d), effective July 19,
    1961; and 4 Moore's Federal Practice Sec. 25.09 at 531 (2d ed.
    1950).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      See Note to Rule 1, supra.
      Statutory proceedings to forfeit property for violation of the
    laws of the United States, formerly governed by the admiralty
    rules, will be governed by the unified and supplemental rules. See
    Supplemental Rule A.
      Upon the recommendation of the judges of the United States
    District Court for the District of Columbia, the Federal Rules of
    Civil Procedure are made applicable to probate proceedings in that
    court. The exception with regard to adoption proceedings is removed
    because the court no longer has jurisdiction of those matters; and
    the words "mental health" are substituted for "lunacy" to conform
    to the current characterization in the District.
      The purpose of the amendment to paragraph (3) is to permit the
    deletion from Rule 73(a) of the clause "unless a shorter time is
    provided by law." The 10 day period fixed for an appeal under 45
    U.S.C. Sec. 159 is the only instance of a shorter time provided for
    appeals in civil cases. Apart from the unsettling effect of the
    clause, it is eliminated because its retention would preserve the
    15 day period heretofore allowed by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2107 for appeals
    from interlocutory decrees in admiralty, it being one of the
    purposes of the amendment to make the time for appeals in civil and
    admiralty cases uniform under the unified rules. See Advisory
    Committee's Note to subdivision (a) of Rule 73.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1968 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments eliminate inappropriate references to appellate
    procedure.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1971 AMENDMENT       
      Title 28, U.S.C., Sec. 2243 now requires that the custodian of a
    person detained must respond to an application for a writ of habeas
    corpus "within three days unless for good cause additional time,
    not exceeding twenty days, is allowed." The amendment increases to
    forty days the additional time that the district court may allow in
    habeas corpus proceedings involving persons in custody pursuant to
    a judgment of a state court. The substantial increase in the number
    of such proceedings in recent years has placed a considerable
    burden on state authorities. Twenty days has proved in practice too
    short a time in which to prepare and file the return in many such
    cases. Allowance of additional time should, of course, be granted
    only for good cause.
      While the time allowed in such a case for the return of the writ
    may not exceed forty days, this does not mean that the state must
    necessarily be limited to that period of time to provide for the
    federal court the transcript of the proceedings of a state trial or
    plenary hearing if the transcript must be prepared after the habeas
    corpus proceeding has begun in the federal court.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2001 AMENDMENT             
      Former Copyright Rule 1 made the Civil Rules applicable to
    copyright proceedings except to the extent the Civil Rules were
    inconsistent with Copyright Rules. Abrogation of the Copyright
    Rules leaves the Civil Rules fully applicable to copyright
    proceedings. Rule 81(a)(1) is amended to reflect this change.
      The District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act
    of 1970, Pub.L. 91-358, 84 Stat. 473, transferred mental health
    proceedings formerly held in the United States District Court for
    the District of Columbia to local District of Columbia courts. The
    provision that the Civil Rules do not apply to these proceedings is
    deleted as superfluous.
      The reference to incorporation of the Civil Rules in the Federal
    Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure has been restyled.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments The Committee Note
    was amended to correct the inadvertent omission of a negative. As
    revised, it correctly reflects the language that is stricken from
    the rule.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      This amendment brings Rule 81(a)(2) into accord with the Rules
    Governing Sec. 2254 and Sec. 2255 proceedings. In its present form,
    Rule 81(a)(2) includes return-time provisions that are inconsistent
    with the provisions in the Rules Governing Secs. 2254 and 2255. The
    inconsistency should be eliminated, and it is better that the time
    provisions continue to be set out in the other rules without
    duplication in Rule 81. Rule 81 also directs that the writ be
    directed to the person having custody of the person detained.
    Similar directions exist in the Sec. 2254 and Sec. 2255 rules,
    providing additional detail for applicants subject to future
    custody. There is no need for partial duplication in Rule 81.
      The provision that the civil rules apply to the extent that
    practice is not set forth in the Sec. 2254 and Sec. 2255 rules
    dovetails with the provisions in Rule 11 of the Sec. 2254 rules and
    Rule 12 of the Sec. 2255 rules.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. The only change since
    publication is deletion of an inadvertent reference to Sec. 2241
    proceedings.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 81 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      Rule 81(c) has been revised to reflect the amendment of 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 1446(a) that changed the procedure for removal from a petition
    for removal to a notice of removal.
      Former Rule 81(e), drafted before the decision in Erie R.R. v.
    Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), defined state law to include "the
    statutes of that state and the state judicial decisions construing
    them." The Erie decision reinterpreted the Rules of Decision Act,
    now 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1652, recognizing that the "laws" of the states
    include the common law established by judicial decisions. Long-
    established practice reflects this understanding, looking to state
    common law as well as statutes and court rules when a Civil Rule
    directs use of state law. Amended Rule 81(d)(1) adheres to this
    practice, including all state judicial decisions, not only those
    that construe state statutes.
      Former Rule 81(f) is deleted. The office of district director of
    internal revenue was abolished by restructuring under the Internal
    Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, Pub. L. 105-
    206, July 22, 1998, 26 U.S.C. Sec. 1 Note.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The times set in the former rule at 5, 10, and 20 days have been
    revised to 7, 14, and 21 days, respectively. See the Note to Rule
    6.
      Several Rules incorporate local state practice. Rule 81(d) now
    provides that "the term 'state' includes, where appropriate, the
    District of Columbia." The definition is expanded to include any
    commonwealth or territory of the United States. As before, these
    entities are included only "where appropriate." They are included
    for the reasons that counsel incorporation of state practice. For
    example, state holidays are recognized in computing time under Rule
    6(a). Other, quite different, examples are Rules 64(a), invoking
    state law for prejudgment remedies, and 69(a)(1), relying on state
    law for the procedure on execution. Including commonwealths and
    territories in these and other rules avoids the gaps that otherwise
    would result when the federal rule relies on local practice rather
    than provide a uniform federal approach. Including them also
    establishes uniformity between federal courts and local courts in
    areas that may involve strong local interests, little need for
    uniformity among federal courts, or difficulty in defining a
    uniform federal practice that integrates effectively with local
    practice.
      Adherence to a local practice may be refused as not "appropriate"
    when the local practice would impair a significant federal
    interest.
      Changes Made after Publication and Comment. The reference to a
    "possession" was deleted in deference to the concerns expressed by
    the Department of Justice.

               * Note. - The Supreme Court made these changes in the
         committee's proposed amendment to Rule 81(c): The phrase, "or
         within 20 days after the service of summons upon such initial
         pleading, then filed," was inserted following the phrase,
         "within 20 days after the receipt through service or otherwise
         of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for
         relief upon which the action or proceeding is based", because
         in several states suit is commenced by service of summons upon
         the defendant, notifying him that the plaintiff's pleading has
         been filed with the clerk of court. Thus, he may never receive
         a copy of the initial pleading. The added phrase is intended
         to give the defendant 20 days after the service of such
         summons in which to answer in a removed action, or 5 days
         after the filing of the petition for removal, whichever is
         longer. In these states, the 20-day period does not begin to
         run until such pleading is actually filed. The last word of
         the third sentence was changed from "longer" to "longest"
         because of the added phrase.
           The phrase, "and who has not already waived his right to
         such trial," which previously appeared in the fourth sentence
         of subsection (c) of Rule 81, was deleted in order to afford a
         party who has waived his right to trial by jury in a state
         court an opportunity to assert that right upon removal to a
         federal court.

      These rules grant extensive power of joining claims and
    counterclaims in one action, but, as this rule states, such grant
    does not extend federal jurisdiction. The rule is declaratory of
    existing practice under the [former] Federal Equity Rules with
    regard to such provisions as [former] Equity Rule 26 on Joinder of
    Causes of Action and [former] Equity Rule 30 on Counterclaims.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1948 AMENDMENT       
      The change in nomenclature conforms to the official designation
    of district courts in Title 28, U.S.C., Sec. 132(a).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1966 AMENDMENT       
      Title 28, U.S.C. Sec. 1391(b) provides: "A civil action wherein
    jurisdiction is not founded solely on diversity of citizenship may
    be brought only in the judicial district where all defendants
    reside, except as otherwise provided by law." This provision cannot
    appropriately be applied to what were formerly suits in admiralty.
    The rationale of decisions holding it inapplicable rests largely on
    the use of the term "civil action"; i.e., a suit in admiralty is
    not a "civil action" within the statute. By virtue of the amendment
    to Rule 1, the provisions of Rule 2 convert suits in admiralty into
    civil actions. The added sentence is necessary to avoid an
    undesirable change in existing law with respect to venue.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2001 AMENDMENT             
      The final sentence of Rule 82 is amended to delete the reference
    to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1393, which has been repealed.

                               STYLE COMMENT                           
      The recommendation that the change be made without publication
    carries with it a recommendation that style changes not be made.
    Styling would carry considerable risks. The first sentence of Rule
    82, for example, states that the Civil Rules do not "extend or
    limit the jurisdiction of the United States district courts." That
    sentence is a flat lie if "jurisdiction" includes personal or quasi-
    in rem jurisdiction. The styling project on this rule requires
    publication and comment.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 82 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

      (a) Local Rules.
        (1) In General. After giving public notice and an opportunity
      for comment, a district court, acting by a majority of its
      district judges, may adopt and amend rules governing its
      practice. A local rule must be consistent with - but not
      duplicate - federal statutes and rules adopted under 28 U.S.C.
      Secs. 2072 and 2075, and must conform to any uniform numbering
      system prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United
      States. A local rule takes effect on the date specified by the
      district court and remains in effect unless amended by the court
      or abrogated by the judicial council of the circuit. Copies of
      rules and amendments must, on their adoption, be furnished to the
      judicial council and the Administrative Office of the United
      States Courts and be made available to the public.
        (2) Requirement of Form. A local rule imposing a requirement of
      form must not be enforced in a way that causes a party to lose
      any right because of a nonwillful failure to comply.

      (b) Procedure When There Is No Controlling Law. A judge may
    regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law, rules
    adopted under 28 U.S.C. Secs. 2072 and 2075, and the district's
    local rules. No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed for
    noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law, federal
    rules, or the local rules unless the alleged violator has been
    furnished in the particular case with actual notice of the
    requirement.

      This rule substantially continues U.S.C., Title 28, Sec. 731 [now
    2071] (Rules of practice in district courts) with the additional
    requirement that copies of such rules and amendments be furnished
    to the Supreme Court of the United States. See [former] Equity Rule
    79 (Additional Rules by District Court). With the last sentence
    compare United States Supreme Court Admiralty Rules (1920), Rule 44
    (Right of Trial Courts To Make Rules of Practice) (originally
    promulgated in 1842).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1985 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 83, which has not been amended since the Federal Rules were
    promulgated in 1938, permits each district to adopt local rules not
    inconsistent with the Federal Rules by a majority of the judges.
    The only other requirement is that copies be furnished to the
    Supreme Court.
      The widespread adoption of local rules and the modest procedural
    prerequisites for their promulgation have led many commentators to
    question the soundness of the process as well as the validity of
    some rules, See 12 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and
    Procedure: Civil Sec. 3152, at 217 (1973); Caballero, Is There an
    Over-Exercise of Local Rule-Making Powers by the United States
    District Courts?, 24 Fed. Bar News 325 (1977). Although the
    desirability of local rules for promoting uniform practice within a
    district is widely accepted, several commentators also have
    suggested reforms to increase the quality, simplicity, and
    uniformity of the local rules. See Note, Rule 83 and the Local
    Federal Rules, 67 Colum.L.Rev. 1251 (1967), and Comment, The Local
    Rules of Civil Procedure in the Federal District Courts - A Survey,
    1966 Duke L.J. 1011.
      The amended Rule attempts, without impairing the procedural
    validity of existing local rules, to enhance the local rulemaking
    process by requiring appropriate public notice of proposed rules
    and an opportunity to comment on them. Although some district
    courts apparently consult the local bar before promulgating rules,
    many do not, which has led to criticism of a process that has
    district judges consulting only with each other. See 12 C. Wright &
    A. Miller, supra, Sec. 3152, at 217; Blair, The New Local Rules for
    Federal Practice In Iowa, 23 Drake L.Rev. 517 (1974). The new
    language subjects local rulemaking to scrutiny similar to that
    accompanying the Federal Rules, administrative rulemaking, and
    legislation. It attempts to assure that the expert advice of
    practitioners and scholars is made available to the district court
    before local rules are promulgated. See Weinstein, Reform of Court
    Rule-Making Procedures 84-87, 127-37, 151 (1977).
      The amended Rule does not detail the procedure for giving notice
    and an opportunity to be heard since conditions vary from district
    to district. Thus, there is no explicit requirement for a public
    hearing, although a district may consider that procedure
    appropriate in all or some rulemaking situations. See generally,
    Weinstein, supra, at 117-37, 151. The new Rule does not foreclose
    any other form of consultation. For example, it can be accomplished
    through the mechanism of an "Advisory Committee" similar to that
    employed by the Supreme Court in connection with the Federal Rules
    themselves.
      The amended Rule provides that a local rule will take effect upon
    the date specified by the district court and will remain in effect
    unless amended by the district court or abrogated by the judicial
    council. The effectiveness of a local rule should not be deferred
    until approved by the judicial council because that might unduly
    delay promulgation of a local rule that should become effective
    immediately, especially since some councils do not meet frequently.
    Similarly, it was thought that to delay a local rule's
    effectiveness for a fixed period of time would be arbitrary and
    that to require the judicial council to abrogate a local rule
    within a specified time would be inconsistent with its power under
    28 U.S.C. Sec. 332 (1976) to nullify a local rule at any time. The
    expectation is that the judicial council will examine all local
    rules, including those currently in effect, with an eye toward
    determining whether they are valid and consistent with the Federal
    Rules, promote inter-district uniformity and efficiency, and do not
    undermine the basic objectives of the Federal Rules.
      The amended Rule requires copies of local rules to be sent upon
    their promulgation to the judicial council and the Administrative
    Office of the United States Courts rather than to the Supreme
    Court. The Supreme Court was the appropriate filing place in 1938,
    when Rule 83 originally was promulgated, but the establishment of
    the Administrative Office makes it a more logical place to develop
    a centralized file of local rules. This procedure is consistent
    with both the Criminal and the Appellate Rules. See Fed.R.Crim.P.
    57(a); Fed.R.App.P. 47. The Administrative Office also will be able
    to provide improved utilization of the file because of its recent
    development of a Local Rules Index.
      The practice pursued by some judges of issuing standing orders
    has been controversial, particularly among members of the
    practicing bar. The last sentence in Rule 83 has been amended to
    make certain that standing orders are not inconsistent with the
    Federal Rules or any local district court rules. Beyond that, it is
    hoped that each district will adopt procedures, perhaps by local
    rule, for promulgating and reviewing single-judge standing orders.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1995 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivison (a). This rule is amended to reflect the requirement
    that local rules be consistent not only with the national rules but
    also with Acts of Congress. The amendment also states that local
    rules should not repeat Acts of Congress or national rules.
      The amendment also requires that the numbering of local rules
    conform with any uniform numbering system that may be prescribed by
    the Judicial Conference. Lack of uniform numbering might create
    unnecessary traps for counsel and litigants. A uniform numbering
    system would make it easier for an increasingly national bar and
    for litigants to locate a local rule that applies to a particular
    procedural issue.
      Paragraph (2) is new. Its aim is to protect against loss of
    rights in the enforcement of local rules relating to matters of
    form. For example, a party should not be deprived of a right to a
    jury trial because its attorney, unaware of - or forgetting - a
    local rule directing that jury demands be noted in the caption of
    the case, includes a jury demand only in the body of the pleading.
    The proscription of paragraph (2) is narrowly drawn - covering only
    violations attributable to nonwillful failure to comply and only
    those involving local rules directed to matters of form. It does
    not limit the court's power to impose substantive penalties upon a
    party if it or its attorney contumaciously or willfully violates a
    local rule, even one involving merely a matter of form. Nor does it
    affect the court's power to enforce local rules that involve more
    than mere matters of form - for example, a local rule requiring
    parties to identify evidentiary matters relied upon to support or
    oppose motions for summary judgment.
      Subdivision (b). This rule provides flexibility to the court in
    regulating practice when there is no controlling law. Specifically,
    it permits the court to regulate practice in any manner consistent
    with Acts of Congress, with rules adopted under 28 U.S.C. Secs.
    2072 and 2075, and with the district local rules.
      This rule recognizes that courts rely on multiple directives to
    control practice. Some courts regulate practice through the
    published Federal Rules and the local rules of the court. Some
    courts also have used internal operating procedures, standing
    orders, and other internal directives. Although such directives
    continue to be authorized, they can lead to problems. Counsel or
    litigants may be unaware of various directives. In addition, the
    sheer volume of directives may impose an unreasonable barrier. For
    example, it may be difficult to obtain copies of the directives.
    Finally, counsel or litigants may be unfairly sanctioned for
    failing to comply with a directive. For these reasons, the
    amendment to this rule disapproves imposing any sanction or other
    disadvantage on a person for noncompliance with such an internal
    directive, unless the alleged violator has been furnished actual
    notice of the requirement in a particular case.
      There should be no adverse consequence to a party or attorney for
    violating special requirements relating to practice before a
    particular court unless the party or attorney has actual notice of
    those requirements. Furnishing litigants with a copy outlining the
    judge's practices - or attaching instructions to a notice setting a
    case for conference or trial - would suffice to give actual notice,
    as would an order in a case specifically adopting by reference a
    judge's standing order and indicating how copies can be obtained.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 83 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

      In accordance with the practice found useful in many codes,
    provision is here made for a limited number of official forms which
    may serve as guides in pleading. Compare 2 Mass. Gen. Laws (Ter.
    Ed., 1932) ch. 231, Sec. 147, Forms 1-47; English Annual Practice

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1946 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment serves to emphasize that the forms contained in the
    Appendix of Forms are sufficient to withstand attack under the
    rules under which they are drawn, and that the practitioner using
    them may rely on them to that extent. The circuit courts of appeals
    generally have upheld the use of the forms as promoting desirable
    simplicity and brevity of statement. Sierocinski v. E. I. DuPont
    DeNemours & Co. (C.C.A. 3d, 1939) 103 F.(2d) 843; Swift & Co. v.
    Young (C.C.A. 4th, 1939) 107 F.(2d) 170; Sparks v. England (C.C.A.
    8th, 1940) 113 F.(2d) 579; Ramsouer v. Midland Valley R. Co.
    (C.C.A. 8th, 1943) 135 F.(2d) 101. And the forms as a whole have
    met with widespread approval in the courts. See cases cited in 1
    Moore's Federal Practice (1938), Cum. Supplement Sec. 8.07, under
    "Page 554"; see also Commentary, The Official Forms (1941) 4 Fed.
    Rules Serv. 954. In Cook, "Facts" and "Statements of Fact" (1937) 4
    U.Chi.L.Rev. 233, 245-246, it is said with reference to what is now
    Rule 84: ". . . pleaders in the federal courts are not to be left
    to guess as to the meaning of [the] language" in Rule 8 (a)
    regarding the form of the complaint. "All of which is as it should
    be. In no other way can useless litigation be avoided." Ibid. The
    amended rule will operate to discourage isolated results such as
    those found in Washburn v. Moorman Mfg. Co. (S.D.Cal. 1938) 25
    F.Supp. 546; Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co. of Wisconsin v.

      By making the general amendments effective on the day following
    the adjournment of the first regular session of Congress to which
    they are transmitted, subdivision (c), supra, departs slightly from
    the prior practice of making amendments effective on the day which
    is three months subsequent to the adjournment of Congress or on
    September 1 of that year, whichever day is later. The reason for
    this departure is that no added period of time is needed for the
    Bench and Bar to acquaint themselves with the general amendments,
    which effect a change in nomenclature to conform to revised Title
    28, substitute present statutory references to this Title and cure
    the omission or defect occasioned by the statutory revision in
    relation to the substitution of public officers, to a cost bond on
    appeal, and to procedure after removal (see Rules 25(d), 73(c),
    81(c)).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The language of Rule 86 has been amended as part of the general
    restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood
    and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.
    These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
      The subdivisions that provided a list of the effective dates of
    the original Civil Rules and amendments made up to 1963 are deleted
    as no longer useful.
      Rule 86(b) is added to clarify the relationship of amendments
    taking effect on December 1, 2007, to other laws for the purpose of
    applying the "supersession" clause in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2072(b).
    Section 2072(b) provides that a law in conflict with an Enabling
    Act Rule "shall be of no further force or effect after such rule[]
    ha[s] taken effect." The amendments that take effect on December 1,
    2007, result from the general restyling of the Civil Rules and from
    a small number of technical revisions adopted on a parallel track.
    None of these amendments is intended to affect resolution of any
    conflict that might arise between a rule and another law. Rule
    86(b) makes this intent explicit. Any conflict that arises should
    be resolved by looking to the date the specific conflicting rule
    provision first became effective.

        EFFECTIVE DATE OF 1966 AMENDMENT; TRANSMISSION TO CONGRESS;

      Sections 2-4 of the Order of the Supreme Court, dated Feb. 28,
    1966, 383 U.S. 1031, provided:
      "2. That the foregoing amendments and additions to the Rules of
    Civil Procedure shall take effect on July 1, 1966, and shall govern
    all proceedings in actions brought thereafter and also in all
    further proceedings in actions then pending, except to the extent
    that in the opinion of the court their application in a particular
    action then pending would not be feasible or would work injustice,
    in which event the former procedure applies.
      "3. That the Chief Justice be, and he hereby is, authorized to
    transmit to the Congress the foregoing amendments and additions to
    the Rules of Civil Procedure in accordance with the provisions of
    Title 28, U.S.C., Secs. 2072 and 2073.

    EXCERPTS FROM THE REPORT OF THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE - COMMITTEE ON
             RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE - SEPTEMBER 2006

                          THE ILLUSTRATIVE FORMS                      
      The advisory committee submitted proposed revisions to
    Illustrative Forms 1 through 35 (to become Forms 1 through 82)
    contained in the Appendix of Forms to the Federal Rules of Civil
    Procedure with a recommendation that they be approved and
    transmitted to the Judicial Conference. * * *
      The Illustrative Forms have not been revised or updated in many
    years. The advisory committee applied the same style conventions
    and principles to the forms as was used with the restyled rules. It
    declined to make changes to the substance of the forms, consistent
    with its style-project policy, even though some of the forms
    represent approaches to pleading and other submissions that may not
    be consistent with current practices. For example, the "complaint"
    forms call for allegations that are far briefer than are commonly
    found in cases filed in the district courts. Similarly, the
    advisory committee did not change the choice of examples in the
    forms; the "negligence complaint" form continues to use the example
    of an automobile striking a pedestrian.
      The forms have been reorganized and grouped by subject area. The
    revised forms place "special" forms as Forms 1-9; "complaint" forms
    as Forms 10-21,[;] "answer" forms as Forms 31-31 [sic]; "motions"
    forms as Forms 40-42; "discovery" forms as Forms 50-52;
    "condemnation" forms as Forms 60-61; "judgment" forms as Forms 70-
    71; and forms for "assignment to magistrate judges" as Forms 80-
    82.
      The pleading dates in the forms were eliminated and a uniform
    blank date was substituted. Explanatory Notes were also eliminated,
    because the forms are intended to stand on their own as simple and
    brief illustrations.

                   NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES               
      The amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to unify
    the civil and admiralty procedure, together with the Supplemental
    Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims, completely
    superseded the Admiralty Rules, effective July 1, 1966.
    Accordingly, the latter were rescinded.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1985 AMENDMENT       
      Since their promulgation in 1966, the Supplemental Rules for
    Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims have preserved the special
    procedures of arrest and attachment unique to admiralty law. In
    recent years, however, these Rules have been challenged as
    violating the principles of procedural due process enunciated in
    the United States Supreme Court's decision in Sniadach v. Family
    Finance Corp., 395 U.S. 337 (1969), and later developed in Fuentes
    v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67 (1972); Mitchell v. W. T. Grant Co., 416
    U.S. 600 (1974); and North Georgia Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem,
    Inc., 419 U.S. 601 (1975). These Supreme Court decisions provide
    five basic criteria for a constitutional seizure of property: (1)
    effective notice to persons having interests in the property
    seized, (2) judicial review prior to attachment, (3) avoidance of
    conclusory allegations in the complaint, (4) security posted by the
    plaintiff to protect the owner of the property under attachment,
    and (5) a meaningful and timely hearing after attachment.
      Several commentators have found the Supplemental Rules lacking on
    some or all five grounds. E.g., Batiza & Partridge, The
    Constitutional Challenge to Maritime Seizures, 26 Loy. L. Rev. 203
    (1980); Morse, The Conflict Between the Supreme Court Admiralty
    Rules and Sniadach-Fuentes: A Collision Course?, 3 Fla. St. U.L.
    Rev. 1 (1975). The federal courts have varied in their disposition
    of challenges to the Supplemental Rules. The Fourth and Fifth
    Circuits have affirmed the constitutionality of Rule C. Amstar
    Corp. v. S/S Alexandros T., 664 F.2d 904 (4th Cir. 1981); Merchants
    National Bank of Mobile v. The Dredge General G. L. Gillespie, 663
    F.2d 1338 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. dismissed, 456 U.S. 966 (1982).
    However, a district court in the Ninth Circuit found Rule C
    unconstitutional. Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. The Vessel Bay
    Ridge, 509 F. Supp. 1115 (D. Alaska 1981), appeal dismissed, 703
    F.2d 381 (9th Cir. 1983). Rule B(1) has received similar
    inconsistent treatment. The Ninth and Eleventh Circuits have upheld
    its constitutionality. Polar Shipping, Ltd. v. Oriental Shipping
    Corp., 680 F.2d 627 (9th Cir. 1982); Schiffahartsgesellschaft
    Leonhardt & Co. v. A. Bottacchi S. A. de Navegacion, 732 F.2d 1543
    (11th Cir. 1984). On the other hand, a Washington district court
    has found it to be constitutionally deficient. Grand Bahama
    Petroleum Co. v. Canadian Transportation Agencies, Ltd., 450 F.
    Supp. 447 (W.D. Wash. 1978). The constitutionality of both rules
    was questioned in Techem Chem Co. v. M/T Choyo Maru, 416 F. Supp.
    960 (D. Md. 1976). Thus, there is uncertainty as to whether the
    current rules prescribe constitutionally sound procedures for
    guidance of courts and counsel. See generally Note, Due Process in
    Admiralty Arrest and Attachment, 56 Tex. L. Rev. 1091 (1978).
      Due to the controversy and uncertainty that have surrounded the
    Supplemental Rules, local admiralty bars and the Maritime Law
    Association of the United States have sought to strengthen the
    constitutionality of maritime arrest and attachment by encouraging
    promulgation of local admiralty rules providing for prompt post-
    seizure hearings. Some districts also adopted rules calling for
    judicial scrutiny of applications for arrest or attachment.
    Nonetheless, the result has been a lack of uniformity and continued
    concern over the constitutionality of the existing practice. The
    amendments that follow are intended to provide rules that meet the
    requirements prescribed by the Supreme Court and to develop
    uniformity in the admiralty practice.

-STATUTE-
      (1) These Supplemental Rules apply to:
        (A) the procedure in admiralty and maritime claims within the
      meaning of Rule 9(h) with respect to the following remedies:
          (i) maritime attachment and garnishment,
          (ii) actions in rem,
          (iii) possessory, petitory, and partition actions, and
          (iv) actions for exoneration from or limitation of liability;

        (B) forfeiture actions in rem arising from a federal statute;
      and
        (C) the procedure in statutory condemnation proceedings
      analogous to maritime actions in rem, whether within the
      admiralty and maritime jurisdiction or not. Except as otherwise
      provided, references in these Supplemental Rules to actions in
      rem include such analogous statutory condemnation proceedings.

      (2) The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure also apply to the
    foregoing proceedings except to the extent that they are
    inconsistent with these Supplemental Rules.

                   NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES               
      Certain distinctively maritime remedies must be preserved in
    unified rules. The commencement of an action by attachment or
    garnishment has heretofore been practically unknown in federal
    jurisprudence except in admiralty, although the amendment of Rule
    4(e) effective July 1, 1963, makes available that procedure in
    accordance with state law. The maritime proceeding in rem is
    unique, except as it has been emulated by statute, and is closely
    related to the substantive maritime law relating to liens. Arrest
    of the vessel or other maritime property is an historic remedy in
    controversies over title or right to possession, and in disputes
    among co-owners over the vessel's employment. The statutory right
    to limit liability is limited to owners of vessels, and has its own
    complexities. While the unified federal rules are generally
    applicable to these distinctive proceedings, certain special rules
    dealing with them are needed.
      Arrest of the person and imprisonment for debt are not included
    because these remedies are not peculiarly maritime. The practice is
    not uniform but conforms to state law. See 2 Benedict Sec. 286; 28
    U.S.C., Sec. 2007; FRCP 64, 69. The relevant provisions of
    Admiralty Rules 2, 3, and 4 are unnecessary or obsolete.
      No attempt is here made to compile a complete and self-contained
    code governing these distinctively maritime remedies. The more
    limited objective is to carry forward the relevant provisions of
    the former Rules of Practice for Admiralty and Maritime Cases,
    modernized and revised to some extent but still in the context of
    history and precedent. Accordingly, these Rules are not to be
    construed as limiting or impairing the traditional power of a
    district court, exercising the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,
    to adapt its procedures and its remedies in the individual case,
    consistently with these rules, to secure the just, speedy, and
    inexpensive determination of every action. (See Swift & Co.,
    Packers v. Compania Columbiana Del Caribe, S/A, 339 U.S. 684,
    (1950); Rule 1). In addition, of course, the district courts retain
    the power to make local rules not inconsistent with these rules.
    See Rule 83; cf. Admiralty Rule 44.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      Rule A is amended to reflect the adoption of Rule G to govern
    procedure in civil forfeiture actions. Rule G(1) contemplates
    application of other Supplemental Rules to the extent that Rule G
    does not address an issue. One example is the Rule E(4)(c)
    provision for arresting intangible property.

-HEAD-
    Rule B. In Personam Actions: Attachment and Garnishment

-STATUTE-
      (1) When Available; Complaint, Affidavit, Judicial Authorization,
    and Process. In an in personam action:
        (a) If a defendant is not found within the district when a
      verified complaint praying for attachment and the affidavit
      required by Rule B(1)(b) are filed, a verified complaint may
      contain a prayer for process to attach the defendant's tangible
      or intangible personal property - up to the amount sued for - in
      the hands of garnishees named in the process.
        (b) The plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney must sign and
      file with the complaint an affidavit stating that, to the
      affiant's knowledge, or on information and belief, the defendant
      cannot be found within the district. The court must review the
      complaint and affidavit and, if the conditions of this Rule B
      appear to exist, enter an order so stating and authorizing
      process of attachment and garnishment. The clerk may issue
      supplemental process enforcing the court's order upon application
      without further court order.
        (c) If the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney certifies that
      exigent circumstances make court review impracticable, the clerk
      must issue the summons and process of attachment and garnishment.
      The plaintiff has the burden in any post-attachment hearing under
      Rule E(4)(f) to show that exigent circumstances existed.
        (d)(i) If the property is a vessel or tangible property on
      board a vessel, the summons, process, and any supplemental
      process must be delivered to the marshal for service.
        (ii) If the property is other tangible or intangible property,
      the summons, process, and any supplemental process must be
      delivered to a person or organization authorized to serve it, who
      may be (A) a marshal; (B) someone under contract with the United
      States; (C) someone specially appointed by the court for that
      purpose; or, (D) in an action brought by the United States, any
      officer or employee of the United States.
        (e) The plaintiff may invoke state-law remedies under Rule 64
      for seizure of person or property for the purpose of securing
      satisfaction of the judgment.

      (2) Notice to Defendant. No default judgment may be entered
    except upon proof - which may be by affidavit - that:
        (a) the complaint, summons, and process of attachment or
      garnishment have been served on the defendant in a manner
      authorized by Rule 4;
        (b) the plaintiff or the garnishee has mailed to the defendant
      the complaint, summons, and process of attachment or garnishment,
      using any form of mail requiring a return receipt; or
        (c) the plaintiff or the garnishee has tried diligently to give
      notice of the action to the defendant but could not do so.

      (3) Answer.
        (a) By Garnishee. The garnishee shall serve an answer, together
      with answers to any interrogatories served with the complaint,
      within 21 days after service of process upon the garnishee.
      Interrogatories to the garnishee may be served with the complaint
      without leave of court. If the garnishee refuses or neglects to
      answer on oath as to the debts, credits, or effects of the
      defendant in the garnishee's hands, or any interrogatories
      concerning such debts, credits, and effects that may be
      propounded by the plaintiff, the court may award compulsory
      process against the garnishee. If the garnishee admits any debts,
      credits, or effects, they shall be held in the garnishee's hands
      or paid into the registry of the court, and shall be held in
      either case subject to the further order of the court.
        (b) By Defendant. The defendant shall serve an answer within 30
      days after process has been executed, whether by attachment of
      property or service on the garnishee.

    Subdivision (1)

      This preserves the traditional maritime remedy of attachment and
    garnishment, and carries forward the relevant substance of
    Admiralty Rule 2. In addition, or in the alternative, provision is
    made for the use of similar state remedies made available by the
    amendment of Rule 4(e) effective July 1, 1963. On the effect of
    appearance to defend against attachment see Rule E(8).
      The rule follows closely the language of Admiralty Rule 2. No
    change is made with respect to the property subject to attachment.
    No change is made in the condition that makes the remedy available.
    The rules have never defined the clause, "if the defendant shall
    not be found within the district," and no definition is attempted
    here. The subject seems one best left for the time being to
    development on a case-by-case basis. The proposal does shift from
    the marshal (on whom it now rests in theory) to the plaintiff the
    burden of establishing that the defendant cannot be found in the
    district.
      A change in the context of the practice is brought about by Rule
    4(f), which will enable summons to be served throughout the state
    instead of, as heretofore, only within the district. The Advisory
    Committee considered whether the rule on attachment and garnishment
    should be correspondingly changed to permit those remedies only
    when the defendant cannot be found within the state and concluded
    that the remedy should not be so limited.
      The effect is to enlarge the class of cases in which the
    plaintiff may proceed by attachment or garnishment although
    jurisdiction of the person of the defendant may be independently
    obtained. This is possible at the present time where, for example,
    a corporate defendant has appointed an agent within the district to
    accept service of process but is not carrying on activities there
    sufficient to subject it to jurisdiction. (Seawind Compania, S.A.
    v. Crescent Line, Inc., 320 F.2d 580 (2d Cir. 1963)), or where,
    though the foreign corporation's activities in the district are
    sufficient to subject it personally to the jurisdiction, there is
    in the district no officer on whom process can be served (United
    States v. Cia. Naviera Continental, S.A., 178 F.Supp. 561,
    (S.D.N.Y. 1959)).
      Process of attachment or garnishment will be limited to the
    district. See Rule E(3)(a).

    Subdivision (2)

      The former Admiralty Rules did not provide for notice to the
    defendant in attachment and garnishment proceedings. None is
    required by the principles of due process, since it is assumed that
    the garnishee or custodian of the property attached will either
    notify the defendant or be deprived of the right to plead the
    judgment as a defense in an action against him by the defendant.
    Harris v. Balk, 198 U.S. 215 (1905); Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714
    (1878). Modern conceptions of fairness, however, dictate that
    actual notice be given to persons known to claim an interest in the
    property that is the subject of the action where that is reasonably
    practicable. In attachment and garnishment proceedings the persons
    whose interests will be affected by the judgment are identified by
    the complaint. No substantial burden is imposed on the plaintiff by
    a simple requirement that he notify the defendant of the action by
    mail.
      In the usual case the defendant is notified of the pendency of
    the proceedings by the garnishee or otherwise, and appears to claim
    the property and to make his answer. Hence notice by mail is not
    routinely required in all cases, but only in those in which the
    defendant has not appeared prior to the time when a default
    judgment is demanded. The rule therefore provides only that no
    default judgment shall be entered except upon proof of notice, or
    of inability to give notice despite diligent efforts to do so. Thus
    the burden of giving notice is further minimized.
      In some cases the plaintiff may prefer to give notice by serving
    process in the usual way instead of simply by mail. (Rule 4(d).) In
    particular, if the defendant is in a foreign country the plaintiff
    may wish to utilize the modes of notice recently provided to
    facilitate compliance with foreign laws and procedures (Rule 4(i)).
    The rule provides for these alternatives.
      The rule does not provide for notice by publication because there
    is no problem concerning unknown claimants, and publication has
    little utility in proportion to its expense where the identity of
    the defendant is known.

    Subdivision (3)

      Subdivision (a) incorporates the substance of Admiralty Rule 36.
      The Admiralty Rules were silent as to when the garnishee and the
    defendant were to answer. See also 2 Benedict ch. XXIV.
      The rule proceeds on the assumption that uniform and definite
    periods of time for responsive pleadings should be substituted for
    return days (see the discussion under Rule C(6), below). Twenty
    days seems sufficient time for the garnishee to answer (cf. FRCP
    12(a)), and an additional 10 days should suffice for the defendant.
    When allowance is made for the time required for notice to reach
    the defendant this gives the defendant in attachment and
    garnishment approximately the same time that defendants have to
    answer when personally served.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1985 AMENDMENT       
      Rule B(1) has been amended to provide for judicial scrutiny
    before the issuance of any attachment or garnishment process. Its
    purpose is to eliminate doubts as to whether the Rule is consistent
    with the principles of procedural due process enunciated by the
    Supreme Court in Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., 395 U.S. 337
    (1969); and later developed in Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67
    (1972); Mitchell v. W. T. Grant Co., 416 U.S. 600 (1974); and North
    Georgia Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., 419 U.S. 601 (1975). Such
    doubts were raised in Grand Bahama Petroleum Co. v. Canadian
    Transportation Agencies, Ltd., 450 F. Supp. 447 (W.D. Wash. 1978);
    and Schiffahartsgesellschaft Leonhardt & Co. v. A. Bottacchi S.A.
    de Navegacion, 552 F. Supp. 771 (S.D. Ga. 1982), which was
    reversed, 732 F.2d 1543 (11th Cir. 1984). But compare Polar
    Shipping Ltd. v. Oriental Shipping Corp., 680 F.2d 627 (9th Cir.
    1982), in which a majority of the panel upheld the
    constitutionality of Rule B because of the unique commercial
    context in which it is invoked. The practice described in Rule B(1)
    has been adopted in some districts by local rule. E.g., N.D. Calif.
    Local Rule 603.3; W.D. Wash. Local Admiralty Rule 15(d).
      The rule envisions that the order will issue when the plaintiff
    makes a prima facie showing that he has a maritime claim against
    the defendant in the amount sued for and the defendant is not
    present in the district. A simple order with conclusory findings is
    contemplated. The reference to review by the "court" is broad
    enough to embrace review by a magistrate as well as by a district
    judge.
      The new provision recognizes that in some situations, such as
    when the judge is unavailable and the ship is about to depart from
    the jurisdiction, it will be impracticable, if not impossible, to
    secure the judicial review contemplated by Rule B(1). When "exigent
    circumstances" exist, the rule enables the plaintiff to secure the
    issuance of the summons and process of attachment and garnishment,
    subject to a later showing that the necessary circumstances
    actually existed. This provision is intended to provide a safety
    valve without undermining the requirement of preattachment
    scrutiny. Thus, every effort to secure judicial review, including
    conducting a hearing by telephone, should be pursued before
    resorting to the exigent-circumstances procedure.
      Rule B(1) also has been amended so that the garnishee shall be
    named in the "process" rather than in the "complaint." This should
    solve the problem presented in Filia Compania Naviera, S.A. v.
    Petroship, S.A., 1983 A.M.C. 1 (S.D.N.Y. 1982), and eliminate any
    need for an additional judicial review of the complaint and
    affidavit when a garnishee is added.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      Rule B(1) is amended in two ways, and style changes have been
    made.
      The service provisions of Rule C(3) are adopted in paragraph (d),
    providing alternatives to service by a marshal if the property to
    be seized is not a vessel or tangible property on board a vessel.
      The provision that allows the plaintiff to invoke state
    attachment and garnishment remedies is amended to reflect the 1993
    amendments of Civil Rule 4. Former Civil Rule 4(e), incorporated in
    Rule B(1), allowed general use of state quasi-in-rem jurisdiction
    if the defendant was not an inhabitant of, or found within, the
    state. Rule 4(e) was replaced in 1993 by Rule 4(n)(2), which
    permits use of state law to seize a defendant's assets only if
    personal jurisdiction over the defendant cannot be obtained in the
    district where the action is brought. Little purpose would be
    served by incorporating Rule 4(n)(2) in Rule B, since maritime
    attachment and garnishment are available whenever the defendant is
    not found within the district, a concept that allows attachment or
    garnishment even in some circumstances in which personal
    jurisdiction also can be asserted. In order to protect against any
    possibility that elimination of the reference to state quasi-in-rem
    jurisdiction remedies might seem to defeat continued use of state
    security devices, paragraph (e) expressly incorporates Civil Rule
    64. Because Rule 64 looks only to security, not jurisdiction, the
    former reference to Rule E(8) is deleted as no longer relevant.
      Rule B(2)(a) is amended to reflect the 1993 redistribution of the
    service provisions once found in Civil Rule 4(d) and (i). These
    provisions are now found in many different subdivisions of Rule 4.
    The new reference simply incorporates Rule 4, without designating
    the new subdivisions, because the function of Rule B(2) is simply
    to describe the methods of notice that suffice to support a default
    judgment. Style changes also have been made.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             
      Rule B(1) is amended to incorporate the decisions in Heidmar,
    Inc. v. Anomina Ravennate Di Armamento Sp.A. of Ravenna, 132 F.3d
    264, 267-268 (5th Cir. 1998), and Navieros InterAmericanos, S.A. v.
    M/V Vasilia Express, 120 F.3d 304, 314-315 (1st Cir. 1997). The
    time for determining whether a defendant is "found" in the district
    is set at the time of filing the verified complaint that prays for
    attachment and the affidavit required by Rule B(1)(b). As provided
    by Rule B(1)(b), the affidavit must be filed with the complaint. A
    defendant cannot defeat the security purpose of attachment by
    appointing an agent for service of process after the complaint and
    affidavit are filed. The complaint praying for attachment need not
    be the initial complaint. So long as the defendant is not found in
    the district, the prayer for attachment may be made in an amended
    complaint; the affidavit that the defendant cannot be found must be
    filed with the amended complaint.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes have been
    made since publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The time set in the former rule at 20 days has been revised to 21
    days. See the Note to Rule 6.

    seizure are not affected by this rule. When a statute so provides,
    an action against the United States or an instrumentality thereof
    may proceed on in rem principles.
      (2) Complaint. In an action in rem the complaint must:
        (a) be verified;
        (b) describe with reasonable particularity the property that is
      the subject of the action; and
        (c) state that the property is within the district or will be
      within the district while the action is pending.

      (3) Judicial Authorization and Process.
        (a) Arrest Warrant.
          (i) The court must review the complaint and any supporting
        papers. If the conditions for an in rem action appear to exist,
        the court must issue an order directing the clerk to issue a
        warrant for the arrest of the vessel or other property that is
        the subject of the action.
          (ii) If the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney certifies
        that exigent circumstances make court review impracticable, the
        clerk must promptly issue a summons and a warrant for the
        arrest of the vessel or other property that is the subject of
        the action. The plaintiff has the burden in any post-arrest
        hearing under Rule E(4)(f) to show that exigent circumstances
        existed.

        (b) Service.
          (i) If the property that is the subject of the action is a
        vessel or tangible property on board a vessel, the warrant and
        any supplemental process must be delivered to the marshal for
        service.
          (ii) If the property that is the subject of the action is
        other property, tangible or intangible, the warrant and any
        supplemental process must be delivered to a person or
        organization authorized to enforce it, who may be: (A) a
        marshal; (B) someone under contract with the United States; (C)
        someone specially appointed by the court for that purpose; or,
        (D) in an action brought by the United States, any officer or
        employee of the United States.

        (c) Deposit in Court. If the property that is the subject of
      the action consists in whole or in part of freight, the proceeds
      of property sold, or other intangible property, the clerk must
      issue - in addition to the warrant - a summons directing any
      person controlling the property to show cause why it should not
      be deposited in court to abide the judgment.
        (d) Supplemental Process. The clerk may upon application issue
      supplemental process to enforce the court's order without further
      court order.

      (4) Notice. No notice other than execution of process is required
    when the property that is the subject of the action has been
    released under Rule E(5). If the property is not released within 14
    days after execution, the plaintiff must promptly - or within the
    time that the court allows - give public notice of the action and
    arrest in a newspaper designated by court order and having general
    circulation in the district, but publication may be terminated if
    the property is released before publication is completed. The
    notice must specify the time under Rule C(6) to file a statement of
    interest in or right against the seized property and to answer.
    This rule does not affect the notice requirements in an action to
    foreclose a preferred ship mortgage under 46 U.S.C. Secs. 31301 et
    seq., as amended.
      (5) Ancillary Process. In any action in rem in which process has
    been served as provided by this rule, if any part of the property
    that is the subject of the action has not been brought within the
    control of the court because it has been removed or sold, or
    because it is intangible property in the hands of a person who has
    not been served with process, the court may, on motion, order any
    person having possession or control of such property or its
    proceeds to show cause why it should not be delivered into the
    custody of the marshal or other person or organization having a
    warrant for the arrest of the property, or paid into court to abide
    the judgment; and, after hearing, the court may enter such judgment
    as law and justice may require.
      (6) Responsive Pleading; Interrogatories.
        (a) Statement of Interest; Answer. In an action in rem:
          (i) a person who asserts a right of possession or any
        ownership interest in the property that is the subject of the
        action must file a verified statement of right or interest:
            (A) within 14 days after the execution of process, or
            (B) within the time that the court allows;

          (ii) the statement of right or interest must describe the
        interest in the property that supports the person's demand for
        its restitution or right to defend the action;
          (iii) an agent, bailee, or attorney must state the authority
        to file a statement of right or interest on behalf of another;
        and
          (iv) a person who asserts a right of possession or any
        ownership interest must serve an answer within 21 days after
        filing the statement of interest or right.

        (b) Interrogatories. Interrogatories may be served with the
      complaint in an in rem action without leave of court. Answers to
      the interrogatories must be served with the answer to the
      complaint.

    Subdivision (1).

      This rule is designed not only to preserve the proceeding in rem
    as it now exists in admiralty cases, but to preserve the substance
    of Admiralty Rules 13-18. The general reference to enforcement of
    any maritime lien is believed to state the existing law, and is an
    improvement over the enumeration in the former Admiralty Rules,
    which is repetitious and incomplete (e.g., there was no reference
    to general average). The reference to any maritime lien is intended
    to include liens created by state law which are enforceable in
    admiralty.
      The main concern of Admiralty Rules 13-18 was with the question
    whether certain actions might be brought in rem or also, or in the
    alternative, in personam. Essentially, therefore, these rules deal
    with questions of substantive law, for in general an action in rem
    may be brought to enforce any maritime lien, and no action in
    personam may be brought when the substantive law imposes no
    personal liability.
      These rules may be summarized as follows:
      1. Cases in which the plaintiff may proceed in rem and/or in
    personam:
        a. Suits for seamen's wages;
        b. Suits by materialmen for supplies, repairs, etc.;
        c. Suits for pilotage;
        d. Suits for collision damages;
        e. Suits founded on mere maritime hypothecation;
        f. Suits for salvage.
      2. Cases in which the plaintiff may proceed only in personam:
        a. Suits for assault and beating.
      3. Cases in which the plaintiff may proceed only in rem:
        a. Suits on bottomry bonds.
      The coverage is complete, since the rules omit mention of many
    cases in which the plaintiff may proceed in rem or in personam.
    This revision proceeds on the principle that it is preferable to
    make a general statement as to the availability of the remedies,
    leaving out conclusions on matters of substantive law. Clearly it
    is not necessary to enumerate the cases listed under Item 1, above,
    nor to try to complete the list.
      The rule eliminates the provision of Admiralty Rule 15 that
    actions for assault and beating may be brought only in personam. A
    preliminary study fails to disclose any reason for the rule. It is
    subject to so many exceptions that it is calculated to receive
    rather than to inform. A seaman may sue in rem when he has been
    beaten by a fellow member of the crew so vicious as to render the
    vessel unseaworthy. The Rolph, 293 Fed. 269, aff'd 299 Fed. 52 (9th
    Cir. 1923), or where the theory of the action is that a beating by
    the master is a breach of the obligation under the shipping
    articles to treat the seaman with proper kindness. The David Evans,
    187 Fed. 775 (D. Hawaii 1911); and a passenger may sue in rem on
    the theory that the assault is a breach of the contract of passage,
    The Western States, 159 Fed. 354 (2d Cir. 1908). To say that an
    action for money damages may be brought only in personam seems
    equivalent to saying that a maritime lien shall not exist; and
    that, in turn, seems equivalent to announcing a rule of substantive
    law rather than a rule of procedure. Dropping the rule will leave
    it to the courts to determine whether a lien exists as a matter of
    substantive law.
      The specific reference to bottomry bonds is omitted because, as a
    matter of hornbook substantive law, there is no personal liability
    on such bonds.

    Subdivision (2).

      This incorporates the substance of Admiralty Rules 21 and 22.

    Subdivision (3).

      Derived from Admiralty Rules 10 and 37. The provision that the
    warrant is to be issued by the clerk is new, but is assumed to
    state existing law.
      There is remarkably little authority bearing on Rule 37, although
    the subject would seem to be an important one. The rule appears on
    its face to have provided for a sort of ancillary process, and this
    may well be the case when tangible property, such as a vessel, is
    arrested, and intangible property such as freight is incidentally
    involved. It can easily happen, however, that the only property
    against which the action may be brought is intangible, as where the
    owner of a vessel under charter has a lien on subfreights. See 2
    Benedict Sec. 299 and cases cited. In such cases it would seem that
    the order to the person holding the fund is equivalent to original
    process, taking the place of the warrant for arrest. That being so,
    it would also seem that (1) there should be some provision for
    notice, comparable to that given when tangible property is
    arrested, and (2) it should not be necessary, as Rule 37 provided,
    to petition the court for issuance of the process, but that it
    should issue as of course. Accordingly the substance of Rule 37 is
    included in the rule covering ordinary process, and notice will be
    required by Rule C(4). Presumably the rules omit any requirement of
    notice in these cases because the holder of the funds (e.g., the
    cargo owner) would be required on general principles (cf. Harris v.
    Balk, 198 U.S. 215 (1905) to notify his obligee (e.g., the
    charterer); but in actions in rem such notice seems plainly
    inadequate because there may be adverse claims to the fund (e.g.,
    there may be liens against the subfreights for seamen's wages,
    etc.). Compare Admiralty Rule 9.

    Subdivision (4).

      This carries forward the notice provision of Admiralty Rule 10,
    with one modification. Notice by publication is too expensive and
    ineffective a formality to be routinely required. When, as usually
    happens, the vessel or other property is released on bond or
    otherwise there is no point in publishing notice; the vessel is
    freed from the claim of the plaintiff and no other interest in the
    vessel can be affected by the proceedings. If however, the vessel
    is not released, general notice is required in order that all
    persons, including unknown claimants, may appear and be heard, and
    in order that the judgment in rem shall be binding on all the
    world.

    Subdivision (5).

      This incorporates the substance of Admiralty Rule 9.
      There are remarkably few cases dealing directly with the rule. In
    The George Prescott, 10 Fed. Cas. 222 (No. 5,339) (E.D.N.Y. 1865),
    the master and crew of a vessel libeled her for wages, and other
    lienors also filed libels. One of the lienors suggested to the
    court that prior to the arrest of the vessel the master had removed
    the sails, and asked that he be ordered to produce them. He
    admitted removing the sails and selling them, justifying on the
    ground that he held a mortgage on the vessel. He was ordered to pay
    the proceeds into court. Cf. United States v. The Zarko, 187
    F.Supp. 371 (S.D.Cal. 1960), where an armature belonging to a
    vessel subject to a preferred ship mortgages was in possession of a
    repairman claiming a lien.
      It is evident that, though the rule has had a limited career in
    the reported cases, it is a potentially important one. It is also
    evident that the rule is framed in terms narrower than the
    principle that supports it. There is no apparent reason for
    limiting it to ships and their appurtenances (2 Benedict Sec. 299).
    Also, the reference to "third parties" in the existing rule seems
    unfortunate. In The George Prescott, the person who removed and
    sold the sails was a plaintiff in the action, and relief against
    him was just as necessary as if he had been a stranger.
      Another situation in which process of this kind would seem to be
    useful is that in which the principal property that is the subject
    of the action is a vessel, but her pending freight is incidentally
    involved. The warrant of arrest, and notice of its service, should
    be all that is required by way of original process and notice;
    ancillary process without notice should suffice as to the
    incidental intangibles.
      The distinction between Admiralty Rules 9 and 37 is not at once
    apparent, but seems to be this: Where the action was against
    property that could not be seized by the marshal because it is
    intangible, the original process was required to be similar to that
    issued against a garnishee, and general notice was required (though
    not provided for by the present rule; cf. Advisory Committee's Note
    to Rule C(3)). Under Admiralty Rule 9 property had been arrested
    and general notice had been given, but some of the property had
    been removed or for some other reason could not be arrested. Here
    no further notice was necessary.
      The rule also makes provision for this kind of situation: The
    proceeding is against a vessel's pending freight only; summons has
    been served on the person supposedly holding the funds, and general
    notice has been given; it develops that another person holds all or
    part of the funds. Ancillary process should be available here
    without further notice.

    Subdivision (6).

      Adherence to the practice of return days seems unsatisfactory.
    The practice varies significantly from district to district. A
    uniform rule should be provided so that any claimant or defendant
    can readily determine when he is required to file or serve a claim
    or answer.
      A virtue of the return-day practice is that it requires claimants
    to come forward and identify themselves at an early stage of the
    proceedings - before they could fairly be required to answer. The
    draft is designed to preserve this feature of the present practice
    by requiring early filing of the claim. The time schedule
    contemplated in the draft is closely comparable to the present
    practice in the Southern District of New York, where the claimant
    has a minimum of 8 days to claim and three weeks thereafter to
    answer.
      This rule also incorporates the substance of Admiralty Rule 25.
    The present rule's emphasis on "the true and bona fide owner" is
    omitted, since anyone having the right to possession can claim (2
    Benedict Sec. 324).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1985 AMENDMENT       
      Rule C(3) has been amended to provide for judicial scrutiny
    before the issuance of any warrant of arrest. Its purpose is to
    eliminate any doubt as to the rule's constitutionality under the
    Sniadach line of cases. Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., 395 U.S.
    337 (1969); Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67 (1972); Mitchell v. W.
    T. Grant Co., 416 U.S. 600 (1974); and North Georgia Finishing,
    Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., 419 U.S. 601 (1975). This was thought
    desirable even though both the Fourth and the Fifth Circuits have
    upheld the existing rule. Amstar Corp. v. S/S Alexandros T., 664
    F.2d 904 (4th Cir. 1981); Merchants National Bank of Mobile v. The
    Dredge General G. L. Gillespie, 663 F.2d 1338 (5th Cir. 1981),
    cert. dismissed, 456 U.S. 966 (1982). A contrary view was taken by
    Judge Tate in the Merchants National Bank case and by the district
    court in Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. The Vessel Bay Ridge, 509
    F. Supp. 1115 (D. Alaska 1981), appeal dismissed, 703 F.2d 381 (9th
    Cir. 1983).
      The rule envisions that the order will issue upon a prima facie
    showing that the plaintiff has an action in rem against the
    defendant in the amount sued for and that the property is within
    the district. A simple order with conclusory findings is
    contemplated. The reference to review by the "court" is broad
    enough to embrace a magistrate as well as a district judge.
      The new provision recognizes that in some situations, such as
    when a judge is unavailable and the vessel is about to depart from
    the jurisdiction, it will be impracticable, if not impossible, to
    secure the judicial review contemplated by Rule C(3). When "exigent
    circumstances" exist, the rule enables the plaintiff to secure the
    issuance of the summons and warrant of arrest, subject to a later
    showing that the necessary circumstances actually existed. This
    provision is intended to provide a safety valve without undermining
    the requirement of pre-arrest scrutiny. Thus, every effort to
    secure judicial review, including conducting a hearing by
    telephone, should be pursued before invoking the exigent-
    circumstances procedure.
      The foregoing requirements for prior court review or proof of
    exigent circumstances do not apply to actions by the United States
    for forfeitures for federal statutory violations. In such actions a
    prompt hearing is not constitutionally required, United States v.
    Eight Thousand Eight Hundred and Fifty Dollars, 103 S.Ct. 2005
    (1983); Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U.S. 663
    (1974), and could prejudice the government in its prosecution of
    the claimants as defendants in parallel criminal proceedings since
    the forfeiture hearing could be misused by the defendants to obtain
    by way of civil discovery information to which they would not
    otherwise be entitled and subject the government and the courts to
    the unnecessary burden and expense of two hearings rather than one.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      These amendments are designed to conform the rule to Fed.R.Civ.P.
    4, as amended. As with recent amendments to Rule 4, it is intended
    to relieve the Marshals Service of the burden of using its limited
    personnel and facilities for execution of process in routine
    circumstances. Doing so may involve a contractual arrangement with
    a person or organization retained by the government to perform
    these services, or the use of other government officers and
    employees, or the special appointment by the court of persons
    available to perform suitably.
      The seizure of a vessel, with or without cargo, remains a task
    assigned to the Marshal. Successful arrest of a vessel frequently
    requires the enforcement presence of an armed government official
    and the cooperation of the United States Coast Guard and other
    governmental authorities. If the marshal is called upon to seize
    the vessel, it is expected that the same officer will also be
    responsible for the seizure of any property on board the vessel at
    the time of seizure that is to be the object of arrest or
    attachment.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      Style changes have been made throughout the revised portions of
    Rule C. Several changes of meaning have been made as well.
      Subdivision 2. In rem jurisdiction originally extended only to
    property within the judicial district. Since 1986, Congress has
    enacted a number of jurisdictional and venue statutes for
    forfeiture and criminal matters that in some circumstances permit a
    court to exercise authority over property outside the district. 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 1355(b)(1) allows a forfeiture action in the district
    where an act or omission giving rise to forfeiture occurred, or in
    any other district where venue is established by Sec. 1395 or by
    any other statute. Section 1355(b)(2) allows an action to be
    brought as provided in (b)(1) or in the United States District
    Court for the District of Columbia when the forfeiture property is
    located in a foreign country or has been seized by authority of a
    foreign government. Section 1355(d) allows a court with
    jurisdiction under Sec. 1355(b) to cause service in any other
    district of process required to bring the forfeiture property
    before the court. Section 1395 establishes venue of a civil
    proceeding for forfeiture in the district where the forfeiture
    accrues or the defendant is found; in any district where the
    property is found; in any district into which the property is
    brought, if the property initially is outside any judicial
    district; or in any district where the vessel is arrested if the
    proceeding is an admiralty proceeding to forfeit a vessel. Section
    1395(e) deals with a vessel or cargo entering a port of entry
    closed by the President, and transportation to or from a state or
    section declared to be in insurrection. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 981(h)
    creates expanded jurisdiction and venue over property located
    elsewhere that is related to a criminal prosecution pending in the
    district. These amendments, and related amendments of Rule E(3),
    bring these Rules into step with the new statutes. No change is
    made as to admiralty and maritime proceedings that do not involve a
    forfeiture governed by one of the new statutes.
      Subdivision (2) has been separated into lettered paragraphs to
    facilitate understanding.
      Subdivision (3). Subdivision (3) has been rearranged and divided
    into lettered paragraphs to facilitate understanding.
      Paragraph (b)(i) is amended to make it clear that any
    supplemental process addressed to a vessel or tangible property on
    board a vessel, as well as the original warrant, is to be served by
    the marshal.
      Subdivision (4). Subdivision (4) has required that public notice
    state the time for filing an answer, but has not required that the
    notice set out the earlier time for filing a statement of interest
    or claim. The amendment requires that both times be stated.
      A new provision is added, allowing termination of publication if
    the property is released more than 10 days after execution but
    before publication is completed. Termination will save money, and
    also will reduce the risk of confusion as to the status of the
    property.
      Subdivision (6). Subdivision (6) has applied a single set of
    undifferentiated provisions to civil forfeiture proceedings and to
    in rem admiralty proceedings. Because some differences in procedure
    are desirable, these proceedings are separated by adopting a new
    paragraph (a) for civil forfeiture proceedings and recasting the
    present rule as paragraph (b) for in rem admiralty proceedings. The
    provision for interrogatories and answers is carried forward as
    paragraph (c). Although this established procedure for serving
    interrogatories with the complaint departs from the general
    provisions of Civil Rule 26(d), the special needs of expedition
    that often arise in admiralty justify continuing the practice.
      Both paragraphs (a) and (b) require a statement of interest or
    right rather than the "claim" formerly required. The new wording
    permits parallel drafting, and facilitates cross-references in
    other rules. The substantive nature of the statement remains the
    same as the former claim. The requirements of (a) and (b) are,
    however, different in some respects.
      In a forfeiture proceeding governed by paragraph (a), a statement
    must be filed by a person who asserts an interest in or a right
    against the property involved. This category includes every right
    against the property, such as a lien, whether or not it establishes
    ownership or a right to possession. In determining who has an
    interest in or a right against property, courts may continue to
    rely on precedents that have developed the meaning of "claims" or
    "claimants" for the purpose of civil forfeiture proceedings.
      In an admiralty and maritime proceeding governed by paragraph
    (b), a statement is filed only by a person claiming a right of
    possession or ownership. Other claims against the property are
    advanced by intervention under Civil Rule 24, as it may be
    supplemented by local admiralty rules. The reference to ownership
    includes every interest that qualifies as ownership under domestic
    or foreign law. If an ownership interest is asserted, it makes no
    difference whether its character is legal, equitable, or something
    else.
      Paragraph (a) provides more time than paragraph (b) for filing a
    statement. Admiralty and maritime in rem proceedings often present
    special needs for prompt action that do not commonly arise in
    forfeiture proceedings.
      Paragraphs (a) and (b) do not limit the right to make a
    restricted appearance under Rule E(8).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Rule C(3) is amended to reflect the provisions of 18 U.S.C. Sec.
    985, enacted by the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000, 114
    Stat. 202, 214-215. Section 985 provides, subject to enumerated
    exceptions, that real property that is the subject of a civil
    forfeiture action is not to be seized until an order of forfeiture
    is entered. A civil forfeiture action is initiated by filing a
    complaint, posting notice, and serving notice on the property
    owner. The summons and arrest procedure is no longer appropriate.
      Rule C(6)(a)(i)(A) is amended to adopt the provision enacted by
    18 U.S.C. Sec. 983(a)(4)(A), shortly before Rule C(6)(a)(i)(A) took
    effect, that sets the time for filing a verified statement as 30
    days rather than 20 days, and that sets the first alternative event
    for measuring the 30 days as the date of service of the
    Government's complaint.
      Rule C(6)(a)(iii) is amended to give notice of the provision
    enacted by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 983(a)(4)(B) that requires that the
    answer in a forfeiture proceeding be filed within 20 days. Without
    this notice, unwary litigants might rely on the provision of Rule
    5(d) that allows a reasonable time for filing after service.
      Rule C(6)(b)(iv) is amended to change the requirement that an
    answer be filed within 20 days to a requirement that it be served
    within 20 days. Service is the ordinary requirement, as in Rule
    12(a). Rule 5(d) requires filing within a reasonable time after
    service.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes have been
    made since publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             
      Rule C(6)(b)(i)(A) is amended to delete the reference to a time
    10 days after completed publication under Rule C(4). This change
    corrects an oversight in the amendments made in 2000. Rule C(4)
    requires publication of notice only if the property that is the
    subject of the action is not released within 10 days after
    execution of process. Execution of process will always be earlier
    than publication.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes have been
    made since publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      Rule C is amended to reflect the adoption of Rule G to govern
    procedure in civil forfeiture actions.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      Supplemental Rule C(6)(a)(i) is amended to correct an inadvertent
    omission in the 2006 amendment to Rule C. The amendment is
    technical and stylistic in nature. No substantive change is
    intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The times set in the former rule at 10 or 20 days have been
    revised to 14 or 21 days. See the Note to Rule 6.

    security for the return of the vessel from any voyage undertaken
    without their consent, or by one or more part owners against the
    others to obtain possession of the vessel for any voyage on giving
    security for its safe return, the process shall be by a warrant of

-MISC1-
                   NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES               
      This carries forward the substance of Admiralty Rule 19.
      Rule 19 provided the remedy of arrest in controversies involving
    title and possession in general. See The Tilton, 23 Fed. Cas. 1277
    (No. 14, 054) (C.C.D. Mass. 1830). In addition it provided that
    remedy in controversies between co-owners respecting the employment
    of a vessel. It did not deal comprehensively with controversies
    between co-owners, omitting the remedy of partition. Presumably the
    omission is traceable to the fact that, when the rules were
    originally promulgated, concepts of substantive law (sometimes
    stated as concepts of jurisdiction) denied the remedy of partition
    except where the parties in disagreement were the owners of equal
    shares. See The Steamboat Orleans, 36 U.S. (11 Pet.) 175 (1837).
    The Supreme Court has now removed any doubt as to the jurisdiction
    of the district courts to partition a vessel, and has held in
    addition that no fixed principle of federal admiralty law limits
    the remedy to the case of equal shares. Madruga v. Superior Court,
    346 U.S. 556 (1954). It is therefore appropriate to include a
    reference to partition in the rule.

      FORFEITURE ACTIONS1A\1\                                 

-HEAD-
    Rule E. Actions in Rem and Quasi in Rem: General Provisions

-STATUTE-
      (1) Applicability. Except as otherwise provided, this rule
    applies to actions in personam with process of maritime attachment
    and garnishment, actions in rem, and petitory, possessory, and
    partition actions, supplementing Rules B, C, and D.
      (2) Complaint; Security.
        (a) Complaint. In actions to which this rule is applicable the
      complaint shall state the circumstances from which the claim
      arises with such particularity that the defendant or claimant
      will be able, without moving for a more definite statement, to
      commence an investigation of the facts and to frame a responsive
      pleading.
        (b) Security for Costs. Subject to the provisions of Rule 54(d)
      and of relevant statutes, the court may, on the filing of the
      complaint or on the appearance of any defendant, claimant, or any
      other party, or at any later time, require the plaintiff,
      defendant, claimant, or other party to give security, or
      additional security, in such sum as the court shall direct to pay
      all costs and expenses that shall be awarded against the party by
      any interlocutory order or by the final judgment, or on appeal by
      any appellate court.

      (3) Process.
        (a) In admiralty and maritime proceedings process in rem or of
      maritime attachment and garnishment may be served only within the
      district.
        (b) Issuance and Delivery. Issuance and delivery of process in
      rem, or of maritime attachment and garnishment, shall be held in
      abeyance if the plaintiff so requests.

      (4) Execution of Process; Marshal's Return; Custody of Property;
    Procedures for Release.
        (a) In General. Upon issuance and delivery of the process, or,
      in the case of summons with process of attachment and
      garnishment, when it appears that the defendant cannot be found
      within the district, the marshal or other person or organization
      having a warrant shall forthwith execute the process in
      accordance with this subdivision (4), making due and prompt
      return.
        (b) Tangible Property. If tangible property is to be attached
      or arrested, the marshal or other person or organization having
      the warrant shall take it into the marshal's possession for safe
      custody. If the character or situation of the property is such
      that the taking of actual possession is impracticable, the
      marshal or other person executing the process shall affix a copy
      thereof to the property in a conspicuous place and leave a copy
      of the complaint and process with the person having possession or
      the person's agent. In furtherance of the marshal's custody of
      any vessel the marshal is authorized to make a written request to
      the collector of customs not to grant clearance to such vessel
      until notified by the marshal or deputy marshal or by the clerk
      that the vessel has been released in accordance with these rules.
        (c) Intangible Property. If intangible property is to be
      attached or arrested the marshal or other person or organization
      having the warrant shall execute the process by leaving with the
      garnishee or other obligor a copy of the complaint and process
      requiring the garnishee or other obligor to answer as provided in
      Rules B(3)(a) and C(6); or the marshal may accept for payment
      into the registry of the court the amount owed to the extent of
      the amount claimed by the plaintiff with interest and costs, in
      which event the garnishee or other obligor shall not be required
      to answer unless alias process shall be served.
        (d) Directions With Respect to Property in Custody. The marshal
      or other person or organization having the warrant may at any
      time apply to the court for directions with respect to property
      that has been attached or arrested, and shall give notice of such
      application to any or all of the parties as the court may direct.
        (e) Expenses of Seizing and Keeping Property; Deposit. These
      rules do not alter the provisions of Title 28, U.S.C., Sec. 1921,
      as amended, relative to the expenses of seizing and keeping
      property attached or arrested and to the requirement of deposits
      to cover such expenses.
        (f) Procedure for Release From Arrest or Attachment. Whenever
      property is arrested or attached, any person claiming an interest
      in it shall be entitled to a prompt hearing at which the
      plaintiff shall be required to show why the arrest or attachment
      should not be vacated or other relief granted consistent with
      these rules. This subdivision shall have no application to suits
      for seamen's wages when process is issued upon a certification of
      sufficient cause filed pursuant to Title 46, U.S.C. Secs. 603 and
      604 (!1) or to actions by the United States for forfeitures for
      violation of any statute of the United States.


      (5) Release of Property.
        (a) Special Bond. Whenever process of maritime attachment and
      garnishment or process in rem is issued the execution of such
      process shall be stayed, or the property released, on the giving
      of security, to be approved by the court or clerk, or by
      stipulation of the parties, conditioned to answer the judgment of
      the court or of any appellate court. The parties may stipulate
      the amount and nature of such security. In the event of the
      inability or refusal of the parties so to stipulate the court
      shall fix the principal sum of the bond or stipulation at an
      amount sufficient to cover the amount of the plaintiff's claim
      fairly stated with accrued interest and costs; but the principal
      sum shall in no event exceed (i) twice the amount of the
      plaintiff's claim or (ii) the value of the property on due
      appraisement, whichever is smaller. The bond or stipulation shall
      be conditioned for the payment of the principal sum and interest
      thereon at 6 per cent per annum.
        (b) General Bond. The owner of any vessel may file a general
      bond or stipulation, with sufficient surety, to be approved by
      the court, conditioned to answer the judgment of such court in
      all or any actions that may be brought thereafter in such court
      in which the vessel is attached or arrested. Thereupon the
      execution of all such process against such vessel shall be stayed
      so long as the amount secured by such bond or stipulation is at
      least double the aggregate amount claimed by plaintiffs in all
      actions begun and pending in which such vessel has been attached
      or arrested. Judgments and remedies may be had on such bond or
      stipulation as if a special bond or stipulation had been filed in
      each of such actions. The district court may make necessary
      orders to carry this rule into effect, particularly as to the
      giving of proper notice of any action against or attachment of a
      vessel for which a general bond has been filed. Such bond or
      stipulation shall be indorsed by the clerk with a minute of the
      actions wherein process is so stayed. Further security may be
      required by the court at any time.
        If a special bond or stipulation is given in a particular case,
      the liability on the general bond or stipulation shall cease as
      to that case.
        (c) Release by Consent or Stipulation; Order of Court or Clerk;
      Costs. Any vessel, cargo, or other property in the custody of the
      marshal or other person or organization having the warrant may be
      released forthwith upon the marshal's acceptance and approval of
      a stipulation, bond, or other security, signed by the party on
      whose behalf the property is detained or the party's attorney and
      expressly authorizing such release, if all costs and charges of
      the court and its officers shall have first been paid. Otherwise
      no property in the custody of the marshal, other person or
      organization having the warrant, or other officer of the court
      shall be released without an order of the court; but such order
      may be entered as of course by the clerk, upon the giving of
      approved security as provided by law and these rules, or upon the
      dismissal or discontinuance of the action; but the marshal or
      other person or organization having the warrant shall not deliver
      any property so released until the costs and charges of the
      officers of the court shall first have been paid.
        (d) Possessory, Petitory, and Partition Actions. The foregoing
      provisions of this subdivision (5) do not apply to petitory,
      possessory, and partition actions. In such cases the property
      arrested shall be released only by order of the court, on such
      terms and conditions and on the giving of such security as the
      court may require.

      (6) Reduction or Impairment of Security. Whenever security is
    taken the court may, on motion and hearing, for good cause shown,
    reduce the amount of security given; and if the surety shall be or
    become insufficient, new or additional sureties may be required on
    motion and hearing.
      (7) Security on Counterclaim.
        (a) When a person who has given security for damages in the
      original action asserts a counterclaim that arises from the
      transaction or occurrence that is the subject of the original
      action, a plaintiff for whose benefit the security has been given
      must give security for damages demanded in the counterclaim
      unless the court, for cause shown, directs otherwise. Proceedings
      on the original claim must be stayed until this security is
      given, unless the court directs otherwise.
        (b) The plaintiff is required to give security under Rule
      E(7)(a) when the United States or its corporate instrumentality
      counterclaims and would have been required to give security to
      respond in damages if a private party but is relieved by law from
      giving security.

      (8) Restricted Appearance. An appearance to defend against an
    admiralty and maritime claim with respect to which there has issued
    process in rem, or process of attachment and garnishment, may be
    expressly restricted to the defense of such claim, and in that
    event is not an appearance for the purposes of any other claim with
    respect to which such process is not available or has not been
    served.
      (9) Disposition of Property; Sales.
        (a) Interlocutory Sales; Delivery.
          (i) On application of a party, the marshal, or other person
        having custody of the property, the court may order all or part
        of the property sold - with the sales proceeds, or as much of
        them as will satisfy the judgment, paid into court to await
        further orders of the court - if:
            (A) the attached or arrested property is perishable, or
          liable to deterioration, decay, or injury by being detained
          in custody pending the action;
            (B) the expense of keeping the property is excessive or
          disproportionate; or
            (C) there is an unreasonable delay in securing release of
          the property.

          (ii) In the circumstances described in Rule E(9)(a)(i), the
        court, on motion by a defendant or a person filing a statement
        of interest or right under Rule C(6), may order that the
        property, rather than being sold, be delivered to the movant
        upon giving security under these rules.

        (b) Sales, Proceeds. All sales of property shall be made by the
      marshal or a deputy marshal, or by other person or organization
      having the warrant, or by any other person assigned by the court
      where the marshal or other person or organization having the
      warrant is a party in interest; and the proceeds of sale shall be
      forthwith paid into the registry of the court to be disposed of
      according to law.

      (10) Preservation of Property. When the owner or another person
    remains in possession of property attached or arrested under the
    provisions of Rule E(4)(b) that permit execution of process without
    taking actual possession, the court, on a party's motion or on its
    own, may enter any order necessary to preserve the property and to
    prevent its removal.

-MISC1-
                   NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES               

      Subdivisions (1), (2).
      Adapted from Admiralty Rule 24. The rule is based on the
    assumption that there is no more need for security for costs in
    maritime personal actions than in civil cases generally, but that
    there is reason to retain the requirement for actions in which
    property is seized. As to proceedings for limitation of liability
    see Rule F(1).

      Subdivision (3).
      The Advisory Committee has concluded for practical reasons that
    process requiring seizure of property should continue to be served
    only within the geographical limits of the district. Compare Rule
    B(1), continuing the condition that process of attachment and
    garnishment may be served only if the defendant is not found within
    the district.
      The provisions of Admiralty Rule 1 concerning the persons by whom
    process is to be served will be superseded by FRCP 4(c).

      Subdivision (4).
      This rule is intended to preserve the provisions of Admiralty
    Rules 10 and 36 relating to execution of process, custody of
    property, seized by the marshal, and the marshal's return. It is
    also designed to make express provision for matters not heretofore
    covered.
      The provision relating to clearance in subdivision (b) is
    suggested by Admiralty Rule 44 of the District of Maryland.
      Subdivision (d) is suggested by English Rule 12, Order 75.
      28 U.S.C. Sec. 1921 as amended in 1962 contains detailed
    provisions relating to the expenses of seizing and preserving
    property attached or arrested.

      Subdivision (5).
      In addition to Admiralty Rule 11 (see Rule E(9), the release of
    property seized on process of attachment or in rem was dealt with
    by Admiralty Rules 5, 6, 12, and 57, and 28 U.S.C., Sec. 2464
    (formerly Rev. Stat. Sec. 941). The rule consolidates these
    provisions and makes them uniformly applicable to attachment and
    garnishment and actions in rem.
      The rule restates the substance of Admiralty Rule 5. Admiralty
    Rule 12 dealt only with ships arrested on in rem process. Since the
    same ground appears to be covered more generally by 28 U.S.C., Sec.
    2464, the subject matter of Rule 12 is omitted. The substance of
    Admiralty Rule 57 is retained. 28 U.S.C., Sec. 2464 is incorporated
    with changes of terminology, and with a substantial change as to
    the amount of the bond. See 2 Benedict 395 n. 1a; The Lotosland, 2
    F. Supp. 42 (S.D.N.Y. 1933). The provision for general bond is
    enlarged to include the contingency of attachment as well as arrest
    of the vessel.

      Subdivision (6).
      Adapted from Admiralty Rule 8.

      Subdivision (7).
      Derived from Admiralty Rule 50.
      Title 46, U.S.C., Sec. 783 extends the principle of Rule 50 to
    the Government when sued under the Public Vessels Act, presumably
    on the theory that the credit of the Government is the equivalent
    of the best security. The rule adopts this principle and extends it
    to all cases in which the Government is defendant although the
    Suits in Admiralty Act contains no parallel provisions.

      Subdivision (8).
      Under the liberal joinder provisions of unified rules the
    plaintiff will be enabled to join with maritime actions in rem, or
    maritime actions in personam with process of attachment and
    garnishment, claims with respect to which such process is not
    available, including nonmaritime claims. Unification should not,
    however, have the result that, in order to defend against an
    admiralty and maritime claim with respect to which process in rem
    or quasi in rem has been served, the claimant or defendant must
    subject himself personally to the jurisdiction of the court with
    reference to other claims with respect to which such process is not
    available or has not been served, especially when such other claims
    are nonmaritime. So far as attachment and garnishment are concerned
    this principle holds true whether process is issued according to
    admiralty tradition and the Supplemental Rules or according to Rule
    4(e) as incorporated by Rule B(1).
      A similar problem may arise with respect to civil actions other
    than admiralty and maritime claims within the meaning of Rule 9(h).
    That is to say, in an ordinary civil action, whether maritime or
    not, there may be joined in one action claims with respect to which
    process of attachment and garnishment is available under state law
    and Rule 4(e) and claims with respect to which such process is not
    available or has not been served. The general Rules of Civil
    Procedure do not specify whether an appearance in such cases to
    defend the claim with respect to which process of attachment and
    garnishment has issued is an appearance for the purposes of the
    other claims. In that context the question has been considered best
    left to case-by-case development. Where admiralty and maritime
    claims within the meaning of Rule 9(h) are concerned, however, it
    seems important to include a specific provision to avoid an
    unfortunate and unintended effect of unification. No inferences
    whatever as to the effect of such an appearance in an ordinary
    civil action should be drawn from the specific provision here and
    the absence of such a provision in the general Rules.

      Subdivision (9).
      Adapted from Admiralty Rules 11, 12, and 40. Subdivision (a) is
    necessary because of various provisions as to disposition of
    property in forfeiture proceedings. In addition to particular
    statutes, note the provisions of 28 U.S.C., Secs. 2461-65.
      The provision of Admiralty Rule 12 relating to unreasonable delay
    was limited to ships but should have broader application. See 2
    Benedict 404. Similarly, both Rules 11 and 12 were limited to
    actions in rem, but should equally apply to attached property.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1985 AMENDMENT       
      Rule E(4)(f) makes available the type of prompt post-seizure
    hearing in proceedings under Supplemental Rules B and C that the
    Supreme Court has called for in a number of cases arising in other
    contexts. See North Georgia Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., 419
    U.S. 601 (1975); Mitchell v. W. T. Grant Co., 416 U.S. 600 (1974).
    Although post-attachment and post-arrest hearings always have been
    available on motion, an explicit statement emphasizing promptness
    and elaborating the procedure has been lacking in the Supplemental
    Rules. Rule E(4)(f) is designed to satisfy the constitutional
    requirement of due process by guaranteeing to the shipowner [sic] a
    prompt post-seizure hearing at which he can attack the complaint,
    the arrest, the security demanded, or any other alleged deficiency
    in the proceedings. The amendment also is intended to eliminate the
    previously disparate treatment under local rules of defendants
    whose property has been seized pursuant to Supplemental Rules B and
    C.
      The new Rule E(4)(f) is based on a proposal by the Maritime Law
    Association of the United States and on local admiralty rules in
    the Eastern, Northern, and Southern Districts of New York. E.D.N.Y.
    Local Rule 13; N.D.N.Y. Local Rule 13; S.D.N.Y. Local Rule 12.
    Similar provisions have been adopted by other maritime districts.
    E.g., N.D. Calif. Local Rule 603.4; W.D. La. Local Admiralty Rule
    21. Rule E(4)(f) will provide uniformity in practice and reduce
    constitutional uncertainties.
      Rule E(4)(f) is triggered by the defendant or any other person
    with an interest in the property seized. Upon an oral or written
    application similar to that used in seeking a temporary restraining
    order, see Rule 65(b), the court is required to hold a hearing as
    promptly as possible to determine whether to allow the arrest or
    attachment to stand. The plaintiff has the burden of showing why
    the seizure should not be vacated. The hearing also may determine
    the amount of security to be granted or the propriety of imposing
    counter-security to protect the defendant from an improper seizure.
      The foregoing requirements for prior court review or proof of
    exigent circumstances do not apply to actions by the United States
    for forfeitures for federal statutory violations. In such actions a
    prompt hearing is not constitutionally required, United States v.
    Eight Thousand Eight Hundred and Fifty Dollars, 103 S.Ct. 2005
    (1983); Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U.S. 663
    (1974), and could prejudice the government in its prosecution of
    the claimants as defendants in parallel criminal proceedings since
    the forfeiture hearing could be misused by the defendants to obtain
    by way of civil discovery information to which they would not
    otherwise be entitled and subject the government and the courts to
    the unnecessary burden and expense of two hearings rather than one.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      These amendments are designed to conform this rule to
    Fed.R.Civ.P. 4, as amended. They are intended to relieve the
    Marshals Service of the burden of using its limited personnel and
    facilities for execution of process in routine circumstances. Doing
    so may involve a contractual arrangement with a person or
    organization retained by the government to perform these services,
    or the use of other government officers and employees, or the
    special appointment by the court of persons available to perform
    suitably.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      Style changes have been made throughout the revised portions of
    Rule E. Several changes of meaning have been made as well.
      Subdivision (3). Subdivision (3) is amended to reflect the
    distinction drawn in Rule C(2)(c) and (d). Service in an admiralty
    or maritime proceeding still must be made within the district, as
    reflected in Rule C(2)(c), while service in forfeiture proceedings
    may be made outside the district when authorized by statute, as
    reflected in Rule C(2)(d).
      Subdivision (7). Subdivision (7)(a) is amended to make it clear
    that a plaintiff need give security to meet a counterclaim only
    when the counterclaim is asserted by a person who has given
    security to respond in damages in the original action.
      Subdivision (8). Subdivision (8) is amended to reflect the change
    in Rule B(1)(e) that deletes the former provision incorporating
    state quasi-in-rem jurisdiction. A restricted appearance is not
    appropriate when state law is invoked only for security under Civil
    Rule 64, not as a basis of quasi-in-rem jurisdiction. But if state
    law allows a special, limited, or restricted appearance as an
    incident of the remedy adopted from state law, the state practice
    applies through Rule 64 "in the manner provided by" state law.
      Subdivision (9). Subdivision 9(b)(ii) is amended to reflect the
    change in Rule C(6) that substitutes a statement of interest or
    right for a claim.
      Subdivision (10). Subdivision 10 is new. It makes clear the
    authority of the court to preserve and to prevent removal of
    attached or arrested property that remains in the possession of the
    owner or other person under Rule E(4)(b).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      Rule E is amended to reflect the adoption of Rule G to govern
    procedure in civil forfeiture actions.

    SUPPLEMENTAL RULES FOR ADMIRALTY OR MARITIME CLAIMS AND ASSET
      FORFEITURE ACTIONS1A\1\                                 

-HEAD-
    Rule F. Limitation of Liability

-STATUTE-
      (1) Time for Filing Complaint; Security. Not later than six
    months after receipt of a claim in writing, any vessel owner may
    file a complaint in the appropriate district court, as provided in
    subdivision (9) of this rule, for limitation of liability pursuant
    to statute. The owner (a) shall deposit with the court, for the
    benefit of claimants, a sum equal to the amount or value of the
    owner's interest in the vessel and pending freight, or approved
    security therefor, and in addition such sums, or approved security
    therefor, as the court may from time to time fix as necessary to
    carry out the provisions of the statutes as amended; or (b) at the
    owner's option shall transfer to a trustee to be appointed by the
    court, for the benefit of claimants, the owner's interest in the
    vessel and pending freight, together with such sums, or approved
    security therefor, as the court may from time to time fix as
    necessary to carry out the provisions of the statutes as amended.
    The plaintiff shall also give security for costs and, if the
    plaintiff elects to give security, for interest at the rate of 6
    percent per annum from the date of the security.
      (2) Complaint. The complaint shall set forth the facts on the
    basis of which the right to limit liability is asserted and all
    facts necessary to enable the court to determine the amount to
    which the owner's liability shall be limited. The complaint may
    demand exoneration from as well as limitation of liability. It
    shall state the voyage if any, on which the demands sought to be
    limited arose, with the date and place of its termination; the
    amount of all demands including all unsatisfied liens or claims of
    lien, in contract or in tort or otherwise, arising on that voyage,
    so far as known to the plaintiff, and what actions and proceedings,
    if any, are pending thereon; whether the vessel was damaged, lost,
    or abandoned, and, if so, when and where; the value of the vessel
    at the close of the voyage or, in case of wreck, the value of her
    wreckage, strippings, or proceeds, if any, and where and in whose
    possession they are; and the amount of any pending freight
    recovered or recoverable. If the plaintiff elects to transfer the
    plaintiff's interest in the vessel to a trustee, the complaint must
    further show any prior paramount liens thereon, and what voyages or
    trips, if any, she has made since the voyage or trip on which the
    claims sought to be limited arose, and any existing liens arising
    upon any such subsequent voyage or trip, with the amounts and
    causes thereof, and the names and addresses of the lienors, so far
    as known; and whether the vessel sustained any injury upon or by
    reason of such subsequent voyage or trip.
      (3) Claims Against Owner; Injunction. Upon compliance by the
    owner with the requirements of subdivision (1) of this rule all
    claims and proceedings against the owner or the owner's property
    with respect to the matter in question shall cease. On application
    of the plaintiff the court shall enjoin the further prosecution of
    any action or proceeding against the plaintiff or the plaintiff's
    property with respect to any claim subject to limitation in the
    action.
      (4) Notice to Claimants. Upon the owner's compliance with
    subdivision (1) of this rule the court shall issue a notice to all
    persons asserting claims with respect to which the complaint seeks
    limitation, admonishing them to file their respective claims with
    the clerk of the court and to serve on the attorneys for the
    plaintiff a copy thereof on or before a date to be named in the
    notice. The date so fixed shall not be less than 30 days after
    issuance of the notice. For cause shown, the court may enlarge the
    time within which claims may be filed. The notice shall be
    published in such newspaper or newspapers as the court may direct
    once a week for four successive weeks prior to the date fixed for
    the filing of claims. The plaintiff not later than the day of
    second publication shall also mail a copy of the notice to every
    person known to have made any claim against the vessel or the
    plaintiff arising out of the voyage or trip on which the claims
    sought to be limited arose. In cases involving death a copy of such
    notice shall be mailed to the decedent at the decedent's last known
    address, and also to any person who shall be known to have made any
    claim on account of such death.
      (5) Claims and Answer. Claims shall be filed and served on or
    before the date specified in the notice provided for in subdivision
    (4) of this rule. Each claim shall specify the facts upon which the
    claimant relies in support of the claim, the items thereof, and the
    dates on which the same accrued. If a claimant desires to contest
    either the right to exoneration from or the right to limitation of
    liability the claimant shall file and serve an answer to the
    complaint unless the claim has included an answer.
      (6) Information To Be Given Claimants. Within 30 days after the
    date specified in the notice for filing claims, or within such time
    as the court thereafter may allow, the plaintiff shall mail to the
    attorney for each claimant (or if the claimant has no attorney to
    the claimant) a list setting forth (a) the name of each claimant,
    (b) the name and address of the claimant's attorney (if the
    claimant is known to have one), (c) the nature of the claim, i.e.,
    whether property loss, property damage, death, personal injury
    etc., and (d) the amount thereof.
      (7) Insufficiency of Fund or Security. Any claimant may by motion
    demand that the funds deposited in court or the security given by
    the plaintiff be increased on the ground that they are less than
    the value of the plaintiff's interest in the vessel and pending
    freight. Thereupon the court shall cause due appraisement to be
    made of the value of the plaintiff's interest in the vessel and
    pending freight; and if the court finds that the deposit or
    security is either insufficient or excessive it shall order its
    increase or reduction. In like manner any claimant may demand that
    the deposit or security be increased on the ground that it is
    insufficient to carry out the provisions of the statutes relating
    to claims in respect of loss of life or bodily injury; and, after
    notice and hearing, the court may similarly order that the deposit
    or security be increased or reduced.
      (8) Objections to Claims: Distribution of Fund. Any interested
    party may question or controvert any claim without filing an
    objection thereto. Upon determination of liability the fund
    deposited or secured, or the proceeds of the vessel and pending
    freight, shall be divided pro rata, subject to all relevant
    provisions of law, among the several claimants in proportion to the
    amounts of their respective claims, duly proved, saving, however,
    to all parties any priority to which they may be legally entitled.
      (9) Venue; Transfer. The complaint shall be filed in any district
    in which the vessel has been attached or arrested to answer for any
    claim with respect to which the plaintiff seeks to limit liability;
    or, if the vessel has not been attached or arrested, then in any
    district in which the owner has been sued with respect to any such
    claim. When the vessel has not been attached or arrested to answer
    the matters aforesaid, and suit has not been commenced against the
    owner, the proceedings may be had in the district in which the
    vessel may be, but if the vessel is not within any district and no
    suit has been commenced in any district, then the complaint may be
    filed in any district. For the convenience of parties and
    witnesses, in the interest of justice, the court may transfer the
    action to any district; if venue is wrongly laid the court shall
    dismiss or, if it be in the interest of justice, transfer the
    action to any district in which it could have been brought. If the
    vessel shall have been sold, the proceeds shall represent the
    vessel for the purposes of these rules.

                   NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES               
    Subdivision (1).

      The amendments of 1936 to the Limitation Act superseded to some
    extent the provisions of Admiralty Rule 51, especially with respect
    to the time of filing the complaint and with respect to security.
    The rule here incorporates in substance the 1936 amendment of the
    Act (46 U.S.C., Sec. 185) with a slight modification to make it
    clear that the complaint may be filed at any time not later than
    six months after a claim has been lodged with the owner.

    Subdivision (2).

      Derived from Admiralty Rules 51 and 53.

    Subdivision (3).

      This is derived from the last sentence of 36 [46] U.S.C. Sec. 185
    and the last paragraph of Admiralty Rule 51.

    Subdivision (4).

      Derived from Admiralty Rule 51.

    Subdivision (5).

      Derived from Admiralty Rules 52 and 53.

    Subdivision (6).

      Derived from Admiralty Rule 52.

    Subdivision (7).

      Derived from Admiralty Rules 52 and 36 [46] U.S.C., Sec. 185.

    Subdivision (8).

      Derived from Admiralty Rule 52.

    Subdivision (9).

      Derived from Admiralty Rule 54. The provision for transfer is
    revised to conform closely to the language of 28 U.S.C. Secs.
    1404(a) and 1406(a), though it retains the existing rule's
    provision for transfer to any district for convenience. The
    revision also makes clear what has been doubted: that the court may
    transfer if venue is wrongly laid.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT

    SUPPLEMENTAL RULES FOR ADMIRALTY OR MARITIME CLAIMS AND ASSET
      FORFEITURE ACTIONS1A\1\                                 

-HEAD-
    Rule G. Forfeiture Actions in Rem

-STATUTE-
      (1) Scope. This rule governs a forfeiture action in rem arising
    from a federal statute. To the extent that this rule does not
    address an issue, Supplemental Rules C and E and the Federal Rules
    of Civil Procedure also apply.
      (2) Complaint. The complaint must:
        (a) be verified;
        (b) state the grounds for subject-matter jurisdiction, in rem
      jurisdiction over the defendant property, and venue;
        (c) describe the property with reasonable particularity;
        (d) if the property is tangible, state its location when any
      seizure occurred and - if different - its location when the
      action is filed;
        (e) identify the statute under which the forfeiture action is
      brought; and
        (f) state sufficiently detailed facts to support a reasonable
      belief that the government will be able to meet its burden of
      proof at trial.

      (3) Judicial Authorization and Process.
        (a) Real Property. If the defendant is real property, the
      government must proceed under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 985.
        (b) Other Property; Arrest Warrant. If the defendant is not
      real property:
          (i) the clerk must issue a warrant to arrest the property if
        it is in the government's possession, custody, or control;
          (ii) the court - on finding probable cause - must issue a
        warrant to arrest the property if it is not in the government's
        possession, custody, or control and is not subject to a
        judicial restraining order; and
          (iii) a warrant is not necessary if the property is subject
        to a judicial restraining order.

        (c) Execution of Process.
          (i) The warrant and any supplemental process must be
        delivered to a person or organization authorized to execute it,
        who may be: (A) a marshal or any other United States officer or
        employee; (B) someone under contract with the United States; or
        (C) someone specially appointed by the court for that purpose.
          (ii) The authorized person or organization must execute the
        warrant and any supplemental process on property in the United
        States as soon as practicable unless:
            (A) the property is in the government's possession,
          custody, or control; or
            (B) the court orders a different time when the complaint is
          under seal, the action is stayed before the warrant and
          supplemental process are executed, or the court finds other
          good cause.

          (iii) The warrant and any supplemental process may be
        executed within the district or, when authorized by statute,
        outside the district.
          (iv) If executing a warrant on property outside the United
        States is required, the warrant may be transmitted to an
        appropriate authority for serving process where the property is
        located.

      (4) Notice.
        (a) Notice by Publication.
          (i) When Publication Is Required. A judgment of forfeiture
        may be entered only if the government has published notice of
        the action within a reasonable time after filing the complaint
        or at a time the court orders. But notice need not be published
        if:
            (A) the defendant property is worth less than $1,000 and
          direct notice is sent under Rule G(4)(b) to every person the
          government can reasonably identify as a potential claimant;
          or
            (B) the court finds that the cost of publication exceeds
          the property's value and that other means of notice would
          satisfy due process.

          (ii) Content of the Notice. Unless the court orders
        otherwise, the notice must:
            (A) describe the property with reasonable particularity;
            (B) state the times under Rule G(5) to file a claim and to
          answer; and
            (C) name the government attorney to be served with the
          claim and answer.

          (iii) Frequency of Publication. Published notice must appear:
            (A) once a week for three consecutive weeks; or
            (B) only once if, before the action was filed, notice of
          nonjudicial forfeiture of the same property was published on
          an official internet government forfeiture site for at least
          30 consecutive days, or in a newspaper of general circulation
          for three consecutive weeks in a district where publication
          is authorized under Rule G(4)(a)(iv).

          (iv) Means of Publication. The government should select from
        the following options a means of publication reasonably
        calculated to notify potential claimants of the action:
            (A) if the property is in the United States, publication in
          a newspaper generally circulated in the district where the
          action is filed, where the property was seized, or where
          property that was not seized is located;
            (B) if the property is outside the United States,
          publication in a newspaper generally circulated in a district
          where the action is filed, in a newspaper generally
          circulated in the country where the property is located, or
          in legal notices published and generally circulated in the
          country where the property is located; or
            (C) instead of (A) or (B), posting a notice on an official
          internet government forfeiture site for at least 30
          consecutive days.

        (b) Notice to Known Potential Claimants.
          (i) Direct Notice Required. The government must send notice
        of the action and a copy of the complaint to any person who
        reasonably appears to be a potential claimant on the facts
        known to the government before the end of the time for filing a
        claim under Rule G(5)(a)(ii)(B).
          (ii) Content of the Notice. The notice must state:
            (A) the date when the notice is sent;
            (B) a deadline for filing a claim, at least 35 days after
          the notice is sent;
            (C) that an answer or a motion under Rule 12 must be filed
          no later than 21 days after filing the claim; and
            (D) the name of the government attorney to be served with
          the claim and answer.

          (iii) Sending Notice.
            (A) The notice must be sent by means reasonably calculated
          to reach the potential claimant.
            (B) Notice may be sent to the potential claimant or to the
          attorney representing the potential claimant with respect to
          the seizure of the property or in a related investigation,
          administrative forfeiture proceeding, or criminal case.
            (C) Notice sent to a potential claimant who is incarcerated
          must be sent to the place of incarceration.
            (D) Notice to a person arrested in connection with an
          offense giving rise to the forfeiture who is not incarcerated
          when notice is sent may be sent to the address that person
          last gave to the agency that arrested or released the person.
            (E) Notice to a person from whom the property was seized
          who is not incarcerated when notice is sent may be sent to
          the last address that person gave to the agency that seized
          the property.

          (iv) When Notice Is Sent. Notice by the following means is
        sent on the date when it is placed in the mail, delivered to a
        commercial carrier, or sent by electronic mail.
          (v) Actual Notice. A potential claimant who had actual notice
        of a forfeiture action may not oppose or seek relief from
        forfeiture because of the government's failure to send the
        required notice.

      (5) Responsive Pleadings.
        (a) Filing a Claim.
          (i) A person who asserts an interest in the defendant
        property may contest the forfeiture by filing a claim in the
        court where the action is pending. The claim must:
            (A) identify the specific property claimed;
            (B) identify the claimant and state the claimant's interest
          in the property;
            (C) be signed by the claimant under penalty of perjury; and
            (D) be served on the government attorney designated under
          Rule G(4)(a)(ii)(C) or (b)(ii)(D).

          (ii) Unless the court for good cause sets a different time,
        the claim must be filed:
            (A) by the time stated in a direct notice sent under Rule
          G(4)(b);
            (B) if notice was published but direct notice was not sent
          to the claimant or the claimant's attorney, no later than 30
          days after final publication of newspaper notice or legal
          notice under Rule G(4)(a) or no later than 60 days after the
          first day of publication on an official internet government
          forfeiture site; or
            (C) if notice was not published and direct notice was not
          sent to the claimant or the claimant's attorney:
              (1) if the property was in the government's possession,
            custody, or control when the complaint was filed, no later
            than 60 days after the filing, not counting any time when
            the complaint was under seal or when the action was stayed
            before execution of a warrant issued under Rule G(3)(b); or
              (2) if the property was not in the government's
            possession, custody, or control when the complaint was
            filed, no later than 60 days after the government complied
            with 18 U.S.C. Sec. 985(c) as to real property, or 60 days
            after process was executed on the property under Rule G(3).

          (iii) A claim filed by a person asserting an interest as a
        bailee must identify the bailor, and if filed on the bailor's
        behalf must state the authority to do so.

        (b) Answer. A claimant must serve and file an answer to the
      complaint or a motion under Rule 12 within 21 days after filing
      the claim. A claimant waives an objection to in rem jurisdiction
      or to venue if the objection is not made by motion or stated in
      the answer.

      (6) Special Interrogatories.
        (a) Time and Scope. The government may serve special
      interrogatories limited to the claimant's identity and
      relationship to the defendant property without the court's leave
      at any time after the claim is filed and before discovery is
      closed. But if the claimant serves a motion to dismiss the
      action, the government must serve the interrogatories within 21
      days after the motion is served.
        (b) Answers or Objections. Answers or objections to these
      interrogatories must be served within 21 days after the
      interrogatories are served.
        (c) Government's Response Deferred. The government need not
      respond to a claimant's motion to dismiss the action under Rule
      G(8)(b) until 21 days after the claimant has answered these
      interrogatories.

      (7) Preserving, Preventing Criminal Use, and Disposing of
    Property; Sales.
        (a) Preserving and Preventing Criminal Use of Property. When
      the government does not have actual possession of the defendant
      property the court, on motion or on its own, may enter any order
      necessary to preserve the property, to prevent its removal or
      encumbrance, or to prevent its use in a criminal offense.
        (b) Interlocutory Sale or Delivery.
          (i) Order to Sell. On motion by a party or a person having
        custody of the property, the court may order all or part of the
        property sold if:
            (A) the property is perishable or at risk of deterioration,
          decay, or injury by being detained in custody pending the
          action;
            (B) the expense of keeping the property is excessive or is
          disproportionate to its fair market value;
            (C) the property is subject to a mortgage or to taxes on
          which the owner is in default; or
            (D) the court finds other good cause.

          (ii) Who Makes the Sale. A sale must be made by a United
        States agency that has authority to sell the property, by the
        agency's contractor, or by any person the court designates.
          (iii) Sale Procedures. The sale is governed by 28 U.S.C.
        Secs. 2001, 2002, and 2004, unless all parties, with the
        court's approval, agree to the sale, aspects of the sale, or
        different procedures.
          (iv) Sale Proceeds. Sale proceeds are a substitute res
        subject to forfeiture in place of the property that was sold.
        The proceeds must be held in an interest-bearing account
        maintained by the United States pending the conclusion of the
        forfeiture action.
          (v) Delivery on a Claimant's Motion. The court may order that
        the property be delivered to the claimant pending the
        conclusion of the action if the claimant shows circumstances
        that would permit sale under Rule G(7)(b)(i) and gives security
        under these rules.

        (c) Disposing of Forfeited Property. Upon entry of a forfeiture
      judgment, the property or proceeds from selling the property must
      be disposed of as provided by law.

      (8) Motions.
        (a) Motion To Suppress Use of the Property as Evidence. If the
      defendant property was seized, a party with standing to contest
      the lawfulness of the seizure may move to suppress use of the
      property as evidence. Suppression does not affect forfeiture of
      the property based on independently derived evidence.
        (b) Motion To Dismiss the Action.
          (i) A claimant who establishes standing to contest forfeiture
        may move to dismiss the action under Rule 12(b).
          (ii) In an action governed by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 983(a)(3)(D) the
        complaint may not be dismissed on the ground that the
        government did not have adequate evidence at the time the
        complaint was filed to establish the forfeitability of the
        property. The sufficiency of the complaint is governed by Rule
        G(2).

        (c) Motion To Strike a Claim or Answer.
          (i) At any time before trial, the government may move to
        strike a claim or answer:
            (A) for failing to comply with Rule G(5) or (6), or
            (B) because the claimant lacks standing.

          (ii) The motion:
            (A) must be decided before any motion by the claimant to
          dismiss the action; and
            (B) may be presented as a motion for judgment on the
          pleadings or as a motion to determine after a hearing or by
          summary judgment whether the claimant can carry the burden of
          establishing standing by a preponderance of the evidence.

        (d) Petition To Release Property.
          (i) If a United States agency or an agency's contractor holds
        property for judicial or nonjudicial forfeiture under a statute
        governed by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 983(f), a person who has filed a
        claim to the property may petition for its release under Sec.
        983(f).
          (ii) If a petition for release is filed before a judicial
        forfeiture action is filed against the property, the petition
        may be filed either in the district where the property was
        seized or in the district where a warrant to seize the property
        issued. If a judicial forfeiture action against the property is
        later filed in another district - or if the government shows
        that the action will be filed in another district - the
        petition may be transferred to that district under 28 U.S.C.
        Sec. 1404.

        (e) Excessive Fines. A claimant may seek to mitigate a
      forfeiture under the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth
      Amendment by motion for summary judgment or by motion made after
      entry of a forfeiture judgment if:
          (i) the claimant has pleaded the defense under Rule 8; and
          (ii) the parties have had the opportunity to conduct civil
        discovery on the defense.

      (9) Trial. Trial is to the court unless any party demands trial
    by jury under Rule 38.

                      COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006                  
      Rule G is added to bring together the central procedures that
    govern civil forfeiture actions. Civil forfeiture actions are in
    rem proceedings, as are many admiralty proceedings. As the number
    of civil forfeiture actions has increased, however, reasons have
    appeared to create sharper distinctions within the framework of the
    Supplemental Rules. Civil forfeiture practice will benefit from
    distinctive provisions that express and focus developments in
    statutory, constitutional, and decisional law. Admiralty practice
    will be freed from the pressures that arise when the needs of civil
    forfeiture proceedings counsel interpretations of common rules that
    may not be suitable for admiralty proceedings.
      Rule G generally applies to actions governed by the Civil Asset
    Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 (CAFRA) and also to actions excluded
    from it. The rule refers to some specific CAFRA provisions; if
    these statutes are amended, the rule should be adapted to the new
    provisions during the period required to amend the rule.
      Rule G is not completely self-contained. Subdivision (1)
    recognizes the need to rely at times on other Supplemental Rules
    and the place of the Supplemental Rules within the basic framework
    of the Civil Rules.
      Supplemental Rules A, C, and E are amended to reflect the
    adoption of Rule G.

                              SUBDIVISION (1)                          
      Rule G is designed to include the distinctive procedures that
    govern a civil forfeiture action. Some details, however, are better
    supplied by relying on Rules C and E. Subdivision (1) incorporates
    those rules for issues not addressed by Rule G. This general
    incorporation is at times made explicit - subdivision (7)(b)(v),
    for example, invokes the security provisions of Rule E. But Rules C
    and E are not to be invoked to create conflicts with Rule G. They
    are to be used only when Rule G, fairly construed, does not address
    the issue.
      The Civil Rules continue to provide the procedural framework
    within which Rule G and the other Supplemental Rules operate. Both
    Rule G(1) and Rule A state this basic proposition. Rule G, for
    example, does not address pleadings amendments. Civil Rule 15
    applies, in light of the circumstances of a forfeiture action.

                              SUBDIVISION (2)                          
      Rule E(2)(a) requires that the complaint in an admiralty action
    "state the circumstances from which the claim arises with such
    particularity that the defendant or claimant will be able, without
    moving for a more definite statement, to commence an investigation
    of the facts and to frame a responsive pleading." Application of
    this standard to civil forfeiture actions has evolved to the
    standard stated in subdivision (2)(f). The complaint must state
    sufficiently detailed facts to support a reasonable belief that the
    government will be able to meet its burden of proof at trial. See
    U.S. v. Mondragon, 313 F.3d 862 (4th Cir. 2002). Subdivision (2)(f)
    carries this forfeiture case law forward without change.

                              SUBDIVISION (3)                          
      Subdivision (3) governs in rem process in a civil forfeiture
    action.
      Paragraph (a). Paragraph (a) reflects the provisions of 18 U.S.C.
    Sec. 985.
      Paragraph (b). Paragraph (b) addresses arrest warrants when the
    defendant is not real property. Subparagraph (i) directs the clerk
    to issue a warrant if the property is in the government's
    possession, custody, or control. If the property is not in the
    government's possession, custody, or control and is not subject to
    a restraining order, subparagraph (ii) provides that a warrant
    issues only if the court finds probable cause to arrest the
    property. This provision departs from former Rule C(3)(a)(i), which
    authorized issuance of summons and warrant by the clerk without a
    probable-cause finding. The probable-cause finding better protects
    the interests of persons interested in the property. Subparagraph
    (iii) recognizes that a warrant is not necessary if the property is
    subject to a judicial restraining order. The government remains
    free, however, to seek a warrant if it anticipates that the
    restraining order may be modified or vacated.
      Paragraph (c). Subparagraph (ii) requires that the warrant and
    any supplemental process be served as soon as practicable unless
    the property is already in the government's possession, custody, or
    control. But it authorizes the court to order a different time. The
    authority to order a different time recognizes that the government
    may have secured orders sealing the complaint in a civil forfeiture
    action or have won a stay after filing. The seal or stay may be
    ordered for reasons, such as protection of an ongoing criminal
    investigation, that would be defeated by prompt service of the
    warrant. Subparagraph (ii) does not reflect any independent ground
    for ordering a seal or stay, but merely reflects the consequences
    for execution when sealing or a stay is ordered. A court also may
    order a different time for service if good cause is shown for
    reasons unrelated to a seal or stay. Subparagraph (iv) reflects the
    uncertainty surrounding service of an arrest warrant on property
    not in the United States. It is not possible to identify in the
    rule the appropriate authority for serving process in all other
    countries. Transmission of the warrant to an appropriate authority,
    moreover, does not ensure that the warrant will be executed. The
    rule requires only that the warrant be transmitted to an
    appropriate authority.

                              SUBDIVISION (4)                          
      Paragraph (a). Paragraph (a) reflects the traditional practice of
    publishing notice of an in rem action.
      Subparagraph (i) recognizes two exceptions to the general
    publication requirement. Publication is not required if the
    defendant property is worth less than $1,000 and direct notice is
    sent to all reasonably identifiable potential claimants as required
    by subdivision (4)(b). Publication also is not required if the cost
    would exceed the property's value and the court finds that other
    means of notice would satisfy due process. Publication on a
    government-established internet forfeiture site, as contemplated by
    subparagraph (iv), would be at a low marginal publication cost,
    which would likely be the cost to compare to the property value.
      Subparagraph (iv) states the basic criterion for selecting the
    means and method of publication. The purpose is to adopt a means
    reasonably calculated to reach potential claimants. The government
    should choose from among these means a method that is reasonably
    likely to reach potential claimants at a cost reasonable in the
    circumstances.
      If the property is in the United States and newspaper notice is
    chosen, publication may be where the action is filed, where the
    property was seized, or - if the property was not seized - where
    the property is located. Choice among these places is influenced by
    the probable location of potential claimants.
      If the property is not in the United States, account must be
    taken of the sensitivities that surround publication of legal
    notices in other countries. A foreign country may forbid local
    publication. If potential claimants are likely to be in the United
    States, publication in the district where the action is filed may
    be the best choice. If potential claimants are likely to be located
    abroad, the better choice may be publication by means generally
    circulated in the country where the property is located.
      Newspaper publication is not a particularly effective means of
    notice for most potential claimants. Its traditional use is best
    defended by want of affordable alternatives. Paragraph (iv)(C)
    contemplates a government-created internet forfeiture site that
    would provide a single easily identified means of notice. Such a
    site could allow much more direct access to notice as to any
    specific property than publication provides.
      Paragraph (b). Paragraph (b) is entirely new. For the first time,
    Rule G expressly recognizes the due process obligation to send
    notice to any person who reasonably appears to be a potential
    claimant.
      Subparagraph (i) states the obligation to send notice. Many
    potential claimants will be known to the government because they
    have filed claims during the administrative forfeiture stage.
    Notice must be sent, however, no matter what source of information
    makes it reasonably appear that a person is a potential claimant.
    The duty to send notice terminates when the time for filing a claim
    expires.
      Notice of the action does not require formal service of summons
    in the manner required by Rule 4 to initiate a personal action. The
    process that begins an in rem forfeiture action is addressed by
    subdivision (3). This process commonly gives notice to potential
    claimants. Publication of notice is required in addition to this
    process. Due process requirements have moved beyond these
    traditional means of notice, but are satisfied by practical means
    that are reasonably calculated to accomplish actual notice.
      Subparagraph (ii)(B) directs that the notice state a deadline for
    filing a claim that is at least 35 days after the notice is sent.
    This provision applies both in actions that fall within 18 U.S.C.
    Sec. 983(a)(4)(A) and in other actions. Section 983(a)(4)(A) states
    that a claim should be filed no later than 30 days after service of
    the complaint. The variation introduced by subparagraph (ii)(B)
    reflects the procedure of Sec. 983(a)(2)(B) for nonjudicial
    forfeiture proceedings. The nonjudicial procedure requires that a
    claim be filed "not later than the deadline set forth in a personal
    notice letter (which may be not earlier than 35 days after the date
    the letter is sent) * * *." This procedure is as suitable in a
    civil forfeiture action as in a nonjudicial forfeiture proceeding.
    Thirty-five days after notice is sent ordinarily will extend the
    claim time by no more than a brief period; a claimant anxious to
    expedite proceedings can file the claim before the deadline; and
    the government has flexibility to set a still longer period when
    circumstances make that desirable.
      Subparagraph (iii) begins by stating the basic requirement that
    notice must be sent by means reasonably calculated to reach the
    potential claimant. No attempt is made to list the various means
    that may be reasonable in different circumstances. It may be
    reasonable, for example, to rely on means that have already been
    established for communication with a particular potential claimant.
    The government's interest in choosing a means likely to accomplish
    actual notice is bolstered by its desire to avoid post-forfeiture
    challenges based on arguments that a different method would have
    been more likely to accomplish actual notice. Flexible rule
    language accommodates the rapid evolution of communications
    technology.
      Notice may be directed to a potential claimant through counsel,
    but only to counsel already representing the claimant with respect
    to the seizure of the property, or in a related investigation,
    administrative forfeiture proceeding, or criminal case.
      Subparagraph (iii)(C) reflects the basic proposition that notice
    to a potential claimant who is incarcerated must be sent to the
    place of incarceration. Notice directed to some other place, such
    as a pre-incarceration residence, is less likely to reach the
    potential claimant. This provision does not address due process
    questions that may arise if a particular prison has deficient
    procedures for delivering notice to prisoners. See Dusenbery v.
    U.S., 534 U.S. 161 (2002).
      Items (D) and (E) of subparagraph (iii) authorize the government
    to rely on an address given by a person who is not incarcerated.
    The address may have been given to the agency that arrested or
    released the person, or to the agency that seized the property. The
    government is not obliged to undertake an independent investigation
    to verify the address.
      Subparagraph (iv) identifies the date on which notice is
    considered to be sent for some common means, without addressing the
    circumstances for choosing among the identified means or other
    means. The date of sending should be determined by analogy for
    means not listed. Facsimile transmission, for example, is sent upon
    transmission. Notice by personal delivery is sent on delivery.
      Subparagraph (v), finally, reflects the purpose to effect actual
    notice by providing that a potential claimant who had actual notice
    of a forfeiture proceeding cannot oppose or seek relief from
    forfeiture because the government failed to comply with subdivision
    (4)(b).

                              SUBDIVISION (5)                          
      Paragraph (a). Paragraph (a) establishes that the first step of
    contesting a civil forfeiture action is to file a claim. A claim is
    required by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 983(a)(4)(A) for actions covered by Sec.
    983. Paragraph (a) applies this procedure as well to actions not
    covered by Sec. 983. "Claim" is used to describe this first
    pleading because of the statutory references to claim and claimant.
    It functions in the same way as the statement of interest
    prescribed for an admiralty proceeding by Rule C(6), and is not
    related to the distinctive meaning of "claim" in admiralty
    practice.
      If the claimant states its interest in the property to be as
    bailee, the bailor must be identified. A bailee who files a claim
    on behalf of a bailor must state the bailee's authority to do so.
      The claim must be signed under penalty of perjury by the person
    making it. An artificial body that can act only through an agent
    may authorize an agent to sign for it. Excusable inability of
    counsel to obtain an appropriate signature may be grounds for an
    extension of time to file the claim.
      Paragraph (a)(ii) sets the time for filing a claim. Item (C)
    applies in the relatively rare circumstance in which notice is not
    published and the government did not send direct notice to the
    claimant because it did not know of the claimant or did not have an
    address for the claimant.
      Paragraph (b). Under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 983(a)(4)(B), which governs
    many forfeiture proceedings, a person who asserts an interest by
    filing a claim "shall file an answer to the Government's complaint
    for forfeiture not later than 20 days after the date of the filing
    of the claim." Paragraph (b) recognizes that this statute works
    within the general procedures established by Civil Rule 12. Rule
    12(a)(4) suspends the time to answer when a Rule 12 motion is
    served within the time allowed to answer. Continued application of
    this rule to proceedings governed by Sec. 983(a)(4)(B) serves all
    of the purposes advanced by Rule 12(a)(4), see U.S. v.
    $8,221,877.16, 330 F.3d 141 (3d Cir. 2003); permits a uniform
    procedure for all civil forfeiture actions; and recognizes that a
    motion under Rule 12 can be made only after a claim is filed that
    provides background for the motion.
      Failure to present an objection to in rem jurisdiction or to
    venue by timely motion or answer waives the objection. Waiver of
    such objections is familiar. An answer may be amended to assert an
    objection initially omitted. But Civil Rule 15 should be applied to
    an amendment that for the first time raises an objection to in rem
    jurisdiction by analogy to the personal jurisdiction objection
    provision in Civil Rule 12(h)(1)(B). The amendment should be
    permitted only if it is permitted as a matter of course under Rule
    15(a).
      A claimant's motion to dismiss the action is further governed by
    subdivisions (6)(c), (8)(b), and (8)(c).

                              SUBDIVISION (6)                          
      Subdivision (6) illustrates the adaptation of an admiralty
    procedure to the different needs of civil forfeiture. Rule C(6)
    permits interrogatories to be served with the complaint in an in
    rem action without limiting the subjects of inquiry. Civil
    forfeiture practice does not require such an extensive departure
    from ordinary civil practice. It remains useful, however, to permit
    the government to file limited interrogatories at any time after a
    claim is filed to gather information that bears on the claimant's
    standing. Subdivisions (8)(b) and (c) allow a claimant to move to
    dismiss only if the claimant has standing, and recognize the
    government's right to move to dismiss a claim for lack of standing.
    Subdivision (6) interrogatories are integrated with these
    provisions in that the interrogatories are limited to the
    claimant's identity and relationship to the defendant property. If
    the claimant asserts a relationship to the property as bailee, the
    interrogatories can inquire into the bailor's interest in the
    property and the bailee's relationship to the bailor. The claimant
    can accelerate the time to serve subdivision (6) interrogatories by
    serving a motion to dismiss - the interrogatories must be served
    within 20 days after the motion is served. Integration is further
    accomplished by deferring the government's obligation to respond to
    a motion to dismiss until 20 days after the claimant moving to
    dismiss has answered the interrogatories.
      Special interrogatories served under Rule G(6) do not count
    against the presumptive 25-interrogatory limit established by Rule
    33(a). Rule 33 procedure otherwise applies to these
    interrogatories.
      Subdivision (6) supersedes the discovery "moratorium" of Rule
    26(d) and the broader interrogatories permitted for admiralty
    proceedings by Rule C(6).

                              SUBDIVISION (7)                          
      Paragraph (a). Paragraph (a) is adapted from Rule E(9)(b). It
    provides for preservation orders when the government does not have
    actual possession of the defendant property. It also goes beyond
    Rule E(9) by recognizing the need to prevent use of the defendant
    property in ongoing criminal offenses.
      Paragraph (b). Paragraph (b)(i)(C) recognizes the authority,
    already exercised in some cases, to order sale of property subject
    to a defaulted mortgage or to defaulted taxes. The authority is
    narrowly confined to mortgages and tax liens; other lien interests
    may be addressed, if at all, only through the general good-cause
    provision. The court must carefully weigh the competing interests
    in each case.
      Paragraph (b)(i)(D) establishes authority to order sale for good
    cause. Good cause may be shown when the property is subject to
    diminution in value. Care should be taken before ordering sale to
    avoid diminished value.
      Paragraph (b)(iii) recognizes that if the court approves, the
    interests of all parties may be served by their agreement to sale,
    aspects of the sale, or sale procedures that depart from governing
    statutory procedures.
      Paragraph (c) draws from Rule E(9)(a), (b), and (c). Disposition
    of the proceeds as provided by law may require resolution of
    disputed issues. A mortgagee's claim to the property or sale
    proceeds, for example, may be disputed on the ground that the
    mortgage is not genuine. An undisputed lien claim, on the other
    hand, may be recognized by payment after an interlocutory sale.

                              SUBDIVISION (8)                          
      Subdivision (8) addresses a number of issues that are unique to
    civil forfeiture actions.
      Paragraph (a). Standing to suppress use of seized property as
    evidence is governed by principles distinct from the principles
    that govern claim standing. A claimant with standing to contest
    forfeiture may not have standing to seek suppression. Rule G does
    not of itself create a basis of suppression standing that does not
    otherwise exist.
      Paragraph (b). Paragraph (b)(i) is one element of the system that
    integrates the procedures for determining a claimant's standing to
    claim and for deciding a claimant's motion to dismiss the action.
    Under paragraph (c)(ii), a motion to dismiss the action cannot be
    addressed until the court has decided any government motion to
    strike the claim or answer. This procedure is reflected in the
    (b)(i) reminder that a motion to dismiss the forfeiture action may
    be made only by a claimant who establishes claim standing. The
    government, moreover, need not respond to a claimant's motion to
    dismiss until 20 days after the claimant has answered any
    subdivision (6) interrogatories.
      Paragraph (b)(ii) mirrors 18 U.S.C. Sec. 983(a)(3)(D). It applies
    only to an action independently governed by Sec. 983(a)(3)(D),
    implying nothing as to actions outside Sec. 983(a)(3)(D). The
    adequacy of the complaint is measured against the pleading
    requirements of subdivision (2), not against the quality of the
    evidence available to the government when the complaint was filed.
      Paragraph (c). As noted with paragraph (b), paragraph (c) governs
    the procedure for determining whether a claimant has standing. It
    does not address the principles that govern claim standing.
      Paragraph (c)(i)(A) provides that the government may move to
    strike a claim or answer for failure to comply with the pleading
    requirements of subdivision (5) or to answer subdivision (6)
    interrogatories. As with other pleadings, the court should strike a
    claim or answer only if satisfied that an opportunity should not be
    afforded to cure the defects under Rule 15. Not every failure to
    respond to subdivision (6) interrogatories warrants an order
    striking the claim. But the special role that subdivision (6) plays
    in the scheme for determining claim standing may justify a somewhat
    more demanding approach than the general approach to discovery
    sanctions under Rule 37.
      Paragraph (c)(ii) directs that a motion to strike a claim or
    answer be decided before any motion by the claimant to dismiss the
    action. A claimant who lacks standing is not entitled to challenge
    the forfeiture on the merits.
      Paragraph (c)(ii) further identifies three procedures for
    addressing claim standing. If a claim fails on its face to show
    facts that support claim standing, the claim can be dismissed by
    judgment on the pleadings. If the claim shows facts that would
    support claim standing, those facts can be tested by a motion for
    summary judgment. If material facts are disputed, precluding a
    grant of summary judgment, the court may hold an evidentiary
    hearing. The evidentiary hearing is held by the court without a
    jury. The claimant has the burden to establish claim standing at a
    hearing; procedure on a government summary judgment motion reflects
    this allocation of the burden.
      Paragraph (d). The hardship release provisions of 18 U.S.C. Sec.
    983(f) do not apply to a civil forfeiture action exempted from Sec.
    983 by Sec. 983(i).
      Paragraph (d)(ii) reflects the venue provisions of 18 U.S.C. Sec.
    983(f)(3)(A) as a guide to practitioners. In addition, it makes
    clear the status of a civil forfeiture action as a "civil action"
    eligible for transfer under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1404. A transfer
    decision must be made on the circumstances of the particular
    proceeding. The district where the forfeiture action is filed has
    the advantage of bringing all related proceedings together,
    avoiding the waste that flows from consideration of different parts
    of the same forfeiture proceeding in the court where the warrant
    issued or the court where the property was seized. Transfer to that
    court would serve consolidation, the purpose that underlies
    nationwide enforcement of a seizure warrant. But there may be
    offsetting advantages in retaining the petition where it was filed.
    The claimant may not be able to litigate, effectively or at all, in
    a distant court. Issues relevant to the petition may be better
    litigated where the property was seized or where the warrant
    issued. One element, for example, is whether the claimant has
    sufficient ties to the community to provide assurance that the
    property will be available at the time of trial. Another is whether
    continued government possession would prevent the claimant from
    working. Determining whether seizure of the claimant's automobile
    prevents work may turn on assessing the realities of local public
    transit facilities.
      Paragraph (e). The Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment
    forbids an excessive forfeiture. U.S. v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321
    (1998). 18 U.S.C. Sec. 983(g) provides a "petition" "to determine
    whether the forfeiture was constitutionally excessive" based on
    finding "that the forfeiture is grossly disproportional to the
    offense." Paragraph (e) describes the procedure for Sec. 983(g)
    mitigation petitions and adopts the same procedure for forfeiture
    actions that fall outside Sec. 983(g). The procedure is by motion,
    either for summary judgment or for mitigation after a forfeiture
    judgment is entered. The claimant must give notice of this defense
    by pleading, but failure to raise the defense in the initial answer
    may be cured by amendment under Rule 15. The issues that bear on
    mitigation often are separate from the issues that determine
    forfeiture. For that reason it may be convenient to resolve the
    issue by summary judgment before trial on the forfeiture issues.
    Often, however, it will be more convenient to determine first
    whether the property is to be forfeited. Whichever time is chosen
    to address mitigation, the parties must have had the opportunity to
    conduct civil discovery on the defense. The extent and timing of
    discovery are governed by the ordinary rules.

                              SUBDIVISION (9)                          
      Subdivision (9) serves as a reminder of the need to demand jury
    trial under Rule 38. It does not expand the right to jury trial.
    See U.S. v. One Parcel of Property Located at 32 Medley Lane, 2005
    WL 465241 (D.Conn. 2005), ruling that the court, not the jury,
    determines whether a forfeiture is constitutionally excessive.

      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Rule G(6)(a) was
    amended to delete the provision that special interrogatories
    addressed to a claimant's standing are "under Rule 33." The
    government was concerned that some forfeitures raise factually
    complex standing issues that require many interrogatories, severely
    depleting the presumptive 25-interrogatory limit in Rule 33. The
    Committee Note is amended to state that the interrogatories do not
    count against the limit, but that Rule 33 governs the procedure.
      Rule G(7)(a) was amended to recognize the court's authority to
    enter an order necessary to prevent use of the defendant property
    in a criminal offense.
      Rule G(8)(c) was revised to clarify the use of three procedures
    to challenge a claimant's standing - judgment on the pleadings,
    summary judgment, or an evidentiary hearing.
      Several other rule text changes were made to add clarity on small
    points or to conform to Style conventions.
      Changes were made in the Committee Note to explain some of the
    rule text revisions, to add clarity on a few points, and to delete
    statements about complex matters that seemed better left to case-
    law development.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The times set in the former rule at 20 days have been revised to
    21 days. See the Note to Rule 6.

      Pub. L. 93-595, Sec. 1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1926, provided:
    "That the following rules shall take effect on the one hundred and
    eightieth day [July 1, 1975] beginning after the date of the
    enactment of this Act [Jan. 2, 1975]. These rules apply to actions,

                              HISTORICAL NOTE                          
      The Federal Rules of Evidence were adopted by order of the
    Supreme Court on Nov. 20, 1972, transmitted to Congress by the
    Chief Justice on Feb. 5, 1973, and to have become effective on July
    1, 1973. Pub. L. 93-12, Mar. 30, 1973, 87 Stat. 9, provided that
    the proposed rules "shall have no force or effect except to the
    extent, and with such amendments, as they may be expressly approved
    by Act of Congress". Pub. L. 93-595, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1926,
    enacted the Federal Rules of Evidence proposed by the Supreme
    Court, with amendments made by Congress, to take effect on July 1,
    1975.

    FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE
    ARTICLE I. GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 103. Rulings on Evidence

-STATUTE-
      (a) Effect of Erroneous Ruling. Error may not be predicated upon
    a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial
    right of the party is affected, and
        (1) Objection. In case the ruling is one admitting evidence, a
      timely objection or motion to strike appears of record, stating
      the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not
      apparent from the context; or
        (2) Offer of Proof. In case the ruling is one excluding
      evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known to the
      court by offer or was apparent from the context within which
      questions were asked.

    Once the court makes a definitive ruling on the record admitting or
    excluding evidence, either at or before trial, a party need not
    renew an objection or offer of proof to preserve a claim of error
    for appeal.
      (b) Record of Offer and Ruling. The court may add any other or
    further statement which shows the character of the evidence, the
    form in which it was offered, the objection made, and the ruling
    thereon. It may direct the making of an offer in question and
    answer form.
      (c) Hearing of Jury. In jury cases, proceedings shall be
    conducted, to the extent practicable, so as to prevent inadmissible
    evidence from being suggested to the jury by any means, such as
    making statements or offers of proof or asking questions in the
    hearing of the jury.
      (d) Plain Error. Nothing in this rule precludes taking notice of
    plain errors affecting substantial rights although they were not
    brought to the attention of the court.

-MISC1-
               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      Subdivision (a) states the law as generally accepted today.
    Rulings on evidence cannot be assigned as error unless (1) a
    substantial right is affected, and (2) the nature of the error was
    called to the attention of the judge, so as to alert him to the
    proper course of action and enable opposing counsel to take proper
    corrective measures. The objection and the offer of proof are the
    techniques for accomplishing these objectives. For similar
    provisions see Uniform Rules 4 and 5; California Evidence Code
    Secs. 353 and 354; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure Secs. 60-404 and
    60-405. The rule does not purport to change the law with respect to
    harmless error. See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2111, F.R.Civ.P. 61, F.R.Crim.P.
    52, and decisions construing them. The status of constitutional
    error as harmless or not is treated in Chapman v. California, 386
    U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), reh. denied id. 987,
    87 S.Ct. 1283, 18 L.Ed.2d 241.
      Subdivision (b). The first sentence is the third sentence of Rule
    43(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure virtually verbatim.
    Its purpose is to reproduce for an appellate court, insofar as
    possible, a true reflection of what occurred in the trial court.
    The second sentence is in part derived from the final sentence of
    Rule 43(c). It is designed to resolve doubts as to what testimony
    the witness would have in fact given, and, in nonjury cases, to
    provide the appellate court with material for a possible final
    disposition of the case in the event of reversal of a ruling which
    excluded evidence. See 5 Moore's Federal Practice Sec. 43.11 (2d
    ed. 1968). Application is made discretionary in view of the
    practical impossibility of formulating a satisfactory rule in
    mandatory terms.
      Subdivision (c). This subdivision proceeds on the supposition
    that a ruling which excludes evidence in a jury case is likely to
    be a pointless procedure if the excluded evidence nevertheless
    comes to the attention of the jury. Bruton v. United States, 389
    U.S. 818, 88 S.Ct. 126, L.Ed.2d 70 (1968). Rule 43(c) of the
    Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides: "The court may require
    the offer to be made out of the hearing of the jury." In re
    McConnell, 370 U.S. 230, 82 S.Ct. 1288, 8 L.Ed.2d 434 (1962), left
    some doubt whether questions on which an offer is based must first
    be asked in the presence of the jury. The subdivision answers in
    the negative. The judge can foreclose a particular line of
    testimony and counsel can protect his record without a series of
    questions before the jury, designed at best to waste time and at
    worst "to waft into the jury box" the very matter sought to be
    excluded.
      Subdivision (d). This wording of the plain error principle is
    from Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. While
    judicial unwillingness to be constructed by mechanical breakdowns
    of the adversary system has been more pronounced in criminal cases,
    there is no scarcity of decisions to the same effect in civil
    cases. In general, see Campbell, Extent to Which Courts of Review
    Will Consider Questions Not Properly Raised and Preserved, 7
    Wis.L.Rev. 91, 160 (1932); Vestal, Sua Sponte Consideration in
    Appellate Review, 27 Fordham L.Rev. 477 (1958-59); 64 Harv.L.Rev.
    652 (1951). In the nature of things the application of the plain
    error rule will be more likely with respect to the admission of
    evidence than to exclusion, since failure to comply with normal
    requirements of offers of proof is likely to produce a record which
    simply does not disclose the error.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      The amendment applies to all rulings on evidence whether they
    occur at or before trial, including so-called "in limine" rulings.
    One of the most difficult questions arising from in limine and
    other evidentiary rulings is whether a losing party must renew an
    objection or offer of proof when the evidence is or would be
    offered at trial, in order to preserve a claim of error on appeal.
    Courts have taken differing approaches to this question. Some
    courts have held that a renewal at the time the evidence is to be
    offered at trial is always required. See, e.g., Collins v. Wayne
    Corp., 621 F.2d 777 (5th Cir. 1980). Some courts have taken a more
    flexible approach, holding that renewal is not required if the
    issue decided is one that (1) was fairly presented to the trial
    court for an initial ruling, (2) may be decided as a final matter
    before the evidence is actually offered, and (3) was ruled on
    definitively by the trial judge. See, e.g., Rosenfeld v. Basquiat,
    78 F.3d 84 (2d Cir. 1996) (admissibility of former testimony under
    the Dead Man's Statute; renewal not required). Other courts have
    distinguished between objections to evidence, which must be renewed
    when evidence is offered, and offers of proof, which need not be
    renewed after a definitive determination is made that the evidence
    is inadmissible. See, e.g., Fusco v. General Motors Corp., 11 F.3d
    259 (1st Cir. 1993). Another court, aware of this Committee's
    proposed amendment, has adopted its approach. Wilson v. Williams,
    182 F.3d 562 (7th Cir. 1999) (en banc). Differing views on this
    question create uncertainty for litigants and unnecessary work for
    the appellate courts.
      The amendment provides that a claim of error with respect to a
    definitive ruling is preserved for review when the party has
    otherwise satisfied the objection or offer of proof requirements of
    Rule 103(a). When the ruling is definitive, a renewed objection or
    offer of proof at the time the evidence is to be offered is more a
    formalism than a necessity. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 46 (formal exceptions
    unnecessary); Fed.R.Cr.P.51 (same); United States v. Mejia-Alarcon,
    995 F.2d 982, 986 (10th Cir. 1993) ("Requiring a party to review an
    objection when the district court has issued a definitive ruling on
    a matter that can be fairly decided before trial would be in the
    nature of a formal exception and therefore unnecessary."). On the
    other hand, when the trial court appears to have reserved its
    ruling or to have indicated that the ruling is provisional, it
    makes sense to require the party to bring the issue to the court's
    attention subsequently. See, e.g., United States v. Vest, 116 F.3d
    1179, 1188 (7th Cir. 1997) (where the trial court ruled in limine
    that testimony from defense witnesses could not be admitted, but
    allowed the defendant to seek leave at trial to call the witnesses
    should their testimony turn out to be relevant, the defendant's
    failure to seek such leave at trial meant that it was "too late to
    reopen the issue now on appeal"); United States v. Valenti, 60 F.3d
    941 (2d Cir. 1995) (failure to proffer evidence at trial waives any
    claim of error where the trial judge had stated that he would
    reserve judgment on the in limine motion until he had heard the
    trial evidence).
      The amendment imposes the obligation on counsel to clarify
    whether an in limine or other evidentiary ruling is definitive when
    there is doubt on that point. See, e.g., Walden v. Georgia-Pacific
    Corp., 126 F.3d 506, 520 (3d Cir. 1997) (although "the district
    court told plaintiffs' counsel not to reargue every ruling, it did
    not countermand its clear opening statement that all of its rulings
    were tentative, and counsel never requested clarification, as he
    might have done.").
      Even where the court's ruling is definitive, nothing in the
    amendment prohibits the court from revisiting its decision when the
    evidence is to be offered. If the court changes its initial ruling,
    or if the opposing party violates the terms of the initial ruling,
    objection must be made when the evidence is offered to preserve the
    claim of error for appeal. The error, if any, in such a situation
    occurs only when the evidence is offered and admitted. United
    States Aviation Underwriters, Inc. v. Olympia Wings, Inc., 896 F.2d
    949, 956 (5th Cir. 1990) ("objection is required to preserve error
    when an opponent, or the court itself, violates a motion in limine
    that was granted"); United States v. Roenigk, 810 F.2d 809 (8th
    Cir. 1987) (claim of error was not preserved where the defendant
    failed to object at trial to secure the benefit of a favorable
    advance ruling).
      A definitive advance ruling is reviewed in light of the facts and
    circumstances before the trial court at the time of the ruling. If
    the relevant facts and circumstances change materially after the
    advance ruling has been made, those facts and circumstances cannot
    be relied upon on appeal unless they have been brought to the
    attention of the trial court by way of a renewed, and timely,
    objection, offer of proof, or motion to strike. See Old Chief v.
    United States, 519 U.S. 172, 182, n.6 (1997) ("It is important that
    a reviewing court evaluate the trial court's decision from its
    perspective when it had to rule and not indulge in review by
    hindsight."). Similarly, if the court decides in an advance ruling
    that proffered evidence is admissible subject to the eventual
    introduction by the proponent of a foundation for the evidence, and
    that foundation is never provided, the opponent cannot claim error
    based on the failure to establish the foundation unless the
    opponent calls that failure to the court's attention by a timely
    motion to strike or other suitable motion. See Huddleston v. United
    States, 485 U.S. 681, 690, n.7 (1988) ("It is, of course, not the
    responsibility of the judge sua sponte to ensure that the
    foundation evidence is offered; the objector must move to strike
    the evidence if at the close of the trial the offeror has failed to
    satisfy the condition.").
      Nothing in the amendment is intended to affect the provisions of
    Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a) or 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(1) pertaining to
    nondispositive pretrial rulings by magistrate judges in proceedings
    that are not before a magistrate judge by consent of the parties.
    Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a) provides that a party who fails to file a
    written objection to a magistrate judge's nondispositive order
    within ten days of receiving a copy "may not thereafter assign as
    error a defect" in the order. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(1) provides
    that any party "may serve and file written objections to such
    proposed findings and recommendations as provided by rules of
    court" within ten days of receiving a copy of the order. Several
    courts have held that a party must comply with this statutory
    provision in order to preserve a claim of error. See, e.g., Wells
    v. Shriners Hospital, 109 F.3d 198, 200 (4th Cir. 1997) ("[i]n this
    circuit, as in others, a party 'may' file objections within ten
    days or he may not, as he chooses, but he 'shall' do so if he
    wishes further consideration."). When Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a) or 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(1) is operative, its requirement must be
    satisfied in order for a party to preserve a claim of error on
    appeal, even where Evidence Rule 103(a) would not require a
    subsequent objection or offer of proof.
      Nothing in the amendment is intended to affect the rule set forth
    in Luce v. United States, 469 U.S. 38 (1984), and its progeny. The
    amendment provides that an objection or offer of proof need not be
    renewed to preserve a claim of error with respect to a definitive
    pretrial ruling. Luce answers affirmatively a separate question:
    whether a criminal defendant must testify at trial in order to
    preserve a claim of error predicated upon a trial court's decision
    to admit the defendant's prior convictions for impeachment. The
    Luce principle has been extended by many lower courts to other
    situations. See United States v. DiMatteo, 759 F.2d 831 (11th Cir.
    1985) (applying Luce where the defendant's witness would be
    impeached with evidence offered under Rule 608). See also United
    States v. Goldman, 41 F.3d 785, 788 (1st Cir. 1994) ("Although Luce
    involved impeachment by conviction under Rule 609, the reasons
    given by the Supreme Court for requiring the defendant to testify
    apply with full force to the kind of Rule 403 and 404 objections
    that are advanced by Goldman in this case."); Palmieri v. DeFaria,
    88 F.3d 136 (2d Cir. 1996) (where the plaintiff decided to take an
    adverse judgment rather than challenge an advance ruling by putting
    on evidence at trial, the in limine ruling would not be reviewed on
    appeal); United States v. Ortiz, 857 F.2d 900 (2d Cir. 1988) (where
    uncharged misconduct is ruled admissible if the defendant pursues a
    certain defense, the defendant must actually pursue that defense at
    trial in order to preserve a claim of error on appeal); United
    States v. Bond, 87 F.3d 695 (5th Cir. 1996) (where the trial court
    rules in limine that the defendant would waive his fifth amendment
    privilege were he to testify, the defendant must take the stand and
    testify in order to challenge that ruling on appeal).
      The amendment does not purport to answer whether a party who
    objects to evidence that the court finds admissible in a definitive
    ruling, and who then offers the evidence to "remove the sting" of
    its anticipated prejudicial effect, thereby waives the right to
    appeal the trial court's ruling. See, e.g., United States v.
    Fisher, 106 F.3d 622 (5th Cir. 1997) (where the trial judge ruled
    in limine that the government could use a prior conviction to
    impeach the defendant if he testified, the defendant did not waive
    his right to appeal by introducing the conviction on direct
    examination); Judd v. Rodman, 105 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir. 1997) (an
    objection made in limine is sufficient to preserve a claim of error
    when the movant, as a matter of trial strategy, presents the
    objectionable evidence herself on direct examination to minimize
    its prejudicial effect); Gill v. Thomas, 83 F.3d 537, 540 (1st Cir.
    1996) ("by offering the misdemeanor evidence himself, Gill waived
    his opportunity to object and thus did not preserve the issue for
    appeal"); United States v. Williams, 939 F.2d 721 (9th Cir. 1991)
    (objection to impeachment evidence was waived where the defendant
    was impeached on direct examination).
      GAP Report - Proposed Amendment to Rule 103(a). The Committee
    made the following changes to the published draft of the proposed
    amendment to Evidence Rule 103(a):
      1. A minor stylistic change was made in the text, in accordance
    with the suggestion of the Style Subcommittee of the Standing
    Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.
      2. The second sentence of the amended portion of the published
    draft was deleted, and the Committee Note was amended to reflect
    the fact that nothing in the amendment is intended to affect the
    rule of Luce v. United States.
      3. The Committee Note was updated to include cases decided after
    the proposed amendment was issued for public comment.
      4. The Committee Note was amended to include a reference to a
    Civil Rule and a statute requiring objections to certain Magistrate
    Judge rulings to be made to the District Court.
      5. The Committee Note was revised to clarify that an advance
    ruling does not encompass subsequent developments at trial that
    might be the subject of an appeal.

    ARTICLE I. GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 104. Preliminary Questions

-STATUTE-
      (a) Questions of Admissibility Generally. Preliminary questions
    concerning the qualification of a person to be a witness, the
    existence of a privilege, or the admissibility of evidence shall be
    determined by the court, subject to the provisions of subdivision
    (b). In making its determination it is not bound by the rules of
    evidence except those with respect to privileges.
      (b) Relevancy Conditioned on Fact. When the relevancy of evidence
    depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the court
    shall admit it upon, or subject to, the introduction of evidence
    sufficient to support a finding of the fulfillment of the
    condition.
      (c) Hearing of Jury. Hearings on the admissibility of confessions
    shall in all cases be conducted out of the hearing of the jury.
    Hearings on other preliminary matters shall be so conducted when
    the interests of justice require, or when an accused is a witness
    and so requests.
      (d) Testimony by Accused. The accused does not, by testifying
    upon a preliminary matter, become subject to cross-examination as
    to other issues in the case.
      (e) Weight and Credibility. This rule does not limit the right of
    a party to introduce before the jury evidence relevant to weight or
    credibility.

-MISC1-
             NOTES OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES         
      Subdivision (a). The applicability of a particular rule of
    evidence often depends upon the existence of a condition. Is the
    alleged expert a qualified physician? Is a witness whose former
    testimony is offered unavailable? Was a stranger present during a
    conversation between attorney and client? In each instance the
    admissibility of evidence will turn upon the answer to the question
    of the existence of the condition. Accepted practice, incorporated
    in the rule, places on the judge the responsibility for these
    determinations. McCormick Sec. 53; Morgan, Basic Problems of
    Evidence 45-50 (1962).
      To the extent that these inquiries are factual, the judge acts as
    a trier of fact. Often, however, rulings on evidence call for an
    evaluation in terms of a legally set standard. Thus when a hearsay
    statement is offered as a declaration against interest, a decision
    must be made whether it possesses the required against-interest
    characteristics. These decisions, too, are made by the judge.
      In view of these considerations, this subdivision refers to
    preliminary requirements generally by the broad term "questions,"
    without attempt at specification.
      This subdivision is of general application. It must, however, be
    read as subject to the special provisions for "conditional
    relevancy" in subdivision (b) and those for confessions in
    subdivision (d).
      If the question is factual in nature, the judge will of necessity
    receive evidence pro and con on the issue. The rule provides that
    the rules of evidence in general do not apply to this process.
    McCormick Sec. 53, p. 123, n. 8, points out that the authorities
    are "scattered and inconclusive," and observes:
      "Should the exclusionary law of evidence, 'the child of the jury
    system' in Thayer's phrase, be applied to this hearing before the
    judge? Sound sense backs the view that it should not, and that the
    judge should be empowered to hear any relevant evidence, such as
    affidavits or other reliable hearsay."
    This view is reinforced by practical necessity in certain
    situations. An item, offered and objected to, may itself be
    considered in ruling on admissibility, though not yet admitted in
    evidence. Thus the content of an asserted declaration against
    interest must be considered in ruling whether it is against
    interest. Again, common practice calls for considering the
    testimony of a witness, particularly a child, in determining
    competency. Another example is the requirement of Rule 602 dealing
    with personal knowledge. In the case of hearsay, it is enough, if
    the declarant "so far as appears [has] had an opportunity to
    observe the fact declared." McCormick, Sec. 10, p. 19.
      If concern is felt over the use of affidavits by the judge in
    preliminary hearings on admissibility, attention is directed to the
    many important judicial determinations made on the basis of
    affidavits. Rule 47 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
    provides:
      "An application to the court for an order shall be by motion * *
    * It may be supported by affidavit."
    The Rules of Civil Procedure are more detailed. Rule 43(e), dealing
    with motions generally, provides:
      "When a motion is based on facts not appearing of record the
    court may hear the matter on affidavits presented by the respective
    parties, but the court may direct that the matter be heard wholly
    or partly on oral testimony or depositions."
    Rule 4(g) provides for proof of service by affidavit. Rule 56
    provides in detail for the entry of summary judgment based on
    affidavits. Affidavits may supply the foundation for temporary
    restraining orders under Rule 65(b).
      The study made for the California Law Revision Commission
    recommended an amendment to Uniform Rule 2 as follows:
      "In the determination of the issue aforesaid [preliminary
    determination], exclusionary rules shall not apply, subject,
    however, to Rule 45 and any valid claim of privilege." Tentative
    Recommendation and a Study Relating to the Uniform Rules of
    Evidence (Article VIII, Hearsay), Cal. Law Revision Comm'n, Rep.,
    Rec. & Studies, 470 (1962). The proposal was not adopted in the
    California Evidence Code. The Uniform Rules are likewise silent on
    the subject. However, New Jersey Evidence Rule 8(1), dealing with
    preliminary inquiry by the judge, provides:
      "In his determination the rules of evidence shall not apply
    except for Rule 4 [exclusion on grounds of confusion, etc.] or a
    valid claim of privilege."
      Subdivision (b). In some situations, the relevancy of an item of
    evidence, in the large sense, depends upon the existence of a
    particular preliminary fact. Thus when a spoken statement is relied
    upon to prove notice to X, it is without probative value unless X
    heard it. Or if a letter purporting to be from Y is relied upon to
    establish an admission by him, it has no probative value unless Y
    wrote or authorized it. Relevance in this sense has been labelled
    "conditional relevancy." Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 45-46
    (1962). Problems arising in connection with it are to be
    distinguished from problems of logical relevancy, e.g. evidence in
    a murder case that accused on the day before purchased a weapon of
    the kind used in the killing, treated in Rule 401.
      If preliminary questions of conditional relevancy were determined
    solely by the judge, as provided in subdivision (a), the
    functioning of the jury as a trier of fact would be greatly
    restricted and in some cases virtually destroyed. These are
    appropriate questions for juries. Accepted treatment, as provided
    in the rule, is consistent with that given fact questions
    generally. The judge makes a preliminary determination whether the
    foundation evidence is sufficient to support a finding of
    fulfillment of the condition. If so, the item is admitted. If after
    all the evidence on the issue is in, pro and con, the jury could
    reasonably conclude that fulfillment of the condition is not
    established, the issue is for them. If the evidence is not such as
    to allow a finding, the judge withdraws the matter from their
    consideration. Morgan, supra; California Evidence Code Sec. 403;
    New Jersey Rule 8(2). See also Uniform Rules 19 and 67.
      The order of proof here, as generally, is subject to the control
    of the judge.
      Subdivision (c). Preliminary hearings on the admissibility of
    confessions must be conducted outside the hearing of the jury. See
    Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908
    (1964). Otherwise, detailed treatment of when preliminary matters
    should be heard outside the hearing of the jury is not feasible.
    The procedure is time consuming. Not infrequently the same evidence
    which is relevant to the issue of establishment of fulfillment of a
    condition precedent to admissibility is also relevant to weight or
    credibility, and time is saved by taking foundation proof in the
    presence of the jury. Much evidence on preliminary questions,
    though not relevant to jury issues, may be heard by the jury with
    no adverse effect. A great deal must be left to the discretion of
    the judge who will act as the interests of justice require.
      Subdivision (d). The limitation upon cross-examination is
    designed to encourage participation by the accused in the
    determination of preliminary matters. He may testify concerning
    them without exposing himself to cross-examination generally. The
    provision is necessary because of the breadth of cross-examination
    under Rule 611(b).
      The rule does not address itself to questions of the subsequent
    use of testimony given by an accused at a hearing on a preliminary
    matter. See Walder v. United States, 347 U.S. 62 (1954): Simmons v.
    United States, 390 U.S. 377 (1968): Harris v. New York, 401 U.S.
    222 (1971)
      Subdivision (e). For similar provisions see Uniform Rule 8;
    California Evidence Code Sec. 406; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure
    Sec. 60-408; New Jersey Evidence Rule 8(1).

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      Rule 104(c) as submitted to the Congress provided that hearings
    on the admissibility of confessions shall be conducted outside the
    presence of the jury and hearings on all other preliminary matters
    should be so conducted when the interests of justice require. The
    Committee amended the Rule to provide that where an accused is a
    witness as to a preliminary matter, he has the right, upon his
    request, to be heard outside the jury's presence. Although
    recognizing that in some cases duplication of evidence would occur
    and that the procedure could be subject to abuse, the Committee
    believed that a proper regard for the right of an accused not to
    testify generally in the case dictates that he be given an option
    to testify out of the presence of the jury on preliminary matters.
      The Committee construes the second sentence of subdivision (c) as
    applying to civil actions and proceedings as well as to criminal
    cases, and on this assumption has left the sentence unamended.

      NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, SENATE REPORT NO. 93-1277  
      Under rule 104(c) the hearing on a preliminary matter may at
    times be conducted in front of the jury. Should an accused testify
    in such a hearing, waiving his privilege against self-incrimination
    as to the preliminary issue, rule 104(d) provides that he will not
    generally be subject to cross-examination as to any other issue.
    This rule is not, however, intended to immunize the accused from
    cross-examination where, in testifying about a preliminary issue,
    he injects other issues into the hearing. If he could not be cross-
    examined about any issues gratuitously raised by him beyond the
    scope of the preliminary matters, injustice result. Accordingly, in
    order to prevent any such unjust result, the committee intends the
    rule to be construed to provide that the accused may subject
    himself to cross-examination as to issues raised by his own
    testimony upon a preliminary matter before a jury.

-STATUTE-
      When evidence which is admissible as to one party or for one

    purpose is admitted, the court, upon request, shall restrict the
    evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly.

-MISC1-
               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      A close relationship exists between this rule and Rule 403 which
    requires exclusion when "probative value is substantially
    outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the
    issues, or misleading the jury." The present rule recognizes the
    practice of admitting evidence for a limited purpose and
    instructing the jury accordingly. The availability and
    effectiveness of this practice must be taken into consideration in
    reaching a decision whether to exclude for unfair prejudice under
    Rule 403. In Bruton v. United States, 389 U.S. 818, 88 S.Ct. 126,
    19 L.Ed.2d 70 (1968), the Court ruled that a limiting instruction
    did not effectively protect the accused against the prejudicial
    effect of admitting in evidence the confession of a codefendant
    which implicated him. The decision does not, however, bar the use
    of limited admissibility with an instruction where the risk of
    prejudice is less serious.
      Similar provisions are found in Uniform Rule 6; California
    Evidence Code Sec. 355; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 60-406;
    New Jersey Evidence Rule 6. The wording of the present rule
    differs, however, in repelling any implication that limiting or
    curative instructions are sufficient in all situations.

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      Rule 106 as submitted by the Supreme Court (now Rule 105 in the
    bill) dealt with the subject of evidence which is admissible as to
    one party or for one purpose but is not admissible against another
    party or for another purpose. The Committee adopted this Rule
    without change on the understanding that it does not affect the
    authority of a court to order a severance in a multi-defendant
    case.

      The rule is an expression of the rule of completeness. McCormick
    Sec. 56. It is manifested as to depositions in Rule 32(a)(4) of the
    Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, of which the proposed rule is
    substantially a restatement.
      The rule is based on two considerations. The first is the
    misleading impression created by taking matters out of context. The
    second is the inadequacy of repair work when delayed to a point
    later in the trial. See McCormick Sec. 56; California Evidence Code
    Sec. 356. The rule does not in any way circumscribe the right of
    the adversary to develop the matter on cross-examination or as part
    of his own case.
      For practical reasons, the rule is limited to writings and
    recorded statements and does not apply to conversations.

    Rule 201. Judicial Notice of Adjudicative Facts

-STATUTE-
      (a) Scope of Rule. This rule governs only judicial notice of
    adjudicative facts.
      (b) Kinds of Facts. A judicially noticed fact must be one not
    subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally
    known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2)
    capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources
    whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.
      (c) When Discretionary. A court may take judicial notice, whether
    requested or not.
      (d) When Mandatory. A court shall take judicial notice if
    requested by a party and supplied with the necessary information.
      (e) Opportunity to be Heard. A party is entitled upon timely
    request to an opportunity to be heard as to the propriety of taking
    judicial notice and the tenor of the matter noticed. In the absence
    of prior notification, the request may be made after judicial
    notice has been taken.
      (f) Time of Taking Notice. Judicial notice may be taken at any
    stage of the proceeding.
      (g) Instructing Jury. In a civil action or proceeding, the court
    shall instruct the jury to accept as conclusive any fact judicially
    noticed. In a criminal case, the court shall instruct the jury that
    it may, but is not required to, accept as conclusive any fact
    judicially noticed.

-MISC1-
               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      Subdivision (a). This is the only evidence rule on the subject of
    judicial notice. It deals only with judicial notice of
    "adjudicative" facts. No rule deals with judicial notice of
    "legislative" facts. Judicial notice of matters of foreign law is
    treated in Rule 44.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and
    Rule 26.1 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
      The omission of any treatment of legislative facts results from
    fundamental differences between adjudicative facts and legislative
    facts. Adjudicative facts are simply the facts of the particular
    case. Legislative facts, on the other hand, are those which have
    relevance to legal reasoning and the lawmaking process, whether in
    the formulation of a legal principle or ruling by a judge or court
    or in the enactment of a legislative body. The terminology was
    coined by Professor Kenneth Davis in his article An Approach to
    Problems of Evidence in the Administrative Process, 55 Harv.L.Rev.
    364, 404-407 (1942). The following discussion draws extensively
    upon his writings. In addition, see the same author's Judicial
    Notice, 55 Colum.L. Rev. 945 (1955); Administrative Law Treatise,
    ch. 15 (1958); A System of Judicial Notice Based on Fairness and
    Convenience, in Perspectives of Law 69 (1964).
      The usual method of establishing adjudicative facts in through
    the introduction of evidence, ordinarily consisting of the
    testimony of witnesses. If particular facts are outside of
    reasonable controversy, this process is dispensed with as
    unnecessary. A high degree of indisputability is the essential
    prerequisite.
      Legislative facts are quite different. As Professor Davis says:
      "My opinion is that judge-made law would stop growing if judges,
    in thinking about questions of law and policy, were forbidden to
    take into account the facts they believe, as distinguished from
    facts which are 'clearly * * * within the domain of the
    indisputable.' Facts most needed in thinking about difficult
    problems of law and policy have a way of being outside the domain
    of the clearly indisputable." A System of Judicial Notice Based on
    Fairness and Convenience, supra, at 82.
    An illustration is Hawkins v. United States, 358 U.S. 74, 79 S.Ct.
    136, 3 L.Ed.2d 125 (1958), in which the Court refused to discard
    the common law rule that one spouse could not testify against the
    other, saying, "Adverse testimony given in criminal proceedings
    would, we think, be likely to destroy almost any marriage." This
    conclusion has a large intermixture of fact, but the factual aspect
    is scarcely "indisputable." See Hutchins and Slesinger, Some
    Observations on the Law of Evidence - Family Relations, 13
    Minn.L.Rev. 675 (1929). If the destructive effect of the giving of
    adverse testimony by a spouse is not indisputable, should the Court
    have refrained from considering it in the absence of supporting
    evidence?
      "If the Model Code or the Uniform Rules had been applicable, the
    Court would have been barred from thinking about the essential
    factual ingredient of the problems before it, and such a result
    would be obviously intolerable. What the law needs as its growing
    points is more, not less, judicial thinking about the factual
    ingredients of problems of what the law ought to be, and the needed
    facts are seldom 'clearly' indisputable." Davis, supra, at 83.
      "Professor Morgan gave the following description of the
    methodology of determining domestic law:
      "In determining the content or applicability of a rule of
    domestic law, the judge is unrestricted in his investigation and
    conclusion. He may reject the propositions of either party or of
    both parties. He may consult the sources of pertinent data to which
    they refer, or he may refuse to do so. He may make an independent
    search for persuasive data or rest content with what he has or what
    the parties present. * * * [T]he parties do no more than to assist;
    they control no part of the process." Morgan, Judicial Notice, 57
    Harv.L.Rev. 269, 270-271 (1944).
    This is the view which should govern judicial access to legislative
    facts. It renders inappropriate any limitation in the form of
    indisputability, any formal requirements of notice other than those
    already inherent in affording opportunity to hear and be heard and
    exchanging briefs, and any requirement of formal findings at any
    level. It should, however, leave open the possibility of
    introducing evidence through regular channels in appropriate
    situations. See Borden's Farm Products Co. v. Baldwin, 293 U.S.
    194, 55 S.Ct. 187, 79 L.Ed. 281 (1934), where the cause was
    remanded for the taking of evidence as to the economic conditions
    and trade practices underlying the New York Milk Control Law.
      Similar considerations govern the judicial use of nonadjudicative
    facts in ways other than formulating laws and rules. Thayer
    described them as a part of the judicial reasoning process.
      "In conducting a process of judicial reasoning, as of other
    reasoning, not a step can be taken without assuming something which
    has not been proved; and the capacity to do this with competent
    judgement and efficiency, is imputed to judges and juries as part
    of their necessary mental outfit." Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on
    Evidence 279-280 (1898).
      As Professor Davis points out, A System of Judicial Notice Based
    on Fairness and Convenience, in Perspectives of Law 69, 73 (1964),
    every case involves the use of hundreds or thousands of non-
    evidence facts. When a witness in an automobile accident case says
    "car," everyone, judge and jury included, furnishes, from non-
    evidence sources within himself, the supplementing information
    that the "car" is an automobile, not a railroad car, that it is
    self-propelled, probably by an internal combustion engine, that it
    may be assumed to have four wheels with pneumatic rubber tires, and
    so on. The judicial process cannot construct every case from
    scratch, like Descartes creating a world based on the postulate
    Cogito, ergo sum. These items could not possibly be introduced into
    evidence, and no one suggests that they be. Nor are they
    appropriate subjects for any formalized treatment of judicial
    notice of facts. See Levin and Levy, Persuading the Jury with Facts
    Not in Evidence: The Fiction-Science Spectrum, 105 U.Pa.L.Rev. 139
    (1956).
      Another aspect of what Thayer had in mind is the use of non-
    evidence facts to appraise or assess the adjudicative facts of the
    case. Pairs of cases from two jurisdictions illustrate this use and
    also the difference between non-evidence facts thus used and
    adjudicative facts. In People v. Strook, 347 Ill. 460, 179 N.E. 821
    (1932), venue in Cook County had been held not established by
    testimony that the crime was committed at 7956 South Chicago
    Avenue, since judicial notice would not be taken that the address
    was in Chicago. However, the same court subsequently ruled that
    venue in Cook County was established by testimony that a crime
    occurred at 8900 South Anthony Avenue, since notice would be taken
    of the common practice of omitting the name of the city when
    speaking of local addresses, and the witness was testifying in
    Chicago. People v. Pride, 16 Ill.2d 82, 156 N.E.2d 551 (1951). And
    in Hughes v. Vestal, 264 N.C. 500, 142 S.E.2d 361 (1965), the
    Supreme Court of North Carolina disapproved the trial judge's
    admission in evidence of a state-published table of automobile
    stopping distances on the basis of judicial notice, though the
    court itself had referred to the same table in an earlier case in a
    "rhetorical and illustrative" way in determining that the defendant
    could not have stopped her car in time to avoid striking a child
    who suddenly appeared in the highway and that a non-suit was
    properly granted. Ennis v. Dupree, 262 N.C. 224, 136 S.E.2d 702
    (1964). See also Brown v. Hale, 263 N.C. 176, 139 S.E.2d 210
    (1964); Clayton v. Rimmer, 262 N.C. 302, 136 S.E.2d 562 (1964). It
    is apparent that this use of non-evidence facts in evaluating the
    adjudicative facts of the case is not an appropriate subject for a
    formalized judicial notice treatment.
      In view of these considerations, the regulation of judicial
    notice of facts by the present rule extends only to adjudicative
    facts.
      What, then, are "adjudicative" facts? Davis refers to them as
    those "which relate to the parties," or more fully:
      "When a court or an agency finds facts concerning the immediate
    parties - who did what, where, when, how, and with what motive or
    intent - the court or agency is performing an adjudicative
    function, and the facts are conveniently called adjudicative facts.
    * * *
      "Stated in other terms, the adjudicative facts are those to which
    the law is applied in the process of adjudication. They are the
    facts that normally go to the jury in a jury case. They relate to
    the parties, their activities, their properties, their businesses."
    2 Administrative Law Treatise 353.
      Subdivision (b). With respect to judicial notice of adjudicative
    facts, the tradition has been one of caution in requiring that the
    matter be beyond reasonable controversy. This tradition of
    circumspection appears to be soundly based, and no reason to depart
    from it is apparent. As Professor Davis says:
      "The reason we use trial-type procedure, I think, is that we make
    the practical judgement, on the basis of experience, that taking
    evidence, subject to cross-examination and rebuttal, is the best
    way to resolve controversies involving disputes of adjudicative
    facts, that is, facts pertaining to the parties. The reason we
    require a determination on the record is that we think fair
    procedure in resolving disputes of adjudicative facts calls for
    giving each party a chance to meet in the appropriate fashion the
    facts that come to the tribunal's attention, and the appropriate
    fashion for meeting disputed adjudicative facts includes rebuttal
    evidence, cross-examination, usually confrontation, and argument
    (either written or oral or both). The key to a fair trial is
    opportunity to use the appropriate weapons (rebuttal evidence,
    cross-examination, and argument) to meet adverse materials that
    come to the tribunal's attention." A System of Judicial Notice
    Based on Fairness and Convenience, in Perspectives of Law 69, 93
    (1964).
    The rule proceeds upon the theory that these considerations call
    for dispensing with traditional methods of proof only in clear
    cases. Compare Professor Davis' conclusion that judicial notice
    should be a matter of convenience, subject to requirements of
    procedural fairness. Id., 94.
      This rule is consistent with Uniform Rule 9(1) and (2) which
    limit judicial notice of facts to those "so universally known that
    they cannot reasonably be the subject of dispute," those "so
    generally known or of such common notoriety within the territorial
    jurisdiction of the court that they cannot reasonably be the
    subject of dispute," and those "capable of immediate and accurate
    determination by resort to easily accessible sources of
    indisputable accuracy." The traditional textbook treatment has
    included these general categories (matters of common knowledge,
    facts capable of verification), McCormick Secs. 324, 325, and then
    has passed on into detailed treatment of such specific topics as
    facts relating to the personnel and records of the court, Id. Sec.
    327, and other governmental facts, Id. Sec. 328. The California
    draftsmen, with a background of detailed statutory regulation of
    judicial notice, followed a somewhat similar pattern. California
    Evidence Code Secs. 451, 452. The Uniform Rules, however, were
    drafted on the theory that these particular matters are included
    within the general categories and need no specific mention. This
    approach is followed in the present rule.
      The phrase "propositions of generalized knowledge," found in
    Uniform Rule 9(1) and (2) is not included in the present rule. It
    was, it is believed, originally included in Model Code Rules 801
    and 802 primarily in order to afford some minimum recognition to
    the right of the judge in his "legislative" capacity (not acting as
    the trier of fact) to take judicial notice of very limited
    categories of generalized knowledge. The limitations thus imposed
    have been discarded herein as undesirable, unworkable, and contrary
    to existing practice. What is left, then, to be considered, is the
    status of a "proposition of generalized knowledge" as an
    "adjudicative" fact to be noticed judicially and communicated by
    the judge to the jury. Thus viewed, it is considered to be lacking
    practical significance. While judges use judicial notice of
    "propositions of generalized knowledge" in a variety of situations:
    determining the validity and meaning of statutes, formulating
    common law rules, deciding whether evidence should be admitted,
    assessing the sufficiency and effect of evidence, all are
    essentially nonadjudicative in nature. When judicial notice is seen
    as a significant vehicle for progress in the law, these are the
    areas involved, particularly in developing fields of scientific
    knowledge. See McCormick 712. It is not believed that judges now
    instruct juries as to "propositions of generalized knowledge"
    derived from encyclopedias or other sources, or that they are
    likely to do so, or, indeed, that it is desirable that they do so.
    There is a vast difference between ruling on the basis of judicial
    notice that radar evidence of speed is admissible and explaining to
    the jury its principles and degree of accuracy, or between using a
    table of stopping distances of automobiles at various speeds in a
    judicial evaluation of testimony and telling the jury its precise
    application in the case. For cases raising doubt as to the
    propriety of the use of medical texts by lay triers of fact in
    passing on disability claims in administrative proceedings, see
    Sayers v. Gardner, 380 F.2d 940 (6th Cir. 1967); Ross v. Gardner,
    365 F.2d 554 (6th Cir. 1966); Sosna v. Celebrezze, 234 F.Supp. 289
    (E.D.Pa. 1964); Glendenning v. Ribicoff, 213 F.Supp. 301 (W.D.Mo.
    1962).
      Subdivisions (c) and (d). Under subdivision (c) the judge has a
    discretionary authority to take judicial notice, regardless of
    whether he is so requested by a party. The taking of judicial
    notice is mandatory, under subdivision (d), only when a party
    requests it and the necessary information is supplied. This scheme
    is believed to reflect existing practice. It is simple and
    workable. It avoids troublesome distinctions in the many situations
    in which the process of taking judicial notice is not recognized as
    such.
      Compare Uniform Rule 9 making judicial notice of facts
    universally known mandatory without request, and making judicial
    notice of facts generally known in the jurisdiction or capable of
    determination by resort to accurate sources discretionary in the
    absence of request but mandatory if request is made and the
    information furnished. But see Uniform Rule 10(3), which directs
    the judge to decline to take judicial notice if available
    information fails to convince him that the matter falls clearly
    within Uniform Rule 9 or is insufficient to enable him to notice it
    judicially. Substantially the same approach is found in California
    Evidence Code Secs. 451-453 and in New Jersey Evidence Rule 9. In
    contrast, the present rule treats alike all adjudicative facts
    which are subject to judicial notice.
      Subdivision (e). Basic considerations of procedural fairness
    demand an opportunity to be heard on the propriety of taking
    judicial notice and the tenor of the matter noticed. The rule
    requires the granting of that opportunity upon request. No formal
    scheme of giving notice is provided. An adversely affected party
    may learn in advance that judicial notice is in contemplation,
    either by virtue of being served with a copy of a request by
    another party under subdivision (d) that judicial notice be taken,
    or through an advance indication by the judge. Or he may have no
    advance notice at all. The likelihood of the latter is enhanced by
    the frequent failure to recognize judicial notice as such. And in
    the absence of advance notice, a request made after the fact could
    not in fairness be considered untimely. See the provision for
    hearing on timely request in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5
    U.S.C. Sec. 556(e). See also Revised Model State Administrative
    Procedure Act (1961), 9C U.L.A. Sec. 10(4) (Supp. 1967).
      Subdivision (f). In accord with the usual view, judicial notice
    may be taken at any stage of the proceedings, whether in the trial
    court or on appeal. Uniform Rule 12; California Evidence Code Sec.
    459; Kansas Rules of Evidence Sec. 60-412; New Jersey Evidence Rule
    12; McCormick Sec. 330, p. 712.
      Subdivision (g). Much of the controversy about judicial notice
    has centered upon the question whether evidence should be admitted
    in disproof of facts of which judicial notice is taken.
      The writers have been divided. Favoring admissibility are Thayer,
    Preliminary Treatise on Evidence 308 (1898); 9 Wigmore Sec. 2567;
    Davis, A System of Judicial Notice Based on Fairness and
    Convenience, in Perspectives of Law, 69, 76-77 (1964). Opposing
    admissibility are Keeffe, Landis and Shaad, Sense and Nonsense
    about Judicial Notice, 2 Stan.L.Rev. 664, 668 (1950); McNaughton,
    Judicial Notice - Excerpts Relating to the Morgan-Whitmore
    Controversy, 14 Vand.L.Rev. 779 (1961); Morgan, Judicial Notice, 57
    Harv.L.Rev. 269, 279 (1944); McCormick 710-711. The Model Code and
    the Uniform Rules are predicated upon indisputability of judicially
    noticed facts.
      The proponents of admitting evidence in disproof have
    concentrated largely upon legislative facts. Since the present rule
    deals only with judicial notice of adjudicative facts, arguments
    directed to legislative facts lose their relevancy.
      Within its relatively narrow area of adjudicative facts, the rule
    contemplates there is to be no evidence before the jury in
    disproof. The judge instructs the jury to take judicially noticed
    facts as established. This position is justified by the undesirable
    effects of the opposite rule in limiting the rebutting party,
    though not his opponent, to admissible evidence, in defeating the
    reasons for judicial notice, and in affecting the substantive law
    to an extent and in ways largely unforeseeable. Ample protection
    and flexibility are afforded by the broad provision for opportunity
    to be heard on request, set forth in subdivision (e).
      Authority upon the propriety of taking judicial notice against an
    accused in a criminal case with respect to matters other than venue
    is relatively meager. Proceeding upon the theory that the right of
    jury trial does not extend to matters which are beyond reasonable
    dispute, the rule does not distinguish between criminal and civil
    cases. People v. Mayes, 113 Cal. 618, 45 P. 860 (1896); Ross v.
    United States, 374 F.2d 97 (8th Cir. 1967). Cf. State v. Main, 94
    R.I. 338, 180 A.2d 814 (1962); State v. Lawrence, 120 Utah 323, 234
    P.2d 600 (1951).
      Note on Judicial Notice of Law. By rules effective July 1, 1966,
    the method of invoking the law of a foreign country is covered
    elsewhere. Rule 44.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; Rule
    26.1 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. These two new
    admirably designed rules are founded upon the assumption that the
    manner in which law is fed into the judicial process is never a
    proper concern of the rules of evidence but rather of the rules of
    procedure. The Advisory Committee on Evidence, believing that this
    assumption is entirely correct, proposes no evidence rule with
    respect to judicial notice of law, and suggests that those matters
    of law which, in addition to foreign-country law, have
    traditionally been treated as requiring pleading and proof and more
    recently as the subject of judicial notice be left to the Rules of
    Civil and Criminal Procedure.

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      Rule 201(g) as received from the Supreme Court provided that when
    judicial notice of a fact is taken, the court shall instruct the
    jury to accept that fact as established. Being of the view that
    mandatory instruction to a jury in a criminal case to accept as
    conclusive any fact judicially noticed is inappropriate because
    contrary to the spirit of the Sixth Amendment right to a jury
    trial, the Committee adopted the 1969 Advisory Committee draft of
    this subsection, allowing a mandatory instruction in civil actions
    and proceedings and a discretionary instruction in criminal cases.

      In all civil actions and proceedings not otherwise provided for

    party against whom it is directed the burden of going forward with
    evidence to rebut or meet the presumption, but does not shift to
    such party the burden of proof in the sense of the risk of
    nonpersuasion, which remains throughout the trial upon the party on

               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      This rule governs presumptions generally. See Rule 302 for
    presumptions controlled by state law and Rule 303 [deleted] for
    those against an accused in a criminal case.
      Presumptions governed by this rule are given the effect of
    placing upon the opposing party the burden of establishing the
    nonexistence of the presumed fact, once the party invoking the
    presumption establishes the basic facts giving rise to it. The same
    considerations of fairness, policy, and probability which dictate
    the allocation of the burden of the various elements of a case as
    between the prima facie case of a plaintiff and affirmative
    defenses also underlie the creation of presumptions. These
    considerations are not satisfied by giving a lesser effect to
    presumptions. Morgan and Maguire, Looking Backward and Forward at
    Evidence, 50 Harv.L.Rev. 909, 913 (1937); Morgan, Instructing the
    Jury upon Presumptions and Burdon of Proof, 47 Harv.L.Rev. 59, 82
    1933); Cleary, Presuming and Pleading: An Essay on Juristic
    Immaturity, 12 Stan.L.Rev. 5 (1959).
      The so-called "bursting bubble" theory, under which a presumption
    vanishes upon the introduction of evidence which would support a
    finding of the nonexistence of the presumed fact, even though not
    believed, is rejected as according presumptions too "slight and
    evanescent" an effect. Morgan and Maguire, supra, at p. 913.
      In the opinion of the Advisory Committee, no constitutional
    infirmity attends this view of presumptions. In Mobile, J. & K.C.R.
    Co. v. Turnipseed, 219 U.S. 35, 31 S.Ct. 136, 55 L.Ed. 78 (1910),
    the Court upheld a Mississippi statute which provided that in
    actions against railroads proof of injury inflicted by the running
    of trains should be prima facie evidence of negligence by the
    railroad. The injury in the case had resulted from a derailment.
    The opinion made the points (1) that the only effect of the statute
    was to impose on the railroad the duty of producing some evidence
    to the contrary, (2) that an inference may be supplied by law if
    there is a rational connection between the fact proved and the fact
    presumed, as long as the opposite party is not precluded from
    presenting his evidence to the contrary, and (3) that
    considerations of public policy arising from the character of the
    business justified the application in question. Nineteen years
    later, in Western & Atlantic R. Co. v. Henderson, 279 U.S. 639, 49
    S.Ct. 445, 73 L.Ed. 884 (1929), the Court overturned a Georgia
    statute making railroads liable for damages done by trains, unless
    the railroad made it appear that reasonable care had been used, the
    presumption being against the railroad. The declaration alleged the
    death of plaintiff's husband from a grade crossing collision, due
    to specified acts of negligence by defendant. The jury were
    instructed that proof of the injury raised a presumption of
    negligence; the burden shifted to the railroad to prove ordinary
    care; and unless it did so, they should find for plaintiff. The
    instruction was held erroneous in an opinion stating (1) that there
    was no rational connection between the mere fact of collision and
    negligence on the part of anyone, and (2) that the statute was
    different from that in Turnipseed in imposing a burden upon the
    railroad. The reader is left in a state of some confusion. Is the
    difference between a derailment and a grade crossing collision of
    no significance? Would the Turnipseed presumption have been bad if
    it had imposed a burden of persuasion on defendant, although that
    would in nowise have impaired its "rational connection"? If
    Henderson forbids imposing a burden of persuasion on defendants,
    what happens to affirmative defenses?
      Two factors serve to explain Henderson. The first was that it was
    common ground that negligence was indispensable to liability.
    Plaintiff thought so, drafted her complaint accordingly, and relied
    upon the presumption. But how in logic could the same presumption
    establish her alternative grounds of negligence that the engineer
    was so blind he could not see decedent's truck and that he failed
    to stop after he saw it? Second, take away the basic assumption of
    no liability without fault, as Turnipseed intimated might be done
    ("considerations of public policy arising out of the character of
    the business"), and the structure of the decision in Henderson
    fails. No question of logic would have arisen if the statute had
    simply said: a prima facie case of liability is made by proof of
    injury by a train; lack of negligence is an affirmative defense, to
    be pleaded and proved as other affirmative defenses. The problem
    would be one of economic due process only. While it seems likely
    that the Supreme Court of 1929 would have voted that due process
    was denied, that result today would be unlikely. See, for example,
    the shift in the direction of absolute liability in the consumer
    cases. Prosser, The Assault upon the Citadel (Strict Liability to
    the Consumer), 69 Yale L.J. 1099 (1960).
      Any doubt as to the constitutional permissibility of a
    presumption imposing a burden of persuasion of the non-existence of
    the presumed fact in civil cases is laid at rest by Dick v. New
    York Life Ins. Co., 359 U.S. 437, 79 S.Ct. 921, 3 L.Ed.2d 935
    (1959). The Court unhesitatingly applied the North Dakota rule that
    the presumption against suicide imposed on defendant the burden of
    proving that the death of insured, under an accidental death
    clause, was due to suicide.
      "Proof of coverage and of death by gunshot wound shifts the
    burden to the insurer to establish that the death of the insured
    was due to his suicide." 359 U.S. at 443, 79 S.Ct. at 925.
      "In a case like this one, North Dakota presumes that death was
    accidental and places on the insurer the burden of proving that
    death resulted from suicide." Id. at 446, 79 S.Ct. at 927.
      The rational connection requirement survives in criminal cases,
    Tot v. United States, 319 U.S. 463, 63 S.Ct. 1241, 87 L.Ed. 1519
    (1943), because the Court has been unwilling to extend into that
    area the greater-includes-the-lesser theory of Ferry v. Ramsey, 277
    U.S. 88, 48 S.Ct. 443, 72 L.Ed. 796 (1928). In that case the Court
    sustained a Kansas statute under which bank directors were
    personally liable for deposits made with their assent and with
    knowledge of insolvency, and the fact of insolvency was prima facie
    evidence of assent and knowledge of insolvency. Mr. Justice Holmes
    pointed out that the state legislature could have made the
    directors personally liable to depositors in every case. Since the
    statute imposed a less stringent liability, "the thing to be
    considered is the result reached, not the possibly inartificial or
    clumsy way of reaching it." Id. at 94, 48 S.Ct. at 444. Mr. Justice
    Sutherland dissented: though the state could have created an
    absolute liability, it did not purport to do so; a rational
    connection was necessary, but lacking, between the liability
    created and the prima facie evidence of it; the result might be
    different if the basis of the presumption were being open for
    business.
      The Sutherland view has prevailed in criminal cases by virtue of
    the higher standard of notice there required. The fiction that
    everyone is presumed to know the law is applied to the substantive
    law of crimes as an alternative to complete unenforceability. But
    the need does not extend to criminal evidence and procedure, and
    the fiction does not encompass them. "Rational connection" is not
    fictional or artificial, and so it is reasonable to suppose that
    Gainey should have known that his presence at the site of an
    illicit still could convict him of being connected with (carrying
    on) the business, United States v. Gainey, 380 U.S. 63, 85 S.Ct.
    754, 13 L.Ed.2d 658 (1965), but not that Romano should have known
    that his presence at a still could convict him of possessing it,
    United States v. Romano, 382 U.S. 136, 86 S.Ct. 279, 15 L.Ed.2d 210
    (1965).
      In his dissent in Gainey, Mr. Justice Black put it more
    artistically:
      "It might be argued, although the Court does not so argue or
    hold, that Congress if it wished could make presence at a still a
    crime in itself, and so Congress should be free to create crimes
    which are called 'possession' and 'carrying on an illegal
    distillery business' but which are defined in such a way that
    unexplained presence is sufficient and indisputable evidence in all
    cases to support conviction for those offenses. See Ferry v.
    Ramsey, 277 U.S. 88, 48 S.Ct. 443, 72 L.Ed. 796. Assuming for the
    sake of argument that Congress could make unexplained presence a
    criminal act, and ignoring also the refusal of this Court in other
    cases to uphold a statutory presumption on such a theory, see
    Heiner v. Donnan, 285 U.S. 312, 52 S.Ct. 358, 76 L.Ed. 772, there
    is no indication here that Congress intended to adopt such a
    misleading method of draftsmanship, nor in my judgement could the
    statutory provisions if so construed escape condemnation for
    vagueness, under the principles applied in Lanzetta v. New Jersey,
    306 U.S. 451, 59 S.Ct. 618, 83 L.Ed. 888, and many other cases."
    380 U.S. at 84, n. 12, 85 S.Ct. at 766.
      And the majority opinion in Romano agreed with him:
      "It may be, of course, that Congress has the power to make
    presence at an illegal still a punishable crime, but we find no
    clear indication that it intended to so exercise this power. The
    crime remains possession, not presence, and with all due deference
    to the judgement of Congress, the former may not constitutionally
    be inferred from the latter." 382 U.S. at 144, 86 S.Ct. at 284.
      The rule does not spell out the procedural aspects of its
    application. Questions as to when the evidence warrants submission
    of a presumption and what instructions are proper under varying
    states of fact are believed to present no particular difficulties.

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      Rule 301 as submitted by the Supreme Court provided that in all
    cases a presumption imposes on the party against whom it is
    directed the burden of proving that the nonexistence of the
    presumed fact is more probable than its existence. The Committee
    limited the scope of Rule 301 to "civil actions and proceedings" to
    effectuate its decision not to deal with the question of
    presumptions in criminal cases. (See note on [proposed] Rule 303 in
    discussion of Rules deleted). With respect to the weight to be
    given a presumption in a civil case, the Committee agreed with the
    judgement implicit in the Court's version that the socalled
    "bursting bubble" theory of presumptions, whereby a presumption
    vanished upon the appearance of any contradicting evidence by the
    other party, gives to presumptions too slight an effect. On the
    other hand, the Committee believed that the Rule proposed by the
    Court, whereby a presumption permanently alters the burden of
    persuasion, no matter how much contradicting evidence is introduced
    - a view shared by only a few courts - lends too great a force to
    presumptions. Accordingly, the Committee amended the Rule to adopt
    an intermediate position under which a presumption does not vanish
    upon the introduction of contradicting evidence, and does not
    change the burden of persuasion; instead it is merely deemed
    sufficient evidence of the fact presumed, to be considered by the
    jury or other finder of fact.

      NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, SENATE REPORT NO. 93-1277  
      The rule governs presumptions in civil cases generally. Rule 302
    provides for presumptions in cases controlled by State law.
      As submitted by the Supreme Court, presumptions governed by this
    rule were given the effect of placing upon the opposing party the
    burden of establishing the non-existence of the presumed fact, once
    the party invoking the presumption established the basic facts
    giving rise to it.
      Instead of imposing a burden of persuasion on the party against
    whom the presumption is directed, the House adopted a provision
    which shifted the burden of going forward with the evidence. They
    further provided that "even though met with contradicting evidence,
    a presumption is sufficient evidence of the fact presumed, to be
    considered by the trier of fact." The effect of the amendment is
    that presumptions are to be treated as evidence.
      The committee feels the House amendment is ill-advised. As the
    joint committees (the Standing Committee on Practice and Procedure
    of the Judicial Conference and the Advisory Committee on the Rules
    of Evidence) stated: "Presumptions are not evidence, but ways of
    dealing with evidence." This treatment requires juries to perform
    the task of considering "as evidence" facts upon which they have no
    direct evidence and which may confuse them in performance of their
    duties. California had a rule much like that contained in the House
    amendment. It was sharply criticized by Justice Traynor in Speck v.
    Sarver [20 Cal. 2d 585, 128 P. 2d 16, 21 (1942)] and was repealed
    after 93 troublesome years [Cal. Ev. Code 1965 Sec. 600].
      Professor McCormick gives a concise and compelling critique of
    the presumption as evidence rule:
                                 * * * * *                             

        Another solution, formerly more popular than now, is to
      instruct the jury that the presumption is "evidence", to be
      weighed and considered with the testimony in the case. This
      avoids the danger that the jury may infer that the presumption is
      conclusive, but it probably means little to the jury, and
      certainly runs counter to accepted theories of the nature of
      evidence. [McCormick, Evidence, 669 (1954); Id. 825 (2d ed.
      1972)].
      For these reasons the committee has deleted that provision of the
    House-passed rule that treats presumptions as evidence. The effect
    of the rule as adopted by the committee is to make clear that while
    evidence of facts giving rise to a presumption shifts the burden of
    coming forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption, it
    does not shift the burden of persuasion on the existence of the
    presumed facts. The burden or persuasion remains on the party to
    whom it is allocated under the rules governing the allocation in
    the first instance.
      The court may instruct the jury that they may infer the existence
    of the presumed fact from proof of the basic facts giving rise to
    the presumption. However, it would be inappropriate under this rule
    to instruct the jury that the inference they are to draw is
    conclusive.

          NOTES OF CONFERENCE COMMITTEE, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-1597      
      The House bill provides that a presumption in civil actions and
    proceedings shifts to the party against whom it is directed the
    burden of going forward with evidence to meet or rebut it. Even
    though evidence contradicting the presumption is offered, a
    presumption is considered sufficient evidence of the presumed fact
    to be considered by the jury. The Senate amendment provides that a
    presumption shifts to the party against whom it is directed the
    burden of going forward with evidence to meet or rebut the
    presumption, but it does not shift to that party the burden of
    persuasion on the existence of the presumed fact.
      Under the Senate amendment, a presumption is sufficient to get a
    party past an adverse party's motion to dismiss made at the end of
    his case-in-chief. If the adverse party offers no evidence
    contradicting the presumed fact, the court will instruct the jury
    that if it finds the basic facts, it may presume the existence of
    the presumed fact. If the adverse party does offer evidence
    contradicting the presumed fact, the court cannot instruct the jury
    that it may presume the existence of the presumed fact from proof
    of the basic facts. The court may, however, instruct the jury that
    it may infer the existence of the presumed fact from proof of the
    basic facts.
      The Conference adopts the Senate amendment.

               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      A series of Supreme Court decisions in diversity cases leaves no
    doubt of the relevance of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S.
    64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938), to questions of burden of
    proof. These decisions are Cities Service Oil Co. v. Dunlap, 308
    U.S. 208, 60 S.Ct. 201, 84 L.Ed. 196 (1939), Palmer v. Hoffman, 318
    U.S. 109, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943), and Dick v. New York
    Life Ins. Co., 359 U.S. 437, 79 S.Ct. 921, 3 L.Ed.2d 935 (1959).
    They involved burden of proof, respectively, as to status as bona
    fide purchasers, contributory negligence, and non-accidental death
    (suicide) of an insured. In each instance the state rule was held
    to be applicable. It does not follow, however, that all
    presumptions in diversity cases are governed by state law. In each
    case cited, the burden of proof question had to do with a
    substantive element of the claim or defense. Application of the
    state law is called for only when the presumption operates upon
    such an element. Accordingly the rule does not apply state law when
    the presumption operates upon a lesser aspect of the case, i.e.
    "tactical" presumptions.
      The situations in which the state law is applied have been tagged
    for convenience in the preceding discussion as "diversity cases."
    The designation is not a completely accurate one since Erie applies
    to any claim or issue having its source in state law, regardless of
    the basis of federal jurisdiction, and does not apply to a federal
    claim or issue, even though jurisdiction is based on diversity.

    ed. 1965); Wright, Federal Courts, 217-218 (1963). Hence the rule
    employs, as appropriately descriptive, the phrase "as to which
    state law supplies the rule of decision." See A.L.I. Study of the

    Rule 401. Definition of "Relevant Evidence"

-STATUTE-

               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      Problems of relevancy call for an answer to the question whether
    an item of evidence, when tested by the processes of legal
    reasoning, possesses sufficient probative value to justify
    receiving it in evidence. Thus, assessment of the probative value
    of evidence that a person purchased a revolver shortly prior to a
    fatal shooting with which he is charged is a matter of analysis and
    reasoning.
      The variety of relevancy problems is coextensive with the
    ingenuity of counsel in using circumstantial evidence as a means of
    proof. An enormous number of cases fall in no set pattern, and this
    rule is designed as a guide for handling them. On the other hand,
    some situations recur with sufficient frequency to create patterns
    susceptible of treatment by specific rules. Rule 404 and those
    following it are of that variety; they also serve as illustrations
    of the application of the present rule as limited by the
    exclusionary principles of Rule 403.
      Passing mention should be made of so-called "conditional"
    relevancy. Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 45-46 (1962). In this
    situation, probative value depends not only upon satisfying the
    basic requirement of relevancy as described above but also upon the
    existence of some matter of fact. For example, if evidence of a
    spoken statement is relied upon to prove notice, probative value is
    lacking unless the person sought to be charged heard the statement.
    The problem is one of fact, and the only rules needed are for the
    purpose of determining the respective functions of judge and jury.
    See Rules 104(b) and 901. The discussion which follows in the
    present note is concerned with relevancy generally, not with any
    particular problem of conditional relevancy.
      Relevancy is not an inherent characteristic of any item of
    evidence but exists only as a relation between an item of evidence
    and a matter properly provable in the case. Does the item of
    evidence tend to prove the matter sought to be proved? Whether the
    relationship exists depends upon principles evolved by experience
    or science, applied logically to the situation at hand. James,
    Relevancy, Probability and the Law, 29 Calif.L.Rev. 689, 696, n. 15
    (1941), in Selected Writings on Evidence and Trial 610, 615, n. 15
    (Fryer ed. 1957). The rule summarizes this relationship as a
    "tendency to make the existence" of the fact to be proved "more
    probable or less probable." Compare Uniform Rule 1(2) which states
    the crux of relevancy as "a tendency in reason," thus perhaps
    emphasizing unduly the logical process and ignoring the need to
    draw upon experience or science to validate the general principle
    upon which relevancy in a particular situation depends.
      The standard of probability under the rule is "more * * *
    probable than it would be without the evidence." Any more stringent
    requirement is unworkable and unrealistic. As McCormick Sec. 152,
    p. 317, says, "A brick is not a wall," or, as Falknor, Extrinsic
    Policies Affecting Admissibility, 10 Rutgers L.Rev. 574, 576
    (1956), quotes Professor McBaine, "* * * [I]t is not to be supposed
    that every witness can make a home run." Dealing with probability
    in the language of the rule has the added virtue of avoiding
    confusion between questions of admissibility and questions of the
    sufficiency of the evidence.
      The rule uses the phrase "fact that is of consequence to the
    determination of the action" to describe the kind of fact to which
    proof may properly be directed. The language is that of California
    Evidence Code Sec. 210; it has the advantage of avoiding the
    loosely used and ambiguous word "material." Tentative
    Recommendation and a Study Relating to the Uniform Rules of
    Evidence (Art. I. General Provisions), Cal. Law Revision Comm'n,
    Rep., Rec. & Studies, 10-11 (1964). The fact to be proved may be
    ultimate, intermediate, or evidentiary; it matters not, so long as
    it is of consequence in the determination of the action. Cf.
    Uniform Rule 1(2) which requires that the evidence relate to a
    "material" fact.
      The fact to which the evidence is directed need not be in
    dispute. While situations will arise which call for the exclusion
    of evidence offered to prove a point conceded by the opponent, the
    ruling should be made on the basis of such considerations as waste
    of time and undue prejudice (see Rule 403), rather than under any
    general requirement that evidence is admissible only if directed to
    matters in dispute. Evidence which is essentially background in
    nature can scarcely be said to involve disputed matter, yet it is
    universally offered and admitted as an aid to understanding.
    Charts, photographs, views of real estate, murder weapons, and many
    other items of evidence fall in this category. A rule limiting
    admissibility to evidence directed to a controversial point would
    invite the exclusion of this helpful evidence, or at least the
    raising of endless questions over its admission. Cf. California
    Evidence Code Sec. 210, defining relevant evidence in terms of
    tendency to prove a disputed fact.

    Rule 402. Relevant Evidence Generally Admissible; Irrelevant
      Evidence Inadmissible

-STATUTE-
      All relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided
    by the Constitution of the United States, by Act of Congress, by
    these rules, or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court
    pursuant to statutory authority. Evidence which is not relevant is

               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      The provisions that all relevant evidence is admissible, with
    certain exceptions, and that evidence which is not relevant is not
    admissible are "a presupposition involved in the very conception of
    a rational system of evidence." Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on
    Evidence 264 (1898). They constitute the foundation upon which the
    structure of admission and exclusion rests. For similar provisions
    see California Evidence Code Secs. 350, 351. Provisions that all
    relevant evidence is admissible are found in Uniform Rule 7(f);
    Kansas Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 60-407(f); and New Jersey
    Evidence Rule 7(f); but the exclusion of evidence which is not
    relevant is left to implication.
      Not all relevant evidence is admissible. The exclusion of
    relevant evidence occurs in a variety of situations and may be
    called for by these rules, by the Rules of Civil and Criminal
    Procedure, by Bankruptcy Rules, by Act of Congress, or by
    constitutional considerations.
      Succeeding rules in the present article, in response to the
    demands of particular policies, require the exclusion of evidence
    despite its relevancy. In addition, Article V recognizes a number
    of privileges; Article VI imposes limitations upon witnesses and
    the manner of dealing with them; Article VII specifies requirements
    with respect to opinions and expert testimony; Article VIII
    excludes hearsay not falling within an exception; Article IX spells
    out the handling of authentication and identification; and Article
    X restricts the manner of proving the contents of writings and
    recordings.
      The Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure in some instances
    require the exclusion of relevant evidence. For example, Rules
    30(b) and 32(a)(3) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, by imposing
    requirements of notice and unavailability of the deponent, place
    limits on the use of relevant depositions. Similarly, Rule 15 of
    the Rules of Criminal Procedure restricts the use of depositions in
    criminal cases, even though relevant. And the effective enforcement
    of the command, originally statutory and now found in Rule 5(a) of
    the Rules of Criminal Procedure, that an arrested person be taken
    without unnecessary delay before a commissioner of other similar
    officer is held to require the exclusion of statements elicited
    during detention in violation thereof. Mallory v. United States,
    354 U.S. 449, 77 S.Ct. 1356, 1 L.Ed.2d 1479 (1957); 18 U.S.C. Sec.
    3501(c).
      While congressional enactments in the field of evidence have
    generally tended to expand admissibility beyond the scope of the
    common law rules, in some particular situations they have
    restricted the admissibility of relevant evidence. Most of this
    legislation has consisted of the formulation of a privilege or of a
    prohibition against disclosure. 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1202(f), records of
    refusal of visas or permits to enter United States confidential,
    subject to discretion of Secretary of State to make available to
    court upon certification of need; 10 U.S.C. Sec. 3693, replacement
    certificate of honorable discharge from Army not admissible in
    evidence; 10 U.S.C. Sec. 8693, same as to Air Force; 11 U.S.C. Sec.
    25(a)(10), testimony given by bankrupt on his examination not
    admissible in criminal proceedings against him, except that given
    in hearing upon objection to discharge; 11 U.S.C. Sec. 205(a),
    railroad reorganization petition, if dismissed, not admissible in
    evidence; 11 U.S.C. Sec. 403(a), list of creditors filed with
    municipal composition plan not an admission; 13 U.S.C. Sec. 9(a),
    census information confidential, retained copies of reports
    privileged; 47 U.S.C. Sec. 605, interception and divulgence of wire
    or radio communications prohibited unless authorized by sender.
    These statutory provisions would remain undisturbed by the rules.
      The rule recognizes but makes no attempt to spell out the
    constitutional considerations which impose basic limitations upon
    the admissibility of relevant evidence. Examples are evidence
    obtained by unlawful search and seizure, Weeks v. United States,
    232 U.S. 383, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652 (1914); Katz v. United
    States, 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967);
    incriminating statement elicited from an accused in violation of
    right to counsel, Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct.
    1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964).

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      Rule 402 as submitted to the Congress contained the phrase "or by
    other rules adopted by the Supreme Court". To accommodate the view
    that the Congress should not appear to acquiesce in the Court's
    judgment that it has authority under the existing Rules Enabling
    Acts to promulgate Rules of Evidence, the Committee amended the
    above phrase to read "or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme
    Court pursuant to statutory authority" in this and other Rules
    where the reference appears.

    Rule 403. Exclusion of Relevant Evidence on Grounds of Prejudice,
      Confusion, or Waste of Time

-STATUTE-
      Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative
    value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair
    prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by
    considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless
    presentation of cumulative evidence.

      The case law recognizes that certain circumstances call for the
    exclusion of evidence which is of unquestioned relevance. These
    circumstances entail risks which range all the way from inducing
    decision on a purely emotional basis, at one extreme, to nothing
    more harmful than merely wasting time, at the other extreme.
    Situations in this area call for balancing the probative value of
    and need for the evidence against the harm likely to result from
    its admission. Slough, Relevancy Unraveled, 5 Kan. L. Rev. 1, 12-15
    (1956); Trautman, Logical or Legal Relevancy - A Conflict in
    Theory, 5 Van. L. Rev. 385, 392 (1952); McCormick Sec. 152, pp. 319-
    321. The rules which follow in this Article are concrete
    applications evolved for particular situations. However, they
    reflect the policies underlying the present rule, which is designed
    as a guide for the handling of situations for which no specific
    rules have been formulated.
      Exclusion for risk of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues,
    misleading the jury, or waste of time, all find ample support in
    the authorities. "Unfair prejudice" within its context means an
    undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis, commonly,
    though not necessarily, an emotional one.
      The rule does not enumerate surprise as a ground for exclusion,
    in this respect following Wigmore's view of the common law. 6
    Wigmore Sec. 1849. Cf. McCormick Sec. 152, p. 320, n. 29, listing
    unfair surprise as a ground for exclusion but stating that it is
    usually "coupled with the danger of prejudice and confusion of
    issues." While Uniform Rule 45 incorporates surprise as a ground
    and is followed in Kansas Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 60-445,
    surprise is not included in California Evidence Code Sec. 352 or
    New Jersey Rule 4, though both the latter otherwise substantially
    embody Uniform Rule 45. While it can scarcely be doubted that
    claims of unfair surprise may still be justified despite procedural
    requirements of notice and instrumentalities of discovery, the
    granting of a continuance is a more appropriate remedy than
    exclusion of the evidence. Tentative Recommendation and a Study
    Relating to the Uniform Rules of Evidence (Art. VI. Extrinsic
    Policies Affecting Admissibility), Cal. Law Revision Comm'n, Rep.,
    Rec. & Studies, 612 (1964). Moreover, the impact of a rule
    excluding evidence on the ground of surprise would be difficult to
    estimate.
      In reaching a decision whether to exclude on grounds of unfair
    prejudice, consideration should be given to the probable
    effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of a limiting instruction.
    See Rule 106 [now 105] and Advisory Committee's Note thereunder.
    The availability of other means of proof may also be an appropriate
    factor.

-HEAD-
    Rule 404. Character Evidence Not Admissible to Prove Conduct;
      Exceptions; Other Crimes

-STATUTE-
      (a) Character Evidence Generally. Evidence of a person's
    character or a trait of character is not admissible for the purpose
    of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion,
    except:
        (1) Character of Accused. In a criminal case, evidence of a
      pertinent trait of character offered by an accused, or by the
      prosecution to rebut the same, or if evidence of a trait of
      character of the alleged victim of the crime is offered by an
      accused and admitted under Rule 404(a)(2), evidence of the same
      trait of character of the accused offered by the prosecution;
        (2) Character of Alleged Victim. In a criminal case, and
      subject to the limitations imposed by Rule 412, evidence of a
      pertinent trait of character of the alleged victim of the crime
      offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same,
      or evidence of a character trait of peacefulness of the alleged
      victim offered by the prosecution in a homicide case to rebut
      evidence that the alleged victim was the first aggressor;
        (3) Character of Witness. Evidence of the character of a
      witness, as provided in Rules 607, 608, and 609.

      (b) Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts. Evidence of other crimes,
    wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a
    person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may,
    however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive,
    opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or
    absence of mistake or accident, provided that upon request by the
    accused, the prosecution in a criminal case shall provide
    reasonable notice in advance of trial, or during trial if the court
    excuses pretrial notice on good cause shown, of the general nature
    of any such evidence it intends to introduce at trial.

-MISC1-
               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      Subdivision (a). This subdivision deals with the basic question
    whether character evidence should be admitted. Once the
    admissibility of character evidence in some form is established
    under this rule, reference must then be made to Rule 405, which
    follows, in order to determine the appropriate method of proof. If
    the character is that of a witness, see Rules 608 and 610 for
    methods of proof.
      Character questions arise in two fundamentally different ways.
    (1) Character may itself be an element of a crime, claim, or
    defense. A situation of this kind is commonly referred to as
    "character in issue." Illustrations are: the chastity of the victim
    under a statute specifying her chastity as an element of the crime
    of seduction, or the competency of the driver in an action for
    negligently entrusting a motor vehicle to an incompetent driver. No
    problem of the general relevancy of character evidence is involved,
    and the present rule therefore has no provision on the subject. The
    only question relates to allowable methods of proof, as to which
    see Rule 405, immediately following. (2) Character evidence is
    susceptible of being used for the purpose of suggesting an
    inference that the person acted on the occasion in question
    consistently with his character. This use of character is often
    described as "circumstantial." Illustrations are: evidence of a
    violent disposition to prove that the person was the aggressor in
    an affray, or evidence of honesty in disproof of a charge of theft.
    This circumstantial use of character evidence raises questions of
    relevancy as well as questions of allowable methods of proof.
      In most jurisdictions today, the circumstantial use of character
    is rejected but with important exceptions: (1) an accused may
    introduce pertinent evidence of good character (often misleadingly
    described as "putting his character in issue"), in which event the
    prosecution may rebut with evidence of bad character; (2) an
    accused may introduce pertinent evidence of the character of the
    victim, as in support of a claim of self-defense to a charge of
    homicide or consent in a case of rape, and the prosecution may
    introduce similar evidence in rebuttal of the character evidence,
    or, in a homicide case, to rebut a claim that deceased was the
    first aggressor, however proved; and (3) the character of a witness
    may be gone into as bearing on his credibility. McCormick Secs. 155-
    161. This pattern is incorporated in the rule. While its basis
    lies more in history and experience than in logic as underlying
    justification can fairly be found in terms of the relative presence
    and absence of prejudice in the various situations. Falknor,
    Extrinsic Policies Affecting Admissibility, 10 Rutger, L.Rev. 574,
    584 (1956); McCormick Sec. 157. In any event, the criminal rule is
    so deeply imbedded in our jurisprudence as to assume almost
    constitutional proportions and to override doubts of the basic
    relevancy of the evidence.
      The limitation to pertinent traits of character, rather than
    character generally, in paragraphs (1) and (2) is in accordance
    with the prevailing view. McCormick Sec. 158, p. 334. A similar
    provision in Rule 608, to which reference is made in paragraph (3),
    limits character evidence respecting witnesses to the trait of
    truthfulness or untruthfulness.
      The argument is made that circumstantial use of character ought
    to be allowed in civil cases to the same extent as in criminal
    cases, i.e. evidence of good (nonprejudicial) character would be
    admissible in the first instance, subject to rebuttal by evidence
    of bad character. Falknor, Extrinsic Policies Affecting
    Admissibility, 10 Rutgers L.Rev. 574, 581-583 (1956); Tentative
    Recommendation and a Study Relating to the Uniform Rules of
    Evidence (Art. VI. Extrinsic Policies Affecting Admissibility),
    Cal. Law Revision Comm'n, Rep., Rec. & Studies, 657-658 (1964).
    Uniform Rule 47 goes farther, in that it assumes that character
    evidence in general satisfies the conditions of relevancy, except
    as provided in Uniform Rule 48. The difficulty with expanding the
    use of character evidence in civil cases is set forth by the
    California Law Revision Commission in its ultimate rejection of
    Uniform Rule 47, Id., 615:
      "Character evidence is of slight probative value and may be very
    prejudicial. It tends to distract the trier of fact from the main
    question of what actually happened on the particular occasion. It
    subtly permits the trier of fact to reward the good man to punish
    the bad man because of their respective characters despite what the
    evidence in the case shows actually happened."
      Much of the force of the position of those favoring greater use
    of character evidence in civil cases is dissipated by their support
    of Uniform Rule 48 which excludes the evidence in negligence cases,
    where it could be expected to achieve its maximum usefulness.
    Moreover, expanding concepts of "character," which seem of
    necessity to extend into such areas as psychiatric evaluation and
    psychological testing, coupled with expanded admissibility, would
    open up such vistas of mental examinations as caused the Court
    concern in Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U.S. 104, 85 S.Ct. 234, 13
    L.Ed.2d 152 (1964). It is believed that those espousing change have
    not met the burden of persuasion.
      Subdivision (b) deals with a specialized but important
    application of the general rule excluding circumstantial use of
    character evidence. Consistently with that rule, evidence of other
    crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove character as a
    basis for suggesting the inference that conduct on a particular
    occasion was in conformity with it. However, the evidence may be
    offered for another purpose, such as proof of motive, opportunity,
    and so on, which does not fall within the prohibition. In this
    situation the rule does not require that the evidence be excluded.
    No mechanical solution is offered. The determination must be made
    whether the danger of undue prejudice outweighs the probative value
    of the evidence in view of the availability of other means of proof
    and other factors appropriate for making decisions of this kind
    under Rule 403. Slough and Knightly, Other Vices, Other Crimes, 41
    Iowa L.Rev. 325 (1956).

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      The second sentence of Rule 404(b) as submitted to the Congress
    began with the words "This subdivision does not exclude the
    evidence when offered". The Committee amended this language to read
    "It may, however, be admissible", the words used in the 1971
    Advisory Committee draft, on the ground that this formulation
    properly placed greater emphasis on admissibility than did the
    final Court version.

      NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, SENATE REPORT NO. 93-1277  
      This rule provides that evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts
    is not admissible to prove character but may be admissible for
    other specified purposes such as proof of motive.
      Although your committee sees no necessity in amending the rule
    itself, it anticipates that the use of the discretionary word "may"
    with respect to the admissibility of evidence of crimes, wrongs, or
    acts is not intended to confer any arbitrary discretion on the
    trial judge. Rather, it is anticipated that with respect to
    permissible uses for such evidence, the trial judge may exclude it
    only on the basis of those considerations set forth in Rule 403,
    i.e. prejudice, confusion or waste of time.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 404(b) has emerged as one of the most cited Rules in the
    Rules of Evidence. And in many criminal cases evidence of an
    accused's extrinsic acts is viewed as an important asset in the
    prosecution's case against an accused. Although there are a few
    reported decisions on use of such evidence by the defense, see,
    e.g., United States v. McClure, 546 F.2nd 670 (5th Cir. 1990) (acts
    of informant offered in entrapment defense), the overwhelming
    number of cases involve introduction of that evidence by the
    prosecution.
      The amendment to Rule 404(b) adds a pretrial notice requirement
    in criminal cases and is intended to reduce surprise and promote
    early resolution on the issue of admissibility. The notice
    requirement thus places Rule 404(b) in the mainstream with notice
    and disclosure provisions in other rules of evidence. See, e.g.,
    Rule 412 (written motion of intent to offer evidence under rule),
    Rule 609 (written notice of intent to offer conviction older than
    10 years), Rule 803(24) and 804(b)(5) (notice of intent to use
    residual hearsay exceptions).
      The Rule expects that counsel for both the defense and the
    prosecution will submit the necessary request and information in a
    reasonable and timely fashion. Other than requiring pretrial
    notice, no specific time limits are stated in recognition that what
    constitutes a reasonable request or disclosure will depend largely
    on the circumstances of each case. Compare Fla. Stat. Ann Sec.
    90.404(2)(b) (notice must be given at least 10 days before trial)
    with Tex.R.Evid. 404(b) (no time limit).
      Likewise, no specific form of notice is required. The Committee
    considered and rejected a requirement that the notice satisfy the
    particularity requirements normally required of language used in a
    charging instrument. Cf. Fla. Stat. Ann Sec. 90.404(2)(b) (written
    disclosure must describe uncharged misconduct with particularity
    required of an indictment or information). Instead, the Committee
    opted for a generalized notice provision which requires the
    prosecution to apprise the defense of the general nature of the
    evidence of extrinsic acts. The Committee does not intend that the
    amendment will supercede other rules of admissibility or
    disclosure, such as the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3500, et seq.
    nor require the prosecution to disclose directly or indirectly the
    names and addresses of its witnesses, something it is currently not
    required to do under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16.
      The amendment requires the prosecution to provide notice,
    regardless of how it intends to use the extrinsic act evidence at
    trial, i.e., during its case-in-chief, for impeachment, or for
    possible rebuttal. The court in its discretion may, under the
    facts, decide that the particular request or notice was not
    reasonable, either because of the lack of timeliness or
    completeness. Because the notice requirement serves as condition
    precedent to admissibility of 404(b) evidence, the offered evidence
    is inadmissible if the court decides that the notice requirement
    has not been met.
      Nothing in the amendment precludes the court from requiring the
    government to provide it with an opportunity to rule in limine on
    404(b) evidence before it is offered or even mentioned during
    trial. When ruling in limine, the court may require the government
    to disclose to it the specifics of such evidence which the court
    must consider in determining admissibility.
      The amendment does not extend to evidence of acts which are
    "intrinsic" to the charged offense, see United States v. Williams,
    900 F.2d 823 (5th Cir. 1990) (noting distinction between 404(b)
    evidence and intrinsic offense evidence). Nor is the amendment
    intended to redefine what evidence would otherwise be admissible
    under Rule 404(b). Finally, the Committee does not intend through
    the amendment to affect the role of the court and the jury in
    considering such evidence. See United States v. Huddleston, 485
    U.S. 681, 108 S.Ct 1496 (1988).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 404(a)(1) has been amended to provide that when the accused
    attacks the character of an alleged victim under subdivision (a)(2)
    of this Rule, the door is opened to an attack on the same character
    trait of the accused. Current law does not allow the government to
    introduce negative character evidence as to the accused unless the
    accused introduces evidence of good character. See, e.g., United
    States v. Fountain, 768 F.2d 790 (7th Cir. 1985) (when the accused
    offers proof of self-defense, this permits proof of the alleged
    victim's character trait for peacefulness, but it does not permit
    proof of the accused's character trait for violence).
      The amendment makes clear that the accused cannot attack the
    alleged victim's character and yet remain shielded from the
    disclosure of equally relevant evidence concerning the same
    character trait of the accused. For example, in a murder case with
    a claim of self-defense, the accused, to bolster this defense,
    might offer evidence of the alleged victim's violent disposition.
    If the government has evidence that the accused has a violent
    character, but is not allowed to offer this evidence as part of its
    rebuttal, the jury has only part of the information it needs for an
    informed assessment of the probabilities as to who was the initial
    aggressor. This may be the case even if evidence of the accused's
    prior violent acts is admitted under Rule 404(b), because such
    evidence can be admitted only for limited purposes and not to show
    action in conformity with the accused's character on a specific
    occasion. Thus, the amendment is designed to permit a more balanced
    presentation of character evidence when an accused chooses to
    attack the character of the alleged victim.
      The amendment does not affect the admissibility of evidence of
    specific acts of uncharged misconduct offered for a purpose other
    than proving character under Rule 404(b). Nor does it affect the
    standards for proof of character by evidence of other sexual
    behavior or sexual offenses under Rules 412-415. By its placement
    in Rule 404(a)(1), the amendment covers only proof of character by
    way of reputation or opinion.
      The amendment does not permit proof of the accused's character if
    the accused merely uses character evidence for a purpose other than
    to prove the alleged victim's propensity to act in a certain way.
    See United States v. Burks, 470 F.2d 432, 434-5 (D.C.Cir. 1972)
    (evidence of the alleged victim's violent character, when known by
    the accused, was admissible "on the issue of whether or not the
    defendant reasonably feared he was in danger of imminent great
    bodily harm"). Finally, the amendment does not permit proof of the
    accused's character when the accused attacks the alleged victim's
    character as a witness under Rule 608 or 609.
      The term "alleged" is inserted before each reference to "victim"
    in the Rule, in order to provide consistency with Evidence Rule
    412.
      GAP Report - Proposed Amendment to Rule 404(a). The Committee
    made the following changes to the published draft of the proposed
    amendment to Evidence Rule 404(a):
      1. The term "a pertinent trait of character" was changed to "the
    same trait of character," in order to limit the scope of the
    government's rebuttal. The Committee Note was revised to accord
    with this change in the text.
      2. The word "alleged" was added before each reference in the Rule
    to a "victim" in order to provide consistency with Evidence Rule
    412. The Committee Note was amended to accord with this change in
    the text.
      3. The Committee Note was amended to clarify that rebuttal is not
    permitted under this Rule if the accused proffers evidence of the
    alleged victim's character for a purpose other than to prove the
    alleged victim's propensity to act in a certain manner.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      The Rule has been amended to clarify that in a civil case
    evidence of a person's character is never admissible to prove that
    the person acted in conformity with the character trait. The
    amendment resolves the dispute in the case law over whether the
    exceptions in subdivisions (a)(1) and (2) permit the circumstantial
    use of character evidence in civil cases. Compare Carson v. Polley,
    689 F.2d 562, 576 (5th Cir. 1982) ("when a central issue in a case
    is close to one of a criminal nature, the exceptions to the Rule
    404(a) ban on character evidence may be invoked"), with SEC v.
    Towers Financial Corp., 966 F.Supp. 203 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (relying on
    the terms "accused" and "prosecution" in Rule 404(a) to conclude
    that the exceptions in subdivisions (a)(1) and (2) are inapplicable
    in civil cases). The amendment is consistent with the original
    intent of the Rule, which was to prohibit the circumstantial use of
    character evidence in civil cases, even where closely related to
    criminal charges. See Ginter v. Northwestern Mut. Life Ins. Co.,
    576 F.Supp. 627, 629-30 (D. Ky.1984) ("It seems beyond peradventure
    of doubt that the drafters of F.R.Evi. 404(a) explicitly intended
    that all character evidence, except where 'character is at issue'
    was to be excluded" in civil cases).
      The circumstantial use of character evidence is generally
    discouraged because it carries serious risks of prejudice,
    confusion and delay. See Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469,
    476 (1948) ("The overriding policy of excluding such evidence,
    despite its admitted probative value, is the practical experience
    that its disallowance tends to prevent confusion of issues, unfair
    surprise and undue prejudice."). In criminal cases, the so-called
    "mercy rule" permits a criminal defendant to introduce evidence of
    pertinent character traits of the defendant and the victim. But
    that is because the accused, whose liberty is at stake, may need "a
    counterweight against the strong investigative and prosecutorial
    resources of the government." C. Mueller & L. Kirkpatrick,
    Evidence: Practice Under the Rules, pp. 264-5 (2d ed. 1999). See
    also Richard Uviller, Evidence of Character to Prove Conduct:
    Illusion, Illogic, and Injustice in the Courtroom, 130 U.Pa.L.Rev.
    845, 855 (1982) (the rule prohibiting circumstantial use of
    character evidence "was relaxed to allow the criminal defendant
    with so much at stake and so little available in the way of
    conventional proof to have special dispensation to tell the
    factfinder just what sort of person he really is"). Those concerns
    do not apply to parties in civil cases.
      The amendment also clarifies that evidence otherwise admissible
    under Rule 404(a)(2) may nonetheless be excluded in a criminal case
    involving sexual misconduct. In such a case, the admissibility of
    evidence of the victim's sexual behavior and predisposition is
    governed by the more stringent provisions of Rule 412.
      Nothing in the amendment is intended to affect the scope of Rule
    404(b). While Rule 404(b) refers to the "accused," the
    "prosecution," and a "criminal case," it does so only in the
    context of a notice requirement. The admissibility standards of
    Rule 404(b) remain fully applicable to both civil and criminal
    cases.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    to the text of the proposed amendment as released for public
    comment. A paragraph was added to the Committee Note to state that
    the amendment does not affect the use of Rule 404(b) in civil
    cases.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Reputation or Opinion. In all cases in which evidence of
    character or a trait of character of a person is admissible, proof
    may be made by testimony as to reputation or by testimony in the
    form of an opinion. On cross-examination, inquiry is allowable into
    relevant specific instances of conduct.
      (b) Specific Instances of Conduct. In cases in which character or
    a trait of character of a person is an essential element of a
    charge, claim, or defense, proof may also be made of specific
    instances of that person's conduct.

               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      The rule deals only with allowable methods of proving character,
    not with the admissibility of character evidence, which is covered
    in Rule 404.
      Of the three methods of proving character provided by the rule,
    evidence of specific instances of conduct is the most convincing.
    At the same time it possesses the greatest capacity to arouse
    prejudice, to confuse, to surprise, and to consume time.
    Consequently the rule confines the use of evidence of this kind to
    cases in which character is, in the strict sense, in issue and
    hence deserving of a searching inquiry. When character is used
    circumstantially and hence occupies a lesser status in the case,
    proof may be only by reputation and opinion. These latter methods
    are also available when character is in issue. This treatment is,
    with respect to specific instances of conduct and reputation,
    conventional contemporary common law doctrine. McCormick Sec. 153.
      In recognizing opinion as a means of proving character, the rule
    departs from usual contemporary practice in favor of that of an
    earlier day. See 7 Wigmore Sec. 1986, pointing out that the earlier
    practice permitted opinion and arguing strongly for evidence based
    on personal knowledge and belief as contrasted with "the
    secondhand, irresponsible product of multiplied guesses and gossip
    which we term 'reputation'." It seems likely that the persistence
    of reputation evidence is due to its largely being opinion in
    disguise. Traditionally character has been regarded primarily in
    moral overtones of good and bad: chaste, peaceable, truthful,
    honest. Nevertheless, on occasion nonmoral considerations crop up,
    as in the case of the incompetent driver, and this seems bound to
    happen increasingly. If character is defined as the kind of person
    one is, then account must be taken of varying ways of arriving at
    the estimate. These may range from the opinion of the employer who
    has found the man honest to the opinion of the psychiatrist based
    upon examination and testing. No effective dividing line exists
    between character and mental capacity, and the latter traditionally
    has been provable by opinion.
      According to the great majority of cases, on cross-examination
    inquiry is allowable as to whether the reputation witness has heard
    of particular instances of conduct pertinent to the trait in
    question. Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 69 S.Ct. 213,
    93 L.Ed. 168 (1948); Annot., 47 A.L.R.2d 1258. The theory is that,
    since the reputation witness relates what he has heard, the inquiry
    tends to shed light on the accuracy of his hearing and reporting.
    Accordingly, the opinion witness would be asked whether he knew, as
    well as whether he had heard. The fact is, of course, that these
    distinctions are of slight if any practical significance, and the
    second sentence of subdivision (a) eliminates them as a factor in
    formulating questions. This recognition of the propriety of
    inquiring into specific instances of conduct does not circumscribe
    inquiry otherwise into the bases of opinion and reputation
    testimony.
      The express allowance of inquiry into specific instances of
    conduct on cross-examination in subdivision (a) and the express
    allowance of it as part of a case in chief when character is
    actually in issue in subdivision (b) contemplate that testimony of
    specific instances is not generally permissible on the direct
    examination of an ordinary opinion witness to character. Similarly
    as to witnesses to the character of witnesses under Rule 608(b).
    Opinion testimony on direct in these situations ought in general to
    correspond to reputation testimony as now given, i.e., be confined
    to the nature and extent of observation and acquaintance upon which
    the opinion is based. See Rule 701.

    Rule 406. Habit; Routine Practice

-STATUTE-
      Evidence of the habit of a person or of the routine practice of
    an organization, whether corroborated or not and regardless of the
    presence of eyewitnesses, is relevant to prove that the conduct of
    the person or organization on a particular occasion was in
    conformity with the habit or routine practice.

-MISC1-
               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      An oft-quoted paragraph, McCormick, Sec. 162, p. 340, describes
    habit in terms effectively contrasting it with character:
      "Character and habit are close akin. Character is a generalized
    description of one's disposition, or of one's disposition in
    respect to a general trait, such as honesty, temperance, or
    peacefulness. 'Habit,' in modern usage, both lay and psychological,
    is more specific. It describes one's regular response to a repeated
    specific situation. If we speak of character for care, we think of
    the person's tendency to act prudently in all the varying
    situations of life, in business, family life, in handling
    automobiles and in walking across the street. A habit, on the other
    hand, is the person's regular practice of meeting a particular kind
    of situation with a specific type of conduct, such as the habit of
    going down a particular stairway two stairs at a time, or of giving
    the hand-signal for a left turn, or of alighting from railway cars
    while they are moving. The doing of the habitual acts may become
    semi-automatic." Equivalent behavior on the part of a group is
    designated "routine practice of an organization" in the rule.
      Agreement is general that habit evidence is highly persuasive as
    proof of conduct on a particular occasion. Again quoting McCormick
    Sec. 162, p. 341:
      "Character may be thought of as the sum of one's habits though
    doubtless it is more than this. But unquestionably the uniformity
    of one's response to habit is far greater than the consistency with
    which one's conduct conforms to character or disposition. Even
    though character comes in only exceptionally as evidence of an act,
    surely any sensible man in investigating whether X did a particular
    act would be greatly helped in his inquiry by evidence as to
    whether he was in the habit of doing it."
      When disagreement has appeared, its focus has been upon the
    question what constitutes habit, and the reason for this is readily
    apparent. The extent to which instances must be multiplied and
    consistency of behavior maintained in order to rise to the status
    of habit inevitably gives rise to differences of opinion. Lewan,
    Rationale of Habit Evidence, 16 Syracuse L.Rev. 39, 49 (1964).
    While adequacy of sampling and uniformity of response are key
    factors, precise standards for measuring their sufficiency for
    evidence purposes cannot be formulated.
      The rule is consistent with prevailing views. Much evidence is
    excluded simply because of failure to achieve the status of habit.
    Thus, evidence of intemperate "habits" is generally excluded when
    offered as proof of drunkenness in accident cases, Annot., 46
    A.L.R.2d 103, and evidence of other assaults is inadmissible to
    prove the instant one in a civil assault action, Annot., 66
    A.L.R.2d 806. In Levin v. United States, 119 U.S.App.D.C. 156, 338
    F.2d 265 (1964), testimony as to the religious "habits" of the
    accused, offered as tending to prove that he was at home observing
    the Sabbath rather than out obtaining money through larceny by
    trick, was held properly excluded;
      "It seems apparent to us that an individual's religious practices
    would not be the type of activities which would lend themselves to
    the characterization of 'invariable regularity.' [1 Wigmore 520.]
    Certainly the very volitional basis of the activity raises serious
    questions as to its invariable nature, and hence its probative
    value." Id. at 272.
    These rulings are not inconsistent with the trend towards admitting
    evidence of business transactions between one of the parties and a
    third person as tending to prove that he made the same bargain or
    proposal in the litigated situation. Slough, Relevancy Unraveled, 6
    Kan.L.Rev. 38-41 (1957). Nor are they inconsistent with such cases
    as Whittemore v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., 65 Cal.App.2d 737, 151
    P.2d 670 (1944), upholding the admission of evidence that
    plaintiff's intestate had on four other occasions flown planes from
    defendant's factory for delivery to his employer airline, offered
    to prove that he was piloting rather than a guest on a plane which
    crashed and killed all on board while en route for delivery.
      A considerable body of authority has required that evidence of
    the routine practice of an organization be corroborated as a
    condition precedent to its admission in evidence. Slough, Relevancy
    Unraveled, 5 Kan.L.Rev. 404, 449 (1957). This requirement is
    specifically rejected by the rule on the ground that it relates to
    the sufficiency of the evidence rather than admissibility. A
    similar position is taken in New Jersey Rule 49. The rule also
    rejects the requirement of the absence of eyewitnesses, sometimes
    encountered with respect to admitting habit evidence to prove
    freedom from contributory negligence in wrongful death cases. For
    comment critical of the requirements see Frank, J., in Cereste v.
    New York, N.H. & H.R. Co., 231 F.2d 50 (2d Cir. 1956), cert. denied
    351 U.S. 951, 76 S.Ct. 848, 100 L.Ed 1475, 10 Vand.L.Rev. 447
    (1957); McCormick Sec. 162, p. 342. The omission of the requirement
    from the California Evidence Code is said to have effected its
    elimination. Comment, Cal.Ev.Code Sec. 1105.

    Rule 407. Subsequent Remedial Measures

-STATUTE-
      When, after an injury or harm allegedly caused by an event,
    measures are taken that, if taken previously, would have made the
    injury or harm less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent
    measures is not admissible to prove negligence, culpable conduct, a
    defect in a product, a defect in a product's design, or a need for
    a warning or instruction. This rule does not require the exclusion
    of evidence of subsequent measures when offered for another
    purpose, such as proving ownership, control, or feasibility of
    precautionary measures, if controverted, or impeachment.

-SOURCE-
    (Pub. L. 93-595, Sec. 1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1932; Apr. 11,

-MISC1-
               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      The rule incorporates conventional doctrine which excludes
    evidence of subsequent remedial measures as proof of an admission
    of fault. The rule rests on two grounds. (1) The conduct is not in
    fact an admission, since the conduct is equally consistent with
    injury by mere accident or through contributory negligence. Or, as
    Baron Bramwell put it, the rule rejects the notion that "because
    the world gets wiser as it gets older, therefore it was foolish
    before." Hart v. Lancashire & Yorkshire Ry. Co., 21 L.T.R. N.S.
    261, 263 (1869). Under a liberal theory of relevancy this ground
    alone would not support exclusion as the inference is still a
    possible one. (2) The other, and more impressive, ground for
    exclusion rests on a social policy of encouraging people to take,
    or at least not discouraging them from taking, steps in furtherance
    of added safety. The courts have applied this principle to exclude
    evidence of subsequent repairs, installation of safety devices,
    changes in company rules, and discharge of employees, and the
    language of the present rules is broad enough to encompass all of
    them. See Falknor, Extrinsic Policies Affecting Admissibility, 10
    Rutgers L.Rev. 574, 590 (1956).
      The second sentence of the rule directs attention to the
    limitations of the rule. Exclusion is called for only when the
    evidence of subsequent remedial measures is offered as proof of
    negligence or culpable conduct. In effect it rejects the suggested
    inference that fault is admitted. Other purposes are, however,
    allowable, including ownership or control, existence of duty, and
    feasibility of precautionary measures, if controverted, and
    impeachment. 2 Wigmore Sec. 283; Annot., 64 A.L.R.2d 1296. Two
    recent federal cases are illustrative. Boeing Airplane Co. v.
    Brown, 291 F.2d 310 (9th Cir. 1961), an action against an airplane
    manufacturer for using an allegedly defectively designed alternator
    shaft which caused a plane crash, upheld the admission of evidence
    of subsequent design modification for the purpose of showing that
    design changes and safeguards were feasible. And Powers v. J. B.
    Michael & Co., 329 F.2d 674 (6th Cir. 1964), an action against a
    road contractor for negligent failure to put out warning signs,
    sustained the admission of evidence that defendant subsequently put
    out signs to show that the portion of the road in question was
    under defendant's control. The requirement that the other purpose
    be controverted calls for automatic exclusion unless a genuine
    issue be present and allows the opposing party to lay the
    groundwork for exclusion by making an admission. Otherwise the
    factors of undue prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the
    jury, and waste of time remain for consideration under Rule 403.
      For comparable rules, see Uniform Rule 51; California Evidence
    Code Sec. 1151; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 60-451; New
    Jersey Evidence Rule 51.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment to Rule 407 makes two changes in the rule. First,
    the words "an injury or harm allegedly caused by" were added to
    clarify that the rule applies only to changes made after the
    occurrence that produced the damages giving rise to the action.
    Evidence of measures taken by the defendant prior to the "event"
    causing "injury or harm" do not fall within the exclusionary scope
    of Rule 407 even if they occurred after the manufacture or design
    of the product. See Chase v. General Motors Corp., 856 F.2d 17, 21-
    22 (4th Cir. 1988).
      Second, Rule 407 has been amended to provide that evidence of
    subsequent remedial measures may not be used to prove "a defect in
    a product or its design, or that a warning or instruction should
    have accompanied a product." This amendment adopts the view of a
    majority of the circuits that have interpreted Rule 407 to apply to
    products liability actions. See Raymond v. Raymond Corp., 938 F.2d
    1518, 1522 (1st Cir. 1991); In re Joint Eastern District and
    Southern District Asbestos Litigation v. Armstrong World
    Industries, Inc., 995 F.2d 343 (2d Cir. 1993); Cann v. Ford Motor
    Co., 658 F.2d 54, 60 (2d Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 960
    (1982); Kelly v. Crown Equipment Co., 970 F.2d 1273, 1275 (3d Cir.

    1980); Flaminio v. Honda Motor Company, Ltd., 733 F.2d 463, 469
    (7th Cir. 1984); Gauthier v. AMF, Inc., 788 F.2d 634, 636-37 (9th
    Cir. 1986).
      Although this amendment adopts a uniform federal rule, it should
    be noted that evidence of subsequent remedial measures may be
    admissible pursuant to the second sentence of Rule 407. Evidence of
    subsequent measures that is not barred by Rule 407 may still be
    subject to exclusion on Rule 403 grounds when the dangers of
    prejudice or confusion substantially outweigh the probative value
    of the evidence.
      GAP Report on Rule 407. The words "injury or harm" were
    substituted for the word "event" in line 3. The stylization changes
    in the second sentence of the rule were eliminated. The words
    "causing 'injury or harm' " were added to the Committee Note.

    on behalf of any party, when offered to prove liability for,
    invalidity of, or amount of a claim that was disputed as to
    validity or amount, or to impeach through a prior inconsistent
    statement or contradiction:
        (1) furnishing or offering or promising to furnish - or
      accepting or offering or promising to accept - a valuable
      consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise the
      claim; and
        (2) conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations
      regarding the claim, except when offered in a criminal case and
      the negotiations related to a claim by a public office or agency
      in the exercise of regulatory, investigative, or enforcement
      authority.

      (b) Permitted Uses. This rule does not require exclusion if the
    evidence is offered for purposes not prohibited by subdivision (a).
    Examples of permissible purposes include proving a witness's bias
    or prejudice; negating a contention of undue delay; and proving an
    effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution.

      As a matter of general agreement, evidence of an offer-to

    of, as the case may be, the validity or invalidity of the claim. As
    with evidence of subsequent remedial measures, dealt with in Rule
    407, exclusion may be based on two grounds. (1) The evidence is
    irrelevant, since the offer may be motivated by a desire for peace
    rather than from any concession of weakness of position. The
    validity of this position will vary as the amount of the offer
    varies in relation to the size of the claim and may also be
    influenced by other circumstances. (2) a more consistently
    impressive ground is promotion of the public policy favoring the
    compromise and settlement of disputes. McCormick Secs. 76, 251.
    While the rule is ordinarily phrased in terms of offers of
    compromise, it is apparent that a similar attitude must be taken
    with respect to completed compromises when offered against a party
    thereto. This latter situation will not, of course, ordinarily
    occur except when a party to the present litigation has compromised
    with a third person.
      The same policy underlies the provision of Rule 68 of the Federal
    Rules of Civil Procedure that evidence of an unaccepted offer of
    judgment is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine
    costs.
      The practical value of the common law rule has been greatly
    diminished by its inapplicability to admissions of fact, even
    though made in the course of compromise negotiations, unless
    hypothetical, stated to be "without prejudice," or so connected
    with the offer as to be inseparable from it. McCormick Sec. 251,
    pp. 540-541. An inevitable effect is to inhibit freedom of
    communication with respect to compromise, even among lawyers.
    Another effect is the generation of controversy over whether a
    given statement falls within or without the protected area. These
    considerations account for the expansion of the rule herewith to
    include evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise
    negotiations, as well as the offer or completed compromise itself.
    For similar provisions see California Evidence Code Secs. 1152,
    1154.
      The policy considerations which underlie the rule do not come
    into play when the effort is to induce a creditor to settle an
    admittedly due amount for a lessor sum. McCormick Sec. 251, p. 540.
    Hence the rule requires that the claim be disputed as to either
    validity or amount.
      The final sentence of the rule serves to point out some
    limitations upon its applicability. Since the rule excludes only
    when the purpose is proving the validity or invalidity of the claim
    or its amount, an offer for another purpose is not within the rule.
    The illustrative situations mentioned in the rule are supported by
    the authorities. As to proving bias or prejudice of a witness, see
    Annot., 161 A.L.R. 395, contra, Fenberg v. Rosenthal, 348 Ill. App.
    510, 109 N.E.2d 402 (1952), and negativing a contention of lack of
    due diligence in presenting a claim, 4 Wigmore Sec. 1061. An effort
    to "buy off" the prosecution or a prosecuting witness in a criminal
    case is not within the policy of the rule of exclusion. McCormick
    Sec. 251, p. 542.
      For other rules of similar import, see Uniform Rules 52 and 53;
    California Evidence Code Sec. 1152, 1154; Kansas Code of Civil
    Procedure Secs. 60-452, 60-453; New Jersey Evidence Rules 52 and
    53.

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      Under existing federal law evidence of conduct and statements
    made in compromise negotiations is admissible in subsequent
    litigation between the parties. The second sentence of Rule 408 as
    submitted by the Supreme Court proposed to reverse that doctrine in
    the interest of further promoting non-judicial settlement of
    disputes. Some agencies of government expressed the view that the
    Court formulation was likely to impede rather than assist efforts
    to achieve settlement of disputes. For one thing, it is not always
    easy to tell when compromise negotiations begin, and informal
    dealings end. Also, parties dealing with government agencies would
    be reluctant to furnish factual information at preliminary
    meetings; they would wait until "compromise negotiations" began and
    thus hopefully effect an immunity for themselves with respect to
    the evidence supplied. In light of these considerations, the
    Committee recast the Rule so that admissions of liability or
    opinions given during compromise negotiations continue
    inadmissible, but evidence of unqualified factual assertions is
    admissible. The latter aspect of the Rule is drafted, however, so
    as to preserve other possible objections to the introduction of
    such evidence. The Committee intends no modification of current law
    whereby a party may protect himself from future use of his
    statements by couching them in hypothetical conditional form.

      NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, SENATE REPORT NO. 93-1277  
      This rule as reported makes evidence of settlement or attempted
    settlement of a disputed claim inadmissible when offered as an
    admission of liability or the amount of liability. The purpose of
    this rule is to encourage settlements which would be discouraged if
    such evidence were admissible.
      Under present law, in most jurisdictions, statements of fact made
    during settlement negotiations, however, are excepted from this ban
    and are admissible. The only escape from admissibility of
    statements of fact made in a settlement negotiation is if the
    declarant or his representative expressly states that the statement
    is hypothetical in nature or is made without prejudice. Rule 408 as
    submitted by the Court reversed the traditional rule. It would have
    brought statements of fact within the ban and made them, as well as
    an offer of settlement, inadmissible.
      The House amended the rule and would continue to make evidence of
    facts disclosed during compromise negotiations admissible. It thus
    reverted to the traditional rule. The House committee report states
    that the committee intends to preserve current law under which a
    party may protect himself by couching his statements in
    hypothetical form [See House Report No. 93-650 above]. The real
    impact of this amendment, however, is to deprive the rule of much
    of its salutary effect. The exception for factual admissions was
    believed by the Advisory Committee to hamper free communication
    between parties and thus to constitute an unjustifiable restraint
    upon efforts to negotiate settlements - the encouragement of which
    is the purpose of the rule. Further, by protecting hypothetically
    phrased statements, it constituted a preference for the
    sophisticated, and a trap for the unwary.
      Three States which had adopted rules of evidence patterned after
    the proposed rules prescribed by the Supreme Court opted for
    versions of rule 408 identical with the Supreme Court draft with
    respect to the inadmissibility of conduct or statements made in
    compromise negotiations. [Nev. Rev. Stats. Sec. 48.105; N. Mex.
    Stats. Anno. (1973 Supp.) Sec. 20-4-408; West's Wis. Stats. Anno.
    (1973 Supp.) Sec. 904.08].
      For these reasons, the committee has deleted the House amendment
    and restored the rule to the version submitted by the Supreme Court
    with one additional amendment. This amendment adds a sentence to
    insure that evidence, such as documents, is not rendered
    inadmissible merely because it is presented in the course of
    compromise negotiations if the evidence is otherwise discoverable.
    A party should not be able to immunize from admissibility documents
    otherwise discoverable merely by offering them in a compromise
    negotiation.

          NOTES OF CONFERENCE COMMITTEE, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-1597      
      The House bill provides that evidence of admissions of liability
    or opinions given during compromise negotiations is not admissible,
    but that evidence of facts disclosed during compromise negotiations
    is not inadmissible by virtue of having been first disclosed in the
    compromise negotiations. The Senate amendment provides that
    evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations
    is not admissible. The Senate amendment also provides that the rule
    does not require the exclusion of any evidence otherwise
    discoverable merely because it is presented in the course of
    compromise negotiations.
      The House bill was drafted to meet the objection of executive
    agencies that under the rule as proposed by the Supreme Court, a
    party could present a fact during compromise negotiations and
    thereby prevent an opposing party from offering evidence of that
    fact at trial even though such evidence was obtained from
    independent sources. The Senate amendment expressly precludes this
    result.
      The Conference adopts the Senate amendment.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 408 has been amended to settle some questions in the courts
    about the scope of the Rule, and to make it easier to read. First,
    the amendment provides that Rule 408 does not prohibit the
    introduction in a criminal case of statements or conduct during
    compromise negotiations regarding a civil dispute by a government
    regulatory, investigative, or enforcement agency. See, e.g., United
    States v. Prewitt, 34 F.3d 436, 439 (7th Cir. 1994) (admissions of
    fault made in compromise of a civil securities enforcement action
    were admissible against the accused in a subsequent criminal action
    for mail fraud). Where an individual makes a statement in the
    presence of government agents, its subsequent admission in a
    criminal case should not be unexpected. The individual can seek to
    protect against subsequent disclosure through negotiation and
    agreement with the civil regulator or an attorney for the
    government.
      Statements made in compromise negotiations of a claim by a
    government agency may be excluded in criminal cases where the
    circumstances so warrant under Rule 403. For example, if an
    individual was unrepresented at the time the statement was made in
    a civil enforcement proceeding, its probative value in a subsequent
    criminal case may be minimal. But there is no absolute exclusion
    imposed by Rule 408.
      In contrast, statements made during compromise negotiations of
    other disputed claims are not admissible in subsequent criminal
    litigation, when offered to prove liability for, invalidity of, or
    amount of those claims. When private parties enter into compromise
    negotiations they cannot protect against the subsequent use of
    statements in criminal cases by way of private ordering. The
    inability to guarantee protection against subsequent use could lead
    to parties refusing to admit fault, even if by doing so they could
    favorably settle the private matter. Such a chill on settlement
    negotiations would be contrary to the policy of Rule 408.
      The amendment distinguishes statements and conduct (such as a
    direct admission of fault) made in compromise negotiations of a
    civil claim by a government agency from an offer or acceptance of a
    compromise of such a claim. An offer or acceptance of a compromise
    of any civil claim is excluded under the Rule if offered against
    the defendant as an admission of fault. In that case, the predicate
    for the evidence would be that the defendant, by compromising with
    the government agency, has admitted the validity and amount of the
    civil claim, and that this admission has sufficient probative value
    to be considered as evidence of guilt. But unlike a direct
    statement of fault, an offer or acceptance of a compromise is not
    very probative of the defendant's guilt. Moreover, admitting such
    an offer or acceptance could deter a defendant from settling a
    civil regulatory action, for fear of evidentiary use in a
    subsequent criminal action. See, e.g., Fishman, Jones on Evidence,
    Civil and Criminal, Sec. 22:16 at 199, n.83 (7th ed. 2000) ("A
    target of a potential criminal investigation may be unwilling to
    settle civil claims against him if by doing so he increases the
    risk of prosecution and conviction.").
      The amendment retains the language of the original rule that bars
    compromise evidence only when offered as evidence of the
    "validity," "invalidity," or "amount" of the disputed claim. The
    intent is to retain the extensive case law finding Rule 408
    inapplicable when compromise evidence is offered for a purpose
    other than to prove the validity, invalidity, or amount of a
    disputed claim. See, e.g., Athey v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, 234 F.3d
    357 (8th Cir. 2000) (evidence of settlement offer by insurer was
    properly admitted to prove insurer's bad faith); Coakley & Williams
    v. Structural Concrete Equip., 973 F.2d 349 (4th Cir. 1992)
    (evidence of settlement is not precluded by Rule 408 where offered
    to prove a party's intent with respect to the scope of a release);
    Cates v. Morgan Portable Bldg. Corp., 708 F.2d 683 (7th Cir. 1985)
    (Rule 408 does not bar evidence of a settlement when offered to
    prove a breach of the settlement agreement, as the purpose of the
    evidence is to prove the fact of settlement as opposed to the
    validity or amount of the underlying claim); Uforma/Shelby Bus.
    Forms, Inc. v. NLRB, 111 F.3d 1284 (6th Cir. 1997) (threats made in
    settlement negotiations were admissible; Rule 408 is inapplicable
    when the claim is based upon a wrong that is committed during the
    course of settlement negotiations). So for example, Rule 408 is
    inapplicable if offered to show that a party made fraudulent
    statements in order to settle a litigation.
      The amendment does not affect the case law providing that Rule
    408 is inapplicable when evidence of the compromise is offered to
    prove notice. See, e.g., United States v. Austin, 54 F.3d 394 (7th
    Cir. 1995) (no error to admit evidence of the defendant's
    settlement with the FTC, because it was offered to prove that the
    defendant was on notice that subsequent similar conduct was
    wrongful); Spell v. McDaniel, 824 F.2d 1380 (4th Cir. 1987) (in a
    civil rights action alleging that an officer used excessive force,
    a prior settlement by the City of another brutality claim was
    properly admitted to prove that the City was on notice of
    aggressive behavior by police officers).
      The amendment prohibits the use of statements made in settlement
    negotiations when offered to impeach by prior inconsistent
    statement or through contradiction. Such broad impeachment would
    tend to swallow the exclusionary rule and would impair the public
    policy of promoting settlements. See McCormick on Evidence at 186
    (5th ed. 1999) ("Use of statements made in compromise negotiations
    to impeach the testimony of a party, which is not specifically
    treated in Rule 408, is fraught with danger of misuse of the
    statements to prove liability, threatens frank interchange of
    information during negotiations, and generally should not be
    permitted."). See also EEOC v. Gear Petroleum, Inc., 948 F.2d 1542
    (10th Cir. 1991) (letter sent as part of settlement negotiation
    cannot be used to impeach defense witnesses by way of contradiction
    or prior inconsistent statement; such broad impeachment would
    undermine the policy of encouraging uninhibited settlement
    negotiations).
      The amendment makes clear that Rule 408 excludes compromise
    evidence even when a party seeks to admit its own settlement offer
    or statements made in settlement negotiations. If a party were to
    reveal its own statement or offer, this could itself reveal the
    fact that the adversary entered into settlement negotiations. The
    protections of Rule 408 cannot be waived unilaterally because the
    Rule, by definition, protects both parties from having the fact of
    negotiation disclosed to the jury. Moreover, proof of statements
    and offers made in settlement would often have to be made through
    the testimony of attorneys, leading to the risks and costs of
    disqualification. See generally Pierce v. F.R. Tripler & Co., 955
    F.2d 820, 828 (2d Cir. 1992) (settlement offers are excluded under
    Rule 408 even if it is the offeror who seeks to admit them; noting
    that the "widespread admissibility of the substance of settlement
    offers could bring with it a rash of motions for disqualification
    of a party's chosen counsel who would likely become a witness at
    trial").
      The sentence of the Rule referring to evidence "otherwise
    discoverable" has been deleted as superfluous. See, e.g., Advisory
    Committee Note to Maine Rule of Evidence 408 (refusing to include
    the sentence in the Maine version of Rule 408 and noting that the
    sentence "seems to state what the law would be if it were
    omitted"); Advisory Committee Note to Wyoming Rule of Evidence 408
    (refusing to include the sentence in Wyoming Rule 408 on the ground
    that it was "superfluous"). The intent of the sentence was to
    prevent a party from trying to immunize admissible information,
    such as a pre-existing document, through the pretense of disclosing
    it during compromise negotiations. See Ramada Development Co. v.
    Rauch, 644 F.2d 1097 (5th Cir. 1981). But even without the
    sentence, the Rule cannot be read to protect pre-existing
    information simply because it was presented to the adversary in
    compromise negotiations.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. In response to
    public comment, the proposed amendment was changed to provide that
    statements and conduct during settlement negotiations are to be
    admissible in subsequent criminal litigation only when made during
    settlement discussions of a claim brought by a government
    regulatory agency. Stylistic changes were made in accordance with
    suggestions from the Style Subcommittee of the Standing Committee.
    The Committee Note was altered to accord with the change in the
    text, and also to clarify that fraudulent statements made during
    settlement negotiations are not protected by the Rule.

      The considerations underlying this rule parallel those underlying
    Rules 407 and 408, which deal respectively with subsequent remedial
    measures and offers of compromise. As stated in Annot., 20 A.L.R.2d
    291, 293:
      "[G]enerally, evidence of payment of medical, hospital, or
    similar expenses of an injured party by the opposing party, is not
    admissible, the reason often given being that such payment or offer
    is usually made from humane impulses and not from an admission of
    liability, and that to hold otherwise would tend to discourage
    assistance to the injured person."
      Contrary to Rule 408, dealing with offers of compromise, the
    present rule does not extend to conduct or statements not a part of
    the act of furnishing or offering or promising to pay. This
    difference in treatment arises from fundamental differences in
    nature. Communication is essential if compromises are to be
    effected, and consequently broad protection of statements is
    needed. This is not so in cases of payments or offers or promises
    to pay medical expenses, where factual statements may be expected
    to be incidental in nature.
      For rules on the same subject, but phrased in terms of
    "humanitarian motives," see Uniform Rule 52; California Evidence

      Statements

-STATUTE-
      Except as otherwise provided in this rule, evidence of the
    following is not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, admissible
    against the defendant who made the plea or was a participant in the
    plea discussions:
        (1) a plea of guilty which was later withdrawn;
        (2) a plea of nolo contendere;
        (3) any statement made in the course of any proceedings under
      Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or comparable
      state procedure regarding either of the foregoing pleas; or
        (4) any statement made in the course of plea discussions with
      an attorney for the prosecuting authority which do not result in
      a plea of guilty or which result in a plea of guilty later
      withdrawn.

    However, such a statement is admissible (i) in any proceeding
    wherein another statement made in the course of the same plea or
    plea discussions has been introduced and the statement ought in
    fairness be considered contemporaneously with it, or (ii) in a
    criminal proceeding for perjury or false statement if the statement
    was made by the defendant under oath, on the record and in the
    presence of counsel.

               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      Withdrawn pleas of guilty were held inadmissible in federal
    prosecutions in Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220, 47 S.Ct.
    582, 71 L.Ed. 1009 (1927). The Court pointed out that to admit the
    withdrawn plea would effectively set at naught the allowance of
    withdrawal and place the accused in a dilemma utterly inconsistent
    with the decision to award him a trial. The New York Court of
    Appeals, in People v. Spitaleri, 9 N.Y.2d 168, 212 N.Y.S.2d 53, 173
    N.E.2d 35 (1961), reexamined and overturned its earlier decisions
    which had allowed admission. In addition to the reasons set forth
    in Kercheval, which was quoted at length, the court pointed out
    that the effect of admitting the plea was to compel defendant to
    take the stand by way of explanation and to open the way for the
    prosecution to call the lawyer who had represented him at the time
    of entering the plea. State court decisions for and against
    admissibility are collected in Annot., 86 A.L.R.2d 326.
      Pleas of nolo contendere are recognized by Rule 11 of the Rules
    of Criminal Procedure, although the law of numerous States is to
    the contrary. The present rule gives effect to the principal
    traditional characteristic of the nolo plea, i.e., avoiding the
    admission of guilt which is inherent in pleas of guilty. This
    position is consistent with the construction of Section 5 of the
    Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 16(a), recognizing the inconclusive and
    compromise nature of judgments based on nolo pleas. General
    Electric Co. v. City of San Antonio, 334 F.2d 480 (5th Cir. 1964);
    Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., 323 F.2d 412
    (7th Cir. 1963), cert. denied 376 U.S. 939, 84 S.Ct. 794, 11
    L.Ed.2d 659; Armco Steel Corp. v. North Dakota, 376 F.2d 206 (8th
    Cir. 1967); City of Burbank v. General Electric Co., 329 F.2d 825
    (9th Cir. 1964). See also state court decisions in Annot., 18
    A.L.R.2d 1287, 1314.
      Exclusion of offers to plead guilty or nolo has as its purpose
    the promotion of disposition of criminal cases by compromise. As
    pointed out in McCormick Sec. 251, p. 543
      "Effective criminal law administration in many localities would
    hardly be possible if a large proportion of the charges were not
    disposed of by such compromises."
      See also People v. Hamilton, 60 Cal.2d 105, 32 Cal.Rptr. 4, 383
    P.2d 412 (1963), discussing legislation designed to achieve this
    result. As with compromise offers generally, Rule 408, free
    communication is needed, and security against having an offer of
    compromise or related statement admitted in evidence effectively
    encourages it.
      Limiting the exclusionary rule to use against the accused is
    consistent with the purpose of the rule, since the possibility of
    use for or against other persons will not impair the effectiveness
    of withdrawing pleas or the freedom of discussion which the rule is
    designed to foster. See A.B.A. Standards Relating to Pleas of
    Guilty Sec. 2.2 (1968). See also the narrower provisions of New
    Jersey Evidence Rule 52(2) and the unlimited exclusion provided in
    California Evidence Code Sec. 1153.

      The Committee added the phrase "Except as otherwise provided by
    Act of Congress" to Rule 410 as submitted by the Court in order to
    preserve particular congressional policy judgments as to the effect
    of a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere. See 15 U.S.C. 16(a). The

    statutes and statutes subsequently enacted.

    NOTES OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, SENATE REPORT NO. 93-1277
      As adopted by the House, rule 410 would make inadmissible pleas
    of guilty or nolo contendere subsequently withdrawn as well as
    offers to make such pleas. Such a rule is clearly justified as a
    means of encouraging pleading. However, the House rule would then
    go on to render inadmissible for any purpose statements made in
    connection with these pleas or offers as well.
      The committee finds this aspect of the House rule unjustified. Of
    course, in certain circumstances such statements should be
    excluded. If, for example, a plea is vitiated because of coercion,
    statements made in connection with the plea may also have been
    coerced and should be inadmissible on that basis. In other cases,
    however, voluntary statements of an accused made in court on the
    record, in connection with a plea, and determined by a court to be
    reliable should be admissible even though the plea is subsequently
    withdrawn. This is particularly true in those cases where, if the
    House rule were in effect, a defendant would be able to contradict
    his previous statements and thereby lie with impunity [See Harris
    v. New York, 401 U.S. 222 (1971)]. To prevent such an injustice,
    the rule has been modified to permit the use of such statements for
    the limited purposes of impeachment and in subsequent perjury or
    false statement prosecutions.

          NOTES OF CONFERENCE COMMITTEE, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-1597      
      The House bill provides that evidence of a guilty or nolo
    contendere plea, of an offer of either plea, or of statements made
    in connection with such pleas or offers of such pleas, is
    inadmissible in any civil or criminal action, case or proceeding
    against the person making such plea or offer. The Senate amendment
    makes the rule inapplicable to a voluntary and reliable statement
    made in court on the record where the statement is offered in a
    subsequent prosecution of the declarant for perjury or false
    statement.
      The issues raised by Rule 410 are also raised by proposed Rule
    11(e)(6) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure presently
    pending before Congress. This proposed rule, which deals with the
    admissibility of pleas of guilty or nolo contendere, offers to make
    such pleas, and statements made in connection with such pleas, was
    promulgated by the Supreme Court on April 22, 1974, and in the
    absence of congressional action will become effective on August 1,
    1975. The conferees intend to make no change in the presently-
    existing case law until that date, leaving the courts free to
    develop rules in this area on a case-by-case basis.
      The Conferees further determined that the issues presented by the
    use of guilty and nolo contendere pleas, offers of such pleas, and
    statements made in connection with such pleas or offers, can be
    explored in greater detail during Congressional consideration of
    Rule 11(e)(6) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The
    Conferees believe, therefore, that it is best to defer its
    effective date until August 1, 1975. The Conferees intend that Rule
    410 would be superseded by any subsequent Federal Rule of Criminal
    Procedure or Act of Congress with which it is inconsistent, if the
    Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure or Act of Congress takes effect
    or becomes law after the date of the enactment of the act
    establishing the rules of evidence.
      The conference adopts the Senate amendment with an amendment that
    expresses the above intentions.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1979 AMENDMENT       
      Present rule 410 conforms to rule 11(e)(6) of the Federal Rules
    of Criminal Procedure. A proposed amendment to rule 11(e)(6) would
    clarify the circumstances in which pleas, plea discussions and
    related statements are inadmissible in evidence; see Advisory
    Committee Note thereto. The amendment proposed above would make
    comparable changes in rule 410.

-STATUTE-
      Evidence that a person was or was not insured against liability
    is not admissible upon the issue whether the person acted
    negligently or otherwise wrongfully. This rule does not require the

    control, or bias or prejudice of a witness.

               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      The courts have with substantial unanimity rejected evidence of
    liability insurance for the purpose of proving fault, and absence
    of liability insurance as proof of lack of fault. At best the
    inference of fault from the fact of insurance coverage is a tenuous
    one, as is its converse. More important, no doubt, has been the
    feeling that knowledge of the presence or absence of liability
    insurance would induce juries to decide cases on improper grounds.

    broad terms so as to include contributory negligence or other fault
    of a plaintiff as well as fault of a defendant.
      The second sentence points out the limits of the rule, using well
    established illustrations. Id.

    Rule 412. Sex Offense Cases; Relevance of Alleged Victim's Past
      Sexual Behavior or Alleged Sexual Predisposition

-STATUTE-
      (a) Evidence Generally Inadmissible. The following evidence is
    not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding involving
    alleged sexual misconduct except as provided in subdivisions (b)
    and (c):
        (1) Evidence offered to prove that any alleged victim engaged
      in other sexual behavior.
        (2) Evidence offered to prove any alleged victim's sexual
      predisposition.

      (b) Exceptions.
        (1) In a criminal case, the following evidence is admissible,
      if otherwise admissible under these rules:
          (A) evidence of specific instances of sexual behavior by the
        alleged victim offered to prove that a person other than the
        accused was the source of semen, injury or other physical
        evidence;
          (B) evidence of specific instances of sexual behavior by the
        alleged victim with respect to the person accused of the sexual
        misconduct offered by the accused to prove consent or by the
        prosecution; and
          (C) evidence the exclusion of which would violate the
        constitutional rights of the defendant.

        (2) In a civil case, evidence offered to prove the sexual
      behavior or sexual predisposition of any alleged victim is
      admissible if it is otherwise admissible under these rules and
      its probative value substantially outweighs the danger of harm to
      any victim and of unfair prejudice to any party. Evidence of an
      alleged victim's reputation is admissible only if it has been
      placed in controversy by the alleged victim.

      (c) Procedure To Determine Admissibility.
        (1) A party intending to offer evidence under subdivision (b)
      must - 
          (A) file a written motion at least 14 days before trial
        specifically describing the evidence and stating the purpose
        for which it is offered unless the court, for good cause
        requires a different time for filing or permits filing during
        trial; and
          (B) serve the motion on all parties and notify the alleged
        victim or, when appropriate, the alleged victim's guardian or
        representative.

        (2) Before admitting evidence under this rule the court must
      conduct a hearing in camera and afford the victim and parties a
      right to attend and be heard. The motion, related papers, and the
      record of the hearing must be sealed and remain under seal unless
      the court orders otherwise.

-MISC1-
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 412 has been revised to diminish some of the confusion
    engendered by the original rule and to expand the protection
    afforded alleged victims of sexual misconduct. Rule 412 applies to
    both civil and criminal proceedings. The rule aims to safeguard the
    alleged victim against the invasion of privacy, potential
    embarrassment and sexual stereotyping that is associated with
    public disclosure of intimate sexual details and the infusion of
    sexual innuendo into the factfinding process. By affording victims
    protection in most instances, the rule also encourages victims of
    sexual misconduct to institute and to participate in legal
    proceedings against alleged offenders.
      Rule 412 seeks to achieve these objectives by barring evidence
    relating to the alleged victim's sexual behavior or alleged sexual
    predisposition, whether offered as substantive evidence or for
    impeachment, except in designated circumstances in which the
    probative value of the evidence significantly outweighs possible
    harm to the victim.
      The revised rule applies in all cases involving sexual misconduct
    without regard to whether the alleged victim or person accused is a
    party to the litigation. Rule 412 extends to "pattern" witnesses in
    both criminal and civil cases whose testimony about other instances
    of sexual misconduct by the person accused is otherwise admissible.
    When the case does not involve alleged sexual misconduct, evidence
    relating to a third-party witness' alleged sexual activities is not
    within the ambit of Rule 412. The witness will, however, be
    protected by other rules such as Rules 404 and 608, as well as Rule
    403.
      The terminology "alleged victim" is used because there will
    frequently be a factual dispute as to whether sexual misconduct
    occurred. It does not connote any requirement that the misconduct
    be alleged in the pleadings. Rule 412 does not, however, apply
    unless the person against whom the evidence is offered can
    reasonably be characterized as a "victim of alleged sexual
    misconduct." When this is not the case, as for instance in a
    defamation action involving statements concerning sexual misconduct
    in which the evidence is offered to show that the alleged
    defamatory statements were true or did not damage the plaintiff's
    reputation, neither Rule 404 nor this rule will operate to bar the
    evidence; Rule 401 and 403 will continue to control. Rule 412 will,
    however, apply in a Title VII action in which the plaintiff has
    alleged sexual harassment.
      The reference to a person "accused" is also used in a non-
    technical sense. There is no requirement that there be a criminal
    charge pending against the person or even that the misconduct would
    constitute a criminal offense. Evidence offered to prove allegedly
    false prior claims by the victim is not barred by Rule 412.
    However, this evidence is subject to the requirements of Rule 404.
      Subdivision (a). As amended, Rule 412 bars evidence offered to
    prove the victim's sexual behavior and alleged sexual
    predisposition. Evidence, which might otherwise be admissible under
    Rules 402, 404(b), 405, 607, 608, 609, or some other evidence rule,
    must be excluded if Rule 412 so requires. The word "other" is used
    to suggest some flexibility in admitting evidence "intrinsic" to
    the alleged sexual misconduct. Cf. Committee Note to 1991 amendment
    to Rule 404(b).
      Past sexual behavior connotes all activities that involve actual
    physical conduct, i.e. sexual intercourse and sexual contact, or
    that imply sexual intercourse or sexual contact. See, e.g., United
    States v. Galloway, 937 F.2d 542 (10th Cir. 1991), cert. denied,
    113 S.Ct. 418 (1992) (use of contraceptives inadmissible since use
    implies sexual activity); United States v. One Feather, 702 F.2d
    736 (8th Cir. 1983) (birth of an illegitimate child inadmissible);
    State v. Carmichael, 727 P.2d 918, 925 (Kan. 1986) (evidence of
    venereal disease inadmissible). In addition, the word "behavior"
    should be construed to include activities of the mind, such as
    fantasies or dreams. See 23 C. Wright & K. Graham, Jr., Federal
    Practice and Procedure, Sec. 5384 at p. 548 (1980) ("While there
    may be some doubt under statutes that require 'conduct,' it would
    seem that the language of Rule 412 is broad enough to encompass the
    behavior of the mind.").
      The rule has been amended to also exclude all other evidence
    relating to an alleged victim of sexual misconduct that is offered
    to prove a sexual predisposition. This amendment is designed to
    exclude evidence that does not directly refer to sexual activities
    or thoughts but that the proponent believes may have a sexual
    connotation for the factfinder. Admission of such evidence would
    contravene Rule 412's objectives of shielding the alleged victim
    from potential embarrassment and safeguarding the victim against
    stereotypical thinking. Consequently, unless the (b)(2) exception
    is satisfied, evidence such as that relating to the alleged
    victim's mode of dress, speech, or life-style will not be
    admissible.
      The introductory phrase in subdivision (a) was deleted because it
    lacked clarity and contained no explicit reference to the other
    provisions of law that were intended to be overridden. The
    conditional clause, "except as provided in subdivisions (b) and
    (c)" is intended to make clear that evidence of the types described
    in subdivision (a) is admissible only under the strictures of those
    sections.
      The reason for extending the rule to all criminal cases is
    obvious. The strong social policy of protecting a victim's privacy
    and encouraging victims to come forward to report criminal acts is
    not confined to cases that involve a charge of sexual assault. The
    need to protect the victim is equally great when a defendant is
    charged with kidnapping, and evidence is offered, either to prove
    motive or as background, that the defendant sexually assaulted the
    victim.
      The reason for extending Rule 412 to civil cases is equally
    obvious. The need to protect alleged victims against invasions of
    privacy, potential embarrassment, and unwarranted sexual
    stereotyping, and the wish to encourage victims to come forward
    when they have been sexually molested do not disappear because the
    context has shifted from a criminal prosecution to a claim for
    damages or injunctive relief. There is a strong social policy in
    not only punishing those who engage in sexual misconduct, but in
    also providing relief to the victim. Thus, Rule 412 applies in any
    civil case in which a person claims to be the victim of sexual
    misconduct, such as actions for sexual battery or sexual
    harassment.
      Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b) spells out the specific
    circumstances in which some evidence may be admissible that would
    otherwise be barred by the general rule expressed in subdivision
    (a). As amended, Rule 412 will be virtually unchanged in criminal
    cases, but will provide protection to any person alleged to be a
    victim of sexual misconduct regardless of the charge actually
    brought against an accused. A new exception has been added for
    civil cases.
      In a criminal case, evidence may be admitted under subdivision
    (b)(1) pursuant to three possible exceptions, provided the evidence
    also satisfies other requirements for admissibility specified in
    the Federal Rules of Evidence, including Rule 403. Subdivisions
    (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) require proof in the form of specific
    instances of sexual behavior in recognition of the limited
    probative value and dubious reliability of evidence of reputation
    or evidence in the form of an opinion.
      Under subdivision (b)(1)(A), evidence of specific instances of
    sexual behavior with persons other than the person whose sexual
    misconduct is alleged may be admissible if it is offered to prove
    that another person was the source of semen, injury or other
    physical evidence. Where the prosecution has directly or indirectly
    asserted that the physical evidence originated with the accused,
    the defendant must be afforded an opportunity to prove that another
    person was responsible. See United States v. Begay, 937 F.2d 515,
    523 n. 10 (10th Cir. 1991). Evidence offered for the specific
    purpose identified in this subdivision may still be excluded if it
    does not satisfy Rules 401 or 403. See, e.g., United States v.
    Azure, 845 F.2d 1503, 1505-06 (8th Cir. 1988) (10 year old victim's
    injuries indicated recent use of force; court excluded evidence of
    consensual sexual activities with witness who testified at in
    camera hearing that he had never hurt victim and failed to
    establish recent activities).
      Under the exception in subdivision (b)(1)(B), evidence of
    specific instances of sexual behavior with respect to the person
    whose sexual misconduct is alleged is admissible if offered to
    prove consent, or offered by the prosecution. Admissible pursuant
    to this exception might be evidence of prior instances of sexual
    activities between the alleged victim and the accused, as well as
    statements in which the alleged victim expressed an intent to
    engage in sexual intercourse with the accused, or voiced sexual
    fantasies involving the specific accused. In a prosection [sic] for
    child sexual abuse, for example, evidence of uncharged sexual
    activity between the accused and the alleged victim offered by the
    prosecution may be admissible pursuant to Rule 404(b) to show a
    pattern of behavior. Evidence relating to the victim's alleged
    sexual predisposition is not admissible pursuant to this exception.
      Under subdivision (b)(1)(C), evidence of specific instances of
    conduct may not be excluded if the result would be to deny a
    criminal defendant the protections afforded by the Constitution.
    For example, statements in which the victim has expressed an intent
    to have sex with the first person encountered on a particular
    occasion might not be excluded without violating the due process
    right of a rape defendant seeking to prove consent. Recognition of
    this basic principle was expressed in subdivision (b)(1) of the
    original rule. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that
    in various circumstances a defendant may have a right to introduce
    evidence otherwise precluded by an evidence rule under the
    Confrontation Clause. See, e.g., Olden v. Kentucky, 488 U.S. 227
    (1988) (defendant in rape cases had right to inquire into alleged
    victim's cohabitation with another man to show bias).
      Subdivision (b)(2) governs the admissibility of otherwise
    proscribed evidence in civil cases. It employs a balancing test
    rather than the specific exceptions stated in subdivision (b)(1) in
    recognition of the difficulty of foreseeing future developments in
    the law. Greater flexibility is needed to accommodate evolving
    causes of action such as claims for sexual harassment.
      The balancing test requires the proponent of the evidence,
    whether plaintiff or defendant, to convince the court that the
    probative value of the proffered evidence "substantially outweighs
    the danger of harm to any victim and of unfair prejudice of any
    party." This test for admitting evidence offered to prove sexual
    behavior or sexual propensity in civil cases differs in three
    respects from the general rule governing admissibility set forth in
    Rule 403. First, it reverses the usual procedure spelled out in
    Rule 403 by shifting the burden to the proponent to demonstrate
    admissibility rather than making the opponent justify exclusion of
    the evidence. Second, the standard expressed in subdivision (b)(2)
    is more stringent than in the original rule; it raises the
    threshold for admission by requiring that the probative value of
    the evidence substantially outweigh the specified dangers. Finally,
    the Rule 412 test puts "harm to the victim" on the scale in
    addition to prejudice to the parties.
      Evidence of reputation may be received in a civil case only if
    the alleged victim has put his or her reputation into controversy.
    The victim may do so without making a specific allegation in a
    pleading. Cf. Fed.R.Civ.P. 35(a).
      Subdivision (c). Amended subdivision (c) is more concise and
    understandable than the subdivision it replaces. The requirement of
    a motion before trial is continued in the amended rule, as is the
    provision that a late motion may be permitted for good cause shown.
    In deciding whether to permit late filing, the court may take into
    account the conditions previously included in the rule: namely
    whether the evidence is newly discovered and could not have been
    obtained earlier through the existence of due diligence, and
    whether the issue to which such evidence relates has newly arisen
    in the case. The rule recognizes that in some instances the
    circumstances that justify an application to introduce evidence
    otherwise barred by Rule 412 will not become apparent until trial.
      The amended rule provides that before admitting evidence that
    falls within the prohibition of Rule 412(a), the court must hold a
    hearing in camera at which the alleged victim and any party must be
    afforded the right to be present and an opportunity to be heard.
    All papers connected with the motion and any record of a hearing on
    the motion must be kept and remain under seal during the course of
    trial and appellate proceedings unless otherwise ordered. This is
    to assure that the privacy of the alleged victim is preserved in
    all cases in which the court rules that proffered evidence is not
    admissible, and in which the hearing refers to matters that are not
    received, or are received in another form.
      The procedures set forth in subdivision (c) do not apply to
    discovery of a victim's past sexual conduct or predisposition in
    civil cases, which will be continued to be governed by Fed.R.Civ.P.
    26. In order not to undermine the rationale of Rule 412, however,
    courts should enter appropriate orders pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P.
    26(c) to protect the victim against unwarranted inquiries and to
    ensure confidentiality. Courts should presumptively issue
    protective orders barring discovery unless the party seeking
    discovery makes a showing that the evidence sought to be discovered
    would be relevant under the facts and theories of the particular
    case, and cannot be obtained except through discovery. In an action
    for sexual harassment, for instance, while some evidence of the
    alleged victim's sexual behavior and/or predisposition in the
    workplace may perhaps be relevant, non-work place conduct will
    usually be irrelevant. Cf. Burns v. McGregor Electronic Industries,
    Inc., 989 F.2d 959, 962-63 (8th Cir. 1993) (posing for a nude
    magazine outside work hours is irrelevant to issue of unwelcomeness
    of sexual advances at work). Confidentiality orders should be
    presumptively granted as well.
      One substantive change made in subdivision (c) is the elimination
    of the following sentence: "Notwithstanding subdivision (b) of Rule
    104, if the relevancy of the evidence which the accused seeks to
    offer in the trial depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of
    fact, the court, at the hearing in chambers or at a subsequent
    hearing in chambers scheduled for such purpose, shall accept
    evidence on the issue of whether such condition of fact is
    fulfilled and shall determine such issue." On its face, this
    language would appear to authorize a trial judge to exclude
    evidence of past sexual conduct between an alleged victim and an
    accused or a defendant in a civil case based upon the judge's
    belief that such past acts did not occur. Such an authorization
    raises questions of invasion of the right to a jury trial under the
    Sixth and Seventh Amendments. See 1 S. Saltzburg & M. Martin,
    Federal Rules Of Evidence Manual, 396-97 (5th ed. 1990).
      The Advisory Committee concluded that the amended rule provided
    adequate protection for all persons claiming to be the victims of
    sexual misconduct, and that it was inadvisable to continue to
    include a provision in the rule that has been confusing and that
    raises substantial constitutional issues.
      [The Supreme Court withheld that portion of the proposed
    amendment to Rule 412 transmitted to the Court by the Judicial
    Conference of the United States which would apply that Rule to
    civil cases. This Note was not revised to account for the Court's
    action, because the Note is the commentary of the advisory
    committee. The proposed amendment to Rule 412 was subsequently
    amended by section 40141(b) of Pub. L. 103-322. See below.]

    for "such rape or assault".
      Subd. (b). Pub. L. 100-690, Sec. 7046(a)(2), (5), substituted "an
    offense under chapter 109A of title 18, United States Code" for
    "rape or of assault with intent to commit rape" in introductory
    provisions and "such offense" for "rape or assault" in subd.
    (b)(2)(B).
      Subds. (c)(1), (d). Pub. L. 100-690, Sec. 7046(a)(4), substituted

-MISC1-
       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      Article V as submitted to Congress contained thirteen Rules. Nine
    of those Rules defined specific non-constitutional privileges which
    the federal courts must recognize (i.e. required reports, lawyer-
    client, psychotherapist-patient, husband-wife, communications to
    clergymen, political vote, trade secrets, secrets of state and
    other official information, and identity of informer). Another Rule
    provided that only those privileges set forth in Article V or in
    some other Act of Congress could be recognized by the federal
    courts. The three remaining Rules addressed collateral problems as
    to waiver of privilege by voluntary disclosure, privileged matter
    disclosed under compulsion or without opportunity to claim
    privilege, comment upon or inference from a claim of privilege, and
    jury instruction with regard thereto.
      The Committee amended Article V to eliminate all of the Court's
    specific Rules on privileges. Instead, the Committee, through a
    single Rule, 501, left the law of privileges in its present state
    and further provided that privileges shall continue to be developed
    by the courts of the United States under a uniform standard
    applicable both in civil and criminal cases. That standard, derived
    from Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, mandates
    the application of the principles of the common law as interpreted
    by the Courts of the United States in the light of reason and
    experience. The words "person, government, State, or political
    subdivision thereof" were added by the Committee to the lone term
    "witness" used in Rule 26 to make clear that, as under present law,
    not only witnesses may have privileges. The Committee also included
    in its amendment a proviso modeled after Rule 302 and similar to
    language added by the Committee to Rule 601 relating to the
    competency of witnesses. The proviso is designed to require the
    application of State privilege law in civil actions and proceedings
    governed by Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), a result
    in accord with current federal court decisions. See Republic Gear
    Co. v. Borg-Warner Corp., 381 F.2d 551, 555-556 n.2 (2nd Cir.
    1967). The Committee deemed the proviso to be necessary in the
    light of the Advisory Committee's view (see its note to Court
    [proposed] Rule 501) that this result is not mandated under Erie.
      The rationale underlying the proviso is that federal law should
    not supersede that of the States in substantive areas such as
    privilege absent a compelling reason. The Committee believes that
    in civil cases in the federal courts where an element of a claim or
    defense is not grounded upon a federal question, there is no
    federal interest strong enough to justify departure from State
    policy. In addition, the Committee considered that the Court's
    proposed Article V would have promoted forum shopping in some civil
    actions, depending upon differences in the privilege law applied as
    among the State and federal courts. The Committee's proviso, on the
    other hand, under which the federal courts are bound to apply the
    State's privilege law in actions founded upon a State-created right
    or defense removes the incentive to "shop".

      NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, SENATE REPORT NO. 93-1277  
      Article V as submitted to Congress contained 13 rules. Nine of
    those rules defined specific nonconstitutional privileges which the
    Federal courts must recognize (i.e., required reports, lawyer-
    client, psychotherapist-patient, husband-wife, communications to
    clergymen, political vote, trade secrets, secrets of state and
    other official information, and identity of informer). Many of
    these rules contained controversial modifications or restrictions
    upon common law privileges. As noted supra, the House amended
    article V to eliminate all of the Court's specific rules on
    privileges. Through a single rule, 501, the House provided that
    privileges shall be governed by the principles of the common law as
    interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of
    reason and experience (a standard derived from rule 26 of the
    Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure) except in the case of an
    element of a civil claim or defense as to which State law supplies
    the rule of decision, in which event state privilege law was to
    govern.
      The committee agrees with the main thrust of the House amendment:
    that a federally developed common law based on modern reason and
    experience shall apply except where the State nature of the issues
    renders deference to State privilege law the wiser course, as in
    the usual diversity case. The committee understands that thrust of
    the House amendment to require that State privilege law be applied
    in "diversity" cases (actions on questions of State law between
    citizens of different States arising under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332).
    The language of the House amendment, however, goes beyond this in
    some respects, and falls short of it in others: State privilege law
    applies even in nondiversity. Federal question civil cases, where
    an issue governed by State substantive law is the object of the
    evidence (such issues do sometimes arise in such cases); and, in
    all instances where State privilege law is to be applied, e.g., on
    proof of a State issue in a diversity case, a close reading reveals
    that State privilege law is not to be applied unless the matter to
    be proved is an element of that state claim or defense, as
    distinguished from a step along the way in the proof of it.
      The committee is concerned that the language used in the House
    amendment could be difficult to apply. It provides that "in civil
    actions * * * with respect to an element of a claim or defense as
    to which State law supplies the rule of decision," State law on
    privilege applies. The question of what is an element of a claim or
    defense is likely to engender considerable litigation. If the
    matter in question constitutes an element of a claim, State law
    supplies the privilege rule; whereas if it is a mere item of proof
    with respect to a claim, then, even though State law might supply
    the rule of decision, Federal law on the privilege would apply.
    Further, disputes will arise as to how the rule should be applied
    in an antitrust action or in a tax case where the Federal statute
    is silent as to a particular aspect of the substantive law in
    question, but Federal cases had incorporated State law by reference
    to State law. [For a discussion of reference to State substantive
    law, see note on Federal Incorporation by Reference of State Law,
    Hart & Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System, pp. 491-
    494 (2d ed. 1973).] Is a claim (or defense) based on such a
    reference a claim or defense as to which federal or State law
    supplies the rule of decision?
      Another problem not entirely avoidable is the complexity or
    difficulty the rule introduces into the trial of a Federal case
    containing a combination of Federal and State claims and defenses,
    e.g. an action involving Federal antitrust and State unfair
    competition claims. Two different bodies of privilege law would
    need to be consulted. It may even develop that the same witness-
    testimony might be relevant on both counts and privileged as to
    one but not the other. [The problems with the House formulation are
    discussed in Rothstein, The Proposed Amendments to the Federal
    Rules of Evidence, 62 Georgetown University Law Journal 125 (1973)
    at notes 25, 26 and 70-74 and accompanying text.]
      The formulation adopted by the House is pregnant with litigious
    mischief. The committee has, therefore, adopted what we believe
    will be a clearer and more practical guideline for determining when
    courts should respect State rules of privilege. Basically, it
    provides that in criminal and Federal question civil cases,
    federally evolved rules on privilege should apply since it is
    Federal policy which is being enforced. [It is also intended that
    the Federal law of privileges should be applied with respect to
    pendant State law claims when they arise in a Federal question
    case.] Conversely, in diversity cases where the litigation in
    question turns on a substantive question of State law, and is
    brought in the Federal courts because the parties reside in
    different States, the committee believes it is clear that State
    rules of privilege should apply unless the proof is directed at a
    claim or defense for which Federal law supplies the rule of
    decision (a situation which would not commonly arise.) [While such
    a situation might require use of two bodies of privilege law,
    federal and state, in the same case, nevertheless the occasions on
    which this would be required are considerably reduced as compared
    with the House version, and confined to situations where the
    Federal and State interests are such as to justify application of
    neither privilege law to the case as a whole. If the rule proposed
    here results in two conflicting bodies of privilege law applying to
    the same piece of evidence in the same case, it is contemplated
    that the rule favoring reception of the evidence should be applied.
    This policy is based on the present rule 43(a) of the Federal Rules
    of Civil Procedure which provides:
    In any case, the statute or rule which favors the reception of the
    evidence governs and the evidence shall be presented according to
    the most convenient method prescribed in any of the statutes or
    rules to which reference is herein made.] It is intended that the
    State rules of privilege should apply equally in original diversity
    actions and diversity actions removed under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1441(b).
      Two other comments on the privilege rule should be made. The
    committee has received a considerable volume of correspondence from
    psychiatric organizations and psychiatrists concerning the deletion
    of rule 504 of the rule submitted by the Supreme Court. It should
    be clearly understood that, in approving this general rule as to
    privileges, the action of Congress should not be understood as
    disapproving any recognition of a psychiatrist-patient, or husband-
    wife, or any other of the enumerated privileges contained in the
    Supreme Court rules. Rather, our action should be understood as
    reflecting the view that the recognition of a privilege based on a
    confidential relationship and other privileges should be determined
    on a case-by-case basis.
      Further, we would understand that the prohibition against spouses
    testifying against each other is considered a rule of privilege and
    covered by this rule and not by rule 601 of the competency of
    witnesses.

          NOTES OF CONFERENCE COMMITTEE, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-1597      
      Rule 501 deals with the privilege of a witness not to testify.
    Both the House and Senate bills provide that federal privilege law
    applies in criminal cases. In civil actions and proceedings, the
    House bill provides that state privilege law applies "to an element
    of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of
    decision." The Senate bill provides that "in civil actions and
    proceedings arising under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332 or 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    1335, or between citizens of different States and removed under 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 1441(b) the privilege of a witness, person, government,
    State or political subdivision thereof is determined in accordance
    with State law, unless with respect to the particular claim or
    defense, Federal law supplies the rule of decision."
      The wording of the House and Senate bills differs in the
    treatment of civil actions and proceedings. The rule in the House
    bill applies to evidence that relates to "an element of a claim or
    defense." If an item of proof tends to support or defeat a claim or
    defense, or an element of a claim or defense, and if state law
    supplies the rule of decision for that claim or defense, then state
    privilege law applies to that item of proof.
      Under the provision in the House bill, therefore, state privilege
    law will usually apply in diversity cases. There may be diversity
    cases, however, where a claim or defense is based upon federal law.
    In such instances, Federal privilege law will apply to evidence
    relevant to the federal claim or defense. See Sola Electric Co. v.
    Jefferson Electric Co., 317 U.S. 173 (1942).
      In nondiversity jurisdiction civil cases, federal privilege law
    will generally apply. In those situations where a federal court
    adopts or incorporates state law to fill interstices or gaps in
    federal statutory phrases, the court generally will apply federal
    privilege law. As Justice Jackson has said:
      A federal court sitting in a non-diversity case such as this does
    not sit as a local tribunal. In some cases it may see fit for
    special reasons to give the law of a particular state highly
    persuasive or even controlling effect, but in the last analysis its
    decision turns upon the law of the United States, not that of any
    state.
    D'Oench, Duhme & Co. v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 315 U.S.
    447, 471 (1942) (Jackson, J., concurring). When a federal court
    chooses to absorb state law, it is applying the state law as a
    matter of federal common law. Thus, state law does not supply the
    rule of decision (even though the federal court may apply a rule
    derived from state decisions), and state privilege law would not
    apply. See C. A. Wright, Federal Courts 251-252 (2d ed. 1970);
    Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U.S. 392 (1946); DeSylva v. Ballentine,
    351 U.S. 570, 581 (1956); 9 Wright & Miller, Federal Rules and
    Procedure Sec. 2408.
      In civil actions and proceedings, where the rule of decision as
    to a claim or defense or as to an element of a claim or defense is
    supplied by state law, the House provision requires that state
    privilege law apply.
      The Conference adopts the House provision.

    FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE
    ARTICLE V. PRIVILEGES

-HEAD-
    Rule 502. Attorney-Client Privilege and Work Product; Limitations
      on Waiver

-STATUTE-
      The following provisions apply, in the circumstances set out, to
    disclosure of a communication or information covered by the
    attorney-client privilege or work-product protection.
      (a) Disclosure Made in a Federal Proceeding or to a Federal
    Office or Agency; Scope of a Waiver. - When the disclosure is made
    in a Federal proceeding or to a Federal office or agency and waives
    the attorney-client privilege or work-product protection, the
    waiver extends to an undisclosed communication or information in a
    Federal or State proceeding only if:
        (1) the waiver is intentional;
        (2) the disclosed and undisclosed communications or information
      concern the same subject matter; and
        (3) they ought in fairness to be considered together.

      (b) Inadvertent Disclosure. - When made in a Federal proceeding
    or to a Federal office or agency, the disclosure does not operate
    as a waiver in a Federal or State proceeding if:
        (1) the disclosure is inadvertent;
        (2) the holder of the privilege or protection took reasonable
      steps to prevent disclosure; and
        (3) the holder promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the
      error, including (if applicable) following Federal Rule of Civil
      Procedure 26(b)(5)(B).

      (c) Disclosure Made in a State Proceeding. - When the disclosure
    is made in a State proceeding and is not the subject of a State-
    court order concerning waiver, the disclosure does not operate as
    a waiver in a Federal proceeding if the disclosure:
        (1) would not be a waiver under this rule if it had been made
      in a Federal proceeding; or
        (2) is not a waiver under the law of the State where the
      disclosure occurred.

      (d) Controlling Effect of a Court Order. - A Federal court may
    order that the privilege or protection is not waived by disclosure
    connected with the litigation pending before the court - in which
    event the disclosure is also not a waiver in any other Federal or
    State proceeding.
      (e) Controlling Effect of a Party Agreement. - An agreement on
    the effect of disclosure in a Federal proceeding is binding only on
    the parties to the agreement, unless it is incorporated into a
    court order.
      (f) Controlling Effect of This Rule. - Notwithstanding Rules 101
    and 1101, this rule applies to State proceedings and to Federal
    court-annexed and Federal court-mandated arbitration proceedings,
    in the circumstances set out in the rule. And notwithstanding Rule
    501, this rule applies even if State law provides the rule of
    decision.
      (g) Definitions. - In this rule:
        (1) "attorney-client privilege" means the protection that
      applicable law provides for confidential attorney-client
      communications; and
        (2) "work-product protection" means the protection that
      applicable law provides for tangible material (or its intangible
      equivalent) prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.

-MISC1-
                   EXPLANATORY NOTE ON EVIDENCE RULE 502               
      The following explanatory note was prepared by the Judicial
    Conference Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules, revised Nov. 28,
    2007:
      This new rule has two major purposes:
      1) It resolves some longstanding disputes in the courts about the
    effect of certain disclosures of communications or information
    protected by the attorney-client privilege or as work product -
    specifically those disputes involving inadvertent disclosure and
    subject matter waiver.
      2) It responds to the widespread complaint that litigation costs
    necessary to protect against waiver of attorney-client privilege or
    work product have become prohibitive due to the concern that any
    disclosure (however innocent or minimal) will operate as a subject
    matter waiver of all protected communications or information. This
    concern is especially troubling in cases involving electronic
    discovery. See, e.g., Hopson v. City of Baltimore, 232 F.R.D. 228,
    244 (D.Md. 2005) (electronic discovery may encompass "millions of
    documents" and to insist upon "record-by-record pre-production
    privilege review, on pain of subject matter waiver, would impose
    upon parties costs of production that bear no proportionality to
    what is at stake in the litigation").
      The rule seeks to provide a predictable, uniform set of standards
    under which parties can determine the consequences of a disclosure
    of a communication or information covered by the attorney-client
    privilege or work-product protection. Parties to litigation need to
    know, for example, that if they exchange privileged information
    pursuant to a confidentiality order, the court's order will be
    enforceable. Moreover, if a federal court's confidentiality order
    is not enforceable in a state court then the burdensome costs of
    privilege review and retention are unlikely to be reduced.
      The rule makes no attempt to alter federal or state law on
    whether a communication or information is protected under the
    attorney-client privilege or work-product immunity as an initial
    matter. Moreover, while establishing some exceptions to waiver, the
    rule does not purport to supplant applicable waiver doctrine
    generally.
      The rule governs only certain waivers by disclosure. Other common-
    law waiver doctrines may result in a finding of waiver even where
    there is no disclosure of privileged information or work product.
    See, e.g., Nguyen v. Excel Corp., 197 F.3d 200 (5th Cir. 1999)
    (reliance on an advice of counsel defense waives the privilege with
    respect to attorney-client communications pertinent to that
    defense); Ryers v. Burleson, 100 F.R.D. 436 (D.D.C. 1983)
    (allegation of lawyer malpractice constituted a waiver of
    confidential communications under the circumstances). The rule is
    not intended to displace or modify federal common law concerning
    waiver of privilege or work product where no disclosure has been
    made.
      Subdivision (a). The rule provides that a voluntary disclosure in
    a federal proceeding or to a federal office or agency, if a waiver,
    generally results in a waiver only of the communication or
    information disclosed; a subject matter waiver (of either privilege
    or work product) is reserved for those unusual situations in which
    fairness requires a further disclosure of related, protected
    information, in order to prevent a selective and misleading
    presentation of evidence to the disadvantage of the adversary. See,
    e.g., In re United Mine Workers of America Employee Benefit Plans
    Litig., 159 F.R.D. 307, 312 (D.D.C. 1994) (waiver of work product
    limited to materials actually disclosed, because the party did not
    deliberately disclose documents in an attempt to gain a tactical
    advantage). Thus, subject matter waiver is limited to situations in
    which a party intentionally puts protected information into the
    litigation in a selective, misleading and unfair manner. It follows
    that an inadvertent disclosure of protected information can never
    result in a subject matter waiver. See Rule 502(b). The rule
    rejects the result in In re Sealed Case, 877 F.2d 976 (D.C.Cir.
    1989), which held that inadvertent disclosure of documents during
    discovery automatically constituted a subject matter waiver.
      The language concerning subject matter waiver - "ought in
    fairness" - is taken from Rule 106, because the animating principle
    is the same. Under both Rules, a party that makes a selective,
    misleading presentation that is unfair to the adversary opens
    itself to a more complete and accurate presentation.
      To assure protection and predictability, the rule provides that
    if a disclosure is made at the federal level, the federal rule on
    subject matter waiver governs subsequent state court determinations
    on the scope of the waiver by that disclosure.
      Subdivision (b). Courts are in conflict over whether an
    inadvertent disclosure of a communication or information protected
    as privileged or work product constitutes a waiver. A few courts
    find that a disclosure must be intentional to be a waiver. Most
    courts find a waiver only if the disclosing party acted carelessly
    in disclosing the communication or information and failed to
    request its return in a timely manner. And a few courts hold that
    any inadvertent disclosure of a communication or information
    protected under the attorney-client privilege or as work product
    constitutes a waiver without regard to the protections taken to
    avoid such a disclosure. See generally Hopson v. City of Baltimore,
    232 F.R.D. 228 (D.Md. 2005), for a discussion of this case law.
      The rule opts for the middle ground: inadvertent disclosure of
    protected communications or information in connection with a
    federal proceeding or to a federal office or agency does not
    constitute a waiver if the holder took reasonable steps to prevent
    disclosure and also promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the
    error. This position is in accord with the majority view on whether
    inadvertent disclosure is a waiver.
      Cases such as Lois Sportswear, U.S.A., Inc. v. Levi Strauss &
    Co., 104 F.R.D. 103, 105 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) and Hartford Fire Ins. Co.
    v. Garvey, 109 F.R.D. 323, 332 (N.D.Cal. 1985), set out a
    multifactor test for determining whether inadvertent disclosure is
    a waiver. The stated factors (none of which is dispositive) are the
    reasonableness of precautions taken, the time taken to rectify the
    error, the scope of discovery, the extent of disclosure and the
    overriding issue of fairness. The rule does not explicitly codify
    that test, because it is really a set of non-determinative
    guidelines that vary from case to case. The rule is flexible enough
    to accommodate any of those listed factors. Other considerations
    bearing on the reasonableness of a producing party's efforts
    include the number of documents to be reviewed and the time
    constraints for production. Depending on the circumstances, a party
    that uses advanced analytical software applications and linguistic
    tools in screening for privilege and work product may be found to
    have taken "reasonable steps" to prevent inadvertent disclosure.
    The implementation of an efficient system of records management
    before litigation may also be relevant.
      The rule does not require the producing party to engage in a post-
    production review to determine whether any protected communication
    or information has been produced by mistake. But the rule does
    require the producing party to follow up on any obvious indications
    that a protected communication or information has been produced
    inadvertently.
      The rule applies to inadvertent disclosures made to a federal
    office or agency, including but not limited to an office or agency
    that is acting in the course of its regulatory, investigative or
    enforcement authority. The consequences of waiver, and the
    concomitant costs of pre-production privilege review, can be as
    great with respect to disclosures to offices and agencies as they
    are in litigation.
      Subdivision (c). Difficult questions can arise when 1) a
    disclosure of a communication or information protected by the
    attorney-client privilege or as work product is made in a state
    proceeding, 2) the communication or information is offered in a
    subsequent federal proceeding on the ground that the disclosure
    waived the privilege or protection, and 3) the state and federal
    laws are in conflict on the question of waiver. The Committee
    determined that the proper solution for the federal court is to
    apply the law that is most protective of privilege and work
    product. If the state law is more protective (such as where the
    state law is that an inadvertent disclosure can never be a waiver),
    the holder of the privilege or protection may well have relied on
    that law when making the disclosure in the state proceeding.
    Moreover, applying a more restrictive federal law of waiver could
    impair the state objective of preserving the privilege or work-
    product protection for disclosures made in state proceedings. On
    the other hand, if the federal law is more protective, applying the
    state law of waiver to determine admissibility in federal court is
    likely to undermine the federal objective of limiting the costs of
    production.
      The rule does not address the enforceability of a state court
    confidentiality order in a federal proceeding, as that question is
    covered both by statutory law and principles of federalism and
    comity. See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1738 (providing that state judicial
    proceedings "shall have the same full faith and credit in every
    court within the United States . . . as they have by law or usage
    in the courts of such State . . . from which they are taken"). See
    also Tucker v. Ohtsu Tire & Rubber Co., 191 F.R.D. 495, 499 (D.Md.
    2000) (noting that a federal court considering the enforceability
    of a state confidentiality order is "constrained by principles of
    comity, courtesy, and . . . federalism"). Thus, a state court order
    finding no waiver in connection with a disclosure made in a state
    court proceeding is enforceable under existing law in subsequent
    federal proceedings.
      Subdivision (d). Confidentiality orders are becoming increasingly
    important in limiting the costs of privilege review and retention,
    especially in cases involving electronic discovery. But the utility
    of a confidentiality order in reducing discovery costs is
    substantially diminished if it provides no protection outside the
    particular litigation in which the order is entered. Parties are
    unlikely to be able to reduce the costs of pre-production review
    for privilege and work product if the consequence of disclosure is
    that the communications or information could be used by non-parties
    to the litigation.
      There is some dispute on whether a confidentiality order entered
    in one case is enforceable in other proceedings. See generally
    Hopson v. City of Baltimore, 232 F.R.D. 228 (D.Md. 2005), for a
    discussion of this case law. The rule provides that when a
    confidentiality order governing the consequences of disclosure in
    that case is entered in a federal proceeding, its terms are
    enforceable against non-parties in any federal or state proceeding.
    For example, the court order may provide for return of documents
    without waiver irrespective of the care taken by the disclosing
    party; the rule contemplates enforcement of "claw-back" and "quick
    peek" arrangements as a way to avoid the excessive costs of pre-
    production review for privilege and work product. See Zubulake v.
    UBS Warburg LLC, 216 F.R.D. 280, 290 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (noting that
    parties may enter into "so-called 'claw-back' agreements that allow
    the parties to forego privilege review altogether in favor of an
    agreement to return inadvertently produced privilege documents").
    The rule provides a party with a predictable protection from a
    court order - predictability that is needed to allow the party to
    plan in advance to limit the prohibitive costs of privilege and
    work product review and retention.
      Under the rule, a confidentiality order is enforceable whether or
    not it memorializes an agreement among the parties to the
    litigation. Party agreement should not be a condition of
    enforceability of a federal court's order.
      Under subdivision (d), a federal court may order that disclosure
    of privileged or protected information "in connection with" a
    federal proceeding does not result in waiver. But subdivision (d)
    does not allow the federal court to enter an order determining the
    waiver effects of a separate disclosure of the same information in
    other proceedings, state or federal. If a disclosure has been made
    in a state proceeding (and is not the subject of a state-court
    order on waiver), then subdivision (d) is inapplicable. Subdivision
    (c) would govern the federal court's determination whether the
    state-court disclosure waived the privilege or protection in the
    federal proceeding.
      Subdivision (e). Subdivision (e) codifies the well-established
    proposition that parties can enter an agreement to limit the effect
    of waiver by disclosure between or among them. Of course such an
    agreement can bind only the parties to the agreement. The rule
    makes clear that if parties want protection against non-parties
    from a finding of waiver by disclosure, the agreement must be made
    part of a court order.
      Subdivision (f). The protections against waiver provided by Rule
    502 must be applicable when protected communications or information
    disclosed in federal proceedings are subsequently offered in state
    proceedings. Otherwise the holders of protected communications and
    information, and their lawyers, could not rely on the protections
    provided by the Rule, and the goal of limiting costs in discovery
    would be substantially undermined. Rule 502(f) is intended to
    resolve any potential tension between the provisions of Rule 502
    that apply to state proceedings and the possible limitations on the
    applicability of the Federal Rules of Evidence otherwise provided
    by Rules 101 and 1101.
      The rule is intended to apply in all federal court proceedings,
    including court-annexed and court-ordered arbitrations, without
    regard to any possible limitations of Rules 101 and 1101. This
    provision is not intended to raise an inference about the
    applicability of any other rule of evidence in arbitration
    proceedings more generally.
      The costs of discovery can be equally high for state and federal
    causes of action, and the rule seeks to limit those costs in all
    federal proceedings, regardless of whether the claim arises under
    state or federal law. Accordingly, the rule applies to state law
    causes of action brought in federal court.
      Subdivision (g). The rule's coverage is limited to attorney-
    client privilege and work product. The operation of waiver by
    disclosure, as applied to other evidentiary privileges, remains a
    question of federal common law. Nor does the rule purport to apply
    to the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-
    incrimination.
      The definition of work product "materials" is intended to include
    both tangible and intangible information. See In re Cendant Corp.
    Sec. Litig., 343 F.3d 658, 662 (3d Cir. 2003) ("work product
    protection extends to both tangible and intangible work product").

      This general ground-clearing eliminates all grounds of
    incompetency not specifically recognized in the succeeding rules of
    this Article. Included among the grounds thus abolished are
    religious belief, conviction of crime, and connection with the
    litigation as a party or interested person or spouse of a party or
    interested person. With the exception of the so-called Dead Man's
    Acts, American jurisdictions generally have ceased to recognize
    these grounds.
      The Dead Man's Acts are surviving traces of the common law
    disqualification of parties and interested persons. They exist in
    variety too great to convey conviction of their wisdom and
    effectiveness. These rules contain no provision of this kind. For
    the reasoning underlying the decision not to give effect to state
    statutes in diversity cases, see the Advisory Committee's Note to
    Rule 501.
      No mental or moral qualifications for testifying as a witness are
    specified. Standards of mental capacity have proved elusive in
    actual application. A leading commentator observes that few
    witnesses are disqualified on that ground. Weihofen, Testimonial
    Competence and Credibility, 34 Geo. Wash.L.Rev. 53 (1965).
    Discretion is regularly exercised in favor of allowing the
    testimony. A witness wholly without capacity is difficult to
    imagine. The question is one particularly suited to the jury as one
    of weight and credibility, subject to judicial authority to review
    the sufficiency of the evidence. 2 Wigmore Secs. 501, 509.
    Standards of moral qualification in practice consist essentially of
    evaluating a person's truthfulness in terms of his own answers
    about it. Their principal utility is in affording an opportunity on
    voir dire examination to impress upon the witness his moral duty.
    This result may, however, be accomplished more directly, and
    without haggling in terms of legal standards, by the manner of
    administering the oath or affirmation under Rule 603.
      Admissibility of religious belief as a ground of impeachment is
    treated in Rule 610. Conviction of crime as a ground of impeachment
    is the subject of Rule 609. Marital relationship is the basis for
    privilege under Rule 505. Interest in the outcome of litigation and
    mental capacity are, of course, highly relevant to credibility and
    require no special treatment to render them admissible along with
    other matters bearing upon the perception, memory, and narration of
    witnesses.

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      Rule 601 as submitted to the Congress provided that "Every person
    is competent to be a witness except as otherwise provided in these
    rules." One effect of the Rule as proposed would have been to
    abolish age, mental capacity, and other grounds recognized in some
    State jurisdictions as making a person incompetent as a witness.
    The greatest controversy centered around the Rule's rendering
    inapplicable in the federal courts the so-called Dead Man's
    Statutes which exist in some States. Acknowledging that there is
    substantial disagreement as to the merit of Dead Man's Statutes,
    the Committee nevertheless believed that where such statutes have
    been enacted they represent State policy which should not be
    overturned in the absence of a compelling federal interest. The
    Committee therefore amended the Rule to make competency in civil
    actions determinable in accordance with State law with respect to
    elements of claims or defenses as to which State law supplies the
    rule of decision. Cf. Courtland v. Walston & Co., Inc., 340 F.Supp.
    1076, 1087-1092 (S.D.N.Y. 1972).

      NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, SENATE REPORT NO. 93-1277  
      The amendment to rule 601 parallels the treatment accorded rule
    501 discussed immediately above.

          NOTES OF CONFERENCE COMMITTEE, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-1597      
      Rule 601 deals with competency of witnesses. Both the House and
    Senate bills provide that federal competency law applies in
    criminal cases. In civil actions and proceedings, the House bill
    provides that state competency law applies "to an element of a
    claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of
    decision." The Senate bill provides that "in civil actions and
    proceedings arising under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332 or 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    1335, or between citizens of different States and removed under 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 1441(b) the competency of a witness, person,
    government, State or political subdivision thereof is determined in
    accordance with State law, unless with respect to the particular
    claim or defense, Federal law supplies the rule of decision."
      The wording of the House and Senate bills differs in the
    treatment of civil actions and proceedings. The rule in the House
    bill applies to evidence that relates to "an element of a claim or
    defense." If an item of proof tends to support or defeat a claim or
    defense, or an element of a claim or defense, and if state law
    supplies the rule of decision for that claim or defense, then state
    competency law applies to that item of proof.
      For reasons similar to those underlying its action on Rule 501,
    the Conference adopts the House provision.

-STATUTE-
      A witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is
    introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has
    personal knowledge of the matter. Evidence to prove personal
    knowledge may, but need not, consist of the witness' own testimony.

      "* * * [T]he rule requiring that a witness who testifies to a
    fact which can be perceived by the senses must have had an
    opportunity to observe, and must have actually observed the fact"
    is a "most pervasive manifestation" of the common law insistence
    upon "the most reliable sources of information." McCormick Sec. 10,
    p. 19. These foundation requirements may, of course, be furnished
    by the testimony of the witness himself; hence personal knowledge
    is not an absolute but may consist of what the witness thinks he
    knows from personal perception. 2 Wigmore Sec. 650. It will be
    observed that the rule is in fact a specialized application of the
    provisions of Rule 104(b) on conditional relevancy.
      This rule does not govern the situation of a witness who
    testifies to a hearsay statement as such, if he has personal
    knowledge of the making of the statement. Rules 801 and 805 would
    be applicable. This rule would, however, prevent him from
    testifying to the subject matter of the hearsay statement, as he
    has no personal knowledge of it.
      The reference to Rule 703 is designed to avoid any question of
    conflict between the present rule and the provisions of that rule
    allowing an expert to express opinions based on facts of which he
    does not have personal knowledge.

    Rule 605. Competency of Judge as Witness

-STATUTE-
      The judge presiding at the trial may not testify in that trial as
    a witness. No objection need be made in order to preserve the
    point.

-MISC1-
               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      In view of the mandate of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 455 that a judge
    disqualify himself in "any case in which he * * * is or has been a
    material witness," the likelihood that the presiding judge in a
    federal court might be called to testify in the trial over which he
    is presiding is slight. Nevertheless the possibility is not totally
    eliminated.
      The solution here presented is a broad rule of incompetency,
    rather than such alternatives as incompetency only as to material
    matters, leaving the matter to the discretion of the judge, or
    recognizing no incompetency. The choice is the result of inability
    to evolve satisfactory answers to questions which arise when the
    judge abandons the bench for the witness stand. Who rules on
    objections? Who compels him to answer? Can he rule impartially on
    the weight and admissibility of his own testimony? Can he be
    impeached or cross-examined effectively? Can he, in a jury trial,
    avoid conferring his seal of approval on one side in the eyes of
    the jury? Can he, in a bench trial, avoid an involvement
    destructive of impartiality? The rule of general incompetency has
    substantial support. See Report of the Special Committee on the
    Propriety of Judges Appearing as Witnesses, 36 A.B.A.J. 630 (1950);
    cases collected in Annot. 157 A.L.R. 311; McCormick Sec. 68, p.
    147; Uniform Rule 42; California Evidence Code Sec. 703; Kansas
    Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 60-442; New Jersey Evidence Rule 42.
    Cf. 6 Wigmore Sec. 1909, which advocates leaving the matter to the
    discretion of the judge, and statutes to that effect collected in
    Annot. 157 A.L.R. 311.
      The rule provides an "automatic" objection. To require an actual
    objection would confront the opponent with a choice between not
    objecting, with the result of allowing the testimony, and
    objecting, with the probable result of excluding the testimony but
    at the price of continuing the trial before a judge likely to feel
    that his integrity had been attacked by the objector.

-STATUTE-
      (a) At the Trial. A member of the jury may not testify as a
    witness before that jury in the trial of the case in which the
    juror is sitting. If the juror is called so to testify, the
    opposing party shall be afforded an opportunity to object out of
    the presence of the jury.
      (b) Inquiry Into Validity of Verdict or Indictment. Upon an
    inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may
    not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the
    course of the jury's deliberations or to the effect of anything
    upon that or any other juror's mind or emotions as influencing the
    juror to assent to or dissent from the verdict or indictment or
    concerning the juror's mental processes in connection therewith.
    But a juror may testify about (1) whether extraneous prejudicial
    information was improperly brought to the jury's attention, (2)
    whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon
    any juror, or (3) whether there was a mistake in entering the
    verdict onto the verdict form. A juror's affidavit or evidence of
    any statement by the juror may not be received on a matter about
    which the juror would be precluded from testifying.

               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      Subdivision (a). The considerations which bear upon the
    permissibility of testimony by a juror in the trial in which he is
    sitting as juror bear an obvious similarity to those evoked when
    the judge is called as a witness. See Advisory Committee's Note to
    Rule 605. The judge is not, however in this instance so involved as
    to call for departure from usual principles requiring objection to
    be made; hence the only provision on objection is that opportunity
    be afforded for its making out of the presence of the jury. Compare
    Rules 605.
      Subdivision (b). Whether testimony, affidavits, or statements of
    jurors should be received for the purpose of invalidating or
    supporting a verdict or indictment, and if so, under what
    circumstances, has given rise to substantial differences of
    opinion. The familiar rubric that a juror may not impeach his own
    verdict, dating from Lord Mansfield's time, is a gross
    oversimplification. The values sought to be promoted by excluding
    the evidence include freedom of deliberation, stability and
    finality of verdicts, and protection of jurors against annoyance
    and embarrassment. McDonald v. Pless, 238 U.S. 264, 35 S.Ct. 785,
    59 L.Ed. 1300 (1915). On the other hand, simply putting verdicts
    beyond effective reach can only promote irregularity and injustice.
    The rule offers an accommodation between these competing
    considerations.
      The mental operations and emotional reactions of jurors in
    arriving at a given result would, if allowed as a subject of
    inquiry, place every verdict at the mercy of jurors and invite
    tampering and harassment. See Grenz v. Werre, 129 N.W.2d 681 (N.D.
    1964). The authorities are in virtually complete accord in
    excluding the evidence. Fryer, Note on Disqualification of
    Witnesses, Selected Writings on Evidence and Trial 345, 347 (Fryer
    ed. 1957); Maguire, Weinstein, et al., Cases on Evidence 887 (5th
    ed. 1965); 8 Wigmore Sec. 2340 (McNaughton Rev. 1961). As to
    matters other than mental operations and emotional reactions of
    jurors, substantial authority refuses to allow a juror to disclose
    irregularities which occur in the jury room, but allows his
    testimony as to irregularities occurring outside and allows
    outsiders to testify as to occurrences both inside and out. 8
    Wigmore Sec. 2354 (McNaughton Rev. 1961). However, the door of the
    jury room is not necessarily a satisfactory dividing point, and the
    Supreme Court has refused to accept it for every situation. Mattox
    v. United States, 146 U.S. 140, 13 S.Ct. 50, 36 L.Ed. 917 (1892).
      Under the federal decisions the central focus has been upon
    insulation of the manner in which the jury reached its verdict, and
    this protection extends to each of the components of deliberation,
    including arguments, statements, discussions, mental and emotional
    reactions, votes, and any other feature of the process. Thus
    testimony or affidavits of jurors have been held incompetent to
    show a compromise verdict, Hyde v. United States, 225 U.S. 347, 382
    (1912); a quotient verdict, McDonald v. Pless, 238 U.S. 264 (1915);
    speculation as to insurance coverage, Holden v. Porter, 495 F.2d
    878 (10th Cir.1969), Farmers Coop. Elev. Ass'n v. Strand, 382 F.2d
    224, 230 (8th Cir. 1967), cert. denied 389 U.S. 1014;
    misinterpretations of instructions, Farmers Coop. Elev. Ass'n v.
    Strand, supra; mistake in returning verdict, United States v.
    Chereton, 309 F.2d 197 (6th Cir. 1962); interpretation of guilty
    plea by one defendant as implicating others, United States v.
    Crosby, 294 F.2d 928, 949 (2d Cir. 1961). The policy does not,
    however, foreclose testimony by jurors as to prejudicial extraneous
    information or influences injected into or brought to bear upon the
    deliberative process. Thus a juror is recognized as competent to
    testify to statements by the bailiff or the introduction of a
    prejudicial newspaper account into the jury room, Mattox v. United
    States, 146 U.S. 140 (1892). See also Parker v. Gladden, 385 U.S.
    363 (1966).
      This rule does not purport to specify the substantive grounds for
    setting aside verdicts for irregularity; it deals only with the
    competency of jurors to testify concerning those grounds. Allowing
    them to testify as to matters other than their own inner reactions
    involves no particular hazard to the values sought to be protected.
    The rules is based upon this conclusion. It makes no attempt to
    specify the substantive grounds for setting aside verdicts for
    irregularity.
      See also Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and
    18 U.S.C. Sec. 3500, governing the secrecy of grand jury
    proceedings. The present rules does not relate to secrecy and
    disclosure but to the competency of certain witnesses and evidence.

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      As proposed by the Court, Rule 606(b) limited testimony by a
    juror in the course of an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or
    indictment. He could testify as to the influence of extraneous
    prejudicial information brought to the jury's attention (e.g. a
    radio newscast or a newspaper account) or an outside influence
    which improperly had been brought to bear upon a juror (e.g. a
    threat to the safety of a member of his family), but he could not
    testify as to other irregularities which occurred in the jury room.
    Under this formulation a quotient verdict could not be attacked
    through the testimony of a juror, nor could a juror testify to the
    drunken condition of a fellow juror which so disabled him that he
    could not participate in the jury's deliberations.
      The 1969 and 1971 Advisory Committee drafts would have permitted
    a member of the jury to testify concerning these kinds of
    irregularities in the jury room. The Advisory Committee note in the
    1971 draft stated that "* * * the door of the jury room is not a
    satisfactory dividing point, and the Supreme Court has refused to
    accept it." The Advisory Committee further commented that - 
        The trend has been to draw the dividing line between testimony
      as to mental processes, on the one hand, and as to the existence
      of conditions or occurrences of events calculated improperly to
      influence the verdict, on the other hand, without regard to
      whether the happening is within or without the jury room. * * *
      The jurors are the persons who know what really happened.
      Allowing them to testify as to matters other than their own
      reactions involves no particular hazard to the values sought to
      be protected. The rule is based upon this conclusion. It makes no
      attempt to specify the substantive grounds for setting aside
      verdicts for irregularity.
    Objective jury misconduct may be testified to in California,
    Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio,
    Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington.
      Persuaded that the better practice is that provided for in the
    earlier drafts, the Committee amended subdivision (b) to read in
    the text of those drafts.

      NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, SENATE REPORT NO. 93-1277  
      As adopted by the House, this rule would permit the impeachment
    of verdicts by inquiry into, not the mental processes of the
    jurors, but what happened in terms of conduct in the jury room.
    This extension of the ability to impeach a verdict is felt to be
    unwarranted and ill-advised.
      The rule passed by the House embodies a suggestion by the
    Advisory Committee of the Judicial Conference that is considerably
    broader than the final version adopted by the Supreme Court, which
    embodies long-accepted Federal law. Although forbidding the
    impeachment of verdicts by inquiry into the jurors' mental
    processes, it deletes from the Supreme Court version the
    proscription against testimony "as to any matter or statement
    occurring during the course of the jury's deliberations." This
    deletion would have the effect of opening verdicts up to challenge
    on the basis of what happened during the jury's internal
    deliberations, for example, where a juror alleged that the jury
    refused to follow the trial judge's instructions or that some of
    the jurors did not take part in deliberations.
      Permitting an individual to attack a jury verdict based upon the
    jury's internal deliberations has long been recognized as unwise by
    the Supreme Court. In McDonald v. Pless, the Court stated:
                                 * * * * *                             

        [L]et it once be established that verdicts solemnly made and
      publicly returned into court can be attacked and set aside on the
      testimony of those who took part in their publication and all
      verdicts could be, and many would be, followed by an inquiry in
      the hope of discovering something which might invalidate the
      finding. Jurors would be harassed and beset by the defeated party
      in an effort to secure from them evidence of facts which might
      establish misconduct sufficient to set aside a verdict. If
      evidence thus secured could be thus used, the result would be to
      make what was intended to be a private deliberation, the constant
      subject of public investigation - to the destruction of all
      frankness and freedom of discussion and conference [238 U.S. 264,
      at 267 (1914)].

      As it stands then, the rule would permit the harassment of former
    jurors by losing parties as well as the possible exploitation of
    disgruntled or otherwise badly-motivated ex-jurors.
      Public policy requires a finality to litigation. And common
    fairness requires that absolute privacy be preserved for jurors to
    engage in the full and free debate necessary to the attainment of
    just verdicts. Jurors will not be able to function effectively if
    their deliberations are to be scrutinized in post-trial litigation.
    In the interest of protecting the jury system and the citizens who
    make it work, rule 606 should not permit any inquiry into the
    internal deliberations of the jurors.

          NOTES OF CONFERENCE COMMITTEE, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-1597      
      Rule 606(b) deals with juror testimony in an inquiry into the
    validity of a verdict or indictment. The House bill provides that a
    juror cannot testify about his mental processes or about the effect
    of anything upon his or another juror's mind as influencing him to
    assent to or dissent from a verdict or indictment. Thus, the House
    bill allows a juror to testify about objective matters occurring
    during the jury's deliberation, such as the misconduct of another
    juror or the reaching of a quotient verdict. The Senate bill does
    not permit juror testimony about any matter or statement occurring
    during the course of the jury's deliberations. The Senate bill does
    provide, however, that a juror may testify on the question whether
    extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the
    jury's attention and on the question whether any outside influence
    was improperly brought to bear on any juror.
      The Conference adopts the Senate amendment. The Conferees believe
    that jurors should be encouraged to be conscientious in promptly
    reporting to the court misconduct that occurs during jury
    deliberations.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 606(b) has been amended to provide that juror testimony may
    be used to prove that the verdict reported was the result of a
    mistake in entering the verdict on the verdict form. The amendment
    responds to a divergence between the text of the Rule and the case
    law that has established an exception for proof of clerical errors.
    See, e.g., Plummer v. Springfield Term. Ry., 5 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.
    1993) ("A number of circuits hold, and we agree, that juror
    testimony regarding an alleged clerical error, such as announcing a
    verdict different than that agreed upon, does not challenge the
    validity of the verdict or the deliberation of mental processes,
    and therefore is not subject to Rule 606(b)."); Teevee Toons, Inc.,
    v. MP3.Com, Inc., 148 F.Supp.2d 276, 278 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (noting
    that Rule 606(b) has been silent regarding inquiries designed to
    confirm the accuracy of a verdict).
      In adopting the exception for proof of mistakes in entering the
    verdict on the verdict form, the amendment specifically rejects the
    broader exception, adopted by some courts, permitting the use of
    juror testimony to prove that the jurors were operating under a
    misunderstanding about the consequences of the result that they
    agreed upon. See, e.g., Attridge v. Cencorp Div. of Dover Techs.
    Int'l, Inc., 836 F.2d 113, 116 (2d Cir. 1987); Eastridge
    Development Co., v. Halpert Associates, Inc., 853 F.2d 772 (10th
    Cir. 1988). The broader exception is rejected because an inquiry
    into whether the jury misunderstood or misapplied an instruction
    goes to the jurors' mental processes underlying the verdict, rather
    than the verdict's accuracy in capturing what the jurors had agreed
    upon. See, e.g., Karl v. Burlington Northern R.R., 880 F.2d 68, 74
    (8th Cir. 1989) (error to receive juror testimony on whether
    verdict was the result of jurors' misunderstanding of instructions:
    "The jurors did not state that the figure written by the foreman
    was different from that which they agreed upon, but indicated that
    the figure the foreman wrote down was intended to be a net figure,
    not a gross figure. Receiving such statements violates Rule 606(b)
    because the testimony relates to how the jury interpreted the
    court's instructions, and concerns the jurors' 'mental processes,'
    which is forbidden by the rule."); Robles v. Exxon Corp., 862 F.2d
    1201, 1208 (5th Cir. 1989) ("the alleged error here goes to the
    substance of what the jury was asked to decide, necessarily
    implicating the jury's mental processes insofar as it questions the
    jury's understanding of the court's instructions and application of
    those instructions to the facts of the case"). Thus, the exception
    established by the amendment is limited to cases such as "where the
    jury foreperson wrote down, in response to an interrogatory, a
    number different from that agreed upon by the jury, or mistakenly
    stated that the defendant was 'guilty' when the jury had actually
    agreed that the defendant was not guilty." Id.
      It should be noted that the possibility of errors in the verdict
    form will be reduced substantially by polling the jury. Rule 606(b)
    does not, of course, prevent this precaution. See 8 C. Wigmore,
    Evidence, Sec. 2350 at 691 (McNaughten ed. 1961) (noting that the
    reasons for the rule barring juror testimony, "namely, the dangers
    of uncertainty and of tampering with the jurors to procure
    testimony, disappear in large part if such investigation as may be
    desired is made by the judge and takes place before the jurors'
    discharge and separation") (emphasis in original). Errors that come
    to light after polling the jury "may be corrected on the spot, or
    the jury may be sent out to continue deliberations, or, if
    necessary, a new trial may be ordered." C. Mueller & L.
    Kirkpatrick, Evidence Under the Rules at 671 (2d ed. 1999) (citing
    Sincox v. United States, 571 F.2d 876, 878-79 (5th Cir. 1978)).
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. Based on public
    comment, the exception established in the amendment was changed
    from one permitting proof of a "clerical mistake" to one permitting
    proof that the verdict resulted from a mistake in entering the
    verdict onto the verdict form. The Committee Note was modified to
    accord with the change in the text.

      The traditional rule against impeaching one's own witness is
    abandoned as based on false premises. A party does not hold out his
    witnesses as worthy of belief, since he rarely has a free choice in
    selecting them. Denial of the right leaves the party at the mercy
    of the witness and the adversary. If the impeachment is by a prior
    statement, it is free from hearsay dangers and is excluded from the
    category of hearsay under Rule 801(d)(1). Ladd, Impeachment of
    One's Own Witness - New Developments 4 U.Chi.L.Rev. 69 (1936);
    McCormick Sec. 38; 3 Wigmore Secs. 896-918. The substantial inroads
    into the old rule made over the years by decisions, rules, and
    statutes are evidence of doubts as to its basic soundness and
    workability. Cases are collected in 3 Wigmore Sec. 905. Revised
    Rule 32(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows any
    party to impeach a witness by means of his deposition, and Rule
    43(b) has allowed the calling and impeachment of an adverse party
    or person identified with him. Illustrative statutes allowing a
    party to impeach his own witness under varying circumstances are
    Ill.Rev. Stats.1967, c. 110, Sec. 60; Mass.Laws Annot. 1959, c. 233

    ARTICLE VI. WITNESSES

-HEAD-
    Rule 608. Evidence of Character and Conduct of Witness

-STATUTE-
      (a) Opinion and Reputation Evidence of Character. The credibility
    of a witness may be attacked or supported by evidence in the form
    of opinion or reputation, but subject to these limitations: (1) the
    evidence may refer only to character for truthfulness or
    untruthfulness, and (2) evidence of truthful character is
    admissible only after the character of the witness for truthfulness
    has been attacked by opinion or reputation evidence or otherwise.
      (b) Specific Instances of Conduct. Specific instances of the
    conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting
    the witness' character for truthfulness, other than conviction of
    crime as provided in rule 609, may not be proved by extrinsic
    evidence. They may, however, in the discretion of the court, if
    probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on
    cross-examination of the witness (1) concerning the witness'
    character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or (2) concerning the
    character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of another witness as
    to which character the witness being cross-examined has testified.
      The giving of testimony, whether by an accused or by any other
    witness, does not operate as a waiver of the accused's or the
    witness' privilege against self-incrimination when examined with
    respect to matters that relate only to character for truthfulness.

-MISC1-
               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      Subdivision (a). In Rule 404(a) the general position is taken
    that character evidence is not admissible for the purpose of
    proving that the person acted in conformity therewith, subject,
    however, to several exceptions, one of which is character evidence
    of a witness as bearing upon his credibility. The present rule
    develops that exception.
      In accordance with the bulk of judicial authority, the inquiry is
    strictly limited to character for veracity, rather than allowing
    evidence as to character generally. The result is to sharpen
    relevancy, to reduce surprise, waste of time, and confusion, and to
    make the lot of the witness somewhat less unattractive. McCormick
    Sec. 44.
      The use of opinion and reputation evidence as means of proving
    the character of witnesses is consistent with Rule 405(a). While
    the modern practice has purported to exclude opinion witnesses who
    testify to reputation seem in fact often to be giving their
    opinions, disguised somewhat misleadingly as reputation. See
    McCormick Sec. 44. And even under the modern practice, a common
    relaxation has allowed inquiry as to whether the witnesses would
    believe the principal witness under oath. United States v. Walker,
    313 F.2d 236 (6th Cir. 1963), and cases cited therein; McCormick
    Sec. 44, pp. 94-95, n. 3.
      Character evidence in support of credibility is admissible under
    the rule only after the witness' character has first been attacked,
    as has been the case at common law. Maguire, Weinstein, et al.,
    Cases on Evidence 295 (5th ed. 1965); McCormick Sec. 49, p. 105; 4
    Wigmore Sec. 1104. The enormous needless consumption of time which
    a contrary practice would entail justifies the limitation. Opinion
    or reputation that the witness is untruthful specifically qualifies
    as an attack under the rule, and evidence or misconduct, including
    conviction of crime, and of corruption also fall within this
    category. Evidence of bias or interest does not. McCormick Sec. 49;
    4 Wigmore Secs. 1106, 1107. Whether evidence in the form of
    contradiction is an attack upon the character of the witness must
    depend Secs. 1108, 1109.
      As to the use of specific instances on direct by an opinion
    witness, see the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 405, supra.
      Subdivision (b). In conformity with Rule 405, which forecloses
    use of evidence of specific incidents as proof in chief of
    character unless character is an issue in the case, the present
    rule generally bars evidence of specific instances of conduct of a
    witness for the purpose of attacking or supporting his credibility.
    There are, however, two exceptions: (1) specific instances are
    provable when they have been the subject of criminal conviction,
    and (2) specific instances may be inquired into on cross-
    examination of the principal witness or of a witness giving an
    opinion of his character for truthfulness.
      (1) Conviction of crime as a technique of impeachment is treated
    in detail in Rule 609, and here is merely recognized as an
    exception to the general rule excluding evidence of specific
    incidents for impeachment purposes.
      (2) Particular instances of conduct, though not the subject of
    criminal conviction, may be inquired into on cross-examination of
    the principal witness himself or of a witness who testifies
    concerning his character for truthfulness. Effective cross-
    examination demands that some allowance be made for going into
    matters of this kind, but the possibilities of abuse are
    substantial. Consequently safeguards are erected in the form of
    specific requirements that the instances inquired into be probative
    of truthfulness or its opposite and not remote in time. Also, the
    overriding protection of Rule 403 requires that probative value not
    be outweighed by danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues,
    or misleading the jury, and that of Rule 611 bars harassment and
    undue embarrassment.
      The final sentence constitutes a rejection of the doctrine of
    such cases as People v. Sorge, 301 N.Y. 198, 93 N.E.2d 637 (1950),
    that any past criminal act relevant to credibility may be inquired
    into on cross-examination, in apparent disregard of the privilege
    against self-incrimination. While it is clear that an ordinary
    witness cannot make a partial disclosure of incriminating matter
    and then invoke the privilege on cross-examination, no tenable
    contention can be made that merely by testifying he waives his
    right to foreclose inquiry on cross-examination into criminal
    activities for the purpose of attacking his credibility. So to hold
    would reduce the privilege to a nullity. While it is true that an
    accused, unlike an ordinary witness, has an option whether to
    testify, if the option can be exercised only at the price of
    opening up inquiry as to any and all criminal acts committed during
    his lifetime, the right to testify could scarcely be said to
    possess much vitality. In Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85
    S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965), the Court held that allowing
    comment on the election of an accused not to testify exacted a
    constitutionally impermissible price, and so here. While no
    specific provision in terms confers constitutional status on the
    right of an accused to take the stand in his own defense, the
    existence of the right is so completely recognized that a denial of
    it or substantial infringement upon it would surely be of due
    process dimensions. See Ferguson v. Georgia, 365 U.S. 570, 81 S.Ct.
    756, 5 L.Ed.2d 783 (1961); McCormick Sec. 131; 8 Wigmore Sec. 2276
    (McNaughton Rev. 1961). In any event, wholly aside from
    constitutional considerations, the provision represents a sound
    policy.

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      Rule 608(a) as submitted by the Court permitted attack to be made
    upon the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of a witness
    either by reputation or opinion testimony. For the same reasons
    underlying its decision to eliminate the admissibility of opinion
    testimony in Rule 405(a), the Committee amended Rule 608(a) to
    delete the reference to opinion testimony.
      The second sentence of Rule 608(b) as submitted by the Court
    permitted specific instances of misconduct of a witness to be
    inquired into on cross-examination for the purpose of attacking his
    credibility, if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, "and
    not remote in time". Such cross-examination could be of the witness
    himself or of another witness who testifies as to "his" character
    for truthfulness or untruthfulness.
      The Committee amended the Rule to emphasize the discretionary
    power of the court in permitting such testimony and deleted the
    reference to remoteness in time as being unnecessary and confusing
    (remoteness from time of trial or remoteness from the incident
    involved?). As recast, the Committee amendment also makes clear the
    antecedent of "his" in the original Court proposal.

          NOTES OF CONFERENCE COMMITTEE, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-1597      
      The Senate amendment adds the words "opinion or" to conform the
    first sentence of the rule with the remainder of the rule.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             
      The Rule has been amended to clarify that the absolute
    prohibition on extrinsic evidence applies only when the sole reason
    for proffering that evidence is to attack or support the witness'
    character for truthfulness. See United States v. Abel, 469 U.S. 45
    (1984); United States v. Fusco, 748 F.2d 996 (5th Cir. 1984) (Rule
    608(b) limits the use of evidence "designed to show that the
    witness has done things, unrelated to the suit being tried, that
    make him more or less believable per se"); Ohio R.Evid. 608(b). On
    occasion the Rule's use of the overbroad term "credibility" has
    been read "to bar extrinsic evidence for bias, competency and
    contradiction impeachment since they too deal with credibility."
    American Bar Association Section of Litigation, Emerging Problems
    Under the Federal Rules of Evidence at 161 (3d ed. 1998). The
    amendment conforms the language of the Rule to its original intent,
    which was to impose an absolute bar on extrinsic evidence only if
    the sole purpose for offering the evidence was to prove the
    witness' character for veracity. See Advisory Committee Note to
    Rule 608(b) (stating that the Rule is "[i]n conformity with Rule
    405, which forecloses use of evidence of specific incidents as
    proof in chief of character unless character is in issue in the
    case . . .").
      By limiting the application of the Rule to proof of a witness'
    character for truthfulness, the amendment leaves the admissibility
    of extrinsic evidence offered for other grounds of impeachment
    (such as contradiction, prior inconsistent statement, bias and
    mental capacity) to Rules 402 and 403. See, e.g., United States v.
    Winchenbach, 197 F.3d 548 (1st Cir. 1999) (admissibility of a prior
    inconsistent statement offered for impeachment is governed by Rules
    402 and 403, not Rule 608(b)); United States v. Tarantino, 846 F.2d
    1384 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (admissibility of extrinsic evidence offered
    to contradict a witness is governed by Rules 402 and 403); United
    States v. Lindemann, 85 F.3d 1232 (7th Cir. 1996) (admissibility of
    extrinsic evidence of bias is governed by Rules 402 and 403).
      It should be noted that the extrinsic evidence prohibition of
    Rule 608(b) bars any reference to the consequences that a witness
    might have suffered as a result of an alleged bad act. For example,
    Rule 608(b) prohibits counsel from mentioning that a witness was
    suspended or disciplined for the conduct that is the subject of
    impeachment, when that conduct is offered only to prove the
    character of the witness. See United States v. Davis, 183 F.3d 231,
    257 n.12 (3d Cir. 1999) (emphasizing that in attacking the
    defendant's character for truthfulness "the government cannot make
    reference to Davis's forty-four day suspension or that Internal
    Affairs found that he lied about" an incident because "[s]uch
    evidence would not only be hearsay to the extent it contains
    assertion of fact, it would be inadmissible extrinsic evidence
    under Rule 608(b)"). See also Stephen A. Saltzburg, Impeaching the
    Witness: Prior Bad Acts and Extrinsic Evidence, 7 Crim. Just. 28,
    31 (Winter 1993) ("counsel should not be permitted to circumvent
    the no-extrinsic-evidence provision by tucking a third person's
    opinion about prior acts into a question asked of the witness who
    has denied the act.").
      For purposes of consistency the term "credibility" has been
    replaced by the term "character for truthfulness" in the last
    sentence of subdivision (b). The term "credibility" is also used in
    subdivision (a). But the Committee found it unnecessary to
    substitute "character for truthfulness" for "credibility" in Rule
    608(a), because subdivision (a)(1) already serves to limit
    impeachment to proof of such character.
      Rules 609(a) and 610 also use the term "credibility" when the
    intent of those Rules is to regulate impeachment of a witness'
    character for truthfulness. No inference should be derived from the
    fact that the Committee proposed an amendment to Rule 608(b) but
    not to Rules 609 and 610.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The last sentence of
    Rule 608(b) was changed to substitute the term "character for
    truthfulness" for the existing term "credibility." This change was
    made in accordance with public comment suggesting that it would be
    helpful to provide uniform terminology throughout Rule 608(b). A
    stylistic change was also made to the last sentence of Rule 608(b).

      (a) General Rule. For the purpose of attacking the character for
    truthfulness of a witness,
        (1) evidence that a witness other than an accused has been
      convicted of a crime shall be admitted, subject to Rule 403, if
      the crime was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of
      one year under the law under which the witness was convicted, and
      evidence that an accused has been convicted of such a crime shall
      be admitted if the court determines that the probative value of
      admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the
      accused; and
        (2) evidence that any witness has been convicted of a crime
      shall be admitted regardless of the punishment, if it readily can
      be determined that establishing the elements of the crime
      required proof or admission of an act of dishonesty or false
      statement by the witness.

      (b) Time Limit. Evidence of a conviction under this rule is not
    admissible if a period of more than ten years has elapsed since the
    date of the conviction or of the release of the witness from the
    confinement imposed for that conviction, whichever is the later
    date, unless the court determines, in the interests of justice,
    that the probative value of the conviction supported by specific
    facts and circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial
    effect. However, evidence of a conviction more than 10 years old as
    calculated herein, is not admissible unless the proponent gives to
    the adverse party sufficient advance written notice of intent to
    use such evidence to provide the adverse party with a fair
    opportunity to contest the use of such evidence.
      (c) Effect of Pardon, Annulment, or Certificate of
    Rehabilitation. Evidence of a conviction is not admissible under
    this rule if (1) the conviction has been the subject of a pardon,
    annulment, certificate of rehabilitation, or other equivalent
    procedure based on a finding of the rehabilitation of the person
    convicted, and that person has not been convicted of a subsequent
    crime that was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one
    year, or (2) the conviction has been the subject of a pardon,
    annulment, or other equivalent procedure based on a finding of
    innocence.
      (d) Juvenile Adjudications. Evidence of juvenile adjudications is
    generally not admissible under this rule. The court may, however,
    in a criminal case allow evidence of a juvenile adjudication of a
    witness other than the accused if conviction of the offense would
    be admissible to attack the credibility of an adult and the court
    is satisfied that admission in evidence is necessary for a fair
    determination of the issue of guilt or innocence.
      (e) Pendency of Appeal. The pendency of an appeal therefrom does
    not render evidence of a conviction inadmissible. Evidence of the
    pendency of an appeal is admissible.

               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      As a means of impeachment, evidence of conviction of crime is
    significant only because it stands as proof of the commission of
    the underlying criminal act. There is little dissent from the
    general proposition that at least some crimes are relevant to
    credibility but much disagreement among the cases and commentators
    about which crimes are usable for this purpose. See McCormick Sec.
    43; 2 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure; Criminal Sec. 416
    (1969). The weight of traditional authority has been to allow use
    of felonies generally, without regard to the nature of the
    particular offense, and of crimen falsi without regard to the grade
    of the offense. This is the view accepted by Congress in the 1970
    amendment of Sec. 14-305 of the District of Columbia Code, P.L. 91-
    358, 84 Stat. 473. Uniform Rule 21 and Model Code Rule 106 permit
    only crimes involving "dishonesty or false statement." Others have
    thought that the trial judge should have discretion to exclude
    convictions if the probative value of the evidence of the crime is
    substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Luck v.
    United States, 121 U.S.App.D.C. 151, 348 F.2d 763 (1965); McGowan,
    Impeachment of Criminal Defendants by Prior Convictions, 1970 Law &
    Soc. Order 1. Whatever may be the merits of those views, this rule
    is drafted to accord with the Congressional policy manifested in
    the 1970 legislation.
      The proposed rule incorporates certain basic safeguards, in terms
    applicable to all witnesses but of particular significance to an
    accused who elects to testify. These protections include the
    imposition of definite time limitations, giving effect to
    demonstrated rehabilitation, and generally excluding juvenile
    adjudications.
      Subdivision (a). For purposes of impeachment, crimes are divided
    into two categories by the rule: (1) those of what is generally
    regarded as felony grade, without particular regard to the nature
    of the offense, and (2) those involving dishonesty or false
    statement, without regard to the grade of the offense. Provable
    convictions are not limited to violations of federal law. By reason
    of our constitutional structure, the federal catalog of crimes is
    far from being a complete one, and resort must be had to the laws
    of the states for the specification of many crimes. For example,
    simple theft as compared with theft from interstate commerce. Other
    instances of borrowing are the Assimilative Crimes Act, making the
    state law of crimes applicable to the special territorial and
    maritime jurisdiction of the United States, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 13, and
    the provision of the Judicial Code disqualifying persons as jurors
    on the grounds of state as well as federal convictions, 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 1865. For evaluation of the crime in terms of seriousness,
    reference is made to the congressional measurement of felony
    (subject to imprisonment in excess of one year) rather than
    adopting state definitions which vary considerably. See 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 1865, supra, disqualifying jurors for conviction in state or
    federal court of crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one
    year.
      Subdivision (b). Few statutes recognize a time limit on
    impeachment by evidence of conviction. However, practical
    considerations of fairness and relevancy demand that some boundary
    be recognized. See Ladd, Credibility Tests - Current Trends, 89
    U.Pa.L.Rev. 166, 176-177 (1940). This portion of the rule is
    derived from the proposal advanced in Recommendation Proposing in
    Evidence Code, Sec. 788(5), p. 142, Cal.Law Rev.Comm'n (1965),
    though not adopted. See California Evidence Code Sec. 788.
      Subdivision (c). A pardon or its equivalent granted solely for
    the purpose of restoring civil rights lost by virtue of a
    conviction has no relevance to an inquiry into character. If,
    however, the pardon or other proceeding is hinged upon a showing of
    rehabilitation the situation is otherwise. The result under the
    rule is to render the conviction inadmissible. The alternative of
    allowing in evidence both the conviction and the rehabilitation has
    not been adopted for reasons of policy, economy of time, and
    difficulties of evaluation.
      A similar provision is contained in California Evidence Code Sec.
    788. Cf. A.L.I. Model Penal Code, Proposed Official Draft Sec.
    306.6(3)(e) (1962), and discussion in A.L.I. Proceedings 310
    (1961).
      Pardons based on innocence have the effect, of course, of
    nullifying the conviction ab initio.
      Subdivision (d). The prevailing view has been that a juvenile
    adjudication is not usable for impeachment. Thomas v. United
    States, 74 App.D.C. 167, 121 F.2d 905 (1941); Cotton v. United
    States, 355 F.2d 480 (10th Cir. 1966). This conclusion was based
    upon a variety of circumstances. By virtue of its informality,
    frequently diminished quantum of required proof, and other
    departures from accepted standards for criminal trials under the
    theory of parens patriae, the juvenile adjudication was considered
    to lack the precision and general probative value of the criminal
    conviction. While In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18
    L.Ed.2d 527 (1967), no doubt eliminates these characteristics
    insofar as objectionable, other obstacles remain. Practical
    problems of administration are raised by the common provisions in
    juvenile legislation that records be kept confidential and that
    they be destroyed after a short time. While Gault was skeptical as
    to the realities of confidentiality of juvenile records, it also
    saw no constitutional obstacles to improvement. 387 U.S. at 25, 87
    S.Ct. 1428. See also Note, Rights and Rehabilitation in the
    Juvenile Courts, 67 Colum.L.Rev. 281, 289 (1967). In addition,
    policy considerations much akin to those which dictate exclusion of
    adult convictions after rehabilitation has been established
    strongly suggest a rule of excluding juvenile adjudications.
    Admittedly, however, the rehabilitative process may in a given case
    be a demonstrated failure, or the strategic importance of a given
    witness may be so great as to require the overriding of general
    policy in the interests of particular justice. See Giles v.
    Maryland, 386 U.S. 66, 87 S.Ct. 793, 17 L.Ed.2d 737 (1967). Wigmore
    was outspoken in his condemnation of the disallowance of juvenile
    adjudications to impeach, especially when the witness is the
    complainant in a case of molesting a minor. 1 Wigmore Sec. 196; 3
    Id. Secs. 924a, 980. The rule recognizes discretion in the judge to
    effect an accommodation among these various factors by departing
    from the general principle of exclusion. In deference to the
    general pattern and policy of juvenile statutes, however, no
    discretion is accorded when the witness is the accused in a
    criminal case.
      Subdivision (e). The presumption of correctness which ought to
    attend judicial proceedings supports the position that pendency of
    an appeal does not preclude use of a conviction for impeachment.
    United States v. Empire Packing Co., 174 F.2d 16 (7th Cir. 1949),
    cert. denied 337 U.S. 959, 69 S.Ct. 1534, 93 L.Ed. 1758; Bloch v.
    United States, 226 F.2d 185 (9th Cir. 1955), cert. denied 350 U.S.
    948, 76 S.Ct. 323, 100 L.Ed. 826 and 353 U.S. 959, 77 S.Ct. 868, 1
    L.Ed.2d 910; and see Newman v. United States, 331 F.2d 968 (8th
    Cir. 1964), Contra, Campbell v. United States, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 133,
    176 F.2d 45 (1949). The pendency of an appeal is, however, a
    qualifying circumstance properly considerable.

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      Rule 609(a) as submitted by the Court was modeled after Section
    133(a) of Public Law 91-358, 14 D.C. Code 305(b)(1), enacted in
    1970. The Rule provided that:
      For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness,
    evidence that he has been convicted of a crime is admissible but
    only if the crime (1) was punishable by death or imprisonment in
    excess of one year under the law under which he was convicted or
    (2) involved dishonesty or false statement regardless of the
    punishment.
      As reported to the Committee by the Subcommittee, Rule 609(a) was
    amended to read as follows:
        For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness,
      evidence that he has been convicted of a crime is admissible only
      if the crime (1) was punishable by death or imprisonment in
      excess of one year, unless the court determines that the danger
      of unfair prejudice outweighs the probative value of the evidence
      of the conviction, or (2) involved dishonesty or false statement.
      In full committee, the provision was amended to permit attack
    upon the credibility of a witness by prior conviction only if the
    prior crime involved dishonesty or false statement. While
    recognizing that the prevailing doctrine in the federal courts and
    in most States allows a witness to be impeached by evidence of
    prior felony convictions without restriction as to type, the
    Committee was of the view that, because of the danger of unfair
    prejudice in such practice and the deterrent effect upon an accused
    who might wish to testify, and even upon a witness who was not the
    accused, cross-examination by evidence of prior conviction should
    be limited to those kinds of convictions bearing directly on
    credibility, i.e., crimes involving dishonesty or false statement.
      Rule 609(b) as submitted by the Court was modeled after Section
    133(a) of Public Law 91-358, 14 D.C. Code 305(b)(2)(B), enacted in
    1970. The Rule provided:
        Evidence of a conviction under this rule is not admissible if a
      period of more than ten years has elapsed since the date of the
      release of the witness from confinement imposed for his most
      recent conviction, or the expiration of the period of his parole,
      probation, or sentence granted or imposed with respect to his
      most recent conviction, whichever is the later date.
    Under this formulation, a witness' entire past record of criminal
    convictions could be used for impeachment (provided the conviction
    met the standard of subdivision (a)), if the witness had been most
    recently released from confinement, or the period of his parole or
    probation had expired, within ten years of the conviction.
      The Committee amended the Rule to read in the text of the 1971
    Advisory Committee version to provide that upon the expiration of
    ten years from the date of a conviction of a witness, or of his
    release from confinement for that offense, that conviction may no
    longer be used for impeachment. The Committee was of the view that
    after ten years following a person's release from confinement (or
    from the date of his conviction) the probative value of the
    conviction with respect to that person's credibility diminished to
    a point where it should no longer be admissible.
      Rule 609(c) as submitted by the Court provided in part that
    evidence of a witness' prior conviction is not admissible to attack
    his credibility if the conviction was the subject of a pardon,
    annulment, or other equivalent procedure, based on a showing of
    rehabilitation, and the witness has not been convicted of a
    subsequent crime. The Committee amended the Rule to provide that
    the "subsequent crime" must have been "punishable by death or
    imprisonment in excess of one year", on the ground that a
    subsequent conviction of an offense not a felony is insufficient to
    rebut the finding that the witness has been rehabilitated. The
    Committee also intends that the words "based on a finding of the
    rehabilitation of the person convicted" apply not only to
    "certificate of rehabilitation, or other equivalent procedure," but
    also to "pardon" and "annulment."

      NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, SENATE REPORT NO. 93-1277  
      As proposed by the Supreme Court, the rule would allow the use of
    prior convictions to impeach if the crime was a felony or a
    misdemeanor if the misdemeanor involved dishonesty or false
    statement. As modified by the House, the rule would admit prior
    convictions for impeachment purposes only if the offense, whether
    felony or misdemeanor, involved dishonesty or false statement.
      The committee has adopted a modified version of the House-passed
    rule. In your committee's view, the danger of unfair prejudice is
    far greater when the accused, as opposed to other witnesses,
    testifies, because the jury may be prejudiced not merely on the
    question of credibility but also on the ultimate question of guilt
    or innocence. Therefore, with respect to defendants, the committee
    agreed with the House limitation that only offenses involving false
    statement or dishonesty may be used. By that phrase, the committee
    means crimes such as perjury or subordination of perjury, false
    statement, criminal fraud, embezzlement or false pretense, or any
    other offense, in the nature of crimen falsi the commission of
    which involves some element of untruthfulness, deceit, or
    falsification bearing on the accused's propensity to testify
    truthfully.
      With respect to other witnesses, in addition to any prior
    conviction involving false statement or dishonesty, any other
    felony may be used to impeach if, and only if, the court finds that
    the probative value of such evidence outweighs its prejudicial
    effect against the party offering that witness.
      Notwithstanding this provision, proof of any prior offense
    otherwise admissible under rule 404 could still be offered for the
    purposes sanctioned by that rule. Furthermore, the committee
    intends that notwithstanding this rule, a defendant's
    misrepresentation regarding the existence or nature of prior
    convictions may be met by rebuttal evidence, including the record
    of such prior convictions. Similarly, such records may be offered
    to rebut representations made by the defendant regarding his
    attitude toward or willingness to commit a general category of
    offense, although denials or other representations by the defendant
    regarding the specific conduct which forms the basis of the charge
    against him shall not make prior convictions admissible to rebut
    such statement.
      In regard to either type of representation, of course, prior
    convictions may be offered in rebuttal only if the defendant's
    statement is made in response to defense counsel's questions or is
    made gratuitously in the course of cross-examination. Prior
    convictions may not be offered as rebuttal evidence if the
    prosecution has sought to circumvent the purpose of this rule by
    asking questions which elicit such representations from the
    defendant.
      One other clarifying amendment has been added to this subsection,
    that is, to provide that the admissibility of evidence of a prior
    conviction is permitted only upon cross-examination of a witness.
    It is not admissible if a person does not testify. It is to be
    understood, however, that a court record of a prior conviction is
    admissible to prove that conviction if the witness has forgotten or
    denies its existence.
      Although convictions over ten years old generally do not have
    much probative value, there may be exceptional circumstances under
    which the conviction substantially bears on the credibility of the
    witness. Rather than exclude all convictions over 10 years old, the
    committee adopted an amendment in the form of a final clause to the
    section granting the court discretion to admit convictions over 10
    years old, but only upon a determination by the court that the
    probative value of the conviction supported by specific facts and
    circumstances, substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.
      It is intended that convictions over 10 years old will be
    admitted very rarely and only in exceptional circumstances. The
    rules provide that the decision be supported by specific facts and
    circumstances thus requiring the court to make specific findings on
    the record as to the particular facts and circumstances it has
    considered in determining that the probative value of the
    conviction substantially outweighs its prejudicial impact. It is
    expected that, in fairness, the court will give the party against
    whom the conviction is introduced a full and adequate opportunity
    to contest its admission.

          NOTES OF CONFERENCE COMMITTEE, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-1597      
      Rule 609 defines when a party may use evidence of a prior
    conviction in order to impeach a witness. The Senate amendments
    make changes in two subsections of Rule 609.
      The House bill provides that the credibility of a witness can be
    attacked by proof of prior conviction of a crime only if the crime
    involves dishonesty or false statement. The Senate amendment
    provides that a witness' credibility may be attacked if the crime
    (1) was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year
    under the law under which he was convicted or (2) involves
    dishonesty or false statement, regardless of the punishment.
      The Conference adopts the Senate amendment with an amendment. The
    Conference amendment provides that the credibility of a witness,
    whether a defendant or someone else, may be attacked by proof of a
    prior conviction but only if the crime: (1) was punishable by death
    or imprisonment in excess of one year under the law under which he
    was convicted and the court determines that the probative value of
    the conviction outweighs its prejudicial effect to the defendant;
    or (2) involved dishonesty or false statement regardless of the
    punishment.
      By the phrase "dishonesty and false statement" the Conference
    means crimes such as perjury or subornation of perjury, false
    statement, criminal fraud, embezzlement, or false pretense, or any
    other offense in the nature of crimen falsi, the commission of
    which involves some element of deceit, untruthfulness, or
    falsification bearing on the accused's propensity to testify
    truthfully.
      The admission of prior convictions involving dishonesty and false
    statement is not within the discretion of the Court. Such
    convictions are peculiarly probative of credibility and, under this
    rule, are always to be admitted. Thus, judicial discretion granted
    with respect to the admissibility of other prior convictions is not
    applicable to those involving dishonesty or false statement.
      With regard to the discretionary standard established by
    paragraph (1) of rule 609(a), the Conference determined that the
    prejudicial effect to be weighed against the probative value of the
    conviction is specifically the prejudicial effect to the defendant.
    The danger of prejudice to a witness other than the defendant (such
    as injury to the witness' reputation in his community) was
    considered and rejected by the Conference as an element to be
    weighed in determining admissibility. It was the judgment of the
    Conference that the danger of prejudice to a nondefendant witness
    is outweighed by the need for the trier of fact to have as much
    relevant evidence on the issue of credibility as possible. Such
    evidence should only be excluded where it presents a danger of
    improperly influencing the outcome of the trial by persuading the
    trier of fact to convict the defendant on the basis of his prior
    criminal record.
      The House bill provides in subsection (b) that evidence of
    conviction of a crime may not be used for impeachment purposes
    under subsection (a) if more than ten years have elapsed since the
    date of the conviction or the date the witness was released from
    confinement imposed for the conviction, whichever is later. The
    Senate amendment permits the use of convictions older than ten
    years, if the court determines, in the interests of justice, that
    the probative value of the conviction, supported by specific facts
    and circumstances, substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.
      The Conference adopts the Senate amendment with an amendment
    requiring notice by a party that he intends to request that the
    court allow him to use a conviction older than ten years. The
    Conferees anticipate that a written notice, in order to give the
    adversary a fair opportunity to contest the use of the evidence,
    will ordinarily include such information as the date of the
    conviction, the jurisdiction, and the offense or statute involved.
    In order to eliminate the possibility that the flexibility of this
    provision may impair the ability of a party-opponent to prepare for
    trial, the Conferees intend that the notice provision operate to
    avoid surprise.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1990 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment to Rule 609(a) makes two changes in the rule. The
    first change removes from the rule the limitation that the
    conviction may only be elicited during cross-examination, a
    limitation that virtually every circuit has found to be
    inapplicable. It is common for witnesses to reveal on direct
    examination their convictions to "remove the sting" of the
    impeachment. See e.g., United States v. Bad Cob, 560 F.2d 877 (8th
    Cir. 1977). The amendment does not contemplate that a court will
    necessarily permit proof of prior convictions through testimony,
    which might be time-consuming and more prejudicial than proof
    through a written record. Rules 403 and 611(a) provide sufficient
    authority for the court to protect against unfair or disruptive
    methods of proof.
      The second change effected by the amendment resolves an ambiguity
    as to the relationship of Rules 609 and 403 with respect to
    impeachment of witnesses other than the criminal defendant. See,
    Green v. Bock Laundry Machine Co., 109 S. Ct. 1981, 490 U.S. 504
    (1989). The amendment does not disturb the special balancing test
    for the criminal defendant who chooses to testify. Thus, the rule
    recognizes that, in virtually every case in which prior convictions
    are used to impeach the testifying defendant, the defendant faces a
    unique risk of prejudice - i.e., the danger that convictions that
    would be excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 404 will be misused by a jury
    as propensity evidence despite their introduction solely for
    impeachment purposes. Although the rule does not forbid all use of
    convictions to impeach a defendant, it requires that the government
    show that the probative value of convictions as impeachment
    evidence outweighs their prejudicial effect.
      Prior to the amendment, the rule appeared to give the defendant
    the benefit of the special balancing test when defense witnesses
    other than the defendant were called to testify. In practice,
    however, the concern about unfairness to the defendant is most
    acute when the defendant's own convictions are offered as evidence.
    Almost all of the decided cases concern this type of impeachment,
    and the amendment does not deprive the defendant of any meaningful
    protection, since Rule 403 now clearly protects against unfair
    impeachment of any defense witness other than the defendant. There
    are cases in which a defendant might be prejudiced when a defense
    witness is impeached. Such cases may arise, for example, when the
    witness bears a special relationship to the defendant such that the
    defendant is likely to suffer some spill-over effect from
    impeachment of the witness.
      The amendment also protects other litigants from unfair
    impeachment of their witnesses. The danger of prejudice from the
    use of prior convictions is not confined to criminal defendants.
    Although the danger that prior convictions will be misused as
    character evidence is particularly acute when the defendant is
    impeached, the danger exists in other situations as well. The
    amendment reflects the view that it is desirable to protect all
    litigants from the unfair use of prior convictions, and that the
    ordinary balancing test of Rule 403, which provides that evidence
    shall not be excluded unless its prejudicial effect substantially
    outweighs its probative value, is appropriate for assessing the
    admissibility of prior convictions for impeachment of any witness
    other than a criminal defendant.
      The amendment reflects a judgment that decisions interpreting
    Rule 609(a) as requiring a trial court to admit convictions in
    civil cases that have little, if anything, to do with credibility
    reach undesirable results. See, e.g., Diggs v. Lyons, 741 F.2d 577
    (3d Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 105 S. Ct. 2157 (1985). The amendment
    provides the same protection against unfair prejudice arising from
    prior convictions used for impeachment purposes as the rules
    provide for other evidence. The amendment finds support in decided
    cases. See, e.g., Petty v. Ideco, 761 F.2d 1146 (5th Cir. 1985);
    Czaka v. Hickman, 703 F.2d 317 (8th Cir. 1983).
      Fewer decided cases address the question whether Rule 609(a)
    provides any protection against unduly prejudicial prior
    convictions used to impeach government witnesses. Some courts have
    read Rule 609(a) as giving the government no protection for its
    witnesses. See, e.g., United States v. Thorne, 547 F.2d 56 (8th
    Cir. 1976); United States v. Nevitt, 563 F.2d 406 (9th Cir. 1977),
    cert. denied, 444 U.S. 847 (1979). This approach also is rejected
    by the amendment. There are cases in which impeachment of
    government witnesses with prior convictions that have little, if
    anything, to do with credibility may result in unfair prejudice to
    the government's interest in a fair trial and unnecessary
    embarrassment to a witness. Fed.R.Evid. 412 already recognizes this
    and excluded certain evidence of past sexual behavior in the
    context of prosecutions for sexual assaults.
      The amendment applies the general balancing test of Rule 403 to
    protect all litigants against unfair impeachment of witnesses. The
    balancing test protects civil litigants, the government in criminal
    cases, and the defendant in a criminal case who calls other
    witnesses. The amendment addresses prior convictions offered under
    Rule 609, not for other purposes, and does not run afoul,
    therefore, of Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308 (1974). Davis involved
    the use of a prior juvenile adjudication not to prove a past law
    violation, but to prove bias. The defendant in a criminal case has
    the right to demonstrate the bias of a witness and to be assured a
    fair trial, but not to unduly prejudice a trier of fact. See
    generally Rule 412. In any case in which the trial court believes
    that confrontation rights require admission of impeachment
    evidence, obviously the Constitution would take precedence over the
    rule.
      The probability that prior convictions of an ordinary government
    witness will be unduly prejudicial is low in most criminal cases.
    Since the behavior of the witness is not the issue in dispute in
    most cases, there is little chance that the trier of fact will
    misuse the convictions offered as impeachment evidence as
    propensity evidence. Thus, trial courts will be skeptical when the
    government objects to impeachment of its witnesses with prior
    convictions. Only when the government is able to point to a real
    danger of prejudice that is sufficient to outweigh substantially
    the probative value of the conviction for impeachment purposes will
    the conviction be excluded.
      The amendment continues to divide subdivision (a) into
    subsections (1) and (2) thus facilitating retrieval under current
    computerized research programs which distinguish the two
    provisions. The Committee recommended no substantive change in
    subdivision (a)(2), even though some cases raise a concern about
    the proper interpretation of the words "dishonesty or false
    statement." These words were used but not explained in the original
    Advisory Committee Note accompanying Rule 609. Congress extensively
    debated the rule, and the Report of the House and Senate Conference
    Committee states that "[b]y the phrase 'dishonesty and false
    statement,' the Conference means crimes such as perjury,
    subornation of perjury, false statement, criminal fraud,
    embezzlement, or false pretense, or any other offense in the nature
    of crimen falsi, commission of which involves some element of
    deceit, untruthfulness, or falsification bearing on the accused's
    propensity to testify truthfully." The Advisory Committee concluded
    that the Conference Report provides sufficient guidance to trial
    courts and that no amendment is necessary, notwithstanding some
    decisions that take an unduly broad view of "dishonesty," admitting
    convictions such as for bank robbery or bank larceny. Subsection
    (a)(2) continues to apply to any witness, including a criminal
    defendant.
      Finally, the Committee determined that it was unnecessary to add
    to the rule language stating that, when a prior conviction is
    offered under Rule 609, the trial court is to consider the
    probative value of the prior conviction for impeachment, not for
    other purposes. The Committee concluded that the title of the rule,
    its first sentence, and its placement among the impeachment rules
    clearly establish that evidence offered under Rule 609 is offered
    only for purposes of impeachment.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      The amendment provides that Rule 609(a)(2) mandates the admission
    of evidence of a conviction only when the conviction required the
    proof of (or in the case of a guilty plea, the admission of) an act
    of dishonesty or false statement. Evidence of all other convictions
    is inadmissible under this subsection, irrespective of whether the
    witness exhibited dishonesty or made a false statement in the
    process of the commission of the crime of conviction. Thus,
    evidence that a witness was convicted for a crime of violence, such
    as murder, is not admissible under Rule 609(a)(2), even if the
    witness acted deceitfully in the course of committing the crime.
      The amendment is meant to give effect to the legislative intent
    to limit the convictions that are to be automatically admitted
    under subdivision (a)(2). The Conference Committee provided that by
    "dishonesty and false statement" it meant "crimes such as perjury,
    subornation of perjury, false statement, criminal fraud,
    embezzlement, or false pretense, or any other offense in the nature
    of crimen falsi, the commission of which involves some element of
    deceit, untruthfulness, or falsification bearing on the [witness's]
    propensity to testify truthfully." Historically, offenses
    classified as crimina falsi have included only those crimes in
    which the ultimate criminal act was itself an act of deceit. See
    Green, Deceit and the Classification of Crimes: Federal Rule of
    Evidence 609(a)(2) and the Origins of Crimen Falsi, 90 J. Crim. L.
    & Criminology 1087 (2000).
      Evidence of crimes in the nature of crimina falsi must be
    admitted under Rule 609(a)(2), regardless of how such crimes are
    specifically charged. For example, evidence that a witness was
    convicted of making a false claim to a federal agent is admissible
    under this subdivision regardless of whether the crime was charged
    under a section that expressly references deceit (e.g., 18 U.S.C.
    Sec. 1001, Material Misrepresentation to the Federal Government) or
    a section that does not (e.g., 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1503, Obstruction of
    Justice).
      The amendment requires that the proponent have ready proof that
    the conviction required the factfinder to find, or the defendant to
    admit, an act of dishonesty or false statement. Ordinarily, the
    statutory elements of the crime will indicate whether it is one of
    dishonesty or false statement. Where the deceitful nature of the
    crime is not apparent from the statute and the face of the judgment
    - as, for example, where the conviction simply records a finding of
    guilt for a statutory offense that does not reference deceit
    expressly - a proponent may offer information such as an
    indictment, a statement of admitted facts, or jury instructions to
    show that the factfinder had to find, or the defendant had to
    admit, an act of dishonesty or false statement in order for the
    witness to have been convicted. Cf. Taylor v. United States, 495
    U.S. 575, 602 (1990) (providing that a trial court may look to a
    charging instrument or jury instructions to ascertain the nature of
    a prior offense where the statute is insufficiently clear on its
    face); Shepard v. United States, 125 S.Ct. 1254 (2005) (the inquiry
    to determine whether a guilty plea to a crime defined by a
    nongeneric statute necessarily admitted elements of the generic
    offense was limited to the charging document's terms, the terms of
    a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and
    defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by
    the defendant, or a comparable judicial record). But the amendment
    does not contemplate a "mini-trial" in which the court plumbs the
    record of the previous proceeding to determine whether the crime
    was in the nature of crimen falsi.
      The amendment also substitutes the term "character for
    truthfulness" for the term "credibility" in the first sentence of
    the Rule. The limitations of Rule 609 are not applicable if a
    conviction is admitted for a purpose other than to prove the
    witness's character for untruthfulness. See, e.g., United States v.
    Lopez, 979 F.2d 1024 (5th Cir. 1992) (Rule 609 was not applicable
    where the conviction was offered for purposes of contradiction).
    The use of the term "credibility" in subdivision (d) is retained,
    however, as that subdivision is intended to govern the use of a
    juvenile adjudication for any type of impeachment.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The language of the
    proposed amendment was changed to provide that convictions are
    automatically admitted only if it readily can be determined that
    the elements of the crime, as proved or admitted, required an act
    of dishonesty or false statement by the witness.

    the prohibition. Thus disclosure of affiliation with a church which
    is a party to the litigation would be allowable under the rule. Cf.

    Rule 611. Mode and Order of Interrogation and Presentation

-STATUTE-
      (a) Control by Court. The court shall exercise reasonable control
    over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting
    evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation
    effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless
    consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or
    undue embarrassment.
      (b) Scope of Cross-Examination. Cross-examination should be
    limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters
    affecting the credibility of the witness. The court may, in the
    exercise of discretion, permit inquiry into additional matters as
    if on direct examination.
      (c) Leading Questions. Leading questions should not be used on
    the direct examination of a witness except as may be necessary to
    develop the witness' testimony. Ordinarily leading questions should
    be permitted on cross-examination. When a party calls a hostile
    witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse
    party, interrogation may be by leading questions.

-MISC1-
               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      Subdivision (a). Spelling out detailed rules to govern the mode
    and order of interrogating witnesses presenting evidence is neither
    desirable nor feasible. The ultimate responsibility for the
    effective working of the adversary system rests with the judge. The
    rule sets forth the objectives which he should seek to attain.
      Item (1) restates in broad terms the power and obligation of the
    judge as developed under common law principles. It covers such
    concerns as whether testimony shall be in the form of a free
    narrative or responses to specific questions, McCormick Sec. 5, the
    order of calling witnesses and presenting evidence, 6 Wigmore Sec.
    1867, the use of demonstrative evidence, McCormick Sec. 179, and
    the many other questions arising during the course of a trial which
    can be solved only by the judge's common sense and fairness in view
    of the particular circumstances.
      Item (2) is addressed to avoidance of needless consumption of
    time, a matter of daily concern in the disposition of cases. A
    companion piece is found in the discretion vested in the judge to
    exclude evidence as a waste of time in Rule 403(b).
      Item (3) calls for a judgement under the particular circumstances
    whether interrogation tactics entail harassment or undue
    embarrassment. Pertinent circumstances include the importance of
    the testimony, the nature of the inquiry, its relevance to
    credibility, waste of time, and confusion. McCormick Sec. 42. In
    Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687, 694, 51 S.Ct. 218, 75 L.Ed.
    624 (1931), the Court pointed out that, while the trial judge
    should protect the witness from questions which "go beyond the
    bounds of proper cross-examination merely to harass, annoy or
    humiliate," this protection by no means forecloses efforts to
    discredit the witness. Reference to the transcript of the
    prosecutor's cross-examination in Berger v. United States, 295 U.S.
    78, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935), serves to lay at rest any
    doubts as to the need for judicial control in this area.
      The inquiry into specific instances of conduct of a witness
    allowed under Rule 608(b) is, of course, subject to this rule.
      Subdivision (b). The tradition in the federal courts and in
    numerous state courts has been to limit the scope of cross-
    examination to matters testified to on direct, plus matters
    bearing upon the credibility of the witness. Various reasons have
    been advanced to justify the rule of limited cross-examination. (1)
    A party vouches for his own witness but only to the extent of
    matters elicited on direct. Resurrection Gold Mining Co. v. Fortune
    Gold Mining Co., 129 F. 668, 675 (8th Cir. 1904), quoted in
    Maguire, Weinstein, et al., Cases on Evidence 277, n. 38 (5th ed.
    1965). But the concept of vouching is discredited, and Rule 607
    rejects it. (2) A party cannot ask his own witness leading
    questions. This is a problem properly solved in terms of what is
    necessary for a proper development of the testimony rather than by
    a mechanistic formula similar to the vouching concept. See
    discussion under subdivision (c). (3) A practice of limited cross-
    examination promotes orderly presentation of the case. Finch v.
    Weiner, 109 Conn. 616, 145 A. 31 (1929). While this latter reason
    has merit, the matter is essentially one of the order of
    presentation and not one in which involvement at the appellate
    level is likely to prove fruitful. See for example, Moyer v. Aetna
    Life Ins. Co., 126 F.2d 141 (3rd Cir. 1942); Butler v. New York
    Central R. Co., 253 F.2d 281 (7th Cir. 1958); United States v.
    Johnson, 285 F.2d 35 (9th Cir. 1960); Union Automobile Indemnity
    Ass'n. v. Capitol Indemnity Ins. Co., 310 F.2d 318 (7th Cir. 1962).
    In evaluating these considerations, McCormick says:
      "The foregoing considerations favoring the wide-open or
    restrictive rules may well be thought to be fairly evenly balanced.
    There is another factor, however, which seems to swing the balance
    overwhelmingly in favor of the wide-open rule. This is the
    consideration of economy of time and energy. Obviously, the wide-
    open rule presents little or no opportunity for dispute in its
    application. The restrictive practice in all its forms, on the
    other hand, is productive in many court rooms, of continual
    bickering over the choice of the numerous variations of the 'scope
    of the direct' criterion, and of their application to particular
    cross-questions. These controversies are often reventilated on
    appeal, and reversals for error in their determination are
    frequent. Observance of these vague and ambiguous restrictions is a
    matter of constant and hampering concern to the cross-examiner. If
    these efforts, delays and misprisions were the necessary incidents
    to the guarding of substantive rights or the fundamentals of fair
    trial, they might be worth the cost. As the price of the choice of
    an obviously debatable regulation of the order of evidence, the
    sacrifice seems misguided. The American Bar Association's Committee
    for the Improvement of the Law of Evidence for the year 1937-38
    said this:
      "The rule limiting cross-examination to the precise subject of
    the direct examination is probably the most frequent rule (except
    the Opinion rule) leading in the trial practice today to refined
    and technical quibbles which obstruct the progress of the trial,
    confuse the jury, and give rise to appeal on technical grounds
    only. Some of the instances in which Supreme Courts have ordered
    new trials for the mere transgression of this rule about the order
    of evidence have been astounding.
      "We recommend that the rule allowing questions upon any part of
    the issue known to the witness * * * be adopted. * * *' "
    McCormick, Sec. 27, p. 51. See also 5 Moore's Federal Practice
    &#182; 43.10 (2nd ed. 1964).
      The provision of the second sentence, that the judge may in the
    interests of justice limit inquiry into new matters on cross-
    examination, is designed for those situations in which the result
    otherwise would be confusion, complication, or protraction of the
    case, not as a matter of rule but as demonstrable in the actual
    development of the particular case.
      The rule does not purport to determine the extent to which an
    accused who elects to testify thereby waives his privilege against
    self-incrimination. The question is a constitutional one, rather
    than a mere matter of administering the trial. Under Simmons v.
    United States, 390 U.S. 377, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968),
    no general waiver occurs when the accused testifies on such
    preliminary matters as the validity of a search and seizure or the
    admissibility of a confession. Rule 104(d), supra. When he
    testifies on the merits, however, can he foreclose inquiry into an
    aspect or element of the crime by avoiding it on direct? The
    affirmative answer given in Tucker v. United States, 5 F.2d 818
    (8th Cir. 1925), is inconsistent with the description of the waiver
    as extending to "all other relevant facts" in Johnson v. United
    States, 318 U.S. 189, 195, 63 S.Ct. 549, 87 L.Ed. 704 (1943). See
    also Brown v. United States, 356 U.S. 148, 78 S.Ct. 622, 2 L.Ed.2d
    589 (1958). The situation of an accused who desires to testify on
    some but not all counts of a multiple-count indictment is one to be
    approached, in the first instance at least, as a problem of
    severance under Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
    Cross v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 324, 335 F.2d 987 (1964).
    Cf. United States v. Baker, 262 F.Supp. 657, 686 (D.D.C. 1966). In
    all events, the extent of the waiver of the privilege against self-
    incrimination ought not to be determined as a by-product of a rule
    on scope of cross-examination.
      Subdivision (c). The rule continues the traditional view that the
    suggestive powers of the leading question are as a general
    proposition undesirable. Within this tradition, however, numerous
    exceptions have achieved recognition: The witness who is hostile,
    unwilling, or biased; the child witness or the adult with
    communication problems; the witness whose recollection is
    exhausted; and undisputed preliminary matters. 3 Wigmore Sec. Sec.
    774-778. An almost total unwillingness to reverse for infractions
    has been manifested by appellate courts. See cases cited in 3
    Wigmore Sec. 770. The matter clearly falls within the area of
    control by the judge over the mode and order of interrogation and
    presentation and accordingly is phrased in words of suggestion
    rather than command.
      The rule also conforms to tradition in making the use of leading
    questions on cross-examination a matter of right. The purpose of
    the qualification "ordinarily" is to furnish a basis for denying
    the use of leading questions when the cross-examination is cross-
    examination in form only and not in fact, as for example the
    "cross-examination" of a party by his own counsel after being
    called by the opponent (savoring more of re-direct) or of an
    insured defendant who proves to be friendly to the plaintiff.
      The final sentence deals with categories of witnesses
    automatically regarded and treated as hostile. Rule 43(b) of the
    Federal Rules of Civil Procedure has included only "an adverse
    party or an officer, director, or managing agent of a public or
    private corporation or of a partnership or association which is an
    adverse party." This limitation virtually to persons whose
    statements would stand as admissions is believed to be an unduly
    narrow concept of those who may safely be regarded as hostile
    without further demonstration. See, for example, Maryland Casualty
    Co. v. Kador, 225 F.2d 120 (5th Cir. 1955), and Degelos v. Fidelity
    and Casualty Co., 313 F.2d 809 (5th Cir. 1963), holding despite the
    language of Rule 43(b) that an insured fell within it, though not a
    party in an action under the Louisiana direct action statute. The
    phrase of the rule, "witness identified with" an adverse party, is
    designed to enlarge the category of persons thus callable.

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      As submitted by the Court, Rule 611(b) provided:
      A witness may be cross-examined on any matter relevant to any
    issue in the case, including credibility. In the interests of
    justice, the judge may limit cross-examination with respect to
    matters not testified to on direct examination.
      The Committee amended this provision to return to the rule which
    prevails in the federal courts and thirty-nine State jurisdictions.
    As amended, the Rule is in the text of the 1969 Advisory Committee
    draft. It limits cross-examination to credibility and to matters
    testified to on direct examination, unless the judge permits more,
    in which event the cross-examiner must proceed as if on direct
    examination. This traditional rule facilitates orderly presentation
    by each party at trial. Further, in light of existing discovery
    procedures, there appears to be no need to abandon the traditional
    rule.
      The third sentence of Rule 611(c) as submitted by the Court
    provided that:
        In civil cases, a party is entitled to call an adverse party or
      witness identified with him and interrogate by leading questions.
      The Committee amended this Rule to permit leading questions to be
    used with respect to any hostile witness, not only an adverse party
    or person identified with such adverse party. The Committee also
    substituted the word "When" for the phrase "In civil cases" to
    reflect the possibility that in criminal cases a defendant may be
    entitled to call witnesses identified with the government, in which
    event the Committee believed the defendant should be permitted to
    inquire with leading questions.

      NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, SENATE REPORT NO. 93-1277  
      Rule 611(b) as submitted by the Supreme Court permitted a broad
    scope of cross-examination: "cross-examination on any matter
    relevant to any issue in the case" unless the judge, in the
    interests of justice, limited the scope of cross-examination.
      The House narrowed the Rule to the more traditional practice of
    limiting cross-examination to the subject matter of direct
    examination (and credibility), but with discretion in the judge to
    permit inquiry into additional matters in situations where that
    would aid in the development of the evidence or otherwise
    facilitate the conduct of the trial.
      The committee agrees with the House amendment. Although there are
    good arguments in support of broad cross-examination from
    perspectives of developing all relevant evidence, we believe the
    factors of insuring an orderly and predictable development of the
    evidence weigh in favor of the narrower rule, especially when
    discretion is given to the trial judge to permit inquiry into
    additional matters. The committee expressly approves this
    discretion and believes it will permit sufficient flexibility
    allowing a broader scope of cross-examination whenever appropriate.
      The House amendment providing broader discretionary cross-
    examination permitted inquiry into additional matters only as if
    on direct examination. As a general rule, we concur with this
    limitation, however, we would understand that this limitation would
    not preclude the utilization of leading questions if the conditions
    of subsection (c) of this rule were met, bearing in mind the
    judge's discretion in any case to limit the scope of cross-
    examination [see McCormick on Evidence, Secs. 24-26 (especially
    24) (2d ed. 1972)].
      Further, the committee has received correspondence from Federal
    judges commenting on the applicability of this rule to section 1407
    of title 28. It is the committee's judgment that this rule as
    reported by the House is flexible enough to provide sufficiently
    broad cross-examination in appropriate situations in multidistrict
    litigation.
      As submitted by the Supreme Court, the rule provided: "In civil
    cases, a party is entitled to call an adverse party or witness
    identified with him and interrogate by leading questions."
      The final sentence of subsection (c) was amended by the House for
    the purpose of clarifying the fact that a "hostile witness" - that
    is a witness who is hostile in fact - could be subject to
    interrogation by leading questions. The rule as submitted by the
    Supreme Court declared certain witnesses hostile as a matter of law
    and thus subject to interrogation by leading questions without any
    showing of hostility in fact. These were adverse parties or
    witnesses identified with adverse parties. However, the wording of
    the first sentence of subsection (c) while generally, prohibiting
    the use of leading questions on direct examination, also provides
    "except as may be necessary to develop his testimony." Further, the
    first paragraph of the Advisory Committee note explaining the
    subsection makes clear that they intended that leading questions
    could be asked of a hostile witness or a witness who was unwilling
    or biased and even though that witness was not associated with an
    adverse party. Thus, we question whether the House amendment was
    necessary.
      However, concluding that it was not intended to affect the
    meaning of the first sentence of the subsection and was intended
    solely to clarify the fact that leading questions are permissible
    in the interrogation of a witness, who is hostile in fact, the
    committee accepts that House amendment.
      The final sentence of this subsection was also amended by the
    House to cover criminal as well as civil cases. The committee
    accepts this amendment, but notes that it may be difficult in
    criminal cases to determine when a witness is "identified with an
    adverse party," and thus the rule should be applied with caution.

-STATUTE-
      Except as otherwise provided in criminal proceedings by section
    3500 of title 18, United States Code, if a witness uses a writing
    to refresh memory for the purpose of testifying, either - 
        (1) while testifying, or
        (2) before testifying, if the court in its discretion
      determines it is necessary in the interests of justice,

    an adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced at the
    hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the witness thereon, and
    to introduce in evidence those portions which relate to the
    testimony of the witness. If it is claimed that the writing
    contains matters not related to the subject matter of the testimony
    the court shall examine the writing in camera, excise any portions
    not so related, and order delivery of the remainder to the party
    entitled thereto. Any portion withheld over objections shall be
    preserved and made available to the appellate court in the event of
    an appeal. If a writing is not produced or delivered pursuant to
    order under this rule, the court shall make any order justice
    requires, except that in criminal cases when the prosecution elects
    not to comply, the order shall be one striking the testimony or, if
    the court in its discretion determines that the interests of
    justice so require, declaring a mistrial.

               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      The treatment of writings used to refresh recollection while on
    the stand is in accord with settled doctrine. McCormick Sec. 9, p.
    15. The bulk of the case law has, however, denied the existence of
    any right to access by the opponent when the writing is used prior
    to taking the stand, though the judge may have discretion in the
    matter. Goldman v. United States, 316 U.S. 129, 62 S.Ct. 993, 86
    L.Ed. 1322 (1942); Needelman v. United States, 261 F.2d 802 (5th
    Cir. 1958), cert. dismissed 362 U.S. 600, 80 S.Ct. 960, 4 L.Ed.2d
    980, rehearing denied 363 U.S. 858, 80 S.Ct. 1606, 4 L.Ed.2d 1739,
    Annot., 82 A.L.R.2d 473, 562 and 7 A.L.R.3d 181, 247. An increasing
    group of cases has repudiated the distinction, People v. Scott, 29
    Ill.2d 97, 193 N.E.2d 814 (1963); State v. Mucci, 25 N.J. 423, 136
    A.2d 761 (1957); State v. Hunt, 25 N.J. 514, 138 A.2d 1 (1958);
    State v. Desolvers, 40 R.I. 89, 100, A. 64 (1917), and this
    position is believed to be correct. As Wigmore put it, "the risk of
    imposition and the need of safeguard is just as great" in both
    situations. 3 Wigmore Sec. 762, p. 111. To the same effect is
    McCormick Sec. 9, p. 17.
      The purpose of the phrase "for the purpose of testifying" is to
    safeguard against using the rule as a pretext for wholesale
    exploration of an opposing party's files and to insure that access
    is limited only to those writings which may fairly be said in fact
    to have an impact upon the testimony of the witness.
      The purpose of the rule is the same as that of the Jencks
    statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3500: to promote the search of credibility
    and memory. The same sensitivity to disclosure of government files
    may be involved; hence the rule is expressly made subject to the
    statute, subdivision (a) of which provides: "In any criminal
    prosecution brought by the United States, no statement or report in
    the possession of the United States which was made by a Government
    witness or prospective Government witness (other than the
    defendant) shall be the subject of a subpena, discovery, or
    inspection until said witness has testified on direct examination
    in the trial of the case." Items falling within the purview of the
    statute are producible only as provided by its terms, Palermo v.
    United States, 360 U.S. 343, 351 (1959), and disclosure under the
    rule is limited similarly by the statutory conditions. With this
    limitation in mind, some differences of application may be noted.
    The Jencks statute applies only to statements of witnesses; the
    rule is not so limited. The statute applies only to criminal cases;
    the rule applies to all cases. The statute applies only to
    government witnesses; the rule applies to all witnesses. The
    statute contains no requirement that the statement be consulted for
    purposes of refreshment before or while testifying; the rule so
    requires. Since many writings would qualify under either statute or
    rule, a substantial overlap exists, but the identity of procedures
    makes this of no importance.
      The consequences of nonproduction by the government in a criminal
    case are those of the Jencks statute, striking the testimony or in
    exceptional cases a mistrial. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3500(d). In other
    cases these alternatives are unduly limited, and such possibilities
    as contempt, dismissal, finding issues against the offender, and
    the like are available. See Rule 16(g) of the Federal Rules of
    Criminal Procedure and Rule 37(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil
    Procedure for appropriate sanctions.

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      As submitted to Congress, Rule 612 provided that except as set
    forth in 18 U.S.C. 3500, if a witness uses a writing to refresh his
    memory for the purpose of testifying, "either before or while
    testifying," an adverse party is entitled to have the writing
    produced at the hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the
    witness on it, and to introduce in evidence those portions relating
    to the witness' testimony. The Committee amended the Rule so as
    still to require the production of writings used by a witness while
    testifying, but to render the production of writings used by a
    witness to refresh his memory before testifying discretionary with
    the court in the interests of justice, as is the case under
    existing federal law. See Goldman v. United States, 316 U.S. 129
    (1942). The Committee considered that permitting an adverse party
    to require the production of writings used before testifying could
    result in fishing expeditions among a multitude of papers which a
    witness may have used in preparing for trial.
      The Committee intends that nothing in the Rule be construed as
    barring the assertion of a privilege with respect to writings used
    by a witness to refresh his memory.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Examining Witness Concerning Prior Statement. In examining a
    witness concerning a prior statement made by the witness, whether
    written or not, the statement need not be shown nor its contents
    disclosed to the witness at that time, but on request the same
    shall be shown or disclosed to opposing counsel.
      (b) Extrinsic Evidence of Prior Inconsistent Statement of
    Witness. Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a
    witness is not admissible unless the witness is afforded an
    opportunity to explain or deny the same and the opposite party is
    afforded an opportunity to interrogate the witness thereon, or the
    interests of justice otherwise require. This provision does not
    apply to admissions of a party-opponent as defined in rule
    801(d)(2).

-MISC1-
               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      Subdivision (a). The Queen's Case, 2 Br. & B. 284, 129 Eng. Rep.
    976 (1820), laid down the requirement that a cross-examiner, prior
    to questioning the witness about his own prior statement in
    writing, must first show it to the witness. Abolished by statute in
    the country of its origin, the requirement nevertheless gained
    currency in the United States. The rule abolishes this useless
    impediment, to cross-examination. Ladd, Some Observations on
    Credibility: Impeachment of Witnesses, 52 Cornell L.Q. 239, 246-247
    (1967); McCormick Sec. 28; 4 Wigmore Secs. 1259-1260. Both oral and
    written statements are included.
      The provision for disclosure to counsel is designed to protect
    against unwarranted insinuations that a statement has been made
    when the fact is to the contrary.
      The rule does not defeat the application of Rule 1002 relating to
    production of the original when the contents of a writing are
    sought to be proved. Nor does it defeat the application of Rule
    26(b)(3) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, as revised, entitling a
    person on request to a copy of his own statement, though the
    operation of the latter may be suspended temporarily.
      Subdivision (b). The familiar foundation requirement that an
    impeaching statement first be shown to the witness before it can be
    proved by extrinsic evidence is preserved but with some
    modifications. See Ladd, Some Observations on Credibility:
    Impeachment of Witnesses, 52 Cornell L.Q. 239, 247 (1967). The
    traditional insistence that the attention of the witness be
    directed to the statement on cross-examination is relaxed in favor
    of simply providing the witness an opportunity to explain and the
    opposite party an opportunity to examine on the statement, with no
    specification of any particular time or sequence. Under this
    procedure, several collusive witnesses can be examined before
    disclosure of a joint prior inconsistent statement. See Comment to
    California Evidence Code Sec. 770. Also, dangers of oversight are
    reduced.
      See McCormick Sec. 37, p. 68.
      In order to allow for such eventualities as the witness becoming
    unavailable by the time the statement is discovered, a measure of
    discretion is conferred upon the judge. Similar provisions are
    found in California Evidence Code Sec. 770 and New Jersey Evidence
    Rule 22(b).
      Under principles of expression unius the rule does not apply to
    impeachment by evidence of prior inconsistent conduct. The use of
    inconsistent statements to impeach a hearsay declaration is treated
    in Rule 806.

    to cross-examine witnesses thus called.

    whether called by itself or by a party.
      (c) Objections. Objections to the calling of witnesses by the
    court or to interrogation by it may be made at the time or at the
    next available opportunity when the jury is not present.

-MISC1-
               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      Subdivision (a). While exercised more frequently in criminal than
    in civil cases, the authority of the judge to call witnesses is
    well established. McCormick Sec. 8, p. 14; Maguire, Weinstein, et
    al., Cases on Evidence 303-304 (5th ed. 1965); 9 Wigmore Sec. 2484.
    One reason for the practice, the old rule against impeaching one's
    own witness, no longer exists by virtue of Rule 607, supra. Other
    reasons remain, however, to justify the continuation of the
    practice of calling court's witnesses. The right to cross-examine,
    with all it implies, is assured. The tendency of juries to
    associate a witness with the party calling him, regardless of
    technical aspects of vouching, is avoided. And the judge is not
    imprisoned within the case as made by the parties.
      Subdivision (b). The authority of the judge to question witnesses
    is also well established. McCormick Sec. 8, pp. 12-13; Maguire,
    Weinstein, et al., Cases on Evidence 737-739 (5th ed. 1965); 3
    Wigmore Sec. 784. The authority is, of course, abused when the
    judge abandons his proper role and assumes that of advocate, but
    the manner in which interrogation should be conducted and the
    proper extent of its exercise are not susceptible of formulation in
    a rule. The omission in no sense precludes courts of review from
    continuing to reverse for abuse.
      Subdivision (c). The provision relating to objections is designed
    to relieve counsel of the embarrassment attendant upon objecting to
    questions by the judge in the presence of the jury, while at the
    same time assuring that objections are made in apt time to afford
    the opportunity to take possible corrective measures. Compare the
    "automatic" objection feature of Rule 605 when the judge is called
    as a witness.

               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      The efficacy of excluding or sequestering witnesses has long been
    recognized as a means of discouraging and exposing fabrication,
    inaccuracy, and collusion. 6 Wigmore Secs. 1837-1838. The authority
    of the judge is admitted, the only question being whether the
    matter is committed to his discretion or one of right. The rule
    takes the latter position. No time is specified for making the
    request.
      Several categories of persons are excepted. (1) Exclusion of
    persons who are parties would raise serious problems of
    confrontation and due process. Under accepted practice they are not
    subject to exclusion. 6 Wigmore Sec. 1841. (2) As the equivalent of
    the right of a natural-person party to be present, a party which is
    not a natural person is entitled to have a representative present.
    Most of the cases have involved allowing a police officer who has
    been in charge of an investigation to remain in court despite the
    fact that he will be a witness. United States v. Infanzon, 235 F.2d
    318 (2d Cir. 1956); Portomene v. United States, 221 F.2d 582 (5th
    Cir. 1955); Powell v. United States, 208 F.2d 618 (6th Cir. 1953);
    Jones v. United States, 252 F.Supp. 781 (W.D.Okl. 1966).
    Designation of the representative by the attorney rather than by
    the client may at first glance appear to be an inversion of the
    attorney-client relationship, but it may be assumed that the
    attorney will follow the wishes of the client, and the solution is
    simple and workable. See California Evidence Code Sec. 777. (3) The
    category contemplates such persons as an agent who handled the
    transaction being litigated or an expert needed to advise counsel
    in the management of the litigation. See 6 Wigmore Sec. 1841, n. 4.

      NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, SENATE REPORT NO. 93-1277  
      Many district courts permit government counsel to have an
    investigative agent at counsel table throughout the trial although
    the agent is or may be a witness. The practice is permitted as an
    exception to the rule of exclusion and compares with the situation
    defense counsel finds himself in - he always has the client with
    him to consult during the trial. The investigative agent's presence
    may be extremely important to government counsel, especially when
    the case is complex or involves some specialized subject matter.
    The agent, too, having lived with the case for a long time, may be
    able to assist in meeting trial surprises where the best-prepared
    counsel would otherwise have difficulty. Yet, it would not seem the
    Government could often meet the burden under rule 615 of showing
    that the agent's presence is essential. Furthermore, it could be
    dangerous to use the agent as a witness as early in the case as
    possible, so that he might then help counsel as a nonwitness, since
    the agent's testimony could be needed in rebuttal. Using another,
    nonwitness agent from the same investigative agency would not
    generally meet government counsel's needs.
      This problem is solved if it is clear that investigative agents
    are within the group specified under the second exception made in
    the rule, for "an officer or employee of a party which is not a
    natural person designated as its representative by its attorney."
    It is our understanding that this was the intention of the House
    committee. It is certainly this committee's construction of the
    rule.

    Rule 701. Opinion Testimony by Lay Witnesses

-STATUTE-
      If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness'
    testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those
    opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the
    perception of the witness, and (b) helpful to a clear understanding
    of the witness' testimony or the determination of a fact in issue,
    and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized
    knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.

               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      The rule retains the traditional objective of putting the trier
    of fact in possession of an accurate reproduction of the event.
      Limitation (a) is the familiar requirement of first-hand
    knowledge or observation.
      Limitation (b) is phrased in terms of requiring testimony to be
    helpful in resolving issues. Witnesses often find difficulty in
    expressing themselves in language which is not that of an opinion
    or conclusion. While the courts have made concessions in certain
    recurring situations, necessity as a standard for permitting
    opinions and conclusions has proved too elusive and too unadaptable
    to particular situations for purposes of satisfactory judicial
    administration. McCormick Sec. 11. Moreover, the practical
    impossibility of determinating by rule what is a "fact,"
    demonstrated by a century of litigation of the question of what is
    a fact for purposes of pleading under the Field Code, extends into
    evidence also. 7 Wigmore Sec. 1919. The rule assumes that the
    natural characteristics of the adversary system will generally lead
    to an acceptable result, since the detailed account carries more
    conviction than the broad assertion, and a lawyer can be expected
    to display his witness to the best advantage. If he fails to do so,
    cross-examination and argument will point up the weakness. See
    Ladd, Expert Testimony, 5 Vand.L.Rev. 414, 415-417 (1952). If,
    despite these considerations, attempts are made to introduce
    meaningless assertions which amount to little more than choosing up
    sides, exclusion for lack of helpfulness is called for by the rule.
      The language of the rule is substantially that of Uniform. Rule
    56(1). Similar provisions are California Evidence Code Sec. 800;
    Kansas Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 60-456(a); New Jersey Evidence
    Rule 56(1).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 701 has been amended to eliminate the risk that the
    reliability requirements set forth in Rule 702 will be evaded
    through the simple expedient of proffering an expert in lay witness
    clothing. Under the amendment, a witness' testimony must be
    scrutinized under the rules regulating expert opinion to the extent
    that the witness is providing testimony based on scientific,
    technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule
    702. See generally Asplundh Mfg. Div. v. Benton Harbor Eng'g, 57
    F.3d 1190 (3d Cir. 1995). By channeling testimony that is actually
    expert testimony to Rule 702, the amendment also ensures that a
    party will not evade the expert witness disclosure requirements set
    forth in Fed.R.Civ.P. 26 and Fed.R.Crim.P. 16 by simply calling an
    expert witness in the guise of a layperson. See Joseph, Emerging
    Expert Issues Under the 1993 Disclosure Amendments to the Federal
    Rules of Civil Procedure, 164 F.R.D. 97, 108 (1996) (noting that
    "there is no good reason to allow what is essentially surprise
    expert testimony," and that "the Court should be vigilant to
    preclude manipulative conduct designed to thwart the expert
    disclosure and discovery process"). See also United States v.
    Figueroa-Lopez, 125 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 1997) (law
    enforcement agents testifying that the defendant's conduct was
    consistent with that of a drug trafficker could not testify as lay
    witnesses; to permit such testimony under Rule 701 "subverts the
    requirements of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(1)(E)").
      The amendment does not distinguish between expert and lay
    witnesses, but rather between expert and lay testimony. Certainly
    it is possible for the same witness to provide both lay and expert
    testimony in a single case. See, e.g., United States v. Figueroa-
    Lopez, 125 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 1997) (law enforcement agents
    could testify that the defendant was acting suspiciously, without
    being qualified as experts; however, the rules on experts were
    applicable where the agents testified on the basis of extensive
    experience that the defendant was using code words to refer to drug
    quantities and prices). The amendment makes clear that any part of
    a witness' testimony that is based upon scientific, technical, or
    other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702 is
    governed by the standards of Rule 702 and the corresponding
    disclosure requirements of the Civil and Criminal Rules.
      The amendment is not intended to affect the "prototypical
    example[s] of the type of evidence contemplated by the adoption of
    Rule 701 relat[ing] to the appearance of persons or things,
    identity, the manner of conduct, competency of a person, degrees of
    light or darkness, sound, size, weight, distance, and an endless
    number of items that cannot be described factually in words apart
    from inferences." Asplundh Mfg. Div. v. Benton Harbor Eng'g, 57
    F.3d 1190, 1196 (3d Cir. 1995).
      For example, most courts have permitted the owner or officer of a
    business to testify to the value or projected profits of the
    business, without the necessity of qualifying the witness as an
    accountant, appraiser, or similar expert. See, e.g., Lightning
    Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp. 4 F.3d 1153 (3d Cir. 1993) (no abuse of
    discretion in permitting the plaintiff's owner to give lay opinion
    testimony as to damages, as it was based on his knowledge and
    participation in the day-to-day affairs of the business). Such
    opinion testimony is admitted not because of experience, training
    or specialized knowledge within the realm of an expert, but because
    of the particularized knowledge that the witness has by virtue of
    his or her position in the business. The amendment does not purport
    to change this analysis. Similarly, courts have permitted lay
    witnesses to testify that a substance appeared to be a narcotic, so
    long as a foundation of familiarity with the substance is
    established. See, e.g., United States v. Westbrook, 896 F.2d 330
    (8th Cir. 1990) (two lay witnesses who were heavy amphetamine users
    were properly permitted to testify that a substance was
    amphetamine; but it was error to permit another witness to make
    such an identification where she had no experience with
    amphetamines). Such testimony is not based on specialized knowledge
    within the scope of Rule 702, but rather is based upon a
    layperson's personal knowledge. If, however, that witness were to
    describe how a narcotic was manufactured, or to describe the
    intricate workings of a narcotic distribution network, then the
    witness would have to qualify as an expert under Rule 702. United
    States v. Figueroa-Lopez, supra.
      The amendment incorporates the distinctions set forth in State v.
    Brown, 836 S.W.2d 530, 549 (1992), a case involving former
    Tennessee Rule of Evidence 701, a rule that precluded lay witness
    testimony based on "special knowledge." In Brown, the court
    declared that the distinction between lay and expert witness
    testimony is that lay testimony "results from a process of
    reasoning familiar in everyday life," while expert testimony
    "results from a process of reasoning which can be mastered only by
    specialists in the field." The court in Brown noted that a lay
    witness with experience could testify that a substance appeared to
    be blood, but that a witness would have to qualify as an expert
    before he could testify that bruising around the eyes is indicative
    of skull trauma. That is the kind of distinction made by the
    amendment to this Rule.
      GAP Report - Proposed Amendment to Rule 701. The Committee made
    the following changes to the published draft of the proposed
    amendment to Evidence Rule 701:
      1. The words "within the scope of Rule 702" were added at the end
    of the proposed amendment, to emphasize that the Rule does not
    require witnesses to qualify as experts unless their testimony is
    of the type traditionally considered within the purview of Rule
    702. The Committee Note was amended to accord with this textual
    change.
      2. The Committee Note was revised to provide further examples of
    the kind of testimony that could and could not be proffered under
    the limitation imposed by the proposed amendment.

    Rule 702. Testimony by Experts

-STATUTE-
      If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will
    assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine
    a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,
    skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in
    the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based
    upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of
    reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied
    the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.

-MISC1-
               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      An intelligent evaluation of facts is often difficult or
    impossible without the application of some scientific, technical,
    or other specialized knowledge. The most common source of this
    knowledge is the expert witness, although there are other
    techniques for supplying it.
      Most of the literature assumes that experts testify only in the
    form of opinions. The assumption is logically unfounded. The rule
    accordingly recognizes that an expert on the stand may give a
    dissertation or exposition of scientific or other principles
    relevant to the case, leaving the trier of fact to apply them to
    the facts. Since much of the criticism of expert testimony has
    centered upon the hypothetical question, it seems wise to recognize
    that opinions are not indispensable and to encourage the use of
    expert testimony in non-opinion form when counsel believes the
    trier can itself draw the requisite inference. The use of opinions
    is not abolished by the rule, however. It will continue to be
    permissible for the experts to take the further step of suggesting
    the inference which should be drawn from applying the specialized
    knowledge to the facts. See Rules 703 to 705.
      Whether the situation is a proper one for the use of expert
    testimony is to be determined on the basis of assisting the trier.
    "There is no more certain test for determining when experts may be
    used than the common sense inquiry whether the untrained layman
    would be qualified to determine intelligently and to the best
    possible degree the particular issue without enlightenment from
    those having a specialized understanding of the subject involved in
    the dispute." Ladd, Expert Testimony, 5 Vand.L.Rev. 414, 418
    (1952). When opinions are excluded, it is because they are
    unhelpful and therefore superfluous and a waste of time. 7 Wigmore
    Sec. 1918.
      The rule is broadly phrased. The fields of knowledge which may be
    drawn upon are not limited merely to the "scientific" and
    "technical" but extend to all "specialized" knowledge. Similarly,
    the expert is viewed, not in a narrow sense, but as a person
    qualified by "knowledge, skill, experience, training or education."
    Thus within the scope of the rule are not only experts in the
    strictest sense of the word, e.g., physicians, physicists, and
    architects, but also the large group sometimes called "skilled"
    witnesses, such as bankers or landowners testifying to land values.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 702 has been amended in response to Daubert v. Merrell Dow
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), and to the many cases
    applying Daubert, including Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 119 S.Ct.
    1167 (1999). In Daubert the Court charged trial judges with the
    responsibility of acting as gatekeepers to exclude unreliable
    expert testimony, and the Court in Kumho clarified that this
    gatekeeper function applies to all expert testimony, not just
    testimony based in science. See also Kumho, 119 S.Ct. at 1178
    (citing the Committee Note to the proposed amendment to Rule 702,
    which had been released for public comment before the date of the
    Kumho decision). The amendment affirms the trial court's role as
    gatekeeper and provides some general standards that the trial court
    must use to assess the reliability and helpfulness of proffered
    expert testimony. Consistently with Kumho, the Rule as amended
    provides that all types of expert testimony present questions of
    admissibility for the trial court in deciding whether the evidence
    is reliable and helpful. Consequently, the admissibility of all
    expert testimony is governed by the principles of Rule 104(a).
    Under that Rule, the proponent has the burden of establishing that
    the pertinent admissibility requirements are met by a preponderance
    of the evidence. See Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171
    (1987).
      Daubert set forth a non-exclusive checklist for trial courts to
    use in assessing the reliability of scientific expert testimony.
    The specific factors explicated by the Daubert Court are (1)
    whether the expert's technique or theory can be or has been tested -
     that is, whether the expert's theory can be challenged in some
    objective sense, or whether it is instead simply a subjective,
    conclusory approach that cannot reasonably be assessed for
    reliability; (2) whether the technique or theory has been subject
    to peer review and publication; (3) the known or potential rate of
    error of the technique or theory when applied; (4) the existence
    and maintenance of standards and controls; and (5) whether the
    technique or theory has been generally accepted in the scientific
    community. The Court in Kumho held that these factors might also be
    applicable in assessing the reliability of nonscientific expert
    testimony, depending upon "the particular circumstances of the
    particular case at issue." 119 S.Ct. at 1175.
      No attempt has been made to "codify" these specific factors.
    Daubert itself emphasized that the factors were neither exclusive
    nor dispositive. Other cases have recognized that not all of the
    specific Daubert factors can apply to every type of expert
    testimony. In addition to Kumho, 119 S.Ct. at 1175, see Tyus v.
    Urban Search Management, 102 F.3d 256 (7th Cir. 1996) (noting that
    the factors mentioned by the Court in Daubert do not neatly apply
    to expert testimony from a sociologist). See also Kannankeril v.
    Terminix Int'l, Inc., 128 F.3d 802, 809 (3d Cir. 1997) (holding
    that lack of peer review or publication was not dispositive where
    the expert's opinion was supported by "widely accepted scientific
    knowledge"). The standards set forth in the amendment are broad
    enough to require consideration of any or all of the specific
    Daubert factors where appropriate.
      Courts both before and after Daubert have found other factors
    relevant in determining whether expert testimony is sufficiently
    reliable to be considered by the trier of fact. These factors
    include:
      (1) Whether experts are "proposing to testify about matters
    growing naturally and directly out of research they have conducted
    independent of the litigation, or whether they have developed their
    opinions expressly for purposes of testifying." Daubert v. Merrell
    Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 43 F.3d 1311, 1317 (9th Cir. 1995).
      (2) Whether the expert has unjustifiably extrapolated from an
    accepted premise to an unfounded conclusion. See General Elec. Co.
    v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 146 (1997) (noting that in some cases a
    trial court "may conclude that there is simply too great an
    analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered").
      (3) Whether the expert has adequately accounted for obvious
    alternative explanations. See Claar v. Burlington N.R.R., 29 F.3d
    499 (9th Cir. 1994) (testimony excluded where the expert failed to
    consider other obvious causes for the plaintiff's condition).
    Compare Ambrosini v. Labarraque, 101 F.3d 129 (D.C.Cir. 1996) (the
    possibility of some uneliminated causes presents a question of
    weight, so long as the most obvious causes have been considered and
    reasonably ruled out by the expert).
      (4) Whether the expert "is being as careful as he would be in his
    regular professional work outside his paid litigation consulting."
    Sheehan v. Daily Racing Form, Inc., 104 F.3d 940, 942 (7th Cir.
    1997). See Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 1176
    (1999) (Daubert requires the trial court to assure itself that the
    expert "employs in the courtroom the same level of intellectual
    rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant
    field").
      (5) Whether the field of expertise claimed by the expert is known
    to reach reliable results for the type of opinion the expert would
    give. See Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 1175 (1999)
    (Daubert's general acceptance factor does not "help show that an
    expert's testimony is reliable where the discipline itself lacks
    reliability, as, for example, do theories grounded in any so-called
    generally accepted principles of astrology or necromancy."); Moore
    v. Ashland Chemical, Inc., 151 F.3d 269 (5th Cir. 1998) (en banc)
    (clinical doctor was properly precluded from testifying to the
    toxicological cause of the plaintiff's respiratory problem, where
    the opinion was not sufficiently grounded in scientific
    methodology); Sterling v. Velsicol Chem. Corp., 855 F.2d 1188 (6th
    Cir. 1988) (rejecting testimony based on "clinical ecology" as
    unfounded and unreliable).
      All of these factors remain relevant to the determination of the
    reliability of expert testimony under the Rule as amended. Other
    factors may also be relevant. See Kumho, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 1176
    ("[W]e conclude that the trial judge must have considerable leeway
    in deciding in a particular case how to go about determining
    whether particular expert testimony is reliable."). Yet no single
    factor is necessarily dispositive of the reliability of a
    particular expert's testimony. See, e.g., Heller v. Shaw
    Industries, Inc., 167 F.3d 146, 155 (3d Cir. 1999) ("not only must
    each stage of the expert's testimony be reliable, but each stage
    must be evaluated practically and flexibly without bright-line
    exclusionary (or inclusionary) rules."); Daubert v. Merrell Dow
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 43 F.3d 1311, 1317, n.5 (9th Cir. 1995)
    (noting that some expert disciplines "have the courtroom as a
    principal theatre of operations" and as to these disciplines "the
    fact that the expert has developed an expertise principally for
    purposes of litigation will obviously not be a substantial
    consideration.").
      A review of the caselaw after Daubert shows that the rejection of
    expert testimony is the exception rather than the rule. Daubert did
    not work a "seachange over federal evidence law," and "the trial
    court's role as gatekeeper is not intended to serve as a
    replacement for the adversary system." United States v. 14.38 Acres
    of Land Situated in Leflore County, Mississippi, 80 F.3d 1074, 1078
    (5th Cir. 1996). As the Court in Daubert stated: "Vigorous cross-
    examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful
    instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and
    appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence." 509
    U.S. at 595. Likewise, this amendment is not intended to provide an
    excuse for an automatic challenge to the testimony of every expert.
    See Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 1176 (1999)
    (noting that the trial judge has the discretion "both to avoid
    unnecessary 'reliability' proceedings in ordinary cases where the
    reliability of an expert's methods is properly taken for granted,
    and to require appropriate proceedings in the less usual or more
    complex cases where cause for questioning the expert's reliability
    arises.").
      When a trial court, applying this amendment, rules that an
    expert's testimony is reliable, this does not necessarily mean that
    contradictory expert testimony is unreliable. The amendment is
    broad enough to permit testimony that is the product of competing
    principles or methods in the same field of expertise. See, e.g.,
    Heller v. Shaw Industries, Inc., 167 F.3d 146, 160 (3d Cir. 1999)
    (expert testimony cannot be excluded simply because the expert uses
    one test rather than another, when both tests are accepted in the
    field and both reach reliable results). As the court stated in In
    re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litigation, 35 F.3d 717, 744 (3d Cir. 1994),
    proponents "do not have to demonstrate to the judge by a
    preponderance of the evidence that the assessments of their experts
    are correct, they only have to demonstrate by a preponderance of
    evidence that their opinions are reliable. . . . The evidentiary
    requirement of reliability is lower than the merits standard of
    correctness." See also Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,
    Inc., 43 F.3d 1311, 1318 (9th Cir. 1995) (scientific experts might
    be permitted to testify if they could show that the methods they
    used were also employed by "a recognized minority of scientists in
    their field."); Ruiz-Troche v. Pepsi Cola, 161 F.3d 77, 85 (1st
    Cir. 1998) ("Daubert neither requires nor empowers trial courts to
    determine which of several competing scientific theories has the
    best provenance.").
      The Court in Daubert declared that the "focus, of course, must be
    solely on principles and methodology, not on the conclusions they
    generate." 509 U.S. at 595. Yet as the Court later recognized,
    "conclusions and methodology are not entirely distinct from one
    another." General Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 146 (1997).
    Under the amendment, as under Daubert, when an expert purports to
    apply principles and methods in accordance with professional
    standards, and yet reaches a conclusion that other experts in the
    field would not reach, the trial court may fairly suspect that the
    principles and methods have not been faithfully applied. See Lust
    v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 89 F.3d 594, 598 (9th Cir.
    1996). The amendment specifically provides that the trial court
    must scrutinize not only the principles and methods used by the
    expert, but also whether those principles and methods have been
    properly applied to the facts of the case. As the court noted in In
    re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 35 F.3d 717, 745 (3d Cir. 1994),
    "any step that renders the analysis unreliable . . . renders the
    expert's testimony inadmissible. This is true whether the step
    completely changes a reliable methodology or merely misapplies that
    methodology."
      If the expert purports to apply principles and methods to the
    facts of the case, it is important that this application be
    conducted reliably. Yet it might also be important in some cases
    for an expert to educate the factfinder about general principles,
    without ever attempting to apply these principles to the specific
    facts of the case. For example, experts might instruct the
    factfinder on the principles of thermodynamics, or bloodclotting,
    or on how financial markets respond to corporate reports, without
    ever knowing about or trying to tie their testimony into the facts
    of the case. The amendment does not alter the venerable practice of
    using expert testimony to educate the factfinder on general
    principles. For this kind of generalized testimony, Rule 702 simply
    requires that: (1) the expert be qualified; (2) the testimony
    address a subject matter on which the factfinder can be assisted by
    an expert; (3) the testimony be reliable; and (4) the testimony
    "fit" the facts of the case.
      As stated earlier, the amendment does not distinguish between
    scientific and other forms of expert testimony. The trial court's
    gatekeeping function applies to testimony by any expert. See Kumho
    Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 1171 (1999) ("We conclude
    that Daubert's general holding - setting forth the trial judge's
    general 'gatekeeping' obligation - applies not only to testimony
    based on 'scientific' knowledge, but also to testimony based on
    'technical' and 'other specialized' knowledge."). While the
    relevant factors for determining reliability will vary from
    expertise to expertise, the amendment rejects the premise that an
    expert's testimony should be treated more permissively simply
    because it is outside the realm of science. An opinion from an
    expert who is not a scientist should receive the same degree of
    scrutiny for reliability as an opinion from an expert who purports
    to be a scientist. See Watkins v. Telsmith, Inc., 121 F.3d 984, 991
    (5th Cir. 1997) ("[I]t seems exactly backwards that experts who
    purport to rely on general engineering principles and practical
    experience might escape screening by the district court simply by
    stating that their conclusions were not reached by any particular
    method or technique."). Some types of expert testimony will be more
    objectively verifiable, and subject to the expectations of
    falsifiability, peer review, and publication, than others. Some
    types of expert testimony will not rely on anything like a
    scientific method, and so will have to be evaluated by reference to
    other standard principles attendant to the particular area of
    expertise. The trial judge in all cases of proffered expert
    testimony must find that it is properly grounded, well-reasoned,
    and not speculative before it can be admitted. The expert's
    testimony must be grounded in an accepted body of learning or
    experience in the expert's field, and the expert must explain how
    the conclusion is so grounded. See, e.g., American College of Trial
    Lawyers, Standards and Procedures for Determining the Admissibility
    of Expert Testimony after Daubert, 157 F.R.D. 571, 579 (1994)
    ("[W]hether the testimony concerns economic principles, accounting
    standards, property valuation or other non-scientific subjects, it
    should be evaluated by reference to the 'knowledge and experience'
    of that particular field.").
      The amendment requires that the testimony must be the product of
    reliable principles and methods that are reliably applied to the
    facts of the case. While the terms "principles" and "methods" may
    convey a certain impression when applied to scientific knowledge,
    they remain relevant when applied to testimony based on technical
    or other specialized knowledge. For example, when a law enforcement
    agent testifies regarding the use of code words in a drug
    transaction, the principle used by the agent is that participants
    in such transactions regularly use code words to conceal the nature
    of their activities. The method used by the agent is the
    application of extensive experience to analyze the meaning of the
    conversations. So long as the principles and methods are reliable
    and applied reliably to the facts of the case, this type of
    testimony should be admitted.
      Nothing in this amendment is intended to suggest that experience
    alone - or experience in conjunction with other knowledge, skill,
    training or education - may not provide a sufficient foundation for
    expert testimony. To the contrary, the text of Rule 702 expressly
    contemplates that an expert may be qualified on the basis of
    experience. In certain fields, experience is the predominant, if
    not sole, basis for a great deal of reliable expert testimony. See,
    e.g., United States v. Jones, 107 F.3d 1147 (6th Cir. 1997) (no
    abuse of discretion in admitting the testimony of a handwriting
    examiner who had years of practical experience and extensive
    training, and who explained his methodology in detail); Tassin v.
    Sears Roebuck, 946 F.Supp. 1241, 1248 (M.D.La. 1996) (design
    engineer's testimony can be admissible when the expert's opinions
    "are based on facts, a reasonable investigation, and traditional
    technical/mechanical expertise, and he provides a reasonable link
    between the information and procedures he uses and the conclusions
    he reaches"). See also Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 119 S.Ct.
    1167, 1178 (1999) (stating that "no one denies that an expert might
    draw a conclusion from a set of observations based on extensive and
    specialized experience.").
      If the witness is relying solely or primarily on experience, then
    the witness must explain how that experience leads to the
    conclusion reached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for
    the opinion, and how that experience is reliably applied to the
    facts. The trial court's gatekeeping function requires more than
    simply "taking the expert's word for it." See Daubert v. Merrell
    Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 43 F.3d 1311, 1319 (9th Cir. 1995)
    ("We've been presented with only the experts' qualifications, their
    conclusions and their assurances of reliability. Under Daubert,
    that's not enough."). The more subjective and controversial the
    expert's inquiry, the more likely the testimony should be excluded
    as unreliable. See O'Conner v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 13 F.3d
    1090 (7th Cir. 1994) (expert testimony based on a completely
    subjective methodology held properly excluded). See also Kumho Tire
    Co. v. Carmichael, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 1176 (1999) ("[I]t will at times
    be useful to ask even of a witness whose expertise is based purely
    on experience, say, a perfume tester able to distinguish among 140
    odors at a sniff, whether his preparation is of a kind that others
    in the field would recognize as acceptable.").
      Subpart (1) of Rule 702 calls for a quantitative rather than
    qualitative analysis. The amendment requires that expert testimony
    be based on sufficient underlying "facts or data." The term "data"
    is intended to encompass the reliable opinions of other experts.
    See the original Advisory Committee Note to Rule 703. The language
    "facts or data" is broad enough to allow an expert to rely on
    hypothetical facts that are supported by the evidence. Id.
      When facts are in dispute, experts sometimes reach different
    conclusions based on competing versions of the facts. The emphasis
    in the amendment on "sufficient facts or data" is not intended to
    authorize a trial court to exclude an expert's testimony on the
    ground that the court believes one version of the facts and not the
    other.
      There has been some confusion over the relationship between Rules
    702 and 703. The amendment makes clear that the sufficiency of the
    basis of an expert's testimony is to be decided under Rule 702.
    Rule 702 sets forth the overarching requirement of reliability, and
    an analysis of the sufficiency of the expert's basis cannot be
    divorced from the ultimate reliability of the expert's opinion. In
    contrast, the "reasonable reliance" requirement of Rule 703 is a
    relatively narrow inquiry. When an expert relies on inadmissible
    information, Rule 703 requires the trial court to determine whether
    that information is of a type reasonably relied on by other experts
    in the field. If so, the expert can rely on the information in
    reaching an opinion. However, the question whether the expert is
    relying on a sufficient basis of information - whether admissible
    information or not - is governed by the requirements of Rule 702.
      The amendment makes no attempt to set forth procedural
    requirements for exercising the trial court's gatekeeping function
    over expert testimony. See Daniel J. Capra, The Daubert Puzzle, 38
    Ga.L.Rev. 699, 766 (1998) ("Trial courts should be allowed
    substantial discretion in dealing with Daubert questions; any
    attempt to codify procedures will likely give rise to unnecessary
    changes in practice and create difficult questions for appellate
    review."). Courts have shown considerable ingenuity and flexibility
    in considering challenges to expert testimony under Daubert, and it
    is contemplated that this will continue under the amended Rule.
    See, e.g., Cortes-Irizarry v. Corporacion Insular, 111 F.3d 184
    (1st Cir. 1997) (discussing the application of Daubert in ruling on
    a motion for summary judgment); In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig.,
    35 F.3d 717, 736, 739 (3d Cir. 1994) (discussing the use of in
    limine hearings); Claar v. Burlington N.R.R., 29 F.3d 499, 502-05
    (9th Cir. 1994) (discussing the trial court's technique of ordering
    experts to submit serial affidavits explaining the reasoning and
    methods underlying their conclusions).
      The amendment continues the practice of the original Rule in
    referring to a qualified witness as an "expert." This was done to
    provide continuity and to minimize change. The use of the term
    "expert" in the Rule does not, however, mean that a jury should
    actually be informed that a qualified witness is testifying as an
    "expert." Indeed, there is much to be said for a practice that
    prohibits the use of the term "expert" by both the parties and the
    court at trial. Such a practice "ensures that trial courts do not
    inadvertently put their stamp of authority" on a witness's opinion,
    and protects against the jury's being "overwhelmed by the so-called
    'experts'." Hon. Charles Richey, Proposals to Eliminate the
    Prejudicial Effect of the Use of the Word "Expert" Under the
    Federal Rules of Evidence in Criminal and Civil Jury Trials, 154
    F.R.D. 537, 559 (1994) (setting forth limiting instructions and a
    standing order employed to prohibit the use of the term "expert" in
    jury trials).
      GAP Report - Proposed Amendment to Rule 702. The Committee made
    the following changes to the published draft of the proposed
    amendment to Evidence Rule 702:
      1. The word "reliable" was deleted from Subpart (1) of the
    proposed amendment, in order to avoid an overlap with Evidence Rule
    703, and to clarify that an expert opinion need not be excluded
    simply because it is based on hypothetical facts. The Committee
    Note was amended to accord with this textual change.
      2. The Committee Note was amended throughout to include pertinent
    references to the Supreme Court's decision in Kumho Tire Co. v.
    Carmichael, which was rendered after the proposed amendment was
    released for public comment. Other citations were updated as well.
      3. The Committee Note was revised to emphasize that the amendment
    is not intended to limit the right to jury trial, nor to permit a
    challenge to the testimony of every expert, nor to preclude the
    testimony of experience-based experts, nor to prohibit testimony
    based on competing methodologies within a field of expertise.
      4. Language was added to the Committee Note to clarify that no
    single factor is necessarily dispositive of the reliability inquiry
    mandated by Evidence Rule 702.

-HEAD-
    Rule 703. Bases of Opinion Testimony by Experts

-STATUTE-
      The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert
    bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made
    known to the expert at or before the hearing. If of a type
    reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in
    forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts or data
    need not be admissible in evidence in order for the opinion or
    inference to be admitted. Facts or data that are otherwise
    inadmissible shall not be disclosed to the jury by the proponent of
    the opinion or inference unless the court determines that their
    probative value in assisting the jury to evaluate the expert's
    opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.

               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      Facts or data upon which expert opinions are based may, under the
    rule, be derived from three possible sources. The first is the
    firsthand observation of the witness, with opinions based thereon
    traditionally allowed. A treating physician affords an example.
    Rheingold, The Basis of Medical Testimony, 15 Vand.L.Rev. 473, 489
    (1962). Whether he must first relate his observations is treated in
    Rule 705. The second source, presentation at the trial, also
    reflects existing practice. The technique may be the familiar
    hypothetical question or having the expert attend the trial and
    hear the testimony establishing the facts. Problems of determining
    what testimony the expert relied upon, when the latter technique is
    employed and the testimony is in conflict, may be resolved by
    resort to Rule 705. The third source contemplated by the rule
    consists of presentation of data to the expert outside of court and
    other than by his own perception. In this respect the rule is
    designed to broaden the basis for expert opinions beyond that
    current in many jurisdictions and to bring the judicial practice
    into line with the practice of the experts themselves when not in
    court. Thus a physician in his own practice bases his diagnosis on
    information from numerous sources and of considerable variety,
    including statements by patients and relatives, reports and
    opinions from nurses, technicians and other doctors, hospital
    records, and X rays. Most of them are admissible in evidence, but
    only with the expenditure of substantial time in producing and
    examining various authenticating witnesses. The physician makes
    life-and-death decisions in reliance upon them. His validation,
    expertly performed and subject to cross-examination, ought to
    suffice for judicial purposes. Rheingold, supra, at 531; McCormick
    Sec. 15. A similar provision is California Evidence Code Sec.
    801(b).
      The rule also offers a more satisfactory basis for ruling upon
    the admissibility of public opinion poll evidence. Attention is
    directed to the validity of the techniques employed rather than to
    relatively fruitless inquiries whether hearsay is involved. See
    Judge Feinberg's careful analysis in Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Rogers
    Imports, Inc., 216 F.Supp. 670 (S.D.N.Y. 1963) See also Blum et al,
    The Art of Opinion Research: A Lawyer's Appraisal of an Emerging
    Service, 24 U.Chi.L.Rev. 1 (1956); Bonynge, Trademark Surveys and
    Techniques and Their Use in Litigation, 48 A.B.A.J. 329 (1962);
    Zeisel, The Uniqueness of Survey Evidence, 45 Cornell L.Q. 322
    (1960); Annot., 76 A.L.R.2d 919.
      If it be feared that enlargement of permissible data may tend to
    break down the rules of exclusion unduly, notice should be taken
    that the rule requires that the facts or data "be of a type
    reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field." The
    language would not warrant admitting in evidence the opinion of an
    "accidentologist" as to the point of impact in an automobile
    collision based on statements of bystanders, since this requirement
    is not satisfied. See Comment, Cal.Law Rev.Comm'n, Recommendation
    Proposing an Evidence Code 148-150 (1965).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 703 has been amended to emphasize that when an expert
    reasonably relies on inadmissible information to form an opinion or
    inference, the underlying information is not admissible simply
    because the opinion or inference is admitted. Courts have reached
    different results on how to treat inadmissible information when it
    is reasonably relied upon by an expert in forming an opinion or
    drawing an inference. Compare United States v. Rollins, 862 F.2d
    1282 (7th Cir. 1988) (admitting, as part of the basis of an FBI
    agent's expert opinion on the meaning of code language, the hearsay
    statements of an informant), with United States v. 0.59 Acres of
    Land, 109 F.3d 1493 (9th Cir. 1997) (error to admit hearsay offered
    as the basis of an expert opinion, without a limiting instruction).
    Commentators have also taken differing views. See, e.g., Ronald
    Carlson, Policing the Bases of Modern Expert Testimony, 39
    Vand.L.Rev. 577 (1986) (advocating limits on the jury's
    consideration of otherwise inadmissible evidence used as the basis
    for an expert opinion); Paul Rice, Inadmissible Evidence as a Basis
    for Expert Testimony: A Response to Professor Carlson, 40
    Vand.L.Rev. 583 (1987) (advocating unrestricted use of information
    reasonably relied upon by an expert).
      When information is reasonably relied upon by an expert and yet
    is admissible only for the purpose of assisting the jury in
    evaluating an expert's opinion, a trial court applying this Rule
    must consider the information's probative value in assisting the
    jury to weigh the expert's opinion on the one hand, and the risk of
    prejudice resulting from the jury's potential misuse of the
    information for substantive purposes on the other. The information
    may be disclosed to the jury, upon objection, only if the trial
    court finds that the probative value of the information in
    assisting the jury to evaluate the expert's opinion substantially
    outweighs its prejudicial effect. If the otherwise inadmissible
    information is admitted under this balancing test, the trial judge
    must give a limiting instruction upon request, informing the jury
    that the underlying information must not be used for substantive
    purposes. See Rule 105. In determining the appropriate course, the
    trial court should consider the probable effectiveness or lack of
    effectiveness of a limiting instruction under the particular
    circumstances.
      The amendment governs only the disclosure to the jury of
    information that is reasonably relied on by an expert, when that
    information is not admissible for substantive purposes. It is not
    intended to affect the admissibility of an expert's testimony. Nor
    does the amendment prevent an expert from relying on information
    that is inadmissible for substantive purposes.
      Nothing in this Rule restricts the presentation of underlying
    expert facts or data when offered by an adverse party. See Rule
    705. Of course, an adversary's attack on an expert's basis will
    often open the door to a proponent's rebuttal with information that
    was reasonably relied upon by the expert, even if that information
    would not have been discloseable initially under the balancing test
    provided by this amendment. Moreover, in some circumstances the
    proponent might wish to disclose information that is relied upon by
    the expert in order to "remove the sting" from the opponent's
    anticipated attack, and thereby prevent the jury from drawing an
    unfair negative inference. The trial court should take this
    consideration into account in applying the balancing test provided
    by this amendment.
      This amendment covers facts or data that cannot be admitted for
    any purpose other than to assist the jury to evaluate the expert's
    opinion. The balancing test provided in this amendment is not
    applicable to facts or data that are admissible for any other
    purpose but have not yet been offered for such a purpose at the
    time the expert testifies.
      The amendment provides a presumption against disclosure to the
    jury of information used as the basis of an expert's opinion and
    not admissible for any substantive purpose, when that information
    is offered by the proponent of the expert. In a multi-party case,
    where one party proffers an expert whose testimony is also
    beneficial to other parties, each such party should be deemed a
    "proponent" within the meaning of the amendment.
      GAP Report - Proposed Amendment to Rule 703. The Committee made
    the following changes to the published draft of the proposed
    amendment to Evidence Rule 703:
      1. A minor stylistic change was made in the text, in accordance
    with the suggestion of the Style Subcommittee of the Standing
    Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.
      2. The words "in assisting the jury to evaluate the expert's
    opinion" were added to the text, to specify the proper purpose for
    offering the otherwise inadmissible information relied on by an
    expert. The Committee Note was revised to accord with this change
    in the text.
      3. Stylistic changes were made to the Committee Note.
      4. The Committee Note was revised to emphasize that the balancing
    test set forth in the proposal should be used to determine whether
    an expert's basis may be disclosed to the jury either (1) in
    rebuttal or (2) on direct examination to "remove the sting" of an
    opponent's anticipated attack on an expert's basis.

               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      The basic approach to opinions, lay and expert, in these rules is
    to admit them when helpful to the trier of fact. In order to render
    this approach fully effective and to allay any doubt on the
    subject, the so-called "ultimate issue" rule is specifically
    abolished by the instant rule.
      The older cases often contained strictures against allowing
    witnesses to express opinions upon ultimate issues, as a particular
    aspect of the rule against opinions. The rule was unduly
    restrictive, difficult of application, and generally served only to
    deprive the trier of fact of useful information. 7 Wigmore Secs.
    1920, 1921; McCormick Sec. 12. The basis usually assigned for the
    rule, to prevent the witness from "usurping the province of the
    jury," is aptly characterized as "empty rhetoric." 7 Wigmore Sec.
    1920, p. 17. Efforts to meet the felt needs of particular
    situations led to odd verbal circumlocutions which were said not to
    violate the rule. Thus a witness could express his estimate of the
    criminal responsibility of an accused in terms of sanity or
    insanity, but not in terms of ability to tell right from wrong or
    other more modern standard. And in cases of medical causation,
    witnesses were sometimes required to couch their opinions in
    cautious phrases of "might or could," rather than "did," though the
    result was to deprive many opinions of the positiveness to which
    they were entitled, accompanied by the hazard of a ruling of
    insufficiency to support a verdict. In other instances the rule was
    simply disregarded, and, as concessions to need, opinions were
    allowed upon such matters as intoxication, speed, handwriting, and
    value, although more precise coincidence with an ultimate issue
    would scarcely be possible.
      Many modern decisions illustrate the trend to abandon the rule
    completely. People v. Wilson, 25 Cal.2d 341, 153 P.2d 720 (1944),
    whether abortion necessary to save life of patient; Clifford-Jacobs
    Forging Co. v. Industrial Comm., 19 Ill.2d 236, 166 N.E.2d 582
    (1960), medical causation; Dowling v. L. H. Shattuck, Inc., 91 N.H.
    234, 17 A.2d 529 (1941), proper method of shoring ditch; Schweiger
    v. Solbeck, 191 Or. 454, 230 P.2d 195 (1951), cause of landslide.
    In each instance the opinion was allowed.
      The abolition of the ultimate issue rule does not lower the bars
    so as to admit all opinions. Under Rules 701 and 702, opinions must
    be helpful to the trier of fact, and Rule 403 provides for
    exclusion of evidence which wastes time. These provisions afford
    ample assurances against the admission of opinions which would
    merely tell the jury what result to reach, somewhat in the manner
    of the oath-helpers of an earlier day. They also stand ready to
    exclude opinions phrased in terms of inadequately explored legal
    criteria. Thus the question, "Did T have capacity to make a will?"
    would be excluded, while the question, "Did T have sufficient
    mental capacity to know the nature and extent of his property and
    the natural objects of his bounty and to formulate a rational
    scheme of distribution?" would be allowed. McCormick Sec. 12.

    Evidence Code Sec. 805; Kansas Code of Civil Procedures Sec. 60-
    456(d); New Jersey Evidence Rule 56(3).

    Rule 705. Disclosure of Facts or Data Underlying Expert Opinion

-STATUTE-
      The expert may testify in terms of opinion or inference and give
    reasons therefor without first testifying to the underlying facts
    or data, unless the court requires otherwise. The expert may in any
    event be required to disclose the underlying facts or data on cross-

      The hypothetical question has been the target of a great deal of
    criticism as encouraging partisan bias, affording an opportunity
    for summing up in the middle of the case, and as complex and time
    consuming. Ladd, Expert Testimony, 5 Vand.L.Rev. 414, 426-427
    (1952). While the rule allows counsel to make disclosure of the
    underlying facts or data as a preliminary to the giving of an
    expert opinion, if he chooses, the instances in which he is
    required to do so are reduced. This is true whether the expert
    bases his opinion on data furnished him at secondhand or observed
    by him at firsthand.
      The elimination of the requirement of preliminary disclosure at
    the trial of underlying facts or data has a long background of
    support. In 1937 the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws
    incorporated a provision to this effect in the Model Expert
    Testimony Act, which furnished the basis for Uniform Rules 57 and
    58. Rule 4515, N.Y. CPLR (McKinney 1963), provides:
      "Unless the court orders otherwise, questions calling for the
    opinion of an expert witness need not be hypothetical in form, and
    the witness may state his opinion and reasons without first
    specifying the data upon which it is based. Upon cross-examination,
    he may be required to specify the data * * *,"
    See also California Evidence Code Sec. 802; Kansas Code of Civil
    Procedure Secs. 60-456, 60-457; New Jersey Evidence Rules 57, 58.
      If the objection is made that leaving it to the cross-examiner to
    bring out the supporting data is essentially unfair, the answer is
    that he is under no compulsion to bring out any facts or data
    except those unfavorable to the opinion. The answer assumes that
    the cross-examiner has the advance knowledge which is essential for
    effective cross-examination. This advance knowledge has been
    afforded, though imperfectly, by the traditional foundation
    requirement. Rule 26(b)(4) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, as
    revised, provides for substantial discovery in this area, obviating
    in large measure the obstacles which have been raised in some
    instances to discovery of findings, underlying data, and even the
    identity of the experts. Friedenthal, Discovery and Use of an
    Adverse Party's Expert Information, 14 Stan.L.Rev. 455 (1962).
    These safeguards are reinforced by the discretionary power of the
    judge to require preliminary disclosure in any event.

      The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      This rule, which relates to the manner of presenting testimony at
    trial, is revised to avoid an arguable conflict with revised Rules
    26(a)(2)(B) and 26(e)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or
    with revised Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,
    which require disclosure in advance of trial of the basis and
    reasons for an expert's opinions.
      If a serious question is raised under Rule 702 or 703 as to the
    admissibility of expert testimony, disclosure of the underlying
    facts or data on which opinions are based may, of course, be needed
    by the court before deciding whether, and to what extent, the
    person should be allowed to testify. This rule does not preclude
    such an inquiry.

-HEAD-
    Rule 706. Court Appointed Experts

-STATUTE-
      (a) Appointment. The court may on its own motion or on the motion
    of any party enter an order to show cause why expert witnesses
    should not be appointed, and may request the parties to submit
    nominations. The court may appoint any expert witnesses agreed upon
    by the parties, and may appoint expert witnesses of its own
    selection. An expert witness shall not be appointed by the court
    unless the witness consents to act. A witness so appointed shall be
    informed of the witness' duties by the court in writing, a copy of
    which shall be filed with the clerk, or at a conference in which
    the parties shall have opportunity to participate. A witness so
    appointed shall advise the parties of the witness' findings, if
    any; the witness' deposition may be taken by any party; and the
    witness may be called to testify by the court or any party. The
    witness shall be subject to cross-examination by each party,
    including a party calling the witness.
      (b) Compensation. Expert witnesses so appointed are entitled to
    reasonable compensation in whatever sum the court may allow. The
    compensation thus fixed is payable from funds which may be provided
    by law in criminal cases and civil actions and proceedings
    involving just compensation under the fifth amendment. In other
    civil actions and proceedings the compensation shall be paid by the
    parties in such proportion and at such time as the court directs,
    and thereafter charged in like manner as other costs.
      (c) Disclosure of Appointment. In the exercise of its discretion,
    the court may authorize disclosure to the jury of the fact that the
    court appointed the expert witness.
      (d) Parties' Experts of Own Selection. Nothing in this rule
    limits the parties in calling expert witnesses of their own
    selection.

               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      The practice of shopping for experts, the venality of some
    experts, and the reluctance of many reputable experts to involve
    themselves in litigation, have been matters of deep concern. Though
    the contention is made that court appointed experts acquire an aura
    of infallibility to which they are not entitled. Levy, Impartial
    Medical Testimony - Revisited, 34 Temple L.Q. 416 (1961), the trend
    is increasingly to provide for their use. While experience
    indicates that actual appointment is a relatively infrequent
    occurrence, the assumption may be made that the availability of the
    procedure in itself decreases the need for resorting to it. The
    ever-present possibility that the judge may appoint an expert in a
    given case must inevitably exert a sobering effect on the expert
    witness of a party and upon the person utilizing his services.
      The inherent power of a trial judge to appoint an expert of his
    own choosing is virtually unquestioned. Scott v. Spanjer Bros.,
    Inc., 298 F.2d 928 (2d Cir. 1962); Danville Tobacco Assn. v. Bryant-
    Buckner Associates, Inc., 333 F.2d 202 (4th Cir. 1964); Sink, The
    Unused Power of a Federal Judge to Call His Own Expert Witnesses,
    29 S.Cal.L.Rev. 195 (1956); 2 Wigmore Sec. 563, 9 Id. Sec. 2484;
    Annot., 95 A.L.R.2d 383. Hence the problem becomes largely one of
    detail.
      The New York plan is well known and is described in Report by
    Special Committee of the Association of the Bar of the City of New
    York: Impartial Medical Testimony (1956). On recommendation of the
    Section of Judicial Administration, local adoption of an impartial
    medical plan was endorsed by the American Bar Association. 82
    A.B.A.Rep. 184-185 (1957). Descriptions and analyses of plans in
    effect in various parts of the country are found in Van Dusen, A
    United States District Judge's View of the Impartial Medical Expert
    System, 322 F.R.D. 498 (1963); Wick and Kightlinger, Impartial
    Medical Testimony Under the Federal Civil Rules: A Tale of Three
    Doctors, 34 Ins. Counsel J. 115 (1967); and numerous articles
    collected in Klein, Judicial Administration and the Legal
    Profession 393 (1963). Statutes and rules include California
    Evidence Code Secs. 730-733; Illinois Supreme Court Rule 215(d),
    Ill.Rev.Stat.1969, c. 110A, Sec. 215(d); Burns Indiana Stats. 1956,
    Sec. 9-1702; Wisconsin Stats.Annot.1958, Sec. 957.27.
      In the federal practice, a comprehensive scheme for court
    appointed experts was initiated with the adoption of Rule 28 of the
    Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in 1946. The Judicial
    Conference of the United States in 1953 considered court appointed
    experts in civil cases, but only with respect to whether they
    should be compensated from public funds, a proposal which was
    rejected. Report of the Judicial Conference of the United States 23
    (1953). The present rule expands the practice to include civil
    cases.
      Subdivision (a) is based on Rule 28 of the Federal Rules of
    Criminal Procedure, with a few changes, mainly in the interest of
    clarity. Language has been added to provide specifically for the
    appointment either on motion of a party or on the judge's own
    motion. A provision subjecting the court appointed expert to
    deposition procedures has been incorporated. The rule has been
    revised to make definite the right of any party, including the
    party calling him, to cross-examine.
      Subdivision (b) combines the present provision for compensation
    in criminal cases with what seems to be a fair and feasible
    handling of civil cases, originally found in the Model Act and
    carried from there into Uniform Rule 60. See also California
    Evidence Code Secs. 730-731. The special provision for Fifth
    Amendment compensation cases is designed to guard against reducing
    constitutionally guaranteed just compensation by requiring the
    recipient to pay costs. See Rule 71A(l) of the Rules of Civil
    Procedure.
      Subdivision (c) seems to be essential if the use of court
    appointed experts is to be fully effective. Uniform Rule 61 so
    provides.
      Subdivision (d) is in essence the last sentence of Rule 28(a) of
    the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

                  INTRODUCTORY NOTE: THE HEARSAY PROBLEM              
      The factors to be considered in evaluating the testimony of a
    witness are perception, memory, and narration. Morgan, Hearsay
    Dangers and the Application of the Hearsay Concept, 62 Harv.L.Rev.
    177 (1948), Selected Writings on Evidence and Trial 764, 765 (Fryer
    ed. 1957); Shientag, Cross-Examination - A Judge's Viewpoint, 3
    Record 12 (1948); Strahorn, A Reconsideration of the Hearsay Rule
    and Admissions, 85 U.Pa.L.Rev. 484, 485 (1937), Selected Writings,
    supra, 756, 757: Weinstein, Probative Force of Hearsay, 46 Iowa
    L.Rev. 331 (1961). Sometimes a fourth is added, sincerity, but in
    fact it seems merely to be an aspect of the three already
    mentioned.
      In order to encourage the witness to do his best with respect to
    each of these factors, and to expose any inaccuracies which may
    enter in, the Anglo-American tradition has evolved three conditions
    under which witnesses will ideally be required to testify: (1)
    under oath, (2) in the personal presence of the trier of fact, (3)
    subject to cross-examination.
      (1) Standard procedure calls for the swearing of witnesses. While
    the practice is perhaps less effective than in an earlier time, no
    disposition to relax the requirement is apparent, other than to
    allow affirmation by persons with scruples against taking oaths.
      (2) The demeanor of the witness traditionally has been believed
    to furnish trier and opponent with valuable clues. Universal Camera
    Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 340 U.S. 474, 495-496, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed.
    456 (1951); Sahm, Demeanor Evidence: Elusive and Intangible
    Imponderables, 47 A.B.A.J. 580 (1961), quoting numerous
    authorities. The witness himself will probably be impressed with
    the solemnity of the occasion and the possibility of public
    disgrace. Willingness to falsify may reasonably become more
    difficult in the presence of the person against whom directed.
    Rules 26 and 43(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal and Civil
    Procedure, respectively, include the general requirement that
    testimony be taken orally in open court. The Sixth Amendment right
    of confrontation is a manifestation of these beliefs and attitudes.
      (3) Emphasis on the basis of the hearsay rule today tends to
    center upon the condition of cross-examination. All may not agree
    with Wigmore that cross-examination is "beyond doubt the greatest
    legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth," but all
    will agree with his statement that it has become a "vital feature"
    of the Anglo-American system. 5 Wigmore Sec. 1367, p. 29. The
    belief, or perhaps hope, that cross-examination is effective in
    exposing imperfections of perception, memory, and narration is
    fundamental. Morgan, Foreword to Model Code of Evidence 37 (1942).
      The logic of the preceding discussion might suggest that no
    testimony be received unless in full compliance with the three
    ideal conditions. No one advocates this position. Common sense
    tells that much evidence which is not given under the three
    conditions may be inherently superior to much that is. Moreover,
    when the choice is between evidence which is less than best and no
    evidence at all, only clear folly would dictate an across-the-board
    policy of doing without. The problem thus resolves itself into
    effecting a sensible accommodation between these considerations and
    the desirability of giving testimony under the ideal conditions.
      The solution evolved by the common law has been a general rule
    excluding hearsay but subject to numerous exceptions under
    circumstances supposed to furnish guarantees of trustworthiness.
    Criticisms of this scheme are that it is bulky and complex, fails
    to screen good from bad hearsay realistically, and inhibits the
    growth of the law of evidence.
      Since no one advocates excluding all hearsay, three possible
    solutions may be considered: (1) abolish the rule against hearsay
    and admit all hearsay; (2) admit hearsay possessing sufficient
    probative force, but with procedural safeguards; (3) revise the
    present system of class exceptions.
      (1) Abolition of the hearsay rule would be the simplest solution.
    The effect would not be automatically to abolish the giving of
    testimony under ideal conditions. If the declarant were available,
    compliance with the ideal conditions would be optional with either
    party. Thus the proponent could call the declarant as a witness as
    a form of presentation more impressive than his hearsay statement.
    Or the opponent could call the declarant to be cross-examined upon
    his statement. This is the tenor of Uniform Rule 63(1), admitting
    the hearsay declaration of a person "who is present at the hearing
    and available for cross-examination." Compare the treatment of
    declarations of available declarants in Rule 801(d)(1) of the
    instant rules. If the declarant were unavailable, a rule of free
    admissibility would make no distinctions in terms of degrees of
    noncompliance with the ideal conditions and would exact no liquid
    pro quo in the form of assurances of trustworthiness. Rule 503 of
    the Model Code did exactly that, providing for the admissibility of
    any hearsay declaration by an unavailable declarant, finding
    support in the Massachusetts act of 1898, enacted at the instance
    of Thayer, Mass.Gen.L.1932, c. 233 Sec. 65, and in the English act
    of 1938, St.1938, c. 28, Evidence. Both are limited to civil cases.
    The draftsmen of the Uniform Rules chose a less advanced and more
    conventional position. Comment, Uniform Rule 63. The present
    Advisory Committee has been unconvinced of the wisdom of abandoning
    the traditional requirement of some particular assurance of
    credibility as a condition precedent to admitting the hearsay
    declaration of an unavailable declarant.
      In criminal cases, the Sixth Amendment requirement of
    confrontation would no doubt move into a large part of the area
    presently occupied by the hearsay rule in the event of the
    abolition of the latter. The resultant split between civil and
    criminal evidence is regarded as an undesirable development.
      (2) Abandonment of the system of class exceptions in favor of
    individual treatment in the setting of the particular case,
    accompanied by procedural safeguards, has been impressively
    advocated. Weinstein, The Probative Force of Hearsay, 46 Iowa
    L.Rev. 331 (1961). Admissibility would be determined by weighing
    the probative force of the evidence against the possibility of
    prejudice, waste of time, and the availability of more satisfactory
    evidence. The bases of the traditional hearsay exceptions would be
    helpful in assessing probative force. Ladd, The Relationship of the
    Principles of Exclusionary Rules of Evidence to the Problem of
    Proof, 18 Minn.L.Rev. 506 (1934). Procedural safeguards would
    consist of notice of intention to use hearsay, free comment by the
    judge on the weight of the evidence, and a greater measure of
    authority in both trial and appellate judges to deal with evidence
    on the basis of weight. The Advisory Committee has rejected this
    approach to hearsay as involving too great a measure of judicial
    discretion, minimizing the predictability of rulings, enhancing the
    difficulties of preparation for trial, adding a further element to
    the already over-complicated congeries of pre-trial procedures, and
    requiring substantially different rules for civil and criminal
    cases. The only way in which the probative force of hearsay differs
    from the probative force of other testimony is in the absence of
    oath, demeanor, and cross-examination as aids in determining
    credibility. For a judge to exclude evidence because he does not
    believe it has been described as "altogether atypical,
    extraordinary. * * *" Chadbourn, Bentham and the Hearsay Rule - A
    Benthamic View of Rule 63(4)(c) of the Uniform Rules of Evidence,
    75 Harv.L.Rev. 932, 947 (1962).
      (3) The approach to hearsay in these rules is that of the common
    law, i.e., a general rule excluding hearsay, with exceptions under
    which evidence is not required to be excluded even though hearsay.
    The traditional hearsay exceptions are drawn upon for the
    exceptions, collected under two rules, one dealing with situations
    where availability of the declarant is regarded as immaterial and
    the other with those where unavailability is made a condition to
    the admission of the hearsay statement. Each of the two rules
    concludes with a provision for hearsay statements not within one of
    the specified exceptions "but having comparable circumstantial
    guarantees of trustworthiness." Rules 803(24) and 804(b)(6). This
    plan is submitted as calculated to encourage growth and development
    in this area of the law, while conserving the values and experience
    of the past as a guide to the future.

                       CONFRONTATION AND DUE PROCESS                   
      Until very recently, decisions invoking the confrontation clause
    of the Sixth Amendment were surprisingly few, a fact probably
    explainable by the former inapplicability of the clause to the
    states and by the hearsay rule's occupancy of much the same ground.
    The pattern which emerges from the earlier cases invoking the
    clause is substantially that of the hearsay rule, applied to
    criminal cases: an accused is entitled to have the witnesses
    against him testify under oath, in the presence of himself and
    trier, subject to cross-examination; yet considerations of public
    policy and necessity require the recognition of such exceptions as
    dying declarations and former testimony of unavailable witnesses.
    Mattox v. United States, 156 U.S. 237, 15 S.Ct. 337, 39 L.Ed. 409
    (1895); Motes v. United States, 178 U.S. 458, 20 S.Ct. 993, 44
    L.Ed. 1150 (1900); Delaney v. United States, 263 U.S. 586, 44 S.Ct.
    206, 68 L.Ed. 462 (1924). Beginning with Snyder v. Massachusetts,
    291 U.S. 97, 54 S.Ct. 330, 78 L.Ed. 674 (1934), the Court began to
    speak of confrontation as an aspect of procedural due process, thus
    extending its applicability to state cases and to federal cases
    other than criminal. The language of Snyder was that of an elastic
    concept of hearsay. The deportation case of Bridges v. Wixon, 326
    U.S. 135, 65 S.Ct. 1443, 89 L.Ed. 2103 (1945), may be read broadly
    as imposing a strictly construed right of confrontation in all
    kinds of cases or narrowly as the product of a failure of the
    Immigration and Naturalization Service to follow its own rules. In
    re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 68 S.Ct. 499, 92 L.Ed. 682 (1948), ruled
    that cross-examination was essential to due process in a state
    contempt proceeding, but in United States v. Nugent, 346 U.S. 1, 73
    S.Ct. 991, 97 L.Ed. 1417 (1953), the court held that it was not an
    essential aspect of a "hearing" for a conscientious objector under
    the Selective Service Act. Stein v. New York, 346 U.S. 156, 196, 73
    S.Ct. 1077, 97 L.Ed. 1522 (1953), disclaimed any purpose to read
    the hearsay rule into the Fourteenth Amendment, but in Greene v.
    McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 79 S.Ct. 1400, 3 L.Ed.2d 1377 (1959),
    revocation of security clearance without confrontation and cross-
    examination was held unauthorized, and a similar result was
    reached in Willner v. Committee on Character, 373 U.S. 96, 83 S.Ct.
    1175, 10 L.Ed.2d 224 (1963). Ascertaining the constitutional
    dimensions of the confrontation-hearsay aggregate against the
    background of these cases is a matter of some difficulty, yet the
    general pattern is at least not inconsistent with that of the
    hearsay rule.
      In 1965 the confrontation clause was held applicable to the
    states. Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d
    923 (1965). Prosecution use of former testimony given at a
    preliminary hearing where petitioner was not represented by counsel
    was a violation of the clause. The same result would have followed
    under conventional hearsay doctrine read in the light of a
    constitutional right to counsel, and nothing in the opinion
    suggests any difference in essential outline between the hearsay
    rule and the right of confrontation. In the companion case of
    Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934
    (1965), however, the result reached by applying the confrontation
    clause is one reached less readily via the hearsay rule. A
    confession implicating petitioner was put before the jury by
    reading it to the witness in portions and asking if he made that
    statement. The witness refused to answer on grounds of self-
    incrimination. The result, said the Court, was to deny cross-
    examination, and hence confrontation. True, it could broadly be
    said that the confession was a hearsay statement which for all
    practical purposes was put in evidence. Yet a more easily accepted
    explanation of the opinion is that its real thrust was in the
    direction of curbing undesirable prosecutorial behavior, rather
    than merely applying rules of exclusion, and that the confrontation
    clause was the means selected to achieve this end. Comparable facts
    and a like result appeared in Brookhart v. Janis, 384 U.S. 1, 86
    S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1966).
      The pattern suggested in Douglas was developed further and more
    distinctly in a pair of cases at the end of the 1966 term. United
    States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149
    (1967), and Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18
    L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967), hinged upon practices followed in identifying
    accused persons before trial. This pretrial identification was said
    to be so decisive an aspect of the case that accused was entitled
    to have counsel present; a pretrial identification made in the
    absence of counsel was not itself receivable in evidence and, in
    addition, might fatally infect a courtroom identification. The
    presence of counsel at the earlier identification was described as
    a necessary prerequisite for "a meaningful confrontation at trial."
    United States v. Wade, supra, 388 U.S. at p. 236, 87 S.Ct. at p.
    1937. Wade involved no evidence of the fact of a prior
    identification and hence was not susceptible of being decided on
    hearsay grounds. In Gilbert, witnesses did testify to an earlier
    identification, readily classifiable as hearsay under a fairly
    strict view of what constitutes hearsay. The Court, however,
    carefully avoided basing the decision on the hearsay ground,
    choosing confrontation instead. 388 U.S. 263, 272, n. 3, 87 S.Ct.
    1951. See also Parker v. Gladden, 385 U.S. 363 87 S.Ct. 468, 17
    L.Ed.2d 420 (1966), holding that the right of confrontation was
    violated when the bailiff made prejudicial statements to jurors,
    and Note, 75, Yale L.J. 1434 (1966).
      Under the earlier cases, the confrontation clause may have been
    little more than a constitutional embodiment of the hearsay rule,
    even including traditional exceptions but with some room for
    expanding them along similar lines. But under the recent cases the
    impact of the clause clearly extends beyond the confines of the
    hearsay rule. These considerations have led the Advisory Committee
    to conclude that a hearsay rule can function usefully as an adjunct
    to the confrontation right in constitutional areas and
    independently in nonconstitutional areas. In recognition of the
    separateness of the confrontation clause and the hearsay rule, and
    to avoid inviting collisions between them or between the hearsay
    rule and other exclusionary principles, the exceptions set forth in
    Rules 803 and 804 are stated in terms of exemption from the general
    exclusionary mandate of the hearsay rule, rather than in positive
    terms of admissibility. See Uniform Rule 63(1) to (31) and
    California Evidence Code Secs. 1200-1340.

    TITLE 28 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE
    ARTICLE VIII. HEARSAY

-HEAD-
    Rule 801. Definitions

-STATUTE-
      The following definitions apply under this article:
      (a) Statement. A "statement" is (1) an oral or written assertion
    or (2) nonverbal conduct of a person, if it is intended by the
    person as an assertion.
      (b) Declarant. A "declarant" is a person who makes a statement.
      (c) Hearsay. "Hearsay" is a statement, other than one made by the
    declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in
    evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.
      (d) Statements Which Are Not Hearsay. A statement is not hearsay
    if - 
        (1) Prior Statement by Witness. The declarant testifies at the
      trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning
      the statement, and the statement is (A) inconsistent with the
      declarant's testimony, and was given under oath subject to the
      penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or
      in a deposition, or (B) consistent with the declarant's testimony
      and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the
      declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive,
      or (C) one of identification of a person made after perceiving
      the person; or
        (2) Admission by Party-Opponent. The statement is offered
      against a party and is (A) the party's own statement, in either
      an individual or a representative capacity or (B) a statement of
      which the party has manifested an adoption or belief in its
      truth, or (C) a statement by a person authorized by the party to
      make a statement concerning the subject, or (D) a statement by
      the party's agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope
      of the agency or employment, made during the existence of the
      relationship, or (E) a statement by a coconspirator of a party
      during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy. The
      contents of the statement shall be considered but are not alone
      sufficient to establish the declarant's authority under
      subdivision (C), the agency or employment relationship and scope
      thereof under subdivision (D), or the existence of the conspiracy
      and the participation therein of the declarant and the party
      against whom the statement is offered under subdivision (E).

-MISC1-
               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      Subdivision (a). The definition of "statement" assumes importance
    because the term is used in the definition of hearsay in
    subdivision (c). The effect of the definition of "statement" is to
    exclude from the operation of the hearsay rule all evidence of
    conduct, verbal or nonverbal, not intended as an assertion. The key
    to the definition is that nothing is an assertion unless intended
    to be one.
      It can scarcely be doubted that an assertion made in words is
    intended by the declarant to be an assertion. Hence verbal
    assertions readily fall into the category of "statement." Whether
    nonverbal conduct should be regarded as a statement for purposes of
    defining hearsay requires further consideration. Some nonverbal
    conduct, such as the act of pointing to identify a suspect in a
    lineup, is clearly the equivalent of words, assertive in nature,
    and to be regarded as a statement. Other nonverbal conduct,
    however, may be offered as evidence that the person acted as he did
    because of his belief in the existence of the condition sought to
    be proved, from which belief the existence of the condition may be
    inferred. This sequence is, arguably, in effect an assertion of the
    existence of the condition and hence properly includable within the
    hearsay concept. See Morgan, Hearsay Dangers and the Application of
    the Hearsay Concept, 62 Harv.L. Rev. 177, 214, 217 (1948), and the
    elaboration in Finman, Implied Assertions as Hearsay: Some
    Criticisms of the Uniform Rules of Evidence, 14 Stan.L.Rev. 682
    (1962). Admittedly evidence of this character is untested with
    respect to the perception, memory, and narration (or their
    equivalents) of the actor, but the Advisory Committee is of the
    view that these dangers are minimal in the absence of an intent to
    assert and do not justify the loss of the evidence on hearsay
    grounds. No class of evidence is free of the possibility of
    fabrication, but the likelihood is less with nonverbal than with
    assertive verbal conduct. The situations giving rise to the
    nonverbal conduct are such as virtually to eliminate questions of
    sincerity. Motivation, the nature of the conduct, and the presence
    or absence of reliance will bear heavily upon the weight to be
    given the evidence. Falknor, The "Hear-Say" Rule as a "See-Do"
    Rule: Evidence of Conduct, 33 Rocky Mt.L.Rev. 133 (1961). Similar
    considerations govern nonassertive verbal conduct and verbal
    conduct which is assertive but offered as a basis for inferring
    something other than the matter asserted, also excluded from the
    definition of hearsay by the language of subdivision (c).
      When evidence of conduct is offered on the theory that it is not
    a statement, and hence not hearsay, a preliminary determination
    will be required to determine whether an assertion is intended. The
    rule is so worded as to place the burden upon the party claiming
    that the intention existed; ambiguous and doubtful cases will be
    resolved against him and in favor of admissibility. The
    determination involves no greater difficulty than many other
    preliminary questions of fact. Maguire, The Hearsay System: Around
    and Through the Thicket, 14 Vand.L.Rev. 741, 765-767 (1961).
      For similar approaches, see Uniform Rule 62(1); California
    Evidence Code Secs. 225, 1200; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure Sec.
    60-459(a); New Jersey Evidence Rule 62(1)
      Subdivision (c). The definition follows along familiar lines in
    including only statements offered to prove the truth of the matter
    asserted. McCormick Sec. 225; 5 Wigmore Sec. 1361, 6 id. Sec. 1766.
    If the significance of an offered statement lies solely in the fact
    that it was made, no issue is raised as to the truth of anything
    asserted, and the statement is not hearsay. Emich Motors Corp. v.
    General Motors Corp., 181 F.2d 70 (7th Cir. 1950), rev'd on other
    grounds 340 U.S. 558, 71 S.Ct. 408, 95 L.Ed 534, letters of
    complaint from customers offered as a reason for cancellation of
    dealer's franchise, to rebut contention that franchise was revoked
    for refusal to finance sales through affiliated finance company.
    The effect is to exclude from hearsay the entire category of
    "verbal acts" and "verbal parts of an act," in which the statement
    itself affects the legal rights of the parties or is a circumstance
    bearing on conduct affecting their rights.
      The definition of hearsay must, of course, be read with reference
    to the definition of statement set forth in subdivision (a).
      Testimony given by a witness in the course of court proceedings
    is excluded since there is compliance with all the ideal conditions
    for testifying.
      Subdivision (d). Several types of statements which would
    otherwise literally fall within the definition are expressly
    excluded from it:
      (1) Prior statement by witness. Considerable controversy has
    attended the question whether a prior out-of-court statement by a
    person now available for cross-examination concerning it, under
    oath and in the presence of the trier of fact, should be classed as
    hearsay. If the witness admits on the stand that he made the
    statement and that it was true, he adopts the statement and there
    is no hearsay problem. The hearsay problem arises when the witness
    on the stand denies having made the statement or admits having made
    it but denies its truth. The argument in favor of treating these
    latter statements as hearsay is based upon the ground that the
    conditions of oath, cross-examination, and demeanor observation did
    not prevail at the time the statement was made and cannot
    adequately be supplied by the later examination. The logic of the
    situation is troublesome. So far as concerns the oath, its mere
    presence has never been regarded as sufficient to remove a
    statement from the hearsay category, and it receives much less
    emphasis than cross-examination as a truth-compelling device. While
    strong expressions are found to the effect that no conviction can
    be had or important right taken away on the basis of statements not
    made under fear of prosecution for perjury, Bridges v. Wixon, 326
    U.S. 135, 65 S.Ct. 1443, 89 L.Ed. 2103 (1945), the fact is that, of
    the many common law exceptions to the hearsay rule, only that for
    reported testimony has required the statement to have been made
    under oath. Nor is it satisfactorily explained why cross-
    examination cannot be conducted subsequently with success. The
    decisions contending most vigorously for its inadequacy in fact
    demonstrate quite thorough exploration of the weaknesses and doubts
    attending the earlier statement. State v. Saporen, 205 Minn. 358,
    285 N.W. 898 (1939); Ruhala v. Roby, 379 Mich. 102, 150 N.W.2d 146
    (1967); People v. Johnson, 68 Cal.2d 646, 68 Cal.Rptr. 599, 441
    P.2d 111 (1968). In respect to demeanor, as Judge Learned Hand
    observed in Di Carlo v. United States, 6 F.2d 364 (2d Cir. 1925),
    when the jury decides that the truth is not what the witness says
    now, but what he said before, they are still deciding from what
    they see and hear in court. The bulk of the case law nevertheless
    has been against allowing prior statements of witnesses to be used
    generally as substantive evidence. Most of the writers and Uniform
    Rule 63(1) have taken the opposite position.
      The position taken by the Advisory Committee in formulating this
    part of the rule is founded upon an unwillingness to countenance
    the general use of prior prepared statements as substantive
    evidence, but with a recognition that particular circumstances call
    for a contrary result. The judgment is one more of experience than
    of logic. The rule requires in each instance, as a general
    safeguard, that the declarant actually testify as a witness, and it
    then enumerates three situations in which the statement is excepted
    from the category of hearsay. Compare Uniform Rule 63(1) which
    allows any out-of-court statement of a declarant who is present at
    the trial and available for cross-examination.
      (A) Prior inconsistent statements traditionally have been
    admissible to impeach but not as substantive evidence. Under the
    rule they are substantive evidence. As has been said by the
    California Law Revision Commission with respect to a similar
    provision:
      "Section 1235 admits inconsistent statements of witnesses because
    the dangers against which the hearsay rule is designed to protect
    are largely nonexistent. The declarant is in court and may be
    examined and cross-examined in regard to his statements and their
    subject matter. In many cases, the inconsistent statement is more
    likely to be true than the testimony of the witness at the trial
    because it was made nearer in time to the matter to which it
    relates and is less likely to be influenced by the controversy that
    gave rise to the litigation. The trier of fact has the declarant
    before it and can observe his demeanor and the nature of his
    testimony as he denies or tries to explain away the inconsistency.
    Hence, it is in as good a position to determine the truth or
    falsity of the prior statement as it is to determine the truth or
    falsity of the inconsistent testimony given in court. Moreover,
    Section 1235 will provide a party with desirable protection against
    the 'turncoat' witness who changes his story on the stand and
    deprives the party calling him of evidence essential to his case."
    Comment, California Evidence Code Sec. 1235. See also McCormick
    Sec. 39. The Advisory Committee finds these views more convincing
    than those expressed in People v. Johnson, 68 Cal.2d 646, 68
    Cal.Rptr. 599, 441 P.2d 111 (1968). The constitutionality of the
    Advisory Committee's view was upheld in California v. Green, 399
    U.S. 149, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970). Moreover, the
    requirement that the statement be inconsistent with the testimony
    given assures a thorough exploration of both versions while the
    witness is on the stand and bars any general and indiscriminate use
    of previously prepared statements.
      (B) Prior consistent statements traditionally have been
    admissible to rebut charges of recent fabrication or improper
    influence or motive but not as substantive evidence. Under the rule
    they are substantive evidence. The prior statement is consistent
    with the testimony given on the stand, and, if the opposite party
    wishes to open the door for its admission in evidence, no sound
    reason is apparent why it should not be received generally.
      (C) The admission of evidence of identification finds substantial
    support, although it falls beyond a doubt in the category of prior
    out-of-court statements. Illustrative are People v. Gould, 54
    Cal.2d 621, 7 Cal.Rptr. 273, 354 P.2d 865 (1960); Judy v. State,
    218 Md. 168, 146 A.2d 29 (1958); State v. Simmons, 63 Wash.2d 17,
    385 P.2d 389 (1963); California Evidence Code Sec. 1238; New Jersey
    Evidence Rule 63(1)(c); N.Y. Code of Criminal Procedure Sec. 393-b.
    Further cases are found in 4 Wigmore Sec. 1130. The basis is the
    generally unsatisfactory and inconclusive nature of courtroom
    identifications as compared with those made at an earlier time
    under less suggestive conditions. The Supreme Court considered the
    admissibility of evidence of prior identification in Gilbert v.
    California, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967).
    Exclusion of lineup identification was held to be required because
    the accused did not then have the assistance of counsel.
    Significantly, the Court carefully refrained from placing its
    decision on the ground that testimony as to the making of a prior
    out-of-court identification ("That's the man") violated either the
    hearsay rule or the right of confrontation because not made under
    oath, subject to immediate cross-examination, in the presence of
    the trier. Instead the Court observed:
      "There is a split among the States concerning the admissibility
    of prior extra-judicial identifications, as independent evidence of
    identity, both by the witness and third parties present at the
    prior identification. See 71 ALR2d 449. It has been held that the
    prior identification is hearsay, and, when admitted through the
    testimony of the identifier, is merely a prior consistent
    statement. The recent trend, however, is to admit the prior
    identification under the exception that admits as substantive
    evidence a prior communication by a witness who is available for
    cross-examination at the trial. See 5 ALR2d Later Case Service 1225-
    1228. * * *" 388 U.S. at 272, n. 3, 87 S.Ct. at 1956.
      (2) Admissions. Admissions by a party-opponent are excluded from
    the category of hearsay on the theory that their admissibility in
    evidence is the result of the adversary system rather than
    satisfaction of the conditions of the hearsay rule. Strahorn, A
    Reconsideration of the Hearsay Rule and Admissions, 85 U.Pa.L.Rev.
    484, 564 (1937); Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 265 (1962); 4
    Wigmore Sec. 1048. No guarantee of trustworthiness is required in
    the case of an admission. The freedom which admissions have enjoyed
    from technical demands of searching for an assurance of
    trustworthiness in some against-interest circumstance, and from the
    restrictive influences of the opinion rule and the rule requiring
    firsthand knowledge, when taken with the apparently prevalent
    satisfaction with the results, calls for generous treatment of this
    avenue to admissibility.
      The rule specifies five categories of statements for which the
    responsibility of a party is considered sufficient to justify
    reception in evidence against him:
      (A) A party's own statement is the classic example of an
    admission. If he has a representative capacity and the statement is
    offered against him in that capacity, no inquiry whether he was
    acting in the representative capacity in making the statement is
    required; the statement need only be relevant to represent affairs.
    To the same effect in California Evidence Code Sec. 1220. Compare
    Uniform Rule 63(7), requiring a statement to be made in a
    representative capacity to be admissible against a party in a
    representative capacity.
      (B) Under established principles an admission may be made by
    adopting or acquiescing in the statement of another. While
    knowledge of contents would ordinarily be essential, this is not
    inevitably so: "X is a reliable person and knows what he is talking
    about." See McCormick Sec. 246, p. 527, n. 15. Adoption or
    acquiescence may be manifested in any appropriate manner. When
    silence is relied upon, the theory is that the person would, under
    the circumstances, protest the statement made in his presence, if
    untrue. The decision in each case calls for an evaluation in terms
    of probable human behavior. In civil cases, the results have
    generally been satisfactory. In criminal cases, however,
    troublesome questions have been raised by decisions holding that
    failure to deny is an admission: the inference is a fairly weak
    one, to begin with; silence may be motivated by advice of counsel
    or realization that "anything you say may be used against you";
    unusual opportunity is afforded to manufacture evidence; and
    encroachment upon the privilege against self-incrimination seems
    inescapably to be involved. However, recent decisions of the
    Supreme Court relating to custodial interrogation and the right to
    counsel appear to resolve these difficulties. Hence the rule
    contains no special provisions concerning failure to deny in
    criminal cases.
      (C) No authority is required for the general proposition that a
    statement authorized by a party to be made should have the status
    of an admission by the party. However, the question arises whether
    only statements to third persons should be so regarded, to the
    exclusion of statements by the agent to the principal. The rule is
    phrased broadly so as to encompass both. While it may be argued
    that the agent authorized to make statements to his principal does
    not speak for him, Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 273 (1962),
    communication to an outsider has not generally been thought to be
    an essential characteristic of an admission. Thus a party's books
    or records are usable against him, without regard to any intent to
    disclose to third persons. 5 Wigmore Sec. 1557. See also McCormick
    Sec. 78, pp. 159-161. In accord is New Jersey Evidence Rule
    63(8)(a). Cf. Uniform Rule 63(8)(a) and California Evidence Code
    Sec. 1222 which limit status as an admission in this regard to
    statements authorized by the party to be made "for" him, which is
    perhaps an ambiguous limitation to statements to third persons.

    Rev. 855, 860-861 (1961).
      (D) The tradition has been to test the admissibility of
    statements by agents, as admissions, by applying the usual test of
    agency. Was the admission made by the agent acting in the scope of
    his employment? Since few principals employ agents for the purpose
    of making damaging statements, the usual result was exclusion of
    the statement. Dissatisfaction with this loss of valuable and
    helpful evidence has been increasing. A substantial trend favors
    admitting statements related to a matter within the scope of the
    agency or employment. Grayson v. Williams, 256 F.2d 61 (10th Cir.
    1958); Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij N.V. KLM Royal Dutch
    Airlines v. Tuller, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 282, 292 F.2d 775, 784 (1961);
    Martin v. Savage Truck Lines, Inc., 121 F.Supp. 417 (D.D.C. 1054),
    and numerous state court decisions collected in 4 Wigmore, 1964
    Supp., pp. 66-73, with comments by the editor that the statements
    should have been excluded as not within scope of agency. For the
    traditional view see Northern Oil Co. v. Socony Mobile Oil Co., 347
    F.2d 81, 85 (2d Cir. 1965) and cases cited therein. Similar
    provisions are found in Uniform Rule 63(9)(a), Kansas Code of Civil
    Procedure Sec. 60-460(i)(1), and New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(9)(a).
      (E) The limitation upon the admissibility of statements of co-
    conspirators to those made "during the course and in furtherance
    of the conspiracy" is in the accepted pattern. While the broadened
    view of agency taken in item (iv) might suggest wider admissibility
    of statements of co-conspirators, the agency theory of conspiracy
    is at best a fiction and ought not to serve as a basis for
    admissibility beyond that already established. See Levie, Hearsay
    and Conspiracy, 52 Mich.L.Rev. 1159 (1954); Comment, 25
    U.Chi.L.Rev. 530 (1958). The rule is consistent with the position
    of the Supreme Court in denying admissibility to statements made
    after the objectives of the conspiracy have either failed or been
    achieved. Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440, 69 S.Ct. 716,
    93 L.Ed. 790 (1949); Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 490,
    83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). For similarly limited
    provisions see California Evidence Code Sec. 1223 and New Jersey
    Rule 63(9)(b). Cf. Uniform Rule 63(9)(b).

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      Present federal law, except in the Second Circuit, permits the
    use of prior inconsistent statements of a witness for impeachment
    only. Rule 801(d)(1) as proposed by the Court would have permitted
    all such statements to be admissible as substantive evidence, an
    approach followed by a small but growing number of State
    jurisdictions and recently held constitutional in California v.
    Green, 399 U.S. 149 (1970). Although there was some support
    expressed for the Court Rule, based largely on the need to
    counteract the effect of witness intimidation in criminal cases,
    the Committee decided to adopt a compromise version of the Rule
    similar to the position of the Second Circuit. The Rule as amended
    draws a distinction between types of prior inconsistent statements
    (other than statements of identification of a person made after
    perceiving him which are currently admissible, see United States v.
    Anderson, 406 F.2d 719, 720 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 967
    (1969)) and allows only those made while the declarant was subject
    to cross-examination at a trial or hearing or in a deposition, to
    be admissible for their truth. Compare United States v. DeSisto,
    329 F.2d 929 (2nd Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 979 (1964); United
    States v. Cunningham, 446 F.2d 194 (2nd Cir. 1971) (restricting the
    admissibility of prior inconsistent statements as substantive
    evidence to those made under oath in a formal proceeding, but not
    requiring that there have been an opportunity for cross-
    examination). The rationale for the Committee's decision is that
    (1) unlike in most other situations involving unsworn or oral
    statements, there can be no dispute as to whether the prior
    statement was made; and (2) the context of a formal proceeding, an
    oath, and the opportunity for cross-examination provide firm
    additional assurances of the reliability of the prior statement.

      NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, SENATE REPORT NO. 93-1277  
      Rule 801 defines what is and what is not hearsay for the purpose
    of admitting a prior statement as substantive evidence. A prior
    statement of a witness at a trial or hearing which is inconsistent
    with his testimony is, of course, always admissible for the purpose
    of impeaching the witness' credibility.
      As submitted by the Supreme Court, subdivision (d)(1)(A) made
    admissible as substantive evidence the prior statement of a witness
    inconsistent with his present testimony.
      The House severely limited the admissibility of prior
    inconsistent statements by adding a requirement that the prior
    statement must have been subject to cross-examination, thus
    precluding even the use of grand jury statements. The requirement
    that the prior statement must have been subject to cross-
    examination appears unnecessary since this rule comes into play
    only when the witness testifies in the present trial. At that time,
    he is on the stand and can explain an earlier position and be cross-
    examined as to both.
      The requirement that the statement be under oath also appears
    unnecessary. Notwithstanding the absence of an oath contemporaneous
    with the statement, the witness, when on the stand, qualifying or
    denying the prior statement, is under oath. In any event, of all
    the many recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule, only one
    (former testimony) requires that the out-of-court statement have
    been made under oath. With respect to the lack of evidence of the
    demeanor of the witness at the time of the prior statement, it
    would be difficult to improve upon Judge Learned Hand's observation
    that when the jury decides that the truth is not what the witness
    says now but what he said before, they are still deciding from what
    they see and hear in court [Di Carlo v. U.S., 6 F.2d 364 (2d Cir.
    1925)].
      The rule as submitted by the Court has positive advantages. The
    prior statement was made nearer in time to the events, when memory
    was fresher and intervening influences had not been brought into
    play. A realistic method is provided for dealing with the turncoat
    witness who changes his story on the stand [see Comment, California
    Evidence Code Sec. 1235; McCormick, Evidence, Sec. 38 (2nd ed.
    1972)].
      New Jersey, California, and Utah have adopted a rule similar to
    this one; and Nevada, New Mexico, and Wisconsin have adopted the
    identical Federal rule.
      For all of these reasons, we think the House amendment should be
    rejected and the rule as submitted by the Supreme Court reinstated.
    [It would appear that some of the opposition to this Rule is based
    on a concern that a person could be convicted solely upon evidence
    admissible under this Rule. The Rule, however, is not addressed to
    the question of the sufficiency of evidence to send a case to the
    jury, but merely as to its admissibility. Factual circumstances
    could well arise where, if this were the sole evidence, dismissal
    would be appropriate].
      As submitted by the Supreme Court and as passed by the House,
    subdivision (d)(1)(c) of rule 801 made admissible the prior
    statement identifying a person made after perceiving him. The
    committee decided to delete this provision because of the concern
    that a person could be convicted solely upon evidence admissible
    under this subdivision.
      The House approved the long-accepted rule that "a statement by a
    coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of
    the conspiracy" is not hearsay as it was submitted by the Supreme
    Court. While the rule refers to a coconspirator, it is this
    committee's understanding that the rule is meant to carry forward
    the universally accepted doctrine that a joint venturer is
    considered as a coconspirator for the purposes of this rule even
    though no conspiracy has been charged. United States v. Rinaldi,
    393 F.2d 97, 99 (2d Cir.), cert. denied 393 U.S. 913 (1968); United
    States v. Spencer, 415 F.2d 1301, 1304 (7th Cir. 1969).

          NOTES OF CONFERENCE COMMITTEE, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-1597      
      Rule 801 supplies some basic definitions for the rules of
    evidence that deal with hearsay. Rule 801(d)(1) defines certain
    statements as not hearsay. The Senate amendments make two changes
    in it.
      The House bill provides that a statement is not hearsay if the
    declarant testifies and is subject to cross-examination concerning
    the statement and if the statement is inconsistent with his
    testimony and was given under oath subject to cross-examination and
    subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial or hearing or in a
    deposition. The Senate amendment drops the requirement that the
    prior statement be given under oath subject to cross-examination
    and subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial or hearing or in a
    deposition.
      The Conference adopts the Senate amendment with an amendment, so
    that the rule now requires that the prior inconsistent statement be
    given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial,
    hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition. The rule as
    adopted covers statements before a grand jury. Prior inconsistent
    statements may, of course, be used for impeaching the credibility
    of a witness. When the prior inconsistent statement is one made by
    a defendant in a criminal case, it is covered by Rule 801(d)(2).
      The House bill provides that a statement is not hearsay if the
    declarant testifies and is subject to cross-examination concerning
    the statement and the statement is one of identification of a
    person made after perceiving him. The Senate amendment eliminated
    this provision.
      The Conference adopts the Senate amendment.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 801(d)(2) has been amended in order to respond to three
    issues raised by Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171 (1987).
    First, the amendment codifies the holding in Bourjaily by stating
    expressly that a court shall consider the contents of a
    coconspirator's statement in determining "the existence of the
    conspiracy and the participation therein of the declarant and the
    party against whom the statement is offered." According to
    Bourjaily, Rule 104(a) requires these preliminary questions to be
    established by a preponderance of the evidence.
      Second, the amendment resolves an issue on which the Court had
    reserved decision. It provides that the contents of the declarant's
    statement do not alone suffice to establish a conspiracy in which
    the declarant and the defendant participated. The court must
    consider in addition the circumstances surrounding the statement,
    such as the identity of the speaker, the context in which the
    statement was made, or evidence corroborating the contents of the
    statement in making its determination as to each preliminary
    question. This amendment is in accordance with existing practice.
    Every court of appeals that has resolved this issue requires some
    evidence in addition to the contents of the statement. See, e.g.,
    United States v. Beckham, 968 F.2d 47, 51 (D.C.Cir. 1992); United
    States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1181-82 (1st Cir. 1993), cert.
    denied, 114 S.Ct. 2714 (1994); United States v. Daly, 842 F.2d
    1380, 1386 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 821 (1988); United
    States v. Clark, 18 F.3d 1337, 1341-42 (6th Cir.), cert. denied,
    115 S.Ct. 152 (1994); United States v. Zambrana, 841 F.2d 1320,
    1344-45 (7th Cir. 1988); United States v. Silverman, 861 F.2d 571,
    577 (9th Cir. 1988); United States v. Gordon, 844 F.2d 1397, 1402
    (9th Cir. 1988); United States v. Hernandez, 829 F.2d 988, 993
    (10th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1013 (1988); United States
    v. Byrom, 910 F.2d 725, 736 (11th Cir. 1990).
      Third, the amendment extends the reasoning of Bourjaily to
    statements offered under subdivisions (C) and (D) of Rule
    801(d)(2). In Bourjaily, the Court rejected treating foundational
    facts pursuant to the law of agency in favor of an evidentiary
    approach governed by Rule 104(a). The Advisory Committee believes
    it appropriate to treat analogously preliminary questions relating
    to the declarant's authority under subdivision (C), and the agency
    or employment relationship and scope thereof under subdivision (D).
      GAP Report on Rule 801. The word "shall" was substituted for the
    word "may" in line 19. The second sentence of the committee note
    was changed accordingly.

      including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact
      remembered or believed unless it relates to the execution,
      revocation, identification, or terms of declarant's will.
        (4) Statements for Purposes of Medical Diagnosis or Treatment.

      to diagnosis or treatment.
        (5) Recorded Recollection. A memorandum or record concerning a
      matter about which a witness once had knowledge but now has
      insufficient recollection to enable the witness to testify fully

      other qualified witness, or by certification that complies with
      Rule 902(11), Rule 902(12), or a statute permitting
      certification, unless the source of information or the method or

      sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of
      trustworthiness.
        (8) Public Records and Reports. Records, reports, statements,
      or data compilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies,

      a record, report, statement, or data compilation, in any form, or
      the nonoccurrence or nonexistence of a matter of which a record,
      report, statement, or data compilation, in any form, was
      regularly made and preserved by a public office or agency,
      evidence in the form of a certification in accordance with rule
      902, or testimony, that diligent search failed to disclose the

      the recording of documents of that kind in that office.
        (15) Statements in Documents Affecting an Interest in Property.
      A statement contained in a document purporting to establish or
      affect an interest in property if the matter stated was relevant
      to the purpose of the document, unless dealings with the property

      history, medicine, or other science or art, established as a
      reliable authority by the testimony or admission of the witness

      ancestry, or other similar fact of personal or family history.
        (20) Reputation Concerning Boundaries or General History.
      Reputation in a community, arising before the controversy, as to
      boundaries of or customs affecting lands in the community, and
      reputation as to events of general history important to the
      community or State or nation in which located.

      prosecution for purposes other than impeachment, judgments
      against persons other than the accused. The pendency of an appeal
      may be shown but does not affect admissibility.

               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      The exceptions are phrased in terms of nonapplication of the
    hearsay rule, rather than in positive terms of admissibility, in
    order to repel any implication that other possible grounds for
    exclusion are eliminated from consideration.
      The present rule proceeds upon the theory that under appropriate
    circumstances a hearsay statement may possess circumstantial
    guarantees of trustworthiness sufficient to justify nonproduction
    of the declarant in person at the trial even though he may be
    available. The theory finds vast support in the many exceptions to
    the hearsay rule developed by the common law in which
    unavailability of the declarant is not a relevant factor. The
    present rule is a synthesis of them, with revision where modern
    developments and conditions are believed to make that course
    appropriate.
      In a hearsay situation, the declarant is, of course, a witness,
    and neither this rule nor Rule 804 dispenses with the requirement
    of firsthand knowledge. It may appear from his statement or be
    inferable from circumstances.
      See Rule 602.
      Exceptions (1) and (2). In considerable measure these two
    examples overlap, though based on somewhat different theories. The
    most significant practical difference will lie in the time lapse
    allowable between event and statement.
      The underlying theory of Exception [paragraph] (1) is that
    substantial contemporaneity of event and statement negative the
    likelihood of deliberate of conscious misrepresentation. Moreover,
    if the witness is the declarant, he may be examined on the
    statement. If the witness is not the declarant, he may be examined
    as to the circumstances as an aid in evaluating the statement.
    Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 340-341 (1962).
      The theory of Exception [paragraph] (2) is simply that
    circumstances may produce a condition of excitement which
    temporarily stills the capacity of reflection and produces
    utterances free of conscious fabrication. 6 Wigmore Sec. 1747, p.
    135. Spontaneity is the key factor in each instance, though arrived
    at by somewhat different routes. Both are needed in order to avoid
    needless niggling.
      While the theory of Exception [paragraph] (2) has been criticized
    on the ground that excitement impairs accuracy of observation as
    well as eliminating conscious fabrication, Hutchins and Slesinger,
    Some Observations on the Law of Evidence: Spontaneous Exclamations,
    28 Colum.L.Rev. 432 (1928), it finds support in cases without
    number. See cases in 6 Wigmore Sec. 1750; Annot., 53 A.L.R.2d 1245
    (statements as to cause of or responsibility for motor vehicle
    accident); Annot., 4 A.L.R.3d 149 (accusatory statements by
    homicide victims). Since unexciting events are less likely to evoke
    comment, decisions involving Exception [paragraph] (1) are far less
    numerous. Illustrative are Tampa Elec. Co. v. Getrost, 151 Fla.
    558, 10 So.2d 83 (1942); Houston Oxygen Co. v. Davis, 139 Tex. 1,
    161 S.W.2d 474 (1942); and cases cited in McCormick Sec. 273, p.
    585, n. 4.
      With respect to the time element, Exception [paragraph] (1)
    recognizes that in many, if not most, instances precise
    contemporaneity is not possible, and hence a slight lapse is
    allowable. Under Exception [paragraph] (2) the standard of
    measurement is the duration of the state of excitement. "How long
    can excitement prevail? Obviously there are no pat answers and the
    character of the transaction or event will largely determine the
    significance of the time factor." Slough, Spontaneous Statements
    and State of Mind, 46 Iowa L.Rev. 224, 243 (1961); McCormick Sec.
    272, p. 580.
      Participation by the declarant is not required: a nonparticipant
    may be moved to describe what he perceives, and one may be startled
    by an event in which he is not an actor. Slough, supra; McCormick,
    supra; 6 Wigmore Sec. 1755; Annot., 78 A.L.R.2d 300.
      Whether proof of the startling event may be made by the statement
    itself is largely an academic question, since in most cases there
    is present at least circumstantial evidence that something of a
    startling nature must have occurred. For cases in which the
    evidence consists of the condition of the declarant (injuries,
    state of shock), see Insurance Co. v. Mosely, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.),
    397, 19 L.Ed. 437 (1869); Wheeler v. United States, 93 U.S.A.App.
    D.C. 159, 211 F.2d 19 (1953); cert. denied 347 U.S. 1019, 74 S.Ct.
    876, 98 L.Ed. 1140; Wetherbee v. Safety Casualty Co., 219 F.2d 274
    (5th Cir. 1955); Lampe v. United States, 97 U.S.App.D.C. 160, 229
    F.2d 43 (1956). Nevertheless, on occasion the only evidence may be
    the content of the statement itself, and rulings that it may be
    sufficient are described as "increasing," Slough, supra at 246, and
    as the "prevailing practice," McCormick Sec. 272, p. 579.
    Illustrative are Armour & Co. v. Industrial Commission, 78 Colo.
    569, 243 P. 546 (1926); Young v. Stewart, 191 N.C. 297, 131 S.E.
    735 (1926). Moreover, under Rule 104(a) the judge is not limited by
    the hearsay rule in passing upon preliminary questions of fact.
      Proof of declarant's perception by his statement presents similar
    considerations when declarant is identified. People v. Poland, 22
    Ill.2d 175, 174 N.E.2d 804 (1961). However, when declarant is an
    unidentified bystander, the cases indicate hesitancy in upholding
    the statement alone as sufficient, Garrett v. Howden, 73 N.M. 307,
    387 P.2d 874 (1963); Beck v. Dye, 200 Wash. 1, 92 P.2d 1113 (1939),
    a result which would under appropriate circumstances be consistent
    with the rule.
      Permissible subject matter of the statement is limited under
    Exception [paragraph] (1) to description or explanation of the
    event or condition, the assumption being that spontaneity, in the
    absence of a startling event, may extend no farther. In Exception
    [paragraph] (2), however, the statement need only "relate" to the
    startling event or condition, thus affording a broader scope of
    subject matter coverage. 6 Wigmore Secs. 1750, 1754. See Sanitary
    Grocery Co. v. Snead, 67 App.D.C. 129, 90 F.2d 374 (1937), slip-and-
    fall case sustaining admissibility of clerk's statement, "That has
    been on the floor for a couple of hours," and Murphy Auto Parts
    Co., Inc. v. Ball, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 416, 249 F.2d 508 (1957),
    upholding admission, on issue of driver's agency, of his statement
    that he had to call on a customer and was in a hurry to get home.
    Quick, Hearsay, Excitement, Necessity and the Uniform Rules: A
    Reappraisal of Rule 63(4), 6 Wayne L.Rev. 204, 206-209 (1960).
      Similar provisions are found in Uniform Rule 63(4)(a) and (b);
    California Evidence Code Sec. 1240 (as to Exception (2) only);
    Kansas Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 60-460(d)(1) and (2); New
    Jersey Evidence Rule 63(4).
      Exception (3) is essentially a specialized application of
    Exception [paragraph] (1), presented separately to enhance its
    usefulness and accessibility. See McCormick Secs. 265, 268.
      The exclusion of "statements of memory or belief to prove the
    fact remembered or believed" is necessary to avoid the virtual
    destruction of the hearsay rule which would otherwise result from
    allowing state of mind, provable by a hearsay statement, to serve
    as the basis for an inference of the happening of the event which
    produced the state of mind). Shepard v. United States, 290 U.S. 96,
    54 S.Ct. 22, 78 L.Ed. 196 (1933); Maguire, The Hillmon Case -
    Thirty-three Years After, 38 Harv.L.Rev. 709, 719-731 (1925);
    Hinton, States of Mind and the Hearsay Rule, 1 U.Chi.L.Rev. 394,
    421-423 (1934). The rule of Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Hillman, 145
    U.S. 285, 12 S.Ct. 909, 36 L.Ed. 706 (1892), allowing evidence of
    intention as tending to prove the doing of the act intended, is of
    course, left undisturbed.
      The carving out, from the exclusion mentioned in the preceding
    paragraph, of declarations relating to the execution, revocation,
    identification, or terms of declarant's will represents an ad hoc
    judgment which finds ample reinforcement in the decisions, resting
    on practical grounds of necessity and expediency rather than logic.
    McCormick Sec. 271, pp. 577-578; Annot., 34 A.L.R.2d 588, 62
    A.L.R.2d 855. A similar recognition of the need for and practical
    value of this kind of evidence is found in California Evidence Code
    Sec. 1260.
      Exception (4). Even those few jurisdictions which have shied away
    from generally admitting statements of present condition have
    allowed them if made to a physician for purposes of diagnosis and
    treatment in view of the patient's strong motivation to be
    truthful. McCormick Sec. 266, p. 563. The same guarantee of
    trustworthiness extends to statements of past conditions and
    medical history, made for purposes of diagnosis or treatment. It
    also extends to statements as to causation, reasonably pertinent to
    the same purposes, in accord with the current trend, Shell Oil Co.
    v. Industrial Commission, 2 Ill.2d 590, 119 N.E.2d 224 (1954);
    McCormick Sec. 266, p. 564; New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(12)(c).
    Statements as to fault would not ordinarily qualify under this
    latter language. Thus a patient's statement that he was struck by
    an automobile would qualify but not his statement that the car was
    driven through a red light. Under the exception the statement need
    not have been made to a physician. Statements to hospital
    attendants, ambulance drivers, or even members of the family might
    be included.
      Conventional doctrine has excluded from the hearsay exception, as
    not within its guarantee of truthfulness, statements to a physician
    consulted only for the purpose of enabling him to testify. While
    these statements were not admissible as substantive evidence, the
    expert was allowed to state the basis of his opinion, including
    statements of this kind. The distinction thus called for was one
    most unlikely to be made by juries. The rule accordingly rejects
    the limitation. This position is consistent with the provision of
    Rule 703 that the facts on which expert testimony is based need not
    be admissible in evidence if of a kind ordinarily relied upon by
    experts in the field.
      Exception (5). A hearsay exception for recorded recollection is
    generally recognized and has been described as having "long been
    favored by the federal and practically all the state courts that
    have had occasion to decide the question." United States v. Kelly,
    349 F.2d 720, 770 (2d Cir. 1965), citing numerous cases and
    sustaining the exception against a claimed denial of the right of
    confrontation. Many additional cases are cited in Annot., 82
    A.L.R.2d 473, 520. The guarantee of trustworthiness is found in the
    reliability inherent in a record made while events were still fresh
    in mind and accurately reflecting them. Owens v. State, 67 Md. 307,
    316, 10 A. 210, 212 (1887).
      The principal controversy attending the exception has centered,
    not upon the propriety of the exception itself, but upon the
    question whether a preliminary requirement of impaired memory on
    the part of the witness should be imposed. The authorities are
    divided. If regard be had only to the accuracy of the evidence,
    admittedly impairment of the memory of the witness adds nothing to
    it and should not be required. McCormick Sec. 277, p. 593; 3
    Wigmore Sec. 738, p. 76; Jordan v. People, 151 Colo. 133, 376 P.2d
    699 (1962), cert. denied 373 U.S. 944, 83 S.Ct. 1553, 10 L.Ed.2d
    699; Hall v. State, 223 Md. 158, 162 A.2d 751 (1960); State v.
    Bindhammer, 44 N.J. 372, 209 A.2d 124 (1965). Nevertheless, the
    absence of the requirement, it is believed, would encourage the use
    of statements carefully prepared for purposes of litigation under
    the supervision of attorneys, investigators, or claim adjusters.
    Hence the example includes a requirement that the witness not have
    "sufficient recollection to enable him to testify fully and
    accurately." To the same effect are California Evidence Code Sec.
    1237 and New Jersey Rule 63(1)(b), and this has been the position
    of the federal courts. Vicksburg & Meridian R.R. v. O'Brien, 119
    U.S. 99, 7 S.Ct. 118, 30 L.Ed. 299 (1886); Ahern v. Webb, 268 F.2d
    45 (10th Cir. 1959); and see N.L.R.B. v. Hudson Pulp and Paper
    Corp., 273 F.2d 660, 665 (5th Cir. 1960); N.L.R.B. v. Federal Dairy
    Co., 297 F.2d 487 (1st Cir. 1962). But cf. United States v. Adams,
    385 F.2d 548 (2d Cir. 1967).
      No attempt is made in the exception to spell out the method of
    establishing the initial knowledge or the contemporaneity and
    accuracy of the record, leaving them to be dealt with as the
    circumstances of the particular case might indicate. Multiple
    person involvement in the process of observing and recording, as in
    Rathbun v. Brancatella, 93 N.J.L. 222, 107 A. 279 (1919), is
    entirely consistent with the exception.
      Locating the exception at this place in the scheme of the rules
    is a matter of choice. There were two other possibilities. The
    first was to regard the statement as one of the group of prior
    statements of a testifying witness which are excluded entirely from
    the category of hearsay by Rule 801(d)(1). That category, however,
    requires that declarant be "subject to cross-examination," as to
    which the impaired memory aspect of the exception raises doubts.
    The other possibility was to include the exception among those
    covered by Rule 804. Since unavailability is required by that rule
    and lack of memory is listed as a species of unavailability by the
    definition of the term in Rule 804(a)(3), that treatment at first
    impression would seem appropriate. The fact is, however, that the
    unavailability requirement of the exception is of a limited and
    peculiar nature. Accordingly, the exception is located at this
    point rather than in the context of a rule where unavailability is
    conceived of more broadly.
      Exception (6) represents an area which has received much
    attention from those seeking to improve the law of evidence. The
    Commonwealth Fund Act was the result of a study completed in 1927
    by a distinguished committee under the chairmanship of Professor
    Morgan. Morgan et al., The Law of Evidence: Some Proposals for its
    Reform 63 (1927). With changes too minor to mention, it was adopted
    by Congress in 1936 as the rule for federal courts. 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    1732. A number of states took similar action. The Commissioners on
    Uniform State Laws in 1936 promulgated the Uniform Business Records
    as Evidence Act, 9A U.L.A. 506, which has acquired a substantial
    following in the states. Model Code Rule 514 and Uniform Rule
    63(13) also deal with the subject. Difference of varying degrees of
    importance exist among these various treatments.
      These reform efforts were largely within the context of business
    and commercial records, as the kind usually encountered, and
    concentrated considerable attention upon relaxing the requirement
    of producing as witnesses, or accounting for the nonproduction of,
    all participants in the process of gathering, transmitting, and
    recording information which the common law had evolved as a
    burdensome and crippling aspect of using records of this type. In
    their areas of primary emphasis on witnesses to be called and the
    general admissibility of ordinary business and commercial records,
    the Commonwealth Fund Act and the Uniform Act appear to have worked
    well. The exception seeks to preserve their advantages.
      On the subject of what witnesses must be called, the Commonwealth
    Fund Act eliminated the common law requirement of calling or
    accounting for all participants by failing to mention it. United
    States v. Mortimer, 118 F.2d 266 (2d Cir. 1941); La Porte v. United
    States, 300 F.2d 878 (9th Cir. 1962); McCormick Sec. 290, p. 608.
    Model Code Rule 514 and Uniform Rule 63(13) did likewise. The
    Uniform Act, however, abolished the common law requirement in
    express terms, providing that the requisite foundation testimony
    might be furnished by "the custodian or other qualified witness."
    Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act, Sec. 2; 9A U.L.A. 506.
    The exception follows the Uniform Act in this respect.
      The element of unusual reliability of business records is said
    variously to be supplied by systematic checking, by regularity and
    continuity which produce habits of precision, by actual experience
    of business in relying upon them, or by a duty to make an accurate
    record as part of a continuing job or occupation. McCormick Secs.
    281, 286, 287; Laughlin, Business Entries and the Like, 46 Iowa
    L.Rev. 276 (1961). The model statutes and rules have sought to
    capture these factors and to extend their impact by employing the
    phrase "regular course of business," in conjunction with a
    definition of "business" far broader than its ordinarily accepted
    meaning. The result is a tendency unduly to emphasize a requirement
    of routineness and repetitiveness and an insistence that other
    types of records be squeezed into the fact patterns which give rise
    to traditional business records. The rule therefore adopts the
    phrase "the course of a regularly conducted activity" as capturing
    the essential basis of the hearsay exception as it has evolved and
    the essential element which can be abstracted from the various
    specifications of what is a "business."
      Amplification of the kinds of activities producing admissible
    records has given rise to problems which conventional business
    records by their nature avoid. They are problems of the source of
    the recorded information, of entries in opinion form, of
    motivation, and of involvement as participant in the matters
    recorded.
      Sources of information presented no substantial problem with
    ordinary business records. All participants, including the observer
    or participant furnishing the information to be recorded, were
    acting routinely, under a duty of accuracy, with employer reliance
    on the result, or in short "in the regular course of business." If,
    however, the supplier of the information does not act in the
    regular course, an essential link is broken; the assurance of
    accuracy does not extend to the information itself, and the fact
    that it may be recorded with scrupulous accuracy is of no avail. An
    illustration is the police report incorporating information
    obtained from a bystander: the officer qualifies as acting in the
    regular course but the informant does not. The leading case,
    Johnson v. Lutz, 253 N.Y. 124, 170 N.E. 517 (1930), held that a
    report thus prepared was inadmissible. Most of the authorities have
    agreed with the decision. Gencarella v. Fyfe, 171 F.2d 419 (1st
    Cir. 1948); Gordon v. Robinson, 210 F.2d 192 (3d Cir. 1954);
    Standard Oil Co. of California v. Moore, 251 F.2d 188, 214 (9th
    Cir. 1957), cert. denied 356 U.S. 975, 78 S.Ct. 1139, 2 L.Ed.2d
    1148; Yates v. Bair Transport, Inc., 249 F.Supp. 681 (S.D.N.Y.
    1965); Annot., 69 A.L.R.2d 1148. Cf. Hawkins v. Gorea Motor
    Express, Inc., 360 F.2d 933 (2d Cir 1966). Contra, 5 Wigmore Sec.
    1530a, n. 1, pp. 391-392. The point is not dealt with specifically
    in the Commonwealth Fund Act, the Uniform Act, or Uniform Rule
    63(13). However, Model Code Rule 514 contains the requirement "that
    it was the regular course of that business for one with personal
    knowledge * * * to make such a memorandum or record or to transmit
    information thereof to be included in such a memorandum or record *
    * *." The rule follows this lead in requiring an informant with
    knowledge acting in the course of the regularly conducted activity.
      Entries in the form of opinions were not encountered in
    traditional business records in view of the purely factual nature
    of the items recorded, but they are now commonly encountered with
    respect to medical diagnoses, prognoses, and test results, as well
    as occasionally in other areas. The Commonwealth Fund Act provided
    only for records of an "act, transaction, occurrence, or event,"
    while the Uniform Act, Model Code Rule 514, and Uniform Rule 63(13)
    merely added the ambiguous term "condition." The limited phrasing
    of the Commonwealth Fund Act, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1732, may account for
    the reluctance of some federal decisions to admit diagnostic
    entries. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 79 U.S.App.D.C. 66, 147
    F.2d 297 (1945); Lyles v. United States, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 22, 254

    Skogen v. Dow Chemical Co., 375 F.2d 692 (8th Cir. 1967). Other
    federal decisions, however, experienced no difficulty in freely
    admitting diagnostic entries. Reed v. Order of United Commercial
    Travelers, 123 F.2d 252 (2d Cir. 1941); Buckminster's Estate v.
    Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 147 F.2d 331 (2d Cir. 1944);

    (1947). In order to make clear its adherence to the latter
    position, the rule specifically includes both diagnoses and
    opinions, in addition to acts, events, and conditions, as proper
    subjects of admissible entries.
      Problems of the motivation of the informant have been a source of
    difficulty and disagreement. In Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109, 63
    S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943), exclusion of an accident report
    made by the since deceased engineer, offered by defendant railroad
    trustees in a grade crossing collision case, was upheld. The report
    was not "in the regular course of business," not a record of the
    systematic conduct of the business as a business, said the Court.
    The report was prepared for use in litigating, not railroading.
    While the opinion mentions the motivation of the engineer only
    obliquely, the emphasis on records of routine operations is
    significant only by virtue of impact on motivation to be accurate.
    Absence of routineness raises lack of motivation to be accurate.
    The opinion of the Court of Appeals had gone beyond mere lack of
    motive to be accurate: the engineer's statement was "dripping with
    motivations to misrepresent." Hoffman v. Palmer, 129 F.2d 976, 991
    (2d Cir. 1942). The direct introduction of motivation is a
    disturbing factor, since absence of motivation to misrepresent has
    not traditionally been a requirement of the rule; that records
    might be self-serving has not been a ground for exclusion.
    Laughlin, Business Records and the Like, 46 Iowa L.Rev. 276, 285
    (1961). As Judge Clark said in his dissent, "I submit that there is
    hardly a grocer's account book which could not be excluded on that
    basis." 129 F.2d at 1002. A physician's evaluation report of a
    personal injury litigant would appear to be in the routine of his
    business. If the report is offered by the party at whose instance
    it was made, however, it has been held inadmissible, Yates v. Bair
    Transport, Inc., 249 F.Supp. 681 (S.D.N.Y. 1965), otherwise if
    offered by the opposite party, Korte v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co.,
    191 F.2d 86 (2d Cir. 1951), cert. denied 342 U.S. 868, 72 S.Ct.
    108, 96 L.Ed. 652.
      The decisions hinge on motivation and which party is entitled to
    be concerned about it. Professor McCormick believed that the
    doctor's report or the accident report were sufficiently routine to
    justify admissibility. McCormick Sec. 287, p. 604. Yet hesitation
    must be experienced in admitting everything which is observed and
    recorded in the course of a regularly conducted activity. Efforts
    to set a limit are illustrated by Hartzog v. United States, 217
    F.2d 706 (4th Cir. 1954), error to admit worksheets made by since
    deceased deputy collector in preparation for the instant income tax
    evasion prosecution, and United States v. Ware, 247 F.2d 698 (7th
    Cir. 1957), error to admit narcotics agents' records of purchases.
    See also Exception [paragraph] (8), infra, as to the public record
    aspects of records of this nature. Some decisions have been
    satisfied as to motivation of an accident report if made pursuant
    to statutory duty, United States v. New York Foreign Trade Zone
    Operators, 304 F.2d 792 (2d Cir. 1962); Taylor v. Baltimore & O. R.
    Co., 344 F.2d 281 (2d Cir. 1965), since the report was oriented in
    a direction other than the litigation which ensued. Cf. Matthews v.
    United States, 217 F.2d 409 (5th Cir. 1954). The formulation of
    specific terms which would assure satisfactory results in all cases
    is not possible. Consequently the rule proceeds from the base that
    records made in the course of a regularly conducted activity will
    be taken as admissible but subject to authority to exclude if "the
    sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of
    trustworthiness."
      Occasional decisions have reached for enhanced accuracy by
    requiring involvement as a participant in matters reported. Clainos
    v. United States, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 278, 163 F.2d 593 (1947), error
    to admit police records of convictions; Standard Oil Co. of
    California v. Moore, 251 F.2d 188 (9th Cir. 1957), cert. denied 356
    U.S. 975, 78 S.Ct. 1139, 2 L.Ed.2d 1148, error to admit employees'
    records of observed business practices of others. The rule includes
    no requirement of this nature. Wholly acceptable records may
    involve matters merely observed, e.g. the weather.
      The form which the "record" may assume under the rule is
    described broadly as a "memorandum, report, record, or data
    compilation, in any form." The expression "data compilation" is
    used as broadly descriptive of any means of storing information
    other than the conventional words and figures in written or
    documentary form. It includes, but is by no means limited to,
    electronic computer storage. The term is borrowed from revised Rule
    34(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.
      Exception (7). Failure of a record to mention a matter which
    would ordinarily be mentioned is satisfactory evidence of its
    nonexistence. Uniform Rule 63(14), Comment. While probably not
    hearsay as defined in Rule 801, supra, decisions may be found which
    class the evidence not only as hearsay but also as not within any
    exception. In order to set the question at rest in favor of
    admissibility, it is specifically treated here. McCormick Sec. 289,
    p. 609; Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 314 (1962); 5 Wigmore
    Sec. 1531; Uniform Rule 63(14); California Evidence Code Sec. 1272;
    Kansas Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 60-460(n); New Jersey Evidence
    Rule 63(14).
      Exception (8). Public records are a recognized hearsay exception
    at common law and have been the subject of statutes without number.
    McCormick Sec. 291. See, for example, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1733, the
    relative narrowness of which is illustrated by its nonapplicability
    to nonfederal public agencies, thus necessitating report to the
    less appropriate business record exception to the hearsay rule. Kay
    v. United States, 255 F.2d 476 (4th Cir. 1958). The rule makes no
    distinction between federal and nonfederal offices and agencies.
      Justification for the exception is the assumption that a public
    official will perform his duty properly and the unlikelihood that
    he will remember details independently of the record. Wong Wing Foo
    v. McGrath, 196 F.2d 120 (9th Cir. 1952), and see Chesapeake &
    Delaware Canal Co. v. United States, 250 U.S. 123, 39 S.Ct. 407, 63
    L.Ed. 889 (1919). As to items (a) and (b), further support is found
    in the reliability factors underlying records of regularly
    conducted activities generally. See Exception [paragraph] (6),
    supra.
      (a) Cases illustrating the admissibility of records of the
    office's or agency's own activities are numerous. Chesapeake &
    Delaware Canal Co. v. United States, 250 U.S. 123, 39 S.Ct. 407, 63
    L.Ed. 889 (1919), Treasury records of miscellaneous receipts and
    disbursements; Howard v. Perrin, 200 U.S. 71, 26 S.Ct. 195, 50
    I.Ed. 374 (1906), General Land Office records; Ballew v. United
    States, 160 U.S. 187, 16 S.Ct. 263, 40 L.Ed. 388 (1895), Pension
    Office records.
      (b) Cases sustaining admissibility of records of matters observed
    are also numerous. United States v. Van Hook, 284 F.2d 489 (7th
    Cir. 1960), remanded for resentencing 365 U.S. 609, 81 S.Ct. 823, 5
    L.Ed.2d 821, letter from induction officer to District Attorney,
    pursuant to army regulations, stating fact and circumstances of
    refusal to be inducted; T'Kach v. United States, 242 F.2d 937 (5th
    Cir. 1957), affidavit of White House personnel officer that search
    of records showed no employment of accused, charged with
    fraudulently representing himself as an envoy of the President;
    Minnehaha County v. Kelley, 150 F.2d 356 (8th Cir. 1945); Weather
    Bureau records of rainfall; United States v. Meyer, 113 F.2d 387
    (7th Cir. 1940), cert. denied 311 U.S. 706, 61 S.Ct. 174, 85 L.Ed.
    459, map prepared by government engineer from information furnished
    by men working under his supervision.
      (c) The more controversial area of public records is that of the
    so-called "evaluative" report. The disagreement among the decisions
    has been due in part, no doubt, to the variety of situations
    encountered, as well as to differences in principle. Sustaining
    admissibility are such cases as United States v. Dumas, 149 U.S.
    278, 13 S.Ct. 872, 37 L.Ed. 734 (1893), statement of account
    certified by Postmaster General in action against postmaster;
    McCarty v. United States, 185 F.2d 520 (5th Cir. 1950), reh. denied
    187 F.2d 234, Certificate of Settlement of General Accounting
    Office showing indebtedness and letter from Army official stating
    Government had performed, in action on contract to purchase and
    remove waste food from Army camp; Moran v. Pittsburgh-Des Moines
    Steel Co., 183 F.2d 467 (3d Cir. 1950), report of Bureau of Mines
    as to cause of gas tank explosion; Petition of W - , 164 F.Supp.
    659 (E.D.Pa.1958), report by Immigration and Naturalization Service
    investigator that petitioner was known in community as wife of man
    to whom she was not married. To the opposite effect and denying
    admissibility are Franklin v. Skelly Oil Co., 141 F.2d 568 (10th
    Cir. 1944), State Fire Marshal's report of cause of gas explosion;
    Lomax Transp. Co. v. United States, 183 F.2d 331 (9th Cir. 1950),
    Certificate of Settlement from General Accounting Office in action
    for naval supplies lost in warehouse fire; Yung Jin Teung v.
    Dulles, 229 F.2d 244 (2d Cir. 1956), "Status Reports" offered to
    justify delay in processing passport applications. Police reports
    have generally been excluded except to the extent to which they
    incorporate firsthand observations of the officer. Annot., 69
    A.L.R.2d 1148. Various kinds of evaluative reports are admissible
    under federal statutes: 7 U.S.C. Sec. 78, findings of Secretary of
    Agriculture prima facie evidence of true grade of grain; 7 U.S.C.
    Sec. 210(f), findings of Secretary of Agriculture prima facie
    evidence in action for damages against stockyard owner; 7 U.S.C.
    Sec. 292, order by Secretary of Agriculture prima facie evidence in
    judicial enforcement proceedings against producers association
    monopoly; 7 U.S.C. Sec. 1622(h), Department of Agriculture
    inspection certificates of products shipped in interstate commerce
    prima facie evidence; 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1440(c), separation of alien
    from military service on conditions other than honorable provable
    by certificate from department in proceedings to revoke
    citizenship; 18 U.S.C. Sec. 4245, certificate of Director of
    Prisons that convicted person has been examined and found probably
    incompetent at time of trial prima facie evidence in court hearing
    on competency; 42 U.S.C. Sec. 269(b), bill of health by appropriate
    official prima facie evidence of vessel's sanitary history and
    condition and compliance with regulations; 46 U.S.C. Sec. 679,
    certificate of consul presumptive evidence of refusal of master to
    transport destitute seamen to United States. While these statutory
    exceptions to the hearsay rule are left undisturbed, Rule 802, the
    willingness of Congress to recognize a substantial measure of
    admissibility for evaluative reports is a helpful guide.
      Factors which may be of assistance in passing upon the
    admissibility of evaluative reports include; (1) the timeliness of
    the investigation, McCormack, Can the Courts Make Wider Use of
    Reports of Official Investigations? 42 Iowa L.Rev. 363 (1957); (2)
    the special skill or experience of the official, id., (3) whether a
    hearing was held and the level at which conducted, Franklin v.
    Skelly Oil Co., 141 F.2d 568 (10th Cir. 1944); (4) possible
    motivation problems suggested by Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109,
    63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943). Others no doubt could be added.
      The formulation of an approach which would give appropriate
    weight to all possible factors in every situation is an obvious
    impossibility. Hence the rule, as in Exception [paragraph] (6),
    assumes admissibility in the first instance but with ample
    provision for escape if sufficient negative factors are present. In
    one respect, however, the rule with respect to evaluate reports
    under item (c) is very specific; they are admissible only in civil
    cases and against the government in criminal cases in view of the
    almost certain collision with confrontation rights which would
    result from their use against the accused in a criminal case.
      Exception (9). Records of vital statistics are commonly the
    subject of particular statutes making them admissible in evidence.
    Uniform Vital Statistics Act, 9C U.L.A. 350 (1957). The rule is in
    principle narrower than Uniform Rule 63(16) which includes reports
    required of persons performing functions authorized by statute, yet
    in practical effect the two are substantially the same. Comment
    Uniform Rule 63(16). The exception as drafted is in the pattern of
    California Evidence Code Sec. 1281.
      Exception (10). The principle of proving nonoccurrence of an
    event by evidence of the absence of a record which would regularly
    be made of its occurrence, developed in Exception [paragraph] (7)
    with respect to regularly conducted activities, is here extended to
    public records of the kind mentioned in Exceptions [paragraphs] (8)
    and (9). 5 Wigmore Sec. 1633(6), p. 519. Some harmless duplication
    no doubt exists with Exception [paragraph] (7). For instances of
    federal statutes recognizing this method of proof, see 8 U.S.C.
    Sec. 1284(b), proof of absence of alien crewman's name from
    outgoing manifest prima facie evidence of failure to detain or
    deport, and 42 U.S.C. Sec. 405(c)(3), (4)(B), (4)(C), absence of
    HEW [Department of Health, Education, and Welfare] record prima
    facie evidence of no wages or self-employment income.
      The rule includes situations in which absence of a record may
    itself be the ultimate focal point of inquiry, e.g. People v. Love,
    310 Ill. 558, 142 N.E. 204 (1923), certificate of Secretary of
    State admitted to show failure to file documents required by
    Securities Law, as well as cases where the absence of a record is
    offered as proof of the nonoccurrence of an event ordinarily
    recorded.
      The refusal of the common law to allow proof by certificate of
    the lack of a record or entry has no apparent justification, 5
    Wigmore Sec. 1678(7), p. 752. The rule takes the opposite position,
    as do Uniform Rule 63(17); California Evidence Code Sec. 1284;
    Kansas Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 60-460(c); New Jersey Evidence
    Rule 63(17). Congress has recognized certification as evidence of
    the lack of a record. 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1360(d), certificate of
    Attorney General or other designated officer that no record of
    Immigration and Naturalization Service of specified nature or entry
    therein is found, admissible in alien cases.
      Exception (11). Records of activities of religious organizations
    are currently recognized as admissible at least to the extent of
    the business records exception to the hearsay rule, 5 Wigmore Sec.
    1523, p. 371, and Exception [paragraph] (6) would be applicable.
    However, both the business record doctrine and Exception
    [paragraph] (6) require that the person furnishing the information
    be one in the business or activity. The result is such decisions as
    Daily v. Grand Lodge, 311 Ill. 184, 142 N.E. 478 (1924), holding a
    church record admissible to prove fact, date, and place of baptism,
    but not age of child except that he had at least been born at the
    time. In view of the unlikelihood that false information would be
    furnished on occasions of this kind, the rule contains no
    requirement that the informant be in the course of the activity.
    See California Evidence Code Sec. 1315 and Comment.
      Exception (12). The principle of proof by certification is
    recognized as to public officials in Exceptions [paragraphs] (8)
    and (10), and with respect to authentication in Rule 902. The
    present exception is a duplication to the extent that it deals with
    a certificate by a public official, as in the case of a judge who
    performs a marriage ceremony. The area covered by the rule is,
    however, substantially larger and extends the certification
    procedure to clergymen and the like who perform marriages and other
    ceremonies or administer sacraments. Thus certificates of such
    matters as baptism or confirmation, as well as marriage, are
    included. In principle they are as acceptable evidence as
    certificates of public officers. See 5 Wigmore Sec. 1645, as to
    marriage certificates. When the person executing the certificate is
    not a public official, the self-authenticating character of
    documents purporting to emanate from public officials, see Rule
    902, is lacking and proof is required that the person was
    authorized and did make the certificate. The time element, however,
    may safely be taken as supplied by the certificate, once authority
    and authenticity are established, particularly in view of the
    presumption that a document was executed on the date it bears.
      For similar rules, some limited to certificates of marriage, with
    variations in foundation requirements, see Uniform Rule 63(18);
    California Evidence Code Sec. 1316; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure
    Sec. 60-460(p); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(18).
      Exception (13). Records of family history kept in family Bibles
    have by long tradition been received in evidence. 5 Wigmore Secs.
    1495, 1496, citing numerous statutes and decisions. See also
    Regulations, Social Security Administration, 20 C.F.R. Sec.
    404.703(c), recognizing family Bible entries as proof of age in the
    absence of public or church records. Opinions in the area also
    include inscriptions on tombstones, publicly displayed pedigrees,
    and engravings on rings. Wigmore, supra. The rule is substantially
    identical in coverage with California Evidence Code Sec. 1312.
      Exception (14). The recording of title documents is a purely
    statutory development. Under any theory of the admissibility of
    public records, the records would be receivable as evidence of the
    contents of the recorded document, else the recording process would
    be reduced to a nullity. When, however, the record is offered for
    the further purpose of proving execution and delivery, a problem of
    lack of first-hand knowledge by the recorder, not present as to
    contents, is presented. This problem is solved, seemingly in all
    jurisdictions, by qualifying for recording only those documents
    shown by a specified procedure, either acknowledgement or a form of
    probate, to have been executed and delivered. 5 Wigmore Secs. 1647-
    1651. Thus what may appear in the rule, at first glance, as
    endowing the record with an effect independently of local law and
    inviting difficulties of an Erie nature under Cities Service Oil
    Co. v. Dunlap, 308 U.S. 208, 60 S.Ct. 201, 84 L.Ed. 196 (1939), is
    not present, since the local law in fact governs under the example.
      Exception (15). Dispositive documents often contain recitals of
    fact. Thus a deed purporting to have been executed by an attorney
    in fact may recite the existence of the power of attorney, or a
    deed may recite that the grantors are all the heirs of the last
    record owner. Under the rule, these recitals are exempted from the
    hearsay rule. The circumstances under which dispositive documents
    are executed and the requirement that the recital be germane to the
    purpose of the document are believed to be adequate guarantees of
    trustworthiness, particularly in view of the nonapplicability of
    the rule if dealings with the property have been inconsistent with
    the document. The age of the document is of no significance, though
    in practical application the document will most often be an ancient
    one. See Uniform Rule 63(29), Comment.
      Similar provisions are contained in Uniform Rule 63(29);
    California Evidence Code Sec. 1330; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure
    Sec. 60-460(aa); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(29).
      Exception (16). Authenticating a document as ancient, essentially
    in the pattern of the common law, as provided in Rule 901(b)(8),
    leaves open as a separate question the admissibility of assertive
    statements contained therein as against a hearsay objection. 7
    Wigmore Sec. 2145a. Wigmore further states that the ancient
    document technique of authentication is universally conceded to
    apply to all sorts of documents, including letters, records,
    contracts, maps, and certificates, in addition to title documents,
    citing numerous decisions. Id. Sec. 2145. Since most of these items
    are significant evidentially only insofar as they are assertive,
    their admission in evidence must be as a hearsay exception. But see
    5 id. Sec. 1573, p. 429, referring to recitals in ancient deeds as
    a "limited" hearsay exception. The former position is believed to
    be the correct one in reason and authority. As pointed out in
    McCormick Sec. 298, danger of mistake is minimized by
    authentication requirements, and age affords assurance that the
    writing antedates the present controversy. See Dallas County v.
    Commercial Union Assurance Co., 286 F.2d 388 (5th Cir. 1961),
    upholding admissibility of 58-year-old newspaper story. Cf. Morgan,
    Basic Problems of Evidence 364 (1962), but see id. 254.
      For a similar provision, but with the added requirement that "the
    statement has since generally been acted upon as true by persons
    having an interest in the matter," see California Evidence Code
    Sec. 1331.
      Exception (17). Ample authority at common law supported the
    admission in evidence of items falling in this category. While
    Wigmore's text is narrowly oriented to lists, etc., prepared for
    the use of a trade or profession, 6 Wigmore Sec. 1702, authorities
    are cited which include other kinds of publications, for example,
    newspaper market reports, telephone directories, and city
    directories. Id. Secs. 1702-1706. The basis of trustworthiness is
    general reliance by the public or by a particular segment of it,
    and the motivation of the compiler to foster reliance by being
    accurate.
      For similar provisions, see Uniform Rule 63(30); California
    Evidence Code Sec. 1340; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 60-
    460(bb); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(30). Uniform Commercial Code
    Sec. 2-724 provides for admissibility in evidence of "reports in
    official publications or trade journals or in newspapers or
    periodicals of general circulation published as the reports of such
    [established commodity] market."
      Exception (18). The writers have generally favored the
    admissibility of learned treatises, McCormick Sec. 296, p. 621;
    Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 366 (1962); 6 Wigmore Sec. 1692,
    with the support of occasional decisions and rules, City of Dothan
    v. Hardy, 237 Ala. 603, 188 So. 264 (1939); Lewandowski v.
    Preferred Risk Mut. Ins. Co., 33 Wis.2d 69, 146 N.W.2d 505 (1966),
    66 Mich.L.Rev. 183 (1967); Uniform Rule 63(31); Kansas Code of
    Civil Procedure Sec. 60-460(ce), but the great weight of authority
    has been that learned treatises are not admissible as substantive
    evidence though usable in the cross-examination of experts. The
    foundation of the minority view is that the hearsay objection must
    be regarded as unimpressive when directed against treatises since a
    high standard of accuracy is engendered by various factors: the
    treatise is written primarily and impartially for professionals,
    subject to scrutiny and exposure for inaccuracy, with the
    reputation of the writer at stake. 6 Wigmore Sec. 1692. Sound as
    this position may be with respect to trustworthiness, there is,
    nevertheless, an additional difficulty in the likelihood that the
    treatise will be misunderstood and misapplied without expert
    assistance and supervision. This difficulty is recognized in the
    cases demonstrating unwillingness to sustain findings relative to
    disability on the basis of judicially noticed medical texts. Ross
    v. Gardner, 365 F.2d 554 (6th Cir. 1966); Sayers v. Gardner, 380
    F.2d 940 (6th Cir. 1967); Colwell v. Gardner, 386 F.2d 56 (6th Cir.
    1967); Glendenning v. Ribicoff, 213 F.Supp. 301 (W.D.Mo. 1962);
    Cook v. Celebrezze, 217 F.Supp. 366 (W.D.Mo. 1963); Sosna v.
    Celebrezze, 234 F.Supp. 289 (E.D.Pa. 1964); and see McDaniel v.
    Celebrezze, 331 F.2d 426 (4th Cir. 1964). The rule avoids the
    danger of misunderstanding and misapplication by limiting the use
    of treatises as substantive evidence to situations in which an
    expert is on the stand and available to explain and assist in the
    application of the treatise if declared. The limitation upon
    receiving the publication itself physically in evidence, contained
    in the last sentence, is designed to further this policy.
      The relevance of the use of treatises on cross-examination is
    evident. This use of treatises has been the subject of varied
    views. The most restrictive position is that the witness must have
    stated expressly on direct his reliance upon the treatise. A
    slightly more liberal approach still insists upon reliance but
    allows it to be developed on cross-examination. Further relaxation
    dispenses with reliance but requires recognition as an authority by
    the witness, developable on cross-examination. The greatest
    liberality is found in decisions allowing use of the treatise on
    cross-examination when its status as an authority is established by
    any means. Annot., 60 A.L.R.2d 77. The exception is hinged upon
    this last position, which is that of the Supreme Court, Reilly v.
    Pinkus, 338 U.S. 269, 70 S.Ct. 110, 94 L.Ed. 63 (1949), and of
    recent well considered state court decisions, City of St.
    Petersburg v. Ferguson, 193 So.2d 648 (Fla.App. 1967), cert. denied
    Fla., 201 So.2d 556; Darling v. Charleston Memorial Community
    Hospital, 33 Ill.2d 326, 211 N.E.2d 253 (1965); Dabroe v. Rhodes
    Co., 64 Wash.2d 431, 392 P.2d 317 (1964).
      In Reilly v. Pinkus, supra, the Court pointed out that testing of
    professional knowledge was incomplete without exploration of the
    witness' knowledge of and attitude toward established treatises in
    the field. The process works equally well in reverse and furnishes
    the basis of the rule.
      The rule does not require that the witness rely upon or recognize
    the treatise as authoritative, thus avoiding the possibility that
    the expert may at the outset block cross-examination by refusing to
    concede reliance or authoritativeness. Dabroe v. Rhodes Co., supra.
    Moreover, the rule avoids the unreality of admitting evidence for
    the purpose of impeachment only, with an instruction to the jury
    not to consider it otherwise. The parallel to the treatment of
    prior inconsistent statements will be apparent. See Rules 6130(b)
    and 801(d)(1).
      Exceptions (19), (20), and (21). Trustworthiness in reputation
    evidence is found "when the topic is such that the facts are likely
    to have been inquired about and that persons having personal
    knowledge have disclosed facts which have thus been discussed in
    the community; and thus the community's conclusion, if any has been
    formed, is likely to be a trustworthy one." 5 Wigmore Sec. 1580, p.
    444, and see also Sec. 1583. On this common foundation, reputation
    as to land boundaries, customs, general history, character, and
    marriage have come to be regarded as admissible. The breadth of the
    underlying principle suggests the formulation of an equally broad
    exception, but tradition has in fact been much narrower and more
    particularized, and this is the pattern of these exceptions in the
    rule.
      Exception [paragraph] (19) is concerned with matters of personal
    and family history. Marriage is universally conceded to be a proper
    subject of proof by evidence of reputation in the community. 5
    Wigmore Sec. 1602. As to such items as legitimacy, relationship,
    adoption, birth, and death, the decisions are divided. Id. Sec.
    1605. All seem to be susceptible to being the subject of well
    founded repute. The "world" in which the reputation may exist may
    be family, associates, or community. This world has proved capable
    of expanding with changing times from the single uncomplicated
    neighborhood, in which all activities take place, to the multiple
    and unrelated worlds of work, religious affiliation, and social
    activity, in each of which a reputation may be generated. People v.
    Reeves, 360 Ill. 55, 195 N.E. 443 (1935); State v. Axilrod, 248
    Minn. 204, 79 N.W.2d 677 (1956); Mass.Stat. 1947, c. 410, M.G.L.A.
    c. 233 Sec. 21A; 5 Wigmore Sec. 1616. The family has often served
    as the point of beginning for allowing community reputation. 5
    Wigmore Sec. 1488. For comparable provisions see Uniform Rule
    63(26), (27)(c); California Evidence Code Secs. 1313, 1314; Kansas
    Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 60-460(x), (y)(3); New Jersey Evidence
    Rule 63(26), (27)(c).
      The first portion of Exception [paragraph] (20) is based upon the
    general admissibility of evidence of reputation as to land
    boundaries and land customs, expanded in this country to include
    private as well as public boundaries. McCormick Sec. 299, p. 625.
    The reputation is required to antedate the controversy, though not
    to be ancient. The second portion is likewise supported by
    authority, id., and is designed to facilitate proof of events when
    judicial notice is not available The historical character of the
    subject matter dispenses with any need that the reputation antedate
    the controversy with respect to which it is offered. For similar
    provisions see Uniform Rule 63(27)(a), (b); California Evidence
    Code Secs. 1320-1322; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 60-
    460(y), (1), (2); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(27)(a), (b).
      Exception [paragraph] (21) recognizes the traditional acceptance
    of reputation evidence as a means of proving human character.
    McCormick Secs. 44, 158. The exception deals only with the hearsay
    aspect of this kind of evidence. Limitations upon admissibility
    based on other grounds will be found in Rules 404, relevancy of
    character evidence generally, and 608, character of witness. The
    exception is in effect a reiteration, in the context of hearsay, of
    Rule 405(a). Similar provisions are contained in Uniform Rule
    63(28); California Evidence Code Sec. 1324; Kansas Code of Civil
    Procedure Sec. 60-460(z); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(28).
      Exception (22). When the status of a former judgment is under
    consideration in subsequent litigation, three possibilities must be
    noted: (1) the former judgment is conclusive under the doctrine of
    res judicata, either as a bar or a collateral estoppel; or (2) it
    is admissible in evidence for what it is worth; or (3) it may be of
    no effect at all. The first situation does not involve any problem
    of evidence except in the way that principles of substantive law
    generally bear upon the relevancy and materiality of evidence. The
    rule does not deal with the substantive effect of the judgment as a
    bar or collateral estoppel. When, however, the doctrine of res
    judicata does not apply to make the judgment either a bar or a
    collateral estoppel, a choice is presented between the second and
    third alternatives. The rule adopts the second for judgments of
    criminal conviction of felony grade. This is the direction of the
    decisions, Annot., 18 A.L.R.2d 1287, 1299, which manifest an
    increasing reluctance to reject in toto the validity of the law's
    factfinding processes outside the confines of res judicata and
    collateral estoppel. While this may leave a jury with the evidence
    of conviction but without means to evaluate it, as suggested by
    Judge Hinton, Note 27 Ill.L.Rev. 195 (1932), it seems safe to
    assume that the jury will give it substantial effect unless
    defendant offers a satisfactory explanation, a possibility not
    foreclosed by the provision. But see North River Ins. Co. v.
    Militello, 104 Colo. 28, 88 P.2d 567 (1939), in which the jury
    found for plaintiff on a fire policy despite the introduction of
    his conviction for arson. For supporting federal decisions see
    Clark, J., in New York & Cuba Mail S.S. Co. v. Continental Cas.
    Co., 117 F.2d 404, 411 (2d Cir. 1941); Connecticut Fire Ins. Co. v.
    Farrara, 277 F.2d 388 (8th Cir. 1960).
      Practical considerations require exclusion of convictions of
    minor offenses, not became the administration of justice in its
    lower echelons must be inferior, but because motivation to defend
    at this level is often minimal or nonexistent. Cope v. Goble, 39
    Cal.App.2d 448, 103 P.2d 598 (1940); Jones v. Talbot, 87 Idaho 498,
    394 P.2d 316 (1964); Warren v. Marsh, 215 Minn. 615, 11 N.W.2d 528
    (1943); Annot., 18 A.L.R.2d 1287, 1295-1297; 16 Brooklyn L.Rev. 286
    (1950); 50 Colum.L.Rev. 529 (1950); 35 Cornell L.Q. 872 (1950).
    Hence the rule includes only convictions of felony grade, measured
    by federal standards.
      Judgments of conviction based upon pleas of nolo contendere are
    not included. This position is consistent with the treatment of
    nolo pleas in Rule 410 and the authorities cited in the Advisory
    Committee's Note in support thereof.
      While these rules do not in general purport to resolve
    constitutional issues, they have in general been drafted with a
    view to avoiding collision with constitutional principles.
    Consequently the exception does not include evidence of the
    conviction of a third person, offered against the accused in a
    criminal prosecution to prove any fact essential to sustain the
    judgment of conviction. A contrary position would seem clearly to
    violate the right of confrontation. Kirby v. United States, 174
    U.S. 47, 19 S.Ct. 574, 43 L.Ed. 890 (1899), error to convict of
    possessing stolen postage stamps with the only evidence of theft
    being the record of conviction of the thieves The situation is to
    be distinguished from cases in which conviction of another person
    is an element of the crime, e.g. 15 U.S.C. Sec. 902(d), interstate
    shipment of firearms to a known convicted felon, and, as
    specifically provided, from impeachment.
      For comparable provisions see Uniform Rule 63(20); California
    Evidence Code Sec. 1300; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 60-
    460(r); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(20).
      Exception (23). A hearsay exception in this area was originally
    justified on the ground that verdicts were evidence of reputation.
    As trial by jury graduated from the category of neighborhood
    inquests, this theory lost its validity. It was never valid as to
    chancery decrees. Nevertheless the rule persisted, though the
    judges and writers shifted ground and began saying that the
    judgment or decree was as good evidence as reputation. See City of
    London v. Clerke, Carth. 181, 90 Eng.Rep. 710 (K.B. 1691); Neill v.
    Duke of Devonshire, 8 App.Cas. 135 (1882). The shift appears to be
    correct, since the process of inquiry, sifting, and scrutiny which
    is relied upon to render reputation reliable is present in perhaps
    greater measure in the process of litigation. While this might
    suggest a broader area of application, the affinity to reputation
    is strong, and paragraph [paragraph] (23) goes no further, not even
    including character.
      The leading case in the United States, Patterson v. Gaines, 47
    U.S. (6 How.) 550, 599, 12 L.Ed. 553 (1847), follows in the pattern
    of the English decisions, mentioning as illustrative matters thus
    provable: manorial rights, public rights of way, immemorial custom,
    disputed boundary, and pedigree. More recent recognition of the
    principle is found in Grant Bros. Construction Co. v. United
    States, 232 U.S. 647, 34 S.Ct. 452, 58 L.Ed. 776 (1914), in action
    for penalties under Alien Contract Labor Law, decision of board of
    inquiry of Immigration Service admissible to prove alienage of
    laborers, as a matter of pedigree; United States v. Mid-Continent
    Petroleum Corp., 67 F.2d 37 (10th Cir. 1933), records of commission
    enrolling Indians admissible on pedigree; Jung Yen Loy v. Cahill,
    81 F.2d 809 (9th Cir. 1936), board decisions as to citizenship of
    plaintiff's father admissible in proceeding for declaration of
    citizenship. Contra, In re Estate of Cunha, 49 Haw. 273, 414 P.2d
    925 (1966).

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      Rule 803(3) was approved in the form submitted by the Court to
    Congress. However, the Committee intends that the Rule be construed
    to limit the doctrine of Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Hillmon, 145
    U.S. 285, 295-300 (1892), so as to render statements of intent by a
    declarant admissible only to prove his future conduct, not the
    future conduct of another person.
      After giving particular attention to the question of physical
    examination made solely to enable a physician to testify, the
    Committee approved Rule 803(4) as submitted to Congress, with the
    understanding that it is not intended in any way to adversely
    affect present privilege rules or those subsequently adopted.
      Rule 803(5) as submitted by the Court permitted the reading into
    evidence of a memorandum or record concerning a matter about which
    a witness once had knowledge but now has insufficient recollection
    to enable him to testify accurately and fully, "shown to have been
    made when the matter was fresh in his memory and to reflect that
    knowledge correctly." The Committee amended this Rule to add the
    words "or adopted by the witness" after the phrase "shown to have
    been made", a treatment consistent with the definition of
    "statement" in the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 3500. Moreover, it is the
    Committee's understanding that a memorandum or report, although
    barred under this Rule, would nonetheless be admissible if it came
    within another hearsay exception. This last stated principle is
    deemed applicable to all the hearsay rules.
      Rule 803(6) as submitted by the Court permitted a record made "in
    the course of a regularly conducted activity" to be admissible in
    certain circumstances. The Committee believed there were
    insufficient guarantees of reliability in records made in the
    course of activities falling outside the scope of "business"
    activities as that term is broadly defined in 28 U.S.C. 1732.
    Moreover, the Committee concluded that the additional requirement
    of Section 1732 that it must have been the regular practice of a
    business to make the record is a necessary further assurance of its
    trustworthiness. The Committee accordingly amended the Rule to
    incorporate these limitations.
      Rule 803(7) as submitted by the Court concerned the absence of
    entry in the records of a "regularly conducted activity." The
    Committee amended this Rule to conform with its action with respect
    to Rule 803(6).
      The Committee approved Rule 803(8) without substantive change
    from the form in which it was submitted by the Court. The Committee
    intends that the phrase "factual findings" be strictly construed
    and that evaluations or opinions contained in public reports shall
    not be admissible under this Rule.
      The Committee approved this Rule in the form submitted by the
    Court, intending that the phrase "Statements of fact concerning
    personal or family history" be read to include the specific types
    of such statements enumerated in Rule 803(11).

      NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, SENATE REPORT NO. 93-1277  
      The House approved this rule as it was submitted by the Supreme
    Court "with the understanding that it is not intended in any way to
    adversely affect present privilege rules." We also approve this
    rule, and we would point out with respect to the question of its
    relation to privileges, it must be read in conjunction with rule 35
    of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which provides that
    whenever the physical or mental condition of a party (plaintiff or
    defendant) is in controversy, the court may require him to submit
    to an examination by a physician. It is these examinations which
    will normally be admitted under this exception.
      Rule 803(5) as submitted by the Court permitted the reading into
    evidence of a memorandum or record concerning a matter about which
    a witness once had knowledge but now has insufficient recollection
    to enable him to testify accurately and fully, "shown to have been
    made when the matter was fresh in his memory and to reflect that
    knowledge correctly." The House amended the rule to add the words
    "or adopted by the witness" after the phrase "shown to have been
    made," language parallel to the Jencks Act [18 U.S.C. Sec. 3500].
      The committee accepts the House amendment with the understanding
    and belief that it was not intended to narrow the scope of
    applicability of the rule. In fact, we understand it to clarify the
    rule's applicability to a memorandum adopted by the witness as well
    as one made by him. While the rule as submitted by the Court was
    silent on the question of who made the memorandum, we view the
    House amendment as a helpful clarification, noting, however, that
    the Advisory Committee's note to this rule suggests that the
    important thing is the accuracy of the memorandum rather than who
    made it.
      The committee does not view the House amendment as precluding
    admissibility in situations in which multiple participants were
    involved.
      When the verifying witness has not prepared the report, but
    merely examined it and found it accurate, he has adopted the
    report, and it is therefore admissible. The rule should also be
    interpreted to cover other situations involving multiple
    participants, e.g., employer dictating to secretary, secretary
    making memorandum at direction of employer, or information being
    passed along a chain of persons, as in Curtis v. Bradley [65 Conn.
    99, 31 Atl. 591 (1894); see, also Rathbun v. Brancatella, 93 N.J.L.
    222, 107 Atl. 279 (1919); see, also McCormick on Evidence, Sec. 303
    (2d ed. 1972)].
      The committee also accepts the understanding of the House that a
    memorandum or report, although barred under rule, would nonetheless
    be admissible if it came within another hearsay exception. We
    consider this principle to be applicable to all the hearsay rules.
      Rule 803(6) as submitted by the Supreme Court permitted a record
    made in the course of a regularly conducted activity to be
    admissible in certain circumstances. This rule constituted a
    broadening of the traditional business records hearsay exception
    which has been long advocated by scholars and judges active in the
    law of evidence
      The House felt there were insufficient guarantees of reliability
    of records not within a broadly defined business records exception.
    We disagree. Even under the House definition of "business"
    including profession, occupation, and "calling of every kind," the
    records of many regularly conducted activities will, or may be,
    excluded from evidence. Under the principle of ejusdem generis, the
    intent of "calling of every kind" would seem to be related to work-
    related endeavors - e.g., butcher, baker, artist, etc.
      Thus, it appears that the records of many institutions or groups
    might not be admissible under the House amendments. For example,
    schools, churches, and hospitals will not normally be considered
    businesses within the definition. Yet, these are groups which keep
    financial and other records on a regular basis in a manner similar
    to business enterprises. We believe these records are of equivalent
    trustworthiness and should be admitted into evidence.
      Three states, which have recently codified their evidence rules,
    have adopted the Supreme Court version of rule 803(6), providing
    for admission of memoranda of a "regularly conducted activity."
    None adopted the words "business activity" used in the House
    amendment. [See Nev. Rev. Stats. Sec. 15.135; N. Mex. Stats. (1973
    Supp.) Sec. 20-4-803(6); West's Wis. Stats. Anno. (1973 Supp.) Sec.
    908.03(6).]
      Therefore, the committee deleted the word "business" as it
    appears before the word "activity". The last sentence then is
    unnecessary and was also deleted.
      It is the understanding of the committee that the use of the
    phrase "person with knowledge" is not intended to imply that the
    party seeking to introduce the memorandum, report, record, or data
    compilation must be able to produce, or even identify, the specific
    individual upon whose first-hand knowledge the memorandum, report,
    record or data compilation was based. A sufficient foundation for
    the introduction of such evidence will be laid if the party seeking
    to introduce the evidence is able to show that it was the regular
    practice of the activity to base such memorandums, reports,
    records, or data compilations upon a transmission from a person
    with knowledge, e.g., in the case of the content of a shipment of
    goods, upon a report from the company's receiving agent or in the
    case of a computer printout, upon a report from the company's
    computer programer or one who has knowledge of the particular
    record system. In short, the scope of the phrase "person with
    knowledge" is meant to be coterminous with the custodian of the
    evidence or other qualified witness. The committee believes this
    represents the desired rule in light of the complex nature of
    modern business organizations.
      The House approved rule 803(8), as submitted by the Supreme
    Court, with one substantive change. It excluded from the hearsay
    exception reports containing matters observed by police officers
    and other law enforcement personnel in criminal cases. Ostensibly,
    the reason for this exclusion is that observations by police
    officers at the scene of the crime or the apprehension of the
    defendant are not as reliable as observations by public officials
    in other cases because of the adversarial nature of the
    confrontation between the police and the defendant in criminal
    cases.
      The committee accepts the House's decision to exclude such
    recorded observations where the police officer is available to
    testify in court about his observation. However, where he is
    unavailable as unavailability is defined in rule 804(a)(4) and
    (a)(5), the report should be admitted as the best available
    evidence. Accordingly, the committee has amended rule 803(8) to
    refer to the provision of [proposed] rule 804(b)(5) [deleted],
    which allows the admission of such reports, records or other
    statements where the police officer or other law enforcement
    officer is unavailable because of death, then existing physical or
    mental illness or infirmity, or not being successfully subject to
    legal process.
      The House Judiciary Committee report contained a statement of
    intent that "the phrase 'factual findings' in subdivision (c) be
    strictly construed and that evaluations or opinions contained in
    public reports shall not be admissible under this rule." The
    committee takes strong exception to this limiting understanding of
    the application of the rule. We do not think it reflects an
    understanding of the intended operation of the rule as explained in
    the Advisory Committee notes to this subsection. The Advisory
    Committee notes on subsection (c) of this subdivision point out
    that various kinds of evaluative reports are now admissible under
    Federal statutes. 7 U.S.C. Sec. 78, findings of Secretary of
    Agriculture prima facie evidence of true grade of grain; 42 U.S.C.
    Sec. 269(b), bill of health by appropriate official prima facie
    evidence of vessel's sanitary history and condition and compliance
    with regulations. These statutory exceptions to the hearsay rule
    are preserved. Rule 802. The willingness of Congress to recognize
    these and other such evaluative reports provides a helpful guide in
    determining the kind of reports which are intended to be admissible
    under this rule. We think the restrictive interpretation of the
    House overlooks the fact that while the Advisory Committee assumes
    admissibility in the first instance of evaluative reports, they are
    not admissible if, as the rule states, "the sources of information
    or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness."
      The Advisory Committee explains the factors to be considered:
                                 * * * * *                             

      Factors which may be assistance in passing upon the admissibility
      of evaluative reports include: (1) the timeliness of the
      investigation, McCormick, Can the Courts Make Wider Use of
      Reports of Official Investigations? 42 Iowa L.Rev. 363 (1957);
      (2) the special skill or experience of the official, id.; (3)
      whether a hearing was held and the level at which conducted,
      Franklin v. Skelly Oil Co., 141 F.2d 568 (19th Cir. 1944); (4)
      possible motivation problems suggested by Palmer v. Hoffman, 318
      U.S. 109, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943). Others no doubt
      could be added.
                                 * * * * *                             

      The committee concludes that the language of the rule together
    with the explanation provided by the Advisory Committee furnish
    sufficient guidance on the admissibility of evaluative reports.
      The proposed Rules of Evidence submitted to Congress contained
    identical provisions in rules 803 and 804 (which set forth the
    various hearsay exceptions), admitting any hearsay statement not
    specifically covered by any of the stated exceptions, if the
    hearsay statement was found to have "comparable circumstantial
    guarantees of trustworthiness." The House deleted these provisions
    (proposed rules 803(24) and 804(b)(6)[(5)]) as injecting "too much
    uncertainty" into the law of evidence and impairing the ability of
    practitioners to prepare for trial. The House felt that rule 102,
    which directs the courts to construe the Rules of Evidence so as to
    promote growth and development, would permit sufficient flexibility
    to admit hearsay evidence in appropriate cases under various
    factual situations that might arise.
      We disagree with the total rejection of a residual hearsay
    exception. While we view rule 102 as being intended to provide for
    a broader construction and interpretation of these rules, we feel
    that, without a separate residual provision, the specifically
    enumerated exceptions could become tortured beyond any reasonable
    circumstances which they were intended to include (even if broadly
    construed). Moreover, these exceptions, while they reflect the most
    typical and well recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule, may not
    encompass every situation in which the reliability and
    appropriateness of a particular piece of hearsay evidence make
    clear that it should be heard and considered by the trier of fact.
      The committee believes that there are certain exceptional
    circumstances where evidence which is found by a court to have
    guarantees of trust worthiness equivalent to or exceeding the
    guarantees reflected by the presently listed exceptions, and to
    have a high degree of prolativeness and necessity could properly be
    admissible.
      The case of Dallas County v. Commercial Union Assoc. Co., Ltd.,
    286 F.2d 388 (5th Cir. 1961) illustrates the point. The issue in
    that case was whether the tower of the county courthouse collapsed
    because it was struck by lightning (covered by insurance) or
    because of structural weakness and deterioration of the structure
    (not covered). Investigation of the structure revealed the presence
    of charcoal and charred timbers. In order to show that lightning
    may not have been the cause of the charring, the insurer offered a
    copy of a local newspaper published over 50 years earlier
    containing an unsigned article describing a fire in the courthouse
    while it was under construction. The Court found that the newspaper
    did not qualify for admission as a business record or an ancient
    document and did not fit within any other recognized hearsay
    exception. The court concluded, however, that the article was
    trustworthy because it was inconceivable that a newspaper reporter
    in a small town would report a fire in the courthouse if none had
    occurred. See also United States v. Barbati, 284 F. Supp. 409
    (E.D.N.Y. 1968).
      Because exceptional cases like the Dallas County case may arise
    in the future, the committee has decided to reinstate a residual
    exception for rules 803 and 804(b).
      The committee, however, also agrees with those supporters of the
    House version who felt that an overly broad residual hearsay
    exception could emasculate the hearsay rule and the recognized
    exceptions or vitiate the rationale behind codification of the
    rules.
      Therefore, the committee has adopted a residual exception for
    rules 803 and 804(b) of much narrower scope and applicability than
    the Supreme Court version. In order to qualify for admission, a
    hearsay statement not falling within one of the recognized
    exceptions would have to satisfy at least four conditions. First,
    it must have "equivalent circumstantial guarantees of
    trustworthiness." Second, it must be offered as evidence of a
    material fact. Third, the court must determine that the statement
    "is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any
    other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable
    efforts." This requirement is intended to insure that only
    statements which have high probative value and necessity may
    qualify for admission under the residual exceptions. Fourth, the
    court must determine that "the general purposes of these rules and
    the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the
    statement into evidence."
      It is intended that the residual hearsay exceptions will be used
    very rarely, an only in exceptional circumstances. The committee
    does not intend to establish a broad license for trial judges to
    admit hearsay statements that do not fall within one of the other
    exceptions contained in rules 803 and 804(b). The residual
    exceptions are not meant to authorize major judicial revisions of
    the hearsay rule, including its present exceptions. Such major
    revisions are best accomplished by legislative action. It is
    intended that in any case in which evidence is sought to be
    admitted under these subsections, the trial judge will exercise no
    less care, reflection and caution than the courts did under the
    common law in establishing the now-recognized exceptions to the
    hearsay rule.
      In order to establish a well-defined jurisprudence, the special
    facts and circumstances which, in the court's judgment, indicates
    that the statement has a sufficiently high degree of
    trustworthiness and necessity to justify its admission should be
    stated on the record. It is expected that the court will give the
    opposing party a full and adequate opportunity to contest the
    admission of any statement sought to be introduced under these
    subsections.

          NOTES OF CONFERENCE COMMITTEE, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-1597      
      Rule 803 defines when hearsay statements are admissible in
    evidence even though the declarant is available as a witness. The
    Senate amendments make three changes in this rule.
      The House bill provides in subsection (6) that records of a
    regularly conducted "business" activity qualify for admission into
    evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule. "Business" is defined
    as including "business, profession, occupation and calling of every
    kind." The Senate amendment drops the requirement that the records
    be those of a "business" activity and eliminates the definition of
    "business." The Senate amendment provides that records are
    admissible if they are records of a regularly conducted "activity."
      The Conference adopts the House provision that the records must
    be those of a regularly conducted "business" activity. The
    Conferees changed the definition of "business" contained in the
    House provision in order to make it clear that the records of
    institutions and associations like schools, churches and hospitals
    are admissible under this provision. The records of public schools
    and hospitals are also covered by Rule 803(8), which deals with
    public records and reports.
      The Senate amendment adds language, not contained in the House
    bill, that refers to another rule that was added by the Senate in
    another amendment ([proposed] Rule 804(b)(5) - Criminal law
    enforcement records and reports [deleted]).
      In view of its action on [proposed] Rule 804(b)(5) (Criminal law
    enforcement records and reports) [deleted], the Conference does not
    adopt the Senate amendment and restores the bill to the House
    version.
      The Senate amendment adds a new subsection, (24), which makes
    admissible a hearsay statement not specifically covered by any of
    the previous twenty-three subsections, if the statement has
    equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness and if the
    court determines that (A) the statement is offered as evidence of a
    material fact; (B) the statement is more probative on the point for
    which it is offered than any other evidence the proponent can
    procure through reasonable efforts; and (C) the general purposes of
    these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by
    admission of the statement into evidence.
      The House bill eliminated a similar, but broader, provision
    because of the conviction that such a provision injected too much
    uncertainty into the law of evidence regarding hearsay and impaired
    the ability of a litigant to prepare adequately for trial.
      The Conference adopts the Senate amendment with an amendment that
    provides that a party intending to request the court to use a
    statement under this provision must notify any adverse party of
    this intention as well as of the particulars of the statement,
    including the name and address of the declarant. This notice must
    be given sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to provide
    any adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to contest the
    use of the statement.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      The amendment provides that the foundation requirements of Rule
    803(6) can be satisfied under certain circumstances without the
    expense and inconvenience of producing time-consuming foundation
    witnesses. Under current law, courts have generally required
    foundation witnesses to testify. See, e.g., Tongil Co., Ltd. v.
    Hyundai Merchant Marine Corp., 968 F.2d 999 (9th Cir. 1992)
    (reversing a judgment based on business records where a qualified
    person filed an affidavit but did not testify). Protections are
    provided by the authentication requirements of Rule 902(11) for
    domestic records, Rule 902(12) for foreign records in civil cases,
    and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3505 for foreign records in criminal cases.

    FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE
    ARTICLE VIII. HEARSAY

-HEAD-
    Rule 804. Hearsay Exceptions; Declarant Unavailable

-STATUTE-
      (a) Definition of Unavailability. "Unavailability as a witness"
    includes situations in which the declarant - 
        (1) is exempted by ruling of the court on the ground of
      privilege from testifying concerning the subject matter of the
      declarant's statement; or
        (2) persists in refusing to testify concerning the subject
      matter of the declarant's statement despite an order of the court
      to do so; or
        (3) testifies to a lack of memory of the subject matter of the
      declarant's statement; or
        (4) is unable to be present or to testify at the hearing
      because of death or then existing physical or mental illness or
      infirmity; or
        (5) is absent from the hearing and the proponent of a statement
      has been unable to procure the declarant's attendance (or in the
      case of a hearsay exception under subdivision (b)(2), (3), or
      (4), the declarant's attendance or testimony) by process or other
      reasonable means.

      A declarant is not unavailable as a witness if exemption,
    refusal, claim of lack of memory, inability, or absence is due to
    the procurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of a statement for
    the purpose of preventing the witness from attending or testifying.
      (b) Hearsay Exceptions. The following are not excluded by the
    hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:
        (1) Former Testimony. Testimony given as a witness at another
      hearing of the same or a different proceeding, or in a deposition
      taken in compliance with law in the course of the same or another
      proceeding, if the party against whom the testimony is now
      offered, or, in a civil action or proceeding, a predecessor in
      interest, had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the
      testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.
        (2) Statement Under Belief of Impending Death. In a prosecution
      for homicide or in a civil action or proceeding, a statement made
      by a declarant while believing that the declarant's death was
      imminent, concerning the cause or circumstances of what the
      declarant believed to be impending death.
        (3) Statement Against Interest. A statement which was at the
      time of its making so far contrary to the declarant's pecuniary
      or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject the
      declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a
      claim by the declarant against another, that a reasonable person
      in the declarant's position would not have made the statement
      unless believing it to be true. A statement tending to expose the
      declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the
      accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances
      clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.
        (4) Statement of Personal or Family History. (A) A statement
      concerning the declarant's own birth, adoption, marriage,
      divorce, legitimacy, relationship by blood, adoption, or
      marriage, ancestry, or other similar fact of personal or family
      history, even though declarant had no means of acquiring personal
      knowledge of the matter stated; or (B) a statement concerning the
      foregoing matters, and death also, of another person, if the
      declarant was related to the other by blood, adoption, or
      marriage or was so intimately associated with the other's family
      as to be likely to have accurate information concerning the
      matter declared.
        [(5) Other Exceptions.] [Transferred to Rule 807]
        (6) Forfeiture by Wrongdoing. A statement offered against a
      party that has engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing that was
      intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant
      as a witness.

-MISC1-
               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      As to firsthand knowledge on the part of hearsay declarants, see
    the introductory portion of the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule
    803.
      Subdivision (a). The definition of unavailability implements the
    division of hearsay exceptions into two categories by Rules 803 and
    804(b).
      At common law the unavailability requirement was evolved in
    connection with particular hearsay exceptions rather than along
    general lines. For example, see the separate explication of
    unavailability in relation to former testimony, declarations
    against interest, and statements of pedigree, separately developed
    in McCormick Secs. 234, 257, and 297. However, no reason is
    apparent for making distinctions as to what satisfies
    unavailability for the different exceptions. The treatment in the
    rule is therefore uniform although differences in the range of
    process for witnesses between civil and criminal cases will lead to
    a less exacting requirement under item (5). See Rule 45(e) of the
    Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 17(e) of the Federal
    Rules of Criminal Procedure.
      Five instances of unavailability are specified:
      (1) Substantial authority supports the position that exercise of
    a claim of privilege by the declarant satisfies the requirement of
    unavailability (usually in connection with former testimony). Wyatt
    v. State, 35 Ala.App. 147, 46 So.2d 837 (1950); State v. Stewart,
    85 Kan. 404, 116 P. 489 (1911); Annot., 45 A.L.R.2d 1354; Uniform
    Rule 62(7)(a); California Evidence Code Sec. 240(a)(1); Kansas Code
    of Civil Procedure Sec. 60-459(g) (1). A ruling by the judge is
    required, which clearly implies that an actual claim of privilege
    must be made.
      (2) A witness is rendered unavailable if he simply refuses to
    testify concerning the subject matter of his statement despite
    judicial pressures to do so, a position supported by similar
    considerations of practicality. Johnson v. People, 152 Colo. 586,
    384 P.2d 454 (1963); People v. Pickett, 339 Mich. 294, 63 N.W.2d
    681, 45 A.L.R.2d 1341 (1954). Contra, Pleau v. State, 255 Wis. 362,
    38 N.W.2d 496 (1949).
      (3) The position that a claimed lack of memory by the witness of
    the subject matter of his statement constitutes unavailability
    likewise finds support in the cases, though not without dissent.
    McCormick Sec. 234, p. 494. If the claim is successful, the
    practical effect is to put the testimony beyond reach, as in the
    other instances. In this instance, however, it will be noted that
    the lack of memory must be established by the testimony of the
    witness himself, which clearly contemplates his production and
    subjection to cross-examination.
      (4) Death and infirmity find general recognition as ground.
    McCormick Secs. 234, 257, 297; Uniform Rule 62(7)(c); California
    Evidence Code Sec. 240(a)(3); Kansas Code of Civil Procedure Sec.
    60-459(g)(3); New Jersey Evidence Rule 62(6)(c). See also the
    provisions on use of depositions in Rule 32(a)(3) of the Federal
    Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 15(e) of the Federal Rules of
    Criminal Procedure.
      (5) Absence from the hearing coupled with inability to compel
    attendance by process or other reasonable means also satisfies the
    requirement. McCormick Sec. 234; Uniform Rule 62(7)(d) and (e);
    California Evidence Code Sec. 240(a)(4) and (5); Kansas Code of
    Civil Procedure Sec. 60-459(g)(4) and (5); New Jersey Rule 62(6)(b)
    and (d). See the discussion of procuring attendance of witnesses
    who are nonresidents or in custody in Barber v. Page, 390 U.S. 719,
    88 S.Ct. 1318, 20 L.Ed.2d 255 (1968).
      If the conditions otherwise constituting unavailability result
    from the procurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of the
    statement, the requirement is not satisfied. The rule contains no
    requirement that an attempt be made to take the deposition of a
    declarant.
      Subdivision (b). Rule 803 supra, is based upon the assumption
    that a hearsay statement falling within one of its exceptions
    possesses qualities which justify the conclusion that whether the
    declarant is available or unavailable is not a relevant factor in
    determining admissibility. The instant rule proceeds upon a
    different theory: hearsay which admittedly is not equal in quality
    to testimony of the declarant on the stand may nevertheless be
    admitted if the declarant is unavailable and if his statement meets
    a specified standard. The rule expresses preferences: testimony
    given on the stand in person is preferred over hearsay, and
    hearsay, if of the specified quality, is preferred over complete
    loss of the evidence of the declarant. The exceptions evolved at
    common law with respect to declarations of unavailable declarants
    furnish the basis for the exceptions enumerated in the proposal.
    The term "unavailable" is defined in subdivision (a).
      Exception (1). Former testimony does not rely upon some set of
    circumstances to substitute for oath and cross-examination, since
    both oath and opportunity to cross-examine were present in fact.
    The only missing one of the ideal conditions for the giving of
    testimony is the presence of trier and opponent ("demeanor
    evidence"). This is lacking with all hearsay exceptions. Hence it
    may be argued that former testimony is the strongest hearsay and
    should be included under Rule 803, supra. However, opportunity to
    observe demeanor is what in a large measure confers depth and
    meaning upon oath and cross-examination. Thus in cases under Rule
    803 demeanor lacks the significance which it possesses with respect
    to testimony. In any event, the tradition, founded in experience,
    uniformly favors production of the witness if he is available. The
    exception indicates continuation of the policy. This preference for
    the presence of the witness is apparent also in rules and statutes
    on the use of depositions, which deal with substantially the same
    problem.
      Under the exception, the testimony may be offered (1) against the
    party against whom it was previously offered or (2) against the
    party by whom it was previously offered. In each instance the
    question resolves itself into whether fairness allows imposing,
    upon the party against whom now offered, the handling of the
    witness on the earlier occasion. (1) If the party against whom now
    offered is the one against whom the testimony was offered
    previously, no unfairness is apparent in requiring him to accept
    his own prior conduct of cross-examination or decision not to cross-
    examine. Only demeanor has been lost, and that is inherent in the
    situation. (2) If the party against whom now offered is the one by
    whom the testimony was offered previously, a satisfactory answer
    becomes somewhat more difficult. One possibility is to proceed
    somewhat along the line of an adoptive admission, i.e. by offering
    the testimony proponent in effect adopts it. However, this theory
    savors of discarded concepts of witnesses' belonging to a party, of
    litigants' ability to pick and choose witnesses, and of vouching
    for one's own witnesses. Cf. McCormick Sec. 246, pp. 526-527; 4
    Wigmore Sec. 1075. A more direct and acceptable approach is simply
    to recognize direct and redirect examination of one's own witness
    as the equivalent of cross-examining an opponent's witness.
    Falknor, Former Testimony and the Uniform Rules: A Comment, 38
    N.Y.U.L.Rev. 651, n. 1 (1963); McCormick Sec. 231, p. 483. See also
    5 Wigmore Sec. 1389. Allowable techniques for dealing with hostile,
    doublecrossing, forgetful, and mentally deficient witnesses leave
    no substance to a claim that one could not adequately develop his
    own witness at the former hearing. An even less appealing argument
    is presented when failure to develop fully was the result of a
    deliberate choice.
      The common law did not limit the admissibility of former
    testimony to that given in an earlier trial of the same case,
    although it did require identity of issues as a means of insuring
    that the former handling of the witness was the equivalent of what
    would now be done if the opportunity were presented. Modern
    decisions reduce the requirement to "substantial" identity.
    McCormick Sec. 233. Since identity of issues is significant only in
    that it bears on motive and interest in developing fully the
    testimony of the witness, expressing the matter in the latter terms
    is preferable. Id. Testimony given at a preliminary hearing was
    held in California v. Green, 399 U.S. 149, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26
    L.Ed.2d 489 (1970), to satisfy confrontation requirements in this
    respect.
      As a further assurance of fairness in thrusting upon a party the
    prior handling of the witness, the common law also insisted upon
    identity of parties, deviating only to the extent of allowing
    substitution of successors in a narrowly construed privity.
    Mutuality as an aspect of identity is now generally discredited,
    and the requirement of identity of the offering party disappears
    except as it might affect motive to develop the testimony. Falknor,
    supra, at 652; McCormick Sec. 232, pp. 487-488. The question
    remains whether strict identity, or privity, should continue as a
    requirement with respect to the party against whom offered. The
    rule departs to the extent of allowing substitution of one with the
    right and opportunity to develop the testimony with similar motive
    and interest. This position is supported by modern decisions.
    McCormick Sec. 232, pp. 489-490; 5 Wigmore Sec. 1388.
      Provisions of the same tenor will be found in Uniform Rule
    63(3)(b); California Evidence Code Secs. 1290-1292; Kansas Code of
    Civil Procedure Sec. 60-460(c)(2); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(3).
    Unlike the rule, the latter three provide either that former
    testimony is not admissible if the right of confrontation is denied
    or that it is not admissible if the accused was not a party to the
    prior hearing. The genesis of these limitations is a caveat in
    Uniform Rule 63(3) Comment that use of former testimony against an
    accused may violate his right of confrontation. Mattox v. United
    States, 156 U.S. 237, 15 S.Ct. 337, 39 L.Ed. 409 (1895), held that
    the right was not violated by the Government's use, on a retrial of
    the same case, of testimony given at the first trial by two
    witnesses since deceased. The decision leaves open the questions
    (1) whether direct and redirect are equivalent to cross-examination
    for purposes of confrontation, (2) whether testimony given in a
    different proceeding is acceptable, and (3) whether the accused
    must himself have been a party to the earlier proceeding or whether
    a similarly situated person will serve the purpose. Professor
    Falknor concluded that, if a dying declaration untested by cross-
    examination is constitutionally admissible, former testimony
    tested by the cross-examination of one similarly situated does not
    offend against confrontation. Falknor, supra, at 659-660. The
    constitutional acceptability of dying declarations has often been
    conceded. Mattox v. United States, 156 U.S. 237, 243, 15 S.Ct. 337,
    39 L.Ed. 409 (1895); Kirby v. United States, 174 U.S. 47, 61, 19
    S.Ct. 574, 43 L.Ed. 890 (1899); Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400,
    407, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965).
      Exception (2). The exception is the familiar dying declaration of
    the common law, expanded somewhat beyond its traditionally narrow
    limits. While the original religious justification for the
    exception may have lost its conviction for some persons over the
    years, it can scarcely be doubted that powerful psychological
    pressures are present. See 5 Wigmore Sec. 1443 and the classic
    statement of Chief Baron Eyre in Rex v. Woodcock, 1 Leach 500, 502,
    168 Eng.Rep. 352, 353 (K.B. 1789).
      The common law required that the statement be that of the victim,
    offered in a prosecution for criminal homicide. Thus declarations
    by victims in prosecutions for other crimes, e.g. a declaration by
    a rape victim who dies in childbirth, and all declarations in civil
    cases were outside the scope of the exception. An occasional
    statute has removed these restrictions, as in Colo.R.S. Sec. 52-1-
    20, or has expanded the area of offenses to include abortions, 5
    Wigmore Sec. 1432, p. 224, n. 4. Kansas by decision extended the
    exception to civil cases. Thurston v. Fritz, 91 Kan. 468, 138 P.
    625 (1914). While the common law exception no doubt originated as a
    result of the exceptional need for the evidence in homicide cases,
    the theory of admissibility applies equally in civil cases and in
    prosecutions for crimes other than homicide. The same
    considerations suggest abandonment of the limitation to
    circumstances attending the event in question, yet when the
    statement deals with matters other than the supposed death, its
    influence is believed to be sufficiently attenuated to justify the
    limitation. Unavailability is not limited to death. See subdivision
    (a) of this rule. Any problem as to declarations phrased in terms
    of opinion is laid at rest by Rule 701, and continuation of a
    requirement of first-hand knowledge is assured by Rule 602.
      Comparable provisions are found in Uniform Rule 63 (5);
    California Evidence Code Sec. 1242; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure
    Sec. 60-460(e); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(5).
      Exception (3). The circumstantial guaranty of reliability for
    declarations against interest is the assumption that persons do not
    make statements which are damaging to themselves unless satisfied
    for good reason that they are true. Hileman v. Northwest
    Engineering Co., 346 F.2d 668 (6th Cir. 1965). If the statement is
    that of a party, offered by his opponent, it comes in as an
    admission, Rule 803(d)(2), and there is no occasion to inquire
    whether it is against interest, this not being a condition
    precedent to admissibility of admissions by opponents.
      The common law required that the interest declared against be
    pecuniary or proprietary but within this limitation demonstrated
    striking ingenuity in discovering an against-interest aspect.
    Higham v. Ridgeway, 10 East 109, 103 Eng.Rep. 717 (K.B. 1808); Reg.
    v. Overseers of Birmingham, 1 B. & S. 763, 121 Eng.Rep. 897 (Q.B.
    1861); McCormick, Sec. 256, p. 551, nn. 2 and 3.
      The exception discards the common law limitation and expands to
    the full logical limit. One result is to remove doubt as to the
    admissibility of declarations tending to establish a tort liability
    against the declarant or to extinguish one which might be asserted
    by him, in accordance with the trend of the decisions in this
    country. McCormick Sec. 254, pp. 548-549. Another is to allow
    statements tending to expose declarant to hatred, ridicule, or
    disgrace, the motivation here being considered to be as strong as
    when financial interests are at stake. McCormick Sec. 255, p. 551.
    And finally, exposure to criminal liability satisfies the against-
    interest requirement. The refusal of the common law to concede the
    adequacy of a penal interest was no doubt indefensible in logic,
    see the dissent of Mr. Justice Holmes in Donnelly v. United States,
    228 U.S. 243, 33 S.Ct. 449, 57 L.Ed. 820 (1913), but one senses in
    the decisions a distrust of evidence of confessions by third
    persons offered to exculpate the accused arising from suspicions of
    fabrication either of the fact of the making of the confession or
    in its contents, enhanced in either instance by the required
    unavailability of the declarant. Nevertheless, an increasing amount
    of decisional law recognizes exposure to punishment for crime as a
    sufficient stake. People v. Spriggs, 60 Cal.2d 868, 36 Cal.Rptr.
    841, 389 P.2d 377 (1964); Sutter v. Easterly, 354 Mo. 282, 189
    S.W.2d 284 (1945); Band's Refuse Removal, Inc. v. Fairlawn Borough,
    62 N.J.Super. 552, 163 A.2d 465 (1960); Newberry v. Commonwealth,
    191 Va. 445, 61 S.E.2d 318 (1950); Annot., 162 A.L.R. 446. The
    requirement of corroboration is included in the rule in order to
    effect an accommodation between these competing considerations.
    When the statement is offered by the accused by way of exculpation,
    the resulting situation is not adapted to control by rulings as to
    the weight of the evidence and, hence the provision is cast in
    terms of a requirement preliminary to admissibility. Cf. Rule
    406(a). The requirement of corroboration should be construed in
    such a manner as to effectuate its purpose of circumventing
    fabrication.
      Ordinarily the third-party confession is thought of in terms of
    exculpating the accused, but this is by no means always or
    necessarily the case: it may include statements implicating him,
    and under the general theory of declarations against interest they
    would be admissible as related statements. Douglas v. Alabama, 380
    U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965), and Bruton v.
    United States, 389 U.S. 818, 88 S.Ct. 126, 19 L.Ed.2d 70 (1968),
    both involved confessions by codefendants which implicated the
    accused. While the confession was not actually offered in evidence
    in Douglas, the procedure followed effectively put it before the
    jury, which the Court ruled to be error. Whether the confession
    might have been admissible as a declaration against penal interest
    was not considered or discussed. Bruton assumed the
    inadmissibility, as against the accused, of the implicating
    confession of his codefendant, and centered upon the question of
    the effectiveness of a limiting instruction. These decisions,
    however, by no means require that all statements implicating
    another person be excluded from the category of declarations
    against interest. Whether a statement is in fact against interest
    must be determined from the circumstances of each case. Thus a
    statement admitting guilt and implicating another person, made
    while in custody, may well be motivated by a desire to curry favor
    with the authorities and hence fail to qualify as against interest.
    See the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice White in Bruton. On the
    other hand, the same words spoken under different circumstances,
    e.g., to an acquaintance, would have no difficulty in qualifying.
    The rule does not purport to deal with questions of the right of
    confrontation.
      The balancing of self-serving against dissenting aspects of a
    declaration is discussed in McCormick Sec. 256.
      For comparable provisions, see Uniform Rule 63(10): California
    Evidence Code Sec. 1230; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 60-
    460(j); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(10).
      Exception (4). The general common law requirement that a
    declaration in this area must have been made ante litem motam has
    been dropped, as bearing more appropriately on weight than
    admissibility. See 5 Wigmore Sec. 1483. Item (i)[(A)] specifically
    disclaims any need of firsthand knowledge respecting declarant's
    own personal history. In some instances it is self-evident
    (marriage) and in others impossible and traditionally not required
    (date of birth). Item (ii)[(B)] deals with declarations concerning
    the history of another person. As at common law, declarant is
    qualified if related by blood or marriage. 5 Wigmore Sec. 1489. In
    addition, and contrary to the common law, declarant qualifies by
    virtue of intimate association with the family. Id., Sec. 1487. The
    requirement sometimes encountered that when the subject of the
    statement is the relationship between two other persons the
    declarant must qualify as to both is omitted. Relationship is
    reciprocal. Id., Sec. 1491.
      For comparable provisions, see Uniform Rule 63 (23), (24), (25);

    Procedure Sec. 60-460(u), (v), (w); New Jersey Evidence Rules

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      Rule 804(a)(3) was approved in the form submitted by the Court.
    However, the Committee intends no change in existing federal law
    under which the court may choose to disbelieve the declarant's
    testimony as to his lack of memory. See United States v. Insana,
    423 F.2d 1165, 1169-1170 (2nd Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 841
    (1970).
      Rule 804(a)(5) as submitted to the Congress provided, as one type
    of situation in which a declarant would be deemed "unavailable",
    that he be "absent from the hearing and the proponent of his
    statement has been unable to procure his attendance by process or
    other reasonable means." The Committee amended the Rule to insert
    after the word "attendance" the parenthetical expression "(or, in
    the case of a hearsay exception under subdivision (b)(2), (3), or
    (4), his attendance or testimony)". The amendment is designed
    primarily to require that an attempt be made to depose a witness
    (as well as to seek his attendance) as a precondition to the
    witness being deemed unavailable. The Committee, however,
    recognized the propriety of an exception to this additional
    requirement when it is the declarant's former testimony that is
    sought to be admitted under subdivision (b)(1).
      Rule 804(b)(1) as submitted by the Court allowed prior testimony
    of an unavailable witness to be admissible if the party against
    whom it is offered or a person "with motive and interest similar"
    to his had an opportunity to examine the witness. The Committee
    considered that it is generally unfair to impose upon the party
    against whom the hearsay evidence is being offered responsibility
    for the manner in which the witness was previously handled by
    another party. The sole exception to this, in the Committee's view,
    is when a party's predecessor in interest in a civil action or
    proceeding had an opportunity and similar motive to examine the
    witness. The Committee amended the Rule to reflect these policy
    determinations.
      Rule 804(b)(3) as submitted by the Court (now Rule 804(b)(2) in
    the bill) proposed to expand the traditional scope of the dying
    declaration exception (i.e. a statement of the victim in a homicide
    case as to the cause or circumstances of his believed imminent
    death) to allow such statements in all criminal and civil cases.
    The Committee did not consider dying declarations as among the most
    reliable forms of hearsay. Consequently, it amended the provision
    to limit their admissibility in criminal cases to homicide
    prosecutions, where exceptional need for the evidence is present.
    This is existing law. At the same time, the Committee approved the
    expansion to civil actions and proceedings where the stakes do not
    involve possible imprisonment, although noting that this could lead
    to forum shopping in some instances.
      Rule 804(b)(4) as submitted by the Court (now Rule 804(b)(3) in
    the bill) provided as follows:
        Statement against interest. - A statement which was at the time
      of its making so far contrary to the declarant's pecuniary or
      proprietary interest or so far tended to subject him to civil or
      criminal liability or to render invalid a claim by him against
      another or to make him an object of hatred, ridicule, or
      disgrace, that a reasonable man in his position would not have
      made the statement unless he believed it to be true. A statement
      tending to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless
      corroborated.
      The Committee determined to retain the traditional hearsay
    exception for statements against pecuniary or proprietary interest.
    However, it deemed the Court's additional references to statements
    tending to subject a declarant to civil liability or to render
    invalid a claim by him against another to be redundant as included
    within the scope of the reference to statements against pecuniary
    or proprietary interest. See Gichner v. Antonio Triano Tile and
    Marble Co., 410 F.2d 238 (D.C. Cir. 1968). Those additional
    references were accordingly deleted.
      The Court's Rule also proposed to expand the hearsay limitation
    from its present federal limitation to include statements
    subjecting the declarant to criminal liability and statements
    tending to make him an object of hatred, ridicule, or disgrace. The
    Committee eliminated the latter category from the subdivision as
    lacking sufficient guarantees of reliability. See United States v.
    Dovico, 380 F.2d 325, 327nn.2,4 (2nd Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S.
    944 (1967). As for statements against penal interest, the Committee
    shared the view of the Court that some such statements do possess
    adequate assurances of reliability and should be admissible. It
    believed, however, as did the Court, that statements of this type
    tending to exculpate the accused are more suspect and so should
    have their admissibility conditioned upon some further provision
    insuring trustworthiness. The proposal in the Court Rule to add a
    requirement of simple corroboration was, however, deemed
    ineffective to accomplish this purpose since the accused's own
    testimony might suffice while not necessarily increasing the
    reliability of the hearsay statement. The Committee settled upon
    the language "unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate
    the trustworthiness of the statement" as affording a proper
    standard and degree of discretion. It was contemplated that the
    result in such cases as Donnelly v. United States, 228 U.S. 243
    (1912), where the circumstances plainly indicated reliability,
    would be changed. The Committee also added to the Rule the final
    sentence from the 1971 Advisory Committee draft, designed to codify
    the doctrine of Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968). The
    Committee does not intend to affect the existing exception to the
    Bruton principle where the codefendant takes the stand and is
    subject to cross-examination, but believed there was no need to
    make specific provision for this situation in the Rule, since in
    that even the declarant would not be "unavailable".

      NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, SENATE REPORT NO. 93-1277  
      Subdivision (a) of rule 804 as submitted by the Supreme Court
    defined the conditions under which a witness was considered to be
    unavailable. It was amended in the House.
      The purpose of the amendment, according to the report of the
    House Committee on the Judiciary, is "primarily to require that an
    attempt be made to depose a witness (as well as to seek his
    attendance) as a precondition to the witness being unavailable."
      Under the House amendment, before a witness is declared
    unavailable, a party must try to depose a witness (declarant) with
    respect to dying declarations, declarations against interest, and
    declarations of pedigree. None of these situations would seem to
    warrant this needless, impractical and highly restrictive
    complication. A good case can be made for eliminating the
    unavailability requirement entirely for declarations against
    interest cases. [Uniform rule 63(10); Kan. Stat. Anno. 60-460(j);
    2A N.J. Stats. Anno. 84-63(10).]
      In dying declaration cases, the declarant will usually, though
    not necessarily, be deceased at the time of trial. Pedigree
    statements which are admittedly and necessarily based largely on
    word of mouth are not greatly fortified by a deposition
    requirement.
      Depositions are expensive and time-consuming. In any event,
    deposition procedures are available to those who wish to resort to
    them. Moreover, the deposition procedures of the Civil Rules and
    Criminal Rules are only imperfectly adapted to implementing the
    amendment. No purpose is served unless the deposition, if taken,
    may be used in evidence. Under Civil Rule (a)(3) and Criminal Rule
    15(e), a deposition, though taken, may not be admissible, and under
    Criminal Rule 15(a) substantial obstacles exist in the way of even
    taking a deposition.
      For these reasons, the committee deleted the House amendment.
      The committee understands that the rule as to unavailability, as
    explained by the Advisory Committee "contains no requirement that
    an attempt be made to take the deposition of a declarant." In
    reflecting the committee's judgment, the statement is accurate
    insofar as it goes. Where, however, the proponent of the statement,
    with knowledge of the existence of the statement, fails to confront
    the declarant with the statement at the taking of the deposition,
    then the proponent should not, in fairness, be permitted to treat
    the declarant as "unavailable" simply because the declarant was not
    amendable to process compelling his attendance at trial. The
    committee does not consider it necessary to amend the rule to this
    effect because such a situation abuses, not conforms to, the rule.
    Fairness would preclude a person from introducing a hearsay
    statement on a particular issue if the person taking the deposition
    was aware of the issue at the time of the deposition but failed to
    depose the unavailable witness on that issue.
      Former testimony. - Rule 804(b)(1) as submitted by the Court
    allowed prior testimony of an unavailable witness to be admissible
    if the party against whom it is offered or a person "with motive
    and interest similar" to his had an opportunity to examine the
    witness.
      The House amended the rule to apply only to a party's predecessor
    in interest. Although the committee recognizes considerable merit
    to the rule submitted by the Supreme Court, a position which has
    been advocated by many scholars and judges, we have concluded that
    the difference between the two versions is not great and we accept
    the House amendment.
      The rule defines those statements which are considered to be
    against interest and thus of sufficient trustworthiness to be
    admissible even though hearsay. With regard to the type of interest
    declared against, the version submitted by the Supreme Court
    included inter alia, statements tending to subject a declarant to
    civil liability or to invalidate a claim by him against another.
    The House struck these provisions as redundant. In view of the
    conflicting case law construing pecuniary or proprietary interests
    narrowly so as to exclude, e.g., tort cases, this deletion could be
    misconstrued.
      Three States which have recently codified their rules of evidence
    have followed the Supreme Court's version of this rule, i.e., that
    a statement is against interest if it tends to subject a declarant
    to civil liability. [Nev. Rev. Stats. Sec. 51.345; N. Mex. Stats.
    (1973 supp.) Sec. 20-4-804(4); West's Wis. Stats. Anno. (1973
    supp.) Sec. 908.045(4).]
      The committee believes that the reference to statements tending
    to subject a person to civil liability constitutes a desirable
    clarification of the scope of the rule. Therefore, we have
    reinstated the Supreme Court language on this matter.
      The Court rule also proposed to expand the hearsay limitation
    from its present federal limitation to include statements
    subjecting the declarant to statements tending to make him an
    object of hatred, ridicule, or disgrace. The House eliminated the
    latter category from the subdivision as lacking sufficient
    guarantees of reliability. Although there is considerable support
    for the admissibility of such statements (all three of the State
    rules referred to supra, would admit such statements), we accept
    the deletion by the House.
      The House amended this exception to add a sentence making
    inadmissible a statement or confession offered against the accused
    in a criminal case, made by a codefendant or other person
    implicating both himself and the accused. The sentence was added to
    codify the constitutional principle announced in Bruton v. United
    States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968). Bruton held that the admission of the
    extrajudicial hearsay statement of one codefendant inculpating a
    second codefendant violated the confrontation clause of the sixth
    amendment.
      The committee decided to delete this provision because the basic
    approach of the rules is to avoid codifying, or attempting to
    codify, constitutional evidentiary principles, such as the fifth
    amendment's right against self-incrimination and, here, the sixth
    amendment's right of confrontation. Codification of a
    constitutional principle is unnecessary and, where the principle is
    under development, often unwise. Furthermore, the House provision
    does not appear to recognize the exceptions to the Bruton rule,
    e.g. where the codefendant takes the stand and is subject to cross
    examination; where the accused confessed, see United States v.
    Mancusi, 404 F.2d 296 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied 397 U.S. 942
    (1907); where the accused was placed at the scene of the crime, see
    United States v. Zelker, 452 F.2d 1009 (2d Cir. 1971). For these
    reasons, the committee decided to delete this provision.
      Note to Subdivision (b)(5). See Note to Paragraph (24), Notes of
    Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93-1277, set out as a
    note under rule 803 of these rules.

          NOTES OF CONFERENCE COMMITTEE, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-1597      
      Rule 804 defines what hearsay statements are admissible in
    evidence if the declarant is unavailable as a witness. The Senate
    amendments make four changes in the rule.
      Subsection (a) defines the term "unavailability as a witness".
    The House bill provides in subsection (a)(5) that the party who
    desires to use the statement must be unable to procure the
    declarant's attendance by process or other reasonable means. In the
    case of dying declarations, statements against interest and
    statements of personal or family history, the House bill requires
    that the proponent must also be unable to procure the declarant's
    testimony (such as by deposition or interrogatories) by process or
    other reasonable means. The Senate amendment eliminates this latter
    provision.
      The Conference adopts the provision contained in the House bill.
      The Senate amendment to subsection (b)(3) provides that a
    statement is against interest and not excluded by the hearsay rule
    when the declarant is unavailable as a witness, if the statement
    tends to subject a person to civil or criminal liability or renders
    invalid a claim by him against another. The House bill did not
    refer specifically to civil liability and to rendering invalid a
    claim against another. The Senate amendment also deletes from the
    House bill the provision that subsection (b)(3) does not apply to a
    statement or confession, made by a codefendant or another, which
    implicates the accused and the person who made the statement, when
    that statement or confession is offered against the accused in a
    criminal case.
      The Conference adopts the Senate amendment. The Conferees intend
    to include within the purview of this rule, statements subjecting a
    person to civil liability and statements rendering claims invalid.
    The Conferees agree to delete the provision regarding statements by
    a codefendant, thereby reflecting the general approach in the Rules
    of Evidence to avoid attempting to codify constitutional
    evidentiary principles.
      The Senate amendment adds a new subsection, (b)(6) [now (b)(5)],
    which makes admissible a hearsay statement not specifically covered
    by any of the five previous subsections, if the statement has
    equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness and if the
    court determines that (A) the statement is offered as evidence of a
    material fact; (B) the statement is more probative on the point for
    which it is offered than any other evidence the proponent can
    procure through reasonable efforts; and (C) the general purposes of
    these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by
    admission of the statement into evidence.
      The House bill eliminated a similar, but broader, provision
    because of the conviction that such a provision injected too much
    uncertainty into the law of evidence regarding hearsay and impaired
    the ability of a litigant to prepare adequately for trial.
      The Conference adopts the Senate amendment with an amendment that
    renumbers this subsection and provides that a party intending to
    request the court to use a statement under this provision must
    notify any adverse party of this intention as well as of the
    particulars of the statement, including the name and address of the
    declarant. This notice must be given sufficiently in advance of the
    trial or hearing to provide any adverse party with a fair
    opportunity to prepare the contest the use of the statement.

      Subdivision (b)(6). Rule 804(b)(6) has been added to provide that
    a party forfeits the right to object on hearsay grounds to the
    admission of a declarant's prior statement when the party's
    deliberate wrongdoing or acquiescence therein procured the
    unavailability of the declarant as a witness. This recognizes the
    need for a prophylactic rule to deal with abhorrent behavior "which
    strikes at the heart of the system of justice itself." United
    States v. Mastrangelo, 693 F.2d 269, 273 (2d Cir. 1982), cert.
    denied, 467 U.S. 1204 (1984). The wrongdoing need not consist of a
    criminal act. The rule applies to all parties, including the
    government.
      Every circuit that has resolved the question has recognized the
    principle of forfeiture by misconduct, although the tests for
    determining whether there is a forfeiture have varied. See, e.g.,
    United States v. Aguiar, 975 F.2d 45, 47 (2d Cir. 1992); United
    States v. Potamitis, 739 F.2d 784, 789 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 469

    standard), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 825 (1982). The usual Rule 104(a)

      On principle it scarcely seems open to doubt that the hearsay
    rule should not call for exclusion of a hearsay statement which
    includes a further hearsay statement when both conform to the
    requirements of a hearsay exception. Thus a hospital record might
    contain an entry of the patient's age based on information
    furnished by his wife. The hospital record would qualify as a
    regular entry except that the person who furnished the information
    was not acting in the routine of the business. However, her
    statement independently qualifies as a statement of pedigree (if
    she is unavailable) or as a statement made for purposes of
    diagnosis or treatment, and hence each link in the chain falls
    under sufficient assurances. Or, further to illustrate, a dying
    declaration may incorporate a declaration against interest by
    another declarant. See McCormick Sec. 290, p. 611.

    Rule 806. Attacking and Supporting Credibility of Declarant

-STATUTE-
      When a hearsay statement, or a statement defined in Rule
    801(d)(2)(C), (D), or (E), has been admitted in evidence, the
    credibility of the declarant may be attacked, and if attacked may
    be supported, by any evidence which would be admissible for those
    purposes if declarant had testified as a witness. Evidence of a
    statement or conduct by the declarant at any time, inconsistent
    with the declarant's hearsay statement, is not subject to any
    requirement that the declarant may have been afforded an
    opportunity to deny or explain. If the party against whom a hearsay
    statement has been admitted calls the declarant as a witness, the
    party is entitled to examine the declarant on the statement as if
    under cross-examination.

-MISC1-
               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      The declarant of a hearsay statement which is admitted in
    evidence is in effect a witness. His credibility should in fairness
    be subject to impeachment and support as though he had in fact
    testified. See Rules 608 and 609. There are however, some special
    aspects of the impeaching of a hearsay declarant which require
    consideration. These special aspects center upon impeachment by
    inconsistent statement, arise from factual differences which exist
    between the use of hearsay and an actual witness and also between
    various kinds of hearsay, and involve the question of applying to
    declarants the general rule disallowing evidence of an inconsistent
    statement to impeach a witness unless he is afforded an opportunity
    to deny or explain. See Rule 613(b).
      The principle difference between using hearsay and an actual
    witness is that the inconsistent statement will in the case of the
    witness almost inevitably of necessity in the nature of things be a
    prior statement, which it is entirely possible and feasible to call
    to his attention, while in the case of hearsay the inconsistent
    statement may well be a subsequent one, which practically precludes
    calling it to the attention of the declarant. The result of
    insisting upon observation of this impossible requirement in the
    hearsay situation is to deny the opponent, already barred from
    cross-examination, any benefit of this important technique of
    impeachment. The writers favor allowing the subsequent statement.
    McCormick Sec. 37, p. 69; 3 Wigmore Sec. 1033. The cases, however,
    are divided. Cases allowing the impeachment include People v.
    Collup, 27 Cal.2d 829, 167 P.2d 714 (1946); People v. Rosoto, 58
    Cal.2d 304, 23 Cal.Rptr. 779, 373 P.2d 867 (1962); Carver v. United
    States, 164 U.S. 694, 17 S.Ct. 228, 41 L.Ed. 602 (1897). Contra,
    Mattox v. United States, 156 U.S. 237, 15 S.Ct. 337, 39 L.Ed. 409
    (1895); People v. Hines, 284 N.Y. 93, 29 N.E.2d 483 (1940). The
    force of Mattox, where the hearsay was the former testimony of a
    deceased witness and the denial of use of a subsequent inconsistent
    statement was upheld, is much diminished by Carver, where the
    hearsay was a dying declaration and denial of use of a subsequent
    inconsistent statement resulted in reversal. The difference in the
    particular brand of hearsay seems unimportant when the inconsistent
    statement is a subsequent one. True, the opponent is not totally
    deprived of cross-examination when the hearsay is former testimony
    or a deposition but he is deprived of cross-examining on the
    statement or along lines suggested by it. Mr. Justice Shiras, with
    two justices joining him, dissented vigorously in Mattox.
      When the impeaching statement was made prior to the hearsay
    statement, differences in the kinds of hearsay appear which
    arguably may justify differences in treatment. If the hearsay
    consisted of a simple statement by the witness, e.g. a dying
    declaration or a declaration against interest, the feasibility of
    affording him an opportunity to deny or explain encounters the same
    practical impossibility as where the statement is a subsequent one,
    just discussed, although here the impossibility arises from the
    total absence of anything resembling a hearing at which the matter
    could be put to him. The courts by a large majority have ruled in
    favor of allowing the statement to be used under these
    circumstances. McCormick Sec. 37, p. 69; 3 Wigmore Sec. 1033. If,
    however, the hearsay consists of former testimony or a deposition,
    the possibility of calling the prior statement to the attention of
    the witness or deponent is not ruled out, since the opportunity to
    cross-examine was available. It might thus be concluded that with
    former testimony or depositions the conventional foundation should
    be insisted upon. Most of the cases involve depositions, and
    Wigmore describes them as divided. 3 Wigmore Sec. 1031. Deposition
    procedures at best are cumbersome and expensive, and to require the
    laying of the foundation may impose an undue burden. Under the
    federal practice, there is no way of knowing with certainty at the
    time of taking a deposition whether it is merely for discovery or
    will ultimately end up in evidence. With respect to both former
    testimony and depositions the possibility exists that knowledge of
    the statement might not be acquired until after the time of the
    cross-examination. Moreover, the expanded admissibility of former
    testimony and depositions under Rule 804(b)(1) calls for a
    correspondingly expanded approach to impeachment. The rule
    dispenses with the requirement in all hearsay situations, which is
    readily administered and best calculated to lead to fair results.
      Notice should be taken that Rule 26(f) of the Federal Rules of
    Civil Procedure, as originally submitted by the Advisory Committee,
    ended with the following:
      "* * * and, without having first called them to the deponent's
    attention, may show statements contradictory thereto made at any
    time by the deponent."
    This language did not appear in the rule as promulgated in
    December, 1937. See 4 Moore's Federal Practice &#182;&#182;
    26.01[9], 26.35 (2d ed. 1967). In 1951, Nebraska adopted a
    provision strongly resembling the one stricken from the federal
    rule:
      "Any party may impeach any adverse deponent by self-contradiction
    without having laid foundation for such impeachment at the time
    such deposition was taken." R.S.Neb. Sec. 25-1267.07.
      For similar provisions, see Uniform Rule 65; California Evidence
    Code Sec. 1202; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 60-462; New
    Jersey Evidence Rule 65.
      The provision for cross-examination of a declarant upon his
    hearsay statement is a corollary of general principles of cross-
    examination. A similar provision is found in California Evidence
    Code Sec. 1203.

      NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, SENATE REPORT NO. 93-1277  
      Rule 906, as passed by the House and as proposed by the Supreme
    Court provides that whenever a hearsay statement is admitted, the
    credibility of the declarant of the statement may be attacked, and
    if attacked may be supported, by any evidence which would be
    admissible for those purposes if the declarant had testified as a
    witness. Rule 801 defines what is a hearsay statement. While
    statements by a person authorized by a party-opponent to make a
    statement concerning the subject, by the party-opponent's agent or
    by a coconspirator of a party - see rule 801(d)(2)(c), (d) and (e) -
     are traditionally defined as exceptions to the hearsay rule, rule
    801 defines such admission by a party-opponent as statements which
    are not hearsay. Consequently, rule 806 by referring exclusively to
    the admission of hearsay statements, does not appear to allow the
    credibility of the declarant to be attacked when the declarant is a
    coconspirator, agent or authorized spokesman. The committee is of
    the view that such statements should open the declarant to attacks
    on his credibility. Indeed, the reason such statements are excluded
    from the operation of rule 806 is likely attributable to the
    drafting technique used to codify the hearsay rule, viz some
    statements, instead of being referred to as exceptions to the
    hearsay rule, are defined as statements which are not hearsay. The
    phrase "or a statement defined in rule 801(d)(2)(c), (d) and (e)"
    is added to the rule in order to subject the declarant of such
    statements, like the declarant of hearsay statements, to attacks on
    his credibility. [The committee considered it unnecessary to
    include statements contained in rule 801(d)(2)(A) and (B) - the
    statement by the party-opponent himself or the statement of which
    he has manifested his adoption - because the credibility of the
    party-opponent is always subject to an attack on his credibility].

          NOTES OF CONFERENCE COMMITTEE, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-1597      
      The Senate amendment permits an attack upon the credibility of
    the declarant of a statement if the statement is one by a person
    authorized by a party-opponent to make a statement concerning the
    subject, one by an agent of a party-opponent, or one by a
    coconspirator of the party-opponent, as these statements are
    defined in Rules 801(d)(2)(C), (D) and (E). The House bill has no
    such provision.
      The Conference adopts the Senate amendment. The Senate amendment
    conforms the rule to present practice.

-HEAD-
    Rule 901. Requirement of Authentication or Identification

-STATUTE-
      (a) General Provision. The requirement of authentication or
    identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is
    satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the
    matter in question is what its proponent claims.
      (b) Illustrations. By way of illustration only, and not by way of
    limitation, the following are examples of authentication or
    identification conforming with the requirements of this rule:
        (1) Testimony of Witness With Knowledge. Testimony that a
      matter is what it is claimed to be.
        (2) Nonexpert Opinion on Handwriting. Nonexpert opinion as to
      the genuineness of handwriting, based upon familiarity not
      acquired for purposes of the litigation.
        (3) Comparison by Trier or Expert Witness. Comparison by the
      trier of fact or by expert witnesses with specimens which have
      been authenticated.
        (4) Distinctive Characteristics and the Like. Appearance,
      contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive
      characteristics, taken in conjunction with circumstances.
        (5) Voice Identification. Identification of a voice, whether
      heard firsthand or through mechanical or electronic transmission
      or recording, by opinion based upon hearing the voice at any time
      under circumstances connecting it with the alleged speaker.
        (6) Telephone Conversations. Telephone conversations, by
      evidence that a call was made to the number assigned at the time
      by the telephone company to a particular person or business, if
      (A) in the case of a person, circumstances, including self-
      identification, show the person answering to be the one called,
      or (B) in the case of a business, the call was made to a place of
      business and the conversation related to business reasonably
      transacted over the telephone.
        (7) Public Records or Reports. Evidence that a writing
      authorized by law to be recorded or filed and in fact recorded or
      filed in a public office, or a purported public record, report,
      statement, or data compilation, in any form, is from the public
      office where items of this nature are kept.
        (8) Ancient Documents or Data Compilation. Evidence that a
      document or data compilation, in any form, (A) is in such
      condition as to create no suspicion concerning its authenticity,
      (B) was in a place where it, if authentic, would likely be, and
      (C) has been in existence 20 years or more at the time it is
      offered.
        (9) Process or System. Evidence describing a process or system
      used to produce a result and showing that the process or system
      produces an accurate result.
        (10) Methods Provided by Statute or Rule. Any method of
      authentication or identification provided by Act of Congress or
      by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to
      statutory authority.

      Subdivision (a). Authentication and identification represent a
    special aspect of relevancy. Michael and Adler, Real Proof, 5
    Vand.L.Rev. 344, 362 (1952); McCormick Secs. 179, 185; Morgan,
    Basic Problems of Evidence 378. (1962). Thus a telephone
    conversation may be irrelevant because on an unrelated topic or
    because the speaker is not identified. The latter aspect is the one
    here involved. Wigmore describes the need for authentication as "an
    inherent logical necessity." 7 Wigmore Sec. 2129, p. 564.
      This requirement of showing authenticity or identity fails in the
    category of relevancy dependent upon fulfillment of a condition of
    fact and is governed by the procedure set forth in Rule 104(b).
      The common law approach to authentication of documents has been
    criticized as an "attitude of agnosticism," McCormick, Cases on
    Evidence 388, n. 4 (3rd ed. 1956), as one which "departs sharply
    from men's customs in ordinary affairs," and as presenting only a
    slight obstacle to the introduction of forgeries in comparison to
    the time and expense devoted to proving genuine writings which
    correctly show their origin on their face, McCormick Sec. 185, pp.
    395, 396. Today, such available procedures as requests to admit and
    pretrial conference afford the means of eliminating much of the
    need for authentication or identification. Also, significant
    inroads upon the traditional insistence on authentication and
    identification have been made by accepting as at least prima facie
    genuine items of the kind treated in Rule 902, infra. However, the
    need for suitable methods of proof still remains, since criminal
    cases pose their own obstacles to the use of preliminary
    procedures, unforeseen contingencies may arise, and cases of
    genuine controversy will still occur.
      Subdivision (b). The treatment of authentication and
    identification draws largely upon the experience embodied in the
    common law and in statutes to furnish illustrative applications of
    the general principle set forth in subdivision (a). The examples
    are not intended as an exclusive enumeration of allowable methods
    but are meant to guide and suggest, leaving room for growth and
    development in this area of the law.
      The examples relate for the most part to documents, with some
    attention given to voice communications and computer print-outs. As
    Wigmore noted, no special rules have been developed for
    authenticating chattels. Wigmore, Code of Evidence Sec. 2086 (3rd
    ed. 1942).
      It should be observed that compliance with requirements of
    authentication or identification by no means assures admission of
    an item into evidence, as other bars, hearsay for example, may
    remain.
      Example (1). Example (1) contemplates a broad spectrum ranging
    from testimony of a witness who was present at the signing of a
    document to testimony establishing narcotics as taken from an
    accused and accounting for custody through the period until trial,
    including laboratory analysis. See California Evidence Code Sec.
    1413, eyewitness to signing.
      Example (2). Example (2) states conventional doctrine as to lay
    identification of handwriting, which recognizes that a sufficient
    familiarity with the handwriting of another person may be acquired
    by seeing him write, by exchanging correspondence, or by other
    means, to afford a basis for identifying it on subsequent
    occasions. McCormick Sec. 189. See also California Evidence Code
    Sec. 1416. Testimony based upon familiarity acquired for purposes
    of the litigation is reserved to the expert under the example which
    follows.
      Example (3). The history of common law restrictions upon the
    technique of proving or disproving the genuineness of a disputed
    specimen of handwriting through comparison with a genuine specimen,
    by either the testimony of expert witnesses or direct viewing by
    the triers themselves, is detailed in 7 Wigmore Secs. 1991-1994. In
    breaking away, the English Common Law Procedure Act of 1854, 17 and
    18 Viet., c. 125, Sec. 27, cautiously allowed expert or trier to
    use exemplars "proved to the satisfaction of the judge to be
    genuine" for purposes of comparison. The language found its way
    into numerous statutes in this country, e.g., California Evidence
    Code Secs. 1417, 1418. While explainable as a measure of prudence
    in the process of breaking with precedent in the handwriting
    situation, the reservation to the judge of the question of the
    genuineness of exemplars and the imposition of an unusually high
    standard of persuasion are at variance with the general treatment
    of relevancy which depends upon fulfillment of a condition of fact.
    Rule 104(b). No similar attitude is found in other comparison
    situations, e.g., ballistics comparison by jury, as in Evans v.
    Commonwealth, 230 Ky. 411, 19 S.W.2d 1091 (1929), or by experts,
    Annot. 26 A.L.R.2d 892, and no reason appears for its continued
    existence in handwriting cases. Consequently Example (3) sets no
    higher standard for handwriting specimens and treats all comparison
    situations alike, to be governed by Rule 104(b). This approach is
    consistent with 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1731: "The admitted or proved
    handwriting of any person shall be admissible, for purposes of
    comparison, to determine genuineness of other handwriting
    attributed to such person."
      Precedent supports the acceptance of visual comparison as
    sufficiently satisfying preliminary authentication requirements for
    admission in evidence. Brandon v. Collins, 267 F.2d 731 (2d Cir.
    1959); Wausau Sulphate Fibre Co. v. Commissioner of Internal
    Revenue, 61 F.2d 879 (7th Cir. 1932); Desimone v. United States,
    227 F.2d 864 (9th Cir. 1955).
      Example (4). The characteristics of the offered item itself,
    considered in the light of circumstances, afford authentication
    techniques in great variety. Thus a document or telephone
    conversation may be shown to have emanated from a particular person
    by virtue of its disclosing knowledge of facts known peculiarly to
    him; Globe Automatic Sprinkler Co. v. Braniff, 89 Okl. 105, 214 P.
    127 (1923); California Evidence Code Sec. 1421; similarly, a letter
    may be authenticated by content and circumstances indicating it was
    in reply to a duly authenticated one. McCormick Sec. 192;
    California Evidence Code Sec. 1420. Language patterns may indicate
    authenticity or its opposite. Magnuson v. State, 187 Wis. 122, 203
    N.W. 749 (1925); Arens and Meadow, Psycholinguistics and the
    Confession Dilemma, 56 Colum.L.Rev. 19 (1956).
      Example (5). Since aural voice identification is not a subject of
    expert testimony, the requisite familiarity may be acquired either
    before or after the particular speaking which is the subject of the
    identification, in this respect resembling visual identification of
    a person rather than identification of handwriting. Cf. Example
    (2), supra, People v. Nichols, 378 Ill. 487, 38 N.E.2d 766 (1942);
    McGuire v. State, 200 Md. 601, 92 A.2d 582 (1952); State v. McGee,
    336 Mo. 1082, 83 S.W.2d 98 (1935).
      Example (6). The cases are in agreement that a mere assertion of
    his identity by a person talking on the telephone is not sufficient
    evidence of the authenticity of the conversation and that
    additional evidence of his identity is required. The additional
    evidence need not fall in any set pattern. Thus the content of his
    statements or the reply technique, under Example (4), supra, or
    voice identification under Example (5), may furnish the necessary
    foundation. Outgoing calls made by the witness involve additional
    factors bearing upon authenticity. The calling of a number assigned
    by the telephone company reasonably supports the assumption that
    the listing is correct and that the number is the one reached. If
    the number is that of a place of business, the mass of authority
    allows an ensuing conversation if it relates to business reasonably
    transacted over the telephone, on the theory that the maintenance
    of the telephone connection is an invitation to do business without
    further identification. Matton v. Hoover Co., 350 Mo. 506, 166
    S.W.2d 557 (1942); City of Pawhuska v. Crutchfield, 147 Okl. 4. 293
    P. 1095 (1930); Zurich General Acc. & Liability Ins. Co. v. Baum,
    159 Va. 404, 165 S.E. 518 (1932). Otherwise, some additional
    circumstance of identification of the speaker is required. The
    authorities divide on the question whether the self-identifying
    statement of the person answering suffices. Example (6) answers in
    the affirmative on the assumption that usual conduct respecting
    telephone calls furnish adequate assurances of regularity, bearing
    in mind that the entire matter is open to exploration before the
    trier of fact. In general, see McCormick Sec. 193; 7 Wigmore Sec.
    2155; Annot., 71 A.L.R. 5, 105 id. 326.
      Example (7). Public records are regularly authenticated by proof
    of custody, without more. McCormick Sec. 191; 7 Wigmore Secs. 2158,
    2159. The example extends the principle to include data stored in
    computers and similar methods, of which increasing use in the
    public records area may be expected. See California Evidence Code
    Secs. 1532, 1600.
      Example (8). The familiar ancient document rule of the common law
    is extended to include data stored electronically or by other
    similar means. Since the importance of appearance diminishes in
    this situation, the importance of custody or place where found
    increases correspondingly. This expansion is necessary in view of
    the widespread use of methods of storing data in forms other than
    conventional written records.
      Any time period selected is bound to be arbitrary. The common law
    period of 30 years is here reduced to 20 years, with some shift of
    emphasis from the probable unavailability of witnesses to the
    unlikeliness of a still viable fraud after the lapse of time. The
    shorter period is specified in the English Evidence Act of 1938, 1
    & 2 Geo. 6, c. 28, and in Oregon R.S. 1963, Sec. 41.360(34). See
    also the numerous statutes prescribing periods of less than 30
    years in the case of recorded documents. 7 Wigmore Sec. 2143.
      The application of Example (8) is not subject to any limitation
    to title documents or to any requirement that possession, in the
    case of a title document, has been consistent with the document.
    See McCormick Sec. 190.
      Example (9). Example (9) is designed for situations in which the
    accuracy of a result is dependent upon a process or system which
    produces it. X-rays afford a familiar instance. Among more recent
    developments is the computer, as to which see Transport Indemnity
    Co. v. Seib, 178 Neb. 253, 132 N.W.2d 871 (1965); State v. Veres, 7
    Ariz.App. 117, 436 P.2d 629 (1968); Merrick v. United States Rubber
    Co., 7 Ariz.App. 433, 440 P.2d 314 (1968); Freed, Computer Print-
    Outs as Evidence, 16 Am.Jur. Proof of Facts 273; Symposium, Law
    and Computers in the Mid-Sixties, ALI-ABA (1966); 37 Albany L.Rev.
    61 (1967). Example (9) does not, of course, foreclose taking
    judicial notice of the accuracy of the process or system.
      Example (10). The example makes clear that methods of
    authentication provided by Act of Congress and by the Rules of
    Civil and Criminal Procedure or by Bankruptcy Rules are not
    intended to be superseded. Illustrative are the provisions for
    authentication of official records in Civil Procedure Rule 44 and
    Criminal Procedure Rule 27, for authentication of records of
    proceedings by court reporters in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 753(b) and Civil
    Procedure Rule 80(c), and for authentication of depositions in
    Civil Procedure Rule 30(f).

-HEAD-
    Rule 902. Self-authentication

-STATUTE-
      Extrinsic evidence of authenticity as a condition precedent to
    admissibility is not required with respect to the following:
        (1) Domestic Public Documents Under Seal. A document bearing a
      seal purporting to be that of the United States, or of any State,
      district, Commonwealth, territory, or insular possession thereof,
      or the Panama Canal Zone, or the Trust Territory of the Pacific
      Islands, or of a political subdivision, department, officer, or
      agency thereof, and a signature purporting to be an attestation
      or execution.
        (2) Domestic Public Documents Not Under Seal. A document
      purporting to bear the signature in the official capacity of an
      officer or employee of any entity included in paragraph (1)
      hereof, having no seal, if a public officer having a seal and
      having official duties in the district or political subdivision
      of the officer or employee certifies under seal that the signer
      has the official capacity and that the signature is genuine.
        (3) Foreign Public Documents. A document purporting to be
      executed or attested in an official capacity by a person
      authorized by the laws of a foreign country to make the execution
      or attestation, and accompanied by a final certification as to
      the genuineness of the signature and official position (A) of the
      executing or attesting person, or (B) of any foreign official
      whose certificate of genuineness of signature and official
      position relates to the execution or attestation or is in a chain
      of certificates of genuineness of signature and official position
      relating to the execution or attestation. A final certification
      may be made by a secretary of an embassy or legation, consul
      general, consul, vice consul, or consular agent of the United
      States, or a diplomatic or consular official of the foreign
      country assigned or accredited to the United States. If
      reasonable opportunity has been given to all parties to
      investigate the authenticity and accuracy of official documents,
      the court may, for good cause shown, order that they be treated
      as presumptively authentic without final certification or permit
      them to be evidenced by an attested summary with or without final
      certification.
        (4) Certified Copies of Public Records. A copy of an official
      record or report or entry therein, or of a document authorized by
      law to be recorded or filed and actually recorded or filed in a
      public office, including data compilations in any form, certified
      as correct by the custodian or other person authorized to make
      the certification, by certificate complying with paragraph (1),
      (2), or (3) of this rule or complying with any Act of Congress or
      rule prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory
      authority.
        (5) Official Publications. Books, pamphlets, or other
      publications purporting to be issued by public authority.
        (6) Newspapers and Periodicals. Printed materials purporting to
      be newspapers or periodicals.
        (7) Trade Inscriptions and the Like. Inscriptions, signs, tags,
      or labels purporting to have been affixed in the course of
      business and indicating ownership, control, or origin.
        (8) Acknowledged Documents. Documents accompanied by a
      certificate of acknowledgment executed in the manner provided by
      law by a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take
      acknowledgments.
        (9) Commercial Paper and Related Documents. Commercial paper,
      signatures thereon, and documents relating thereto to the extent
      provided by general commercial law.
        (10) Presumptions Under Acts of Congress. Any signature,
      document, or other matter declared by Act of Congress to be
      presumptively or prima facie genuine or authentic.
        (11) Certified Domestic Records of Regularly Conducted
      Activity. The original or a duplicate of a domestic record of
      regularly conducted activity that would be admissible under Rule
      803(6) if accompanied by a written declaration of its custodian
      or other qualified person, in a manner complying with any Act of
      Congress or rule prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to
      statutory authority, certifying that the record - 
          (A) was made at or near the time of the occurrence of the
        matters set forth by, or from information transmitted by, a
        person with knowledge of those matters;
          (B) was kept in the course of the regularly conducted
        activity; and
          (C) was made by the regularly conducted activity as a regular
        practice.

      A party intending to offer a record into evidence under this
      paragraph must provide written notice of that intention to all
      adverse parties, and must make the record and declaration
      available for inspection sufficiently in advance of their offer
      into evidence to provide an adverse party with a fair opportunity
      to challenge them.
        (12) Certified Foreign Records of Regularly Conducted Activity.
      In a civil case, the original or a duplicate of a foreign record
      of regularly conducted activity that would be admissible under
      Rule 803(6) if accompanied by a written declaration by its
      custodian or other qualified person certifying that the record - 
          (A) was made at or near the time of the occurrence of the
        matters set forth by, or from information transmitted by, a
        person with knowledge of those matters;
          (B) was kept in the course of the regularly conducted
        activity; and
          (C) was made by the regularly conducted activity as a regular
        practice.

      The declaration must be signed in a manner that, if falsely made,
      would subject the maker to criminal penalty under the laws of the
      country where the declaration is signed. A party intending to
      offer a record into evidence under this paragraph must provide
      written notice of that intention to all adverse parties, and must
      make the record and declaration available for inspection
      sufficiently in advance of their offer into evidence to provide
      an adverse party with a fair opportunity to challenge them.

               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      Case law and statutes have, over the years, developed a
    substantial body of instances in which authenticity is taken as
    sufficiently established for purposes of admissibility without
    extrinsic evidence to that effect, sometimes for reasons of policy
    but perhaps more often because practical considerations reduce the
    possibility of unauthenticity to a very small dimension. The
    present rule collects and incorporates these situations, in some
    instances expanding them to occupy a larger area which their
    underlying considerations justify. In no instance is the opposite
    party foreclosed from disputing authenticity.
      Paragraph (1). The acceptance of documents bearing a public seal
    and signature, most often encountered in practice in the form of
    acknowledgments or certificates authenticating copies of public
    records, is actually of broad application. Whether theoretically
    based in whole or in part upon judicial notice, the practical
    underlying considerations are that forgery is a crime and detection
    is fairly easy and certain. 7 Wigmore Sec. 2161, p. 638; California
    Evidence Code Sec. 1452. More than 50 provisions for judicial
    notice of official seals are contained in the United States Code.
      Paragraph (2). While statutes are found which raise a presumption
    of genuineness of purported official signatures in the absence of
    an official seal, 7 Wigmore Sec. 2167; California Evidence Code
    Sec. 1453, the greater ease of effecting a forgery under these
    circumstances is apparent. Hence this paragraph of the rule calls
    for authentication by an officer who has a seal. Notarial acts by
    members of the armed forces and other special situations are
    covered in paragraph (10).
      Paragraph (3) provides a method for extending the presumption of
    authenticity to foreign official documents by a procedure of
    certification. It is derived from Rule 44(a)(2) of the Rules of
    Civil Procedure but is broader in applying to public documents
    rather than being limited to public records.
      Paragraph (4). The common law and innumerable statutes have
    recognized the procedure of authenticating copies of public records
    by certificate. The certificate qualifies as a public document,
    receivable as authentic when in conformity with paragraph (1), (2),
    or (3). Rule 44(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 27 of
    the Rules of Criminal Procedure have provided authentication
    procedures of this nature for both domestic and foreign public
    records. It will be observed that the certification procedure here
    provided extends only to public records, reports, and recorded
    documents, all including data compilations, and does not apply to
    public documents generally. Hence documents provable when presented
    in original form under paragraphs (1), (2), or (3) may not be
    provable by certified copy under paragraph (4).
      Paragraph (5). Dispensing with preliminary proof of the
    genuineness of purportedly official publications, most commonly
    encountered in connection with statutes, court reports, rules, and
    regulations, has been greatly enlarged by statutes and decisions. 5
    Wigmore Sec. 1684. Paragraph (5), it will be noted, does not confer
    admissibility upon all official publications; it merely provides a
    means whereby their authenticity may be taken as established for
    purposes of admissibility. Rule 44(a) of the Rules of Civil
    Procedure has been to the same effect.
      Paragraph (6). The likelihood of forgery of newspapers or
    periodicals is slight indeed. Hence no danger is apparent in
    receiving them. Establishing the authenticity of the publication
    may, of course, leave still open questions of authority and
    responsibility for items therein contained. See 7 Wigmore Sec.
    2150. Cf. 39 U.S.C. Sec. 4005(b), public advertisement prima facie
    evidence of agency of person named, in postal fraud order
    proceeding; Canadian Uniform Evidence Act, Draft of 1936, printed
    copy of newspaper prima facie evidence that notices or
    advertisements were authorized.
      Paragraph (7). Several factors justify dispensing with
    preliminary proof of genuineness of commercial and mercantile
    labels and the like. The risk of forgery is minimal. Trademark
    infringement involves serious penalties. Great efforts are devoted
    to inducing the public to buy in reliance on brand names, and
    substantial protection is given them. Hence the fairness of this
    treatment finds recognition in the cases. Curtiss Candy Co. v.
    Johnson, 163 Miss. 426, 141 So. 762 (1932), Baby Ruth candy bar;
    Doyle v. Continental Baking Co., 262 Mass. 516, 160 N.E. 325
    (1928), loaf of bread; Weiner v. Mager & Throne, Inc., 167 Misc.
    338, 3 N.Y.S.2d 918 (1938), same. And see W.Va.Code 1966, Sec. 47-3-
    5, trade-mark on bottle prima facie evidence of ownership. Contra,
    Keegan v. Green Giant Co., 150 Me. 283, 110 A.2d 599 (1954); Murphy
    v. Campbell Soup Co., 62 F.2d 564 (1st Cir. 1933). Cattle brands
    have received similar acceptance in the western states. Rev.Code
    Mont.1947, Sec. 46-606; State v. Wolfley, 75 Kan. 406, 89 P. 1046
    (1907); Annot., 11 L.R.A. (N.S.) 87. Inscriptions on trains and
    vehicles are held to be prima facie evidence of ownership or
    control. Pittsburgh, Ft. W. & C. Ry. v. Callaghan, 157 Ill. 406, 41
    N.E. 909 (1895); 9 Wigmore Sec. 2510a. See also the provision of 19
    U.S.C. Sec. 1615(2) that marks, labels, brands, or stamps
    indicating foreign origin are prima facie evidence of foreign
    origin of merchandise.
      Paragraph (8). In virtually every state, acknowledged title
    documents are receivable in evidence without further proof.
    Statutes are collected in 5 Wigmore Sec. 1676. If this
    authentication suffices for documents of the importance of those
    affecting titles, logic scarcely permits denying this method when
    other kinds of documents are involved. Instances of broadly
    inclusive statutes are California Evidence Code Sec. 1451 and
    N.Y.CPLR 4538, McKinney's Consol. Laws 1963.
      Paragraph (9). Issues of the authenticity of commercial paper in
    federal courts will usually arise in diversity cases, will involve
    an element of a cause of action or defense, and with respect to
    presumptions and burden of proof will be controlled by Erie
    Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188
    (1938). Rule 302, supra. There may, however, be questions of
    authenticity involving lesser segments of a case or the case may be
    one governed by federal common law. Clearfield Trust Co. v. United
    States, 318 U.S. 363, 63 S.Ct. 573, 87 L.Ed. 838 (1943). Cf. United
    States v. Yazell, 382 U.S. 341, 86 S.Ct. 500, 15 L.Ed.2d 404
    (1966). In these situations, resort to the useful authentication
    provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code is provided for. While
    the phrasing is in terms of "general commercial law," in order to
    avoid the potential complication inherent in borrowing local
    statutes, today one would have difficulty in determining the
    general commercial law without referring to the Code. See Williams
    v. Walker-Thomas-Furniture Co., 121 U.S.App.D.C. 315, 350 F.2d 445
    (1965). Pertinent Code provisions are sections 1-202, 3-307, and 3-
    510, dealing with third-party documents, signatures on negotiable
    instruments, protests, and statements of dishonor.
      Paragraph (10). The paragraph continues in effect dispensations
    with preliminary proof of genuineness provided in various Acts of
    Congress. See, for example, 10 U.S.C. Sec. 936, signature, without
    seal, together with title, prima facie evidence of authenticity of
    acts of certain military personnel who are given notarial power; 15
    U.S.C. Sec. 77f(a), signature on SEC registration presumed genuine;
    26 U.S.C. Sec. 6064, signature to tax return prima facie genuine.

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      Rule 902(8) as submitted by the Court referred to certificates of
    acknowledgment "under the hand and seal of" a notary public or
    other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments. The
    Committee amended the Rule to eliminate the requirement, believed
    to be inconsistent with the law in some States, that a notary
    public must affix a seal to a document acknowledged before him. As
    amended the Rule merely requires that the document be executed in
    the manner prescribed by State law.
      The Committee approved Rule 902(9) as submitted by the Court.
    With respect to the meaning of the phrase "general commercial law",
    the Committee intends that the Uniform Commercial Code, which has
    been adopted in virtually every State, will be followed generally,
    but that federal commercial law will apply where federal commercial
    paper is involved. See Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, 318
    U.S. 363 (1943). Further, in those instances in which the issues
    are governed by Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), State
    law will apply irrespective of whether it is the Uniform Commercial
    Code.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1988 AMENDMENT       
      These two sentences were inadvertently eliminated from the 1987
    amendments. The amendment is technical. No substantive change is
    intended.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      The amendment adds two new paragraphs to the rule on self-
    authentication. It sets forth a procedure by which parties can
    authenticate certain records of regularly conducted activity, other
    than through the testimony of a foundation witness. See the
    amendment to Rule 803(6). 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3505 currently provides a
    means for certifying foreign records of regularly conducted
    activity in criminal cases, and this amendment is intended to
    establish a similar procedure for domestic records, and for foreign
    records offered in civil cases.
      A declaration that satisfies 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1746 would satisfy
    the declaration requirement of Rule 902(11), as would any
    comparable certification under oath.
      The notice requirement in Rules 902(11) and (12) is intended to
    give the opponent of the evidence a full opportunity to test the
    adequacy of the foundation set forth in the declaration.
      GAP Report - Proposed Amendment to Rule 902. The Committee made
    the following changes to the published draft of the proposed
    amendment to Evidence Rule 902:
      1. Minor stylistic changes were made in the text, in accordance
    with suggestions of the Style Subcommittee of the Standing
    Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.
      2. The phrase "in a manner complying with any Act of Congress or
    rule prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory
    authority" was added to proposed Rule 902(11), to provide
    consistency with Evidence Rule 902(4). The Committee Note was
    amended to accord with this textual change.
      3. Minor stylistic changes were made in the text to provide a
    uniform construction of the terms "declaration" and "certifying."
      4. The notice provisions in the text were revised to clarify that
    the proponent must make both the declaration and the underlying
    record available for inspection.

-HEAD-
    Rule 1001. Definitions

-STATUTE-
      For purposes of this article the following definitions are
    applicable:
        (1) Writings and Recordings. "Writings" and "recordings"
      consist of letters, words, or numbers, or their equivalent, set
      down by handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating,
      photographing, magnetic impulse, mechanical or electronic
      recording, or other form of data compilation.
        (2) Photographs. "Photographs" include still photographs, X-ray
      films, video tapes, and motion pictures.
        (3) Original. An "original" of a writing or recording is the
      writing or recording itself or any counterpart intended to have
      the same effect by a person executing or issuing it. An
      "original" of a photograph includes the negative or any print
      therefrom. If data are stored in a computer or similar device,
      any printout or other output readable by sight, shown to reflect
      the data accurately, is an "original".
        (4) Duplicate. A "duplicate" is a counterpart produced by the
      same impression as the original, or from the same matrix, or by
      means of photography, including enlargements and miniatures, or
      by mechanical or electronic re-recording, or by chemical
      reproduction, or by other equivalent techniques which accurately
      reproduces the original.

-MISC1-
               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      In an earlier day, when discovery and other related procedures
    were strictly limited, the misleading named "best evidence rule"
    afforded substantial guarantees against inaccuracies and fraud by
    its insistence upon production of original documents. The great
    enlargement of the scope of discovery and related procedures in
    recent times has measurably reduced the need for the rule.
    Nevertheless important areas of usefulness persist: discovery of
    documents outside the jurisdiction may require substantial outlay
    of time and money; the unanticipated document may not practically
    be discoverable; criminal cases have built-in limitations on
    discovery. Cleary and Strong, The Best Evidence Rule: An Evaluation
    in Context, 51 Iowa L.Rev. 825 (1966).
      Paragraph (1). Traditionally the rule requiring the original
    centered upon accumulations of data and expressions affecting legal
    relations set forth in words and figures. This meant that the rule
    was one essentially related to writings. Present day techniques
    have expanded methods of storing data, yet the essential form which
    the information ultimately assumes for usable purposes is words and
    figures. Hence the considerations underlying the rule dictate its
    expansion to include computers, photographic systems, and other
    modern developments.
      Paragraph (3). In most instances, what is an original will be
    self-evident and further refinement will be unnecessary. However,
    in some instances particularized definition is required. A carbon
    copy of a contract executed in duplicate becomes an original, as
    does a sales ticket carbon copy given to a customer. While strictly
    speaking the original of a photograph might be thought to be only
    the negative, practicality and common usage require that any print
    from the negative be regarded as an original. Similarly,
    practicality and usage confer the status of original upon any
    computer printout. Transport Indemnity Co. v. Seib, 178 Neb. 253,
    132 N.W.2d 871 (1965).
      Paragraph (4). The definition describes "copies" produced by
    methods possessing an accuracy which virtually eliminates the
    possibility of error. Copies thus produced are given the status of
    originals in large measure by Rule 1003, infra. Copies subsequently
    produced manually, whether handwritten or typed, are not within the
    definition. It should be noted that what is an original for some
    purposes may be a duplicate for others. Thus a bank's microfilm
    record of checks cleared is the original as a record. However, a
    print offered as a copy of a check whose contents are in
    controversy is a duplicate. This result is substantially consistent
    with 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1732(b). Compare 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7513(c), giving
    full status as originals to photographic reproductions of tax
    returns and other documents, made by authority of the Secretary of
    the Treasury, and 44 U.S.C. Sec. 399(a), giving original status to
    photographic copies in the National Archives.

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      The Committee amended this Rule expressly to include "video
    tapes" in the definition of "photographs."

    Rule 1002. Requirement of Original

-STATUTE-
      To prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, the
    original writing, recording, or photograph is required, except as
    otherwise provided in these rules or by Act of Congress.

-SOURCE-
    (Pub. L. 93-595, Sec. 1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1946.)


-MISC1-
               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      The rule is the familiar one requiring production of the original
    of a document to prove its contents, expanded to include writings,
    recordings, and photographs, as defined in Rule 1001(1) and (2),
    supra.
      Application of the rule requires a resolution of the question
    whether contents are sought to be proved. Thus an event may be
    proved by nondocumentary evidence, even though a written record of
    it was made. If, however, the event is sought to be proved by the
    written record, the rule applies. For example, payment may be
    proved without producing the written receipt which was given.
    Earnings may be proved without producing books of account in which
    they are entered. McCormick Sec. 198; 4 Wigmore Sec. 1245. Nor does
    the rule apply to testimony that books or records have been
    examined and found not to contain any reference to a designated
    matter.
      The assumption should not be made that the rule will come into
    operation on every occasion when use is made of a photograph in
    evidence. On the contrary, the rule will seldom apply to ordinary
    photographs. In most instances a party wishes to introduce the item
    and the question raised is the propriety of receiving it in
    evidence. Cases in which an offer is made of the testimony of a
    witness as to what he saw in a photograph or motion picture,
    without producing the same, are most unusual. The usual course is
    for a witness on the stand to identify the photograph or motion
    picture as a correct representation of events which he saw or of a
    scene with which he is familiar. In fact he adopts the picture as
    his testimony, or, in common parlance, uses the picture to
    illustrate his testimony. Under these circumstances, no effort is
    made to prove the contents of the picture, and the rule is
    inapplicable. Paradis, The Celluloid Witness, 37 U.Colo.L. Rev.
    235, 249-251 (1965).
      On occasion, however, situations arise in which contents are
    sought to be proved. Copyright, defamation, and invasion of privacy
    by photograph or motion picture falls in this category. Similarly
    as to situations in which the picture is offered as having
    independent probative value, e.g. automatic photograph of bank
    robber. See People v. Doggett, 83 Cal.App.2d 405, 188 P.2d 792
    (1948) photograph of defendants engaged in indecent act; Mouser and
    Philbin, Photographic Evidence - Is There a Recognized Basis for
    Admissibility? 8 Hastings L.J. 310 (1957). The most commonly
    encountered of this latter group is of course, the X-ray, with
    substantial authority calling for production of the original.
    Daniels v. Iowa City, 191 Iowa 811, 183 N.W. 415 (1921); Cellamare
    v. Third Acc. Transit Corp., 273 App.Div. 260, 77 N.Y.S.2d 91
    (1948); Patrick & Tilman v. Matkin, 154 Okl. 232, 7 P.2d 414
    (1932); Mendoza v. Rivera, 78 P.R.R. 569 (1955)
      It should be noted, however, that Rule 703, supra, allows an
    expert to give an opinion based on matters not in evidence, and the
    present rule must be read as being limited accordingly in its
    application. Hospital records which may be admitted as business
    records under Rule 803(6) commonly contain reports interpreting X-
    rays by the staff radiologist, who qualifies as an expert, and
    these reports need not be excluded from the records by the instant
    rule.
      The reference to Acts of Congress is made in view of such
    statutory provisions as 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7513, photographic
    reproductions of tax returns and documents, made by authority of
    the Secretary of the Treasury, treated as originals, and 44 U.S.C.
    Sec. 399(a), photographic copies in National Archives treated as
    originals.

    Rule 1003. Admissibility of Duplicates

-STATUTE-
      A duplicate is admissible to the same extent as an original
    unless (1) a genuine question is raised as to the authenticity of
    the original or (2) in the circumstances it would be unfair to
    admit the duplicate in lieu of the original.

               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      When the only concern is with getting the words or other contents
    before the court with accuracy and precision, then a counterpart
    serves equally as well as the original, if the counterpart is the
    product of a method which insures accuracy and genuineness. By
    definition in Rule 1001(4), supra, a "duplicate" possesses this
    character.
      Therefore, if no genuine issue exists as to authenticity and no
    other reason exists for requiring the original, a duplicate is
    admissible under the rule. This position finds support in the
    decisions, Myrick v. United States, 332 F.2d 279 (5th Cir. 1964),
    no error in admitting photostatic copies of checks instead of
    original microfilm in absence of suggestion to trial judge that
    photostats were incorrect; Johns v. United States, 323 F.2d 421
    (5th Cir. 1963), not error to admit concededly accurate tape
    recording made from original wire recording; Sauget v. Johnston,
    315 F.2d 816 (9th Cir. 1963), not error to admit copy of agreement
    when opponent had original and did not on appeal claim any
    discrepancy. Other reasons for requiring the original may be
    present when only a part of the original is reproduced and the
    remainder is needed for cross-examination or may disclose matters
    qualifying the part offered or otherwise useful to the opposing
    party. United States v. Alexander, 326 F.2d 736 (4th Cir. 1964).
    And see Toho Bussan Kaisha, Ltd. v. American President Lines, Ltd.,
    265 F.2d 418, 76 A.L.R.2d 1344 (2d Cir. 1959).

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      The Committee approved this Rule in the form submitted by the
    Court, with the expectation that the courts would be liberal in
    deciding that a "genuine question is raised as to the authenticity
    of the original."

    Rule 1004. Admissibility of Other Evidence of Contents

-STATUTE-
      The original is not required, and other evidence of the contents
    of a writing, recording, or photograph is admissible if - 
        (1) Originals Lost or Destroyed. All originals are lost or have
      been destroyed, unless the proponent lost or destroyed them in
      bad faith; or
        (2) Original Not Obtainable. No original can be obtained by any
      available judicial process or procedure; or
        (3) Original in Possession of Opponent. At a time when an
      original was under the control of the party against whom offered,
      that party was put on notice, by the pleadings or otherwise, that
      the contents would be a subject of proof at the hearing, and that
      party does not produce the original at the hearing; or
        (4) Collateral Matters. The writing, recording, or photograph
      is not closely related to a controlling issue.

-MISC1-
               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      Basically the rule requiring the production of the original as
    proof of contents has developed as a rule of preference: if failure
    to produce the original is satisfactory explained, secondary
    evidence is admissible. The instant rule specifies the
    circumstances under which production of the original is excused.
      The rule recognizes no "degrees" of secondary evidence. While
    strict logic might call for extending the principle of preference
    beyond simply preferring the original, the formulation of a
    hierarchy of preferences and a procedure for making it effective is
    believed to involve unwarranted complexities. Most, if not all,
    that would be accomplished by an extended scheme of preferences
    will, in any event, be achieved through the normal motivation of a
    party to present the most convincing evidence possible and the
    arguments and procedures available to his opponent if he does not.
    Compare McCormick Sec. 207.
      Paragraph (1). Loss or destruction of the original, unless due to
    bad faith of the proponent, is a satisfactory explanation of
    nonproduction. McCormick Sec. 201.
      Paragraph (2). When the original is in the possession of a third
    person, inability to procure it from him by resort to process or
    other judicial procedure is sufficient explanation of
    nonproduction. Judicial procedure includes subpoena duces tecum as
    an incident to the taking of a deposition in another jurisdiction.
    No further showing is required. See McCormick Sec. 202.
      Paragraph (3). A party who has an original in his control has no
    need for the protection of the rule if put on notice that proof of
    contents will be made. He can ward off secondary evidence by
    offering the original. The notice procedure here provided is not to
    be confused with orders to produce or other discovery procedures,
    as the purpose of the procedure under this rule is to afford the
    opposite party an opportunity to produce the original, not to
    compel him to do so. McCormick Sec. 203.
      Paragraph (4). While difficult to define with precision,
    situations arise in which no good purpose is served by production
    of the original. Examples are the newspaper in an action for the
    price of publishing defendant's advertisement, Foster-Holcomb
    Investment Co. v. Little Rock Publishing Co., 151 Ark. 449, 236
    S.W. 597 (1922), and the streetcar transfer of plaintiff claiming
    status as a passenger, Chicago City Ry. Co. v. Carroll, 206 Ill.
    318, 68 N.E. 1087 (1903). Numerous cases are collected in McCormick
    Sec. 200, p. 412, n. 1.

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      The Committee approved Rule 1004(1) in the form submitted to
    Congress. However, the Committee intends that loss or destruction
    of an original by another person at the instigation of the
    proponent should be considered as tantamount to loss or destruction
    in bad faith by the proponent himself.

    to be recorded or filed and actually recorded or filed, including
    data compilations in any form, if otherwise admissible, may be
    proved by copy, certified as correct in accordance with rule 902 or

      Public records call for somewhat different treatment. Removing
    them from their usual place of keeping would be attended by serious
    inconvenience to the public and to the custodian. As a consequence
    judicial decisions and statutes commonly hold that no explanation
    need be given for failure to produce the original of a public
    record. McCormick Sec. 204; 4 Wigmore Secs. 1215-1228. This blanket
    dispensation from producing or accounting for the original would
    open the door to the introduction of every kind of secondary
    evidence of contents of public records were it not for the
    preference given certified or compared copies. Recognition of
    degrees of secondary evidence in this situation is an appropriate
    quid pro quo for not applying the requirement of producing the
    original.
      The provisions of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1733(b) apply only to
    departments or agencies of the United States. The rule, however,
    applies to public records generally and is comparable in scope in
    this respect to Rule 44(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.

      While the parent case, Slatterie v. Pooley, 6 M. & W. 664, 151
    Eng. Rep. 579 (Exch. 1840), allows proof of contents by evidence of
    an oral admission by the party against whom offered, without
    accounting for nonproduction of the original, the risk of
    inaccuracy is substantial and the decision is at odds with the
    purpose of the rule giving preference to the original. See 4
    Wigmore Sec. 1255. The instant rule follows Professor McCormick's
    suggestion of limiting this use of admissions to those made in the
    course of giving testimony or in writing. McCormick Sec. 208, p.
    424. The limitation, of course, does not call for excluding
    evidence of an oral admission when nonproduction of the original
    has been accounted for and secondary evidence generally has become
    admissible. Rule 1004, supra.

    Rule 1008. Functions of Court and Jury

-STATUTE-
      When the admissibility of other evidence of contents of writings,
    recordings, or photographs under these rules depends upon the
    fulfillment of a condition of fact, the question whether the
    condition has been fulfilled is ordinarily for the court to
    determine in accordance with the provisions of rule 104. However,
    when an issue is raised (a) whether the asserted writing ever
    existed, or (b) whether another writing, recording, or photograph
    produced at the trial is the original, or (c) whether other
    evidence of contents correctly reflects the contents, the issue is
    for the trier of fact to determine as in the case of other issues
    of fact.

-MISC1-
               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      Most preliminary questions of fact in connection with applying
    the rule preferring the original as evidence of contents are for
    the judge, under the general principles announced in Rule 104,
    supra. Thus, the question whether the loss of the originals has
    been established, or of the fulfillment of other conditions
    specified in Rule 1004, supra, is for the judge. However, questions
    may arise which go beyond the mere administration of the rule
    preferring the original and into the merits of the controversy. For
    example, plaintiff offers secondary evidence of the contents of an
    alleged contract, after first introducing evidence of loss of the
    original, and defendant counters with evidence that no such
    contract was ever executed. If the judge decides that the contract
    was never executed and excludes the secondary evidence, the case is
    at an end without ever going to the jury on a central issue. Levin,
    Authentication and Content of Writings, 10 Rutgers L.Rev. 632, 644
    (1956). The latter portion of the instant rule is designed to
    insure treatment of these situations as raising jury questions. The
    decision is not one for uncontrolled discretion of the jury but is
    subject to the control exercised generally by the judge over jury
    determinations. See Rule 104(b), supra.
      For similar provisions, see Uniform Rule 70(2); Kansas Code of
    Civil Procedure Sec. 60-467(b); New Jersey Evidence Rule 70(2),

-MISC1-
               NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROPOSED RULES           
      Subdivision (a). The various enabling acts contain differences in
    phraseology in their descriptions of the courts over which the
    Supreme Court's power to make rules of practice and procedure
    extends. The act concerning civil actions, as amended in 1966,
    refers to "the district courts * * * of the United States in civil
    actions, including admiralty and maritime cases. * * *" 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 2072, Pub. L. 89-773, Sec. 1, 80 Stat. 1323. The bankruptcy
    authorization is for rules of practice and procedure "under the
    Bankruptcy Act." 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2075, Pub. L. 88-623, Sec. 1, 78
    Stat. 1001. The Bankruptcy Act in turn creates bankruptcy courts of
    "the United States district courts and the district courts of the
    Territories and possessions to which this title is or may hereafter
    be applicable." 11 U.S.C. Secs. 1(10), 11(a). The provision as to
    criminal rules up to and including verdicts applies to "criminal
    cases and proceedings to punish for criminal contempt of court in
    the United States district courts, in the district courts for the
    districts of the Canal Zone and Virgin Islands, in the Supreme
    Court of Puerto Rico, and in proceedings before United States
    magistrates." 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771.
      These various provisions do not in terms describe the same
    courts. In congressional usage the phrase "district courts of the
    United States," without further qualification, traditionally has
    included the district courts established by Congress in the states
    under Article III of the Constitution, which are "constitutional"
    courts, and has not included the territorial courts created under
    Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2, which are "legislative" courts.
    Hornbuckle v. Toombs, 85 U.S. 648, 21 L.Ed. 966 (1873). However,
    any doubt as to the inclusion of the District Court for the
    District of Columbia in the phrase is laid at rest by the
    provisions of the Judicial Code constituting the judicial
    districts, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 81 et seq. creating district courts
    therein, Id. Sec. 132, and specifically providing that the term
    "district court of the United States" means the courts so
    constituted. Id. Sec. 451. The District of Columbia is included.
    Id. Sec. 88. Moreover, when these provisions were enacted,
    reference to the District of Columbia was deleted from the original
    civil rules enabling act. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2072. Likewise Puerto Rico
    is made a district, with a district court, and included in the
    term. Id. Sec. 119. The question is simply one of the extent of the
    authority conferred by Congress. With respect to civil rules it
    seems clearly to include the district courts in the states, the
    District Court for the District of Columbia, and the District Court
    for the District of Puerto Rico.
      The bankruptcy coverage is broader. The bankruptcy courts include
    "the United States district courts," which includes those
    enumerated above. Bankruptcy courts also include "the district
    courts of the Territories and possessions to which this title is or
    may hereafter be applicable." 11 U.S.C. Secs. 1(10), 11(a). These
    courts include the district courts of Guam and the Virgin Islands.
    48 U.S.C. Secs. 1424(b), 1615. Professor Moore points out that
    whether the District Court for the District of the Canal Zone is a
    court of bankruptcy "is not free from doubt in view of the fact
    that no other statute expressly or inferentially provides for the
    applicability of the Bankruptcy Act in the Zone." He further
    observes that while there seems to be little doubt that the Zone is
    a territory or possession within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act,
    11 U.S.C. Sec. 1(10), it must be noted that the appendix to the
    Canal Zone Code of 1934 did not list the Act among the laws of the
    United States applicable to the Zone. 1 Moore's Collier on
    Bankruptcy &#182;1.10, pp. 67, 72, n. 25 (14th ed. 1967). The Code
    of 1962 confers on the district court jurisdiction of:
      "(4) actions and proceedings involving laws of the United States
    applicable to the Canal Zone; and
      "(5) other matters and proceedings wherein jurisdiction is
    conferred by this Code or any other law." Canal Zone Code, 1962,
    Title 3, Sec. 141.
      Admiralty jurisdiction is expressly conferred. Id. Sec. 142.
    General powers are conferred on the district court, "if the course
    of proceeding is not specifically prescribed by this Code, by the
    statute, or by applicable rule of the Supreme Court of the United
    States * * *" Id. Sec. 279. Neither these provisions nor Sec. 1(10)
    of the Bankruptcy Act ("district courts of the Territories and
    possessions to which this title is or may hereafter be applicable")
    furnishes a satisfactory answer as to the status of the District
    Court for the District of the Canal Zone as a court of bankruptcy.
    However, the fact is that this court exercises no bankruptcy
    jurisdiction in practice.
      The criminal rules enabling act specifies United States district
    courts, district courts for the districts of the Canal Zone and the
    Virgin Islands, the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of Puerto
    Rico, and proceedings before United States commissioners. Aside
    from the addition of commissioners, now magistrates, this scheme
    differs from the bankruptcy pattern in that it makes no mention of
    the District Court of Guam but by specific mention removes the
    Canal Zone from the doubtful list.
      The further difference in including the Supreme Court of the
    Commonwealth of Puerto Rico seems not to be significant for present
    purposes, since the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of Puerto
    Rico is an appellate court. The Rules of Criminal Procedure have
    not been made applicable to it, as being unneeded and
    inappropriate, Rule 54(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal
    Procedure, and the same approach is indicated with respect to rules
    of evidence.
      If one were to stop at this point and frame a rule governing the
    applicability of the proposed rules of evidence in terms of the
    authority conferred by the three enabling acts, an irregular
    pattern would emerge as follows:
      Civil actions, including admiralty and maritime cases - district
    courts in the states, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.
      Bankruptcy - same as civil actions, plus Guam and Virgin Islands.
      Criminal cases - same as civil actions, plus Canal Zone and
    Virgin Islands (but not Guam).
      This irregular pattern need not, however, be accepted. Originally
    the Advisory Committee on the Rules of Civil Procedure took the
    position that, although the phrase "district courts of the United
    States" did not include territorial courts, provisions in the
    organic laws of Puerto Rico and Hawaii would make the rules
    applicable to the district courts thereof, though this would not be
    so as to Alaska, the Virgin Islands, or the Canal Zone, whose
    organic acts contained no corresponding provisions. At the
    suggestion of the Court, however, the Advisory Committee struck
    from its notes a statement to the above effect. 2 Moore's Federal
    Practice &#182;1.07 (2nd ed. 1967); 1 Barron and Holtzoff, Federal
    Practice and Procedure Sec. 121 (Wright ed. 1960). Congress
    thereafter by various enactments provided that the rules and future
    amendments thereto should apply to the district courts of Hawaii,
    53 Stat. 841 (1939), Puerto Rico, 54 Stat. 22 (1940), Alaska, 63
    Stat. 445 (1949), Guam, 64 Stat. 384-390 (1950), and the Virgin
    Islands, 68 Stat. 497, 507 (1954). The original enabling act for
    rules of criminal procedure specifically mentioned the district
    courts of the Canal Zone and the Virgin Islands. The Commonwealth
    of Puerto Rico was blanketed in by creating its court a "district
    court of the United States" as previously described. Although Guam
    is not mentioned in either the enabling act or in the expanded
    definition of "district court of the United States," the Supreme
    Court in 1956 amended Rule 54(a) to state that the Rules of
    Criminal Procedure are applicable in Guam. The Court took this step
    following the enactment of legislation by Congress in 1950 that
    rules theretofore or thereafter promulgated by the Court in civil
    cases, admiralty, criminal cases and bankruptcy should apply to the
    District Court of Guam, 48 U.S.C. Sec. 1424(b), and two Ninth
    Circuit decisions upholding the applicability of the Rules of
    Criminal Procedure to Guam. Pugh v. United States, 212 F.2d 761
    (9th Cir. 1954); Hatchett v. Guam, 212 F.2d 767 (9th Cir. 1954);
    Orfield, The Scope of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 38
    U. of Det.L.J. 173, 187 (1960).
      From this history, the reasonable conclusion is that
    Congressional enactment of a provision that rules and future
    amendments shall apply in the courts of a territory or possession
    is the equivalent of mention in an enabling act and that a rule on
    scope and applicability may properly be drafted accordingly.
    Therefore the pattern set by Rule 54 of the Federal Rules of
    Criminal Procedure is here followed.
      The substitution of magistrates in lieu of commissioners is made
    in pursuance of the Federal Magistrates Act, P.L. 90-578, approved
    October 17, 1968, 82 Stat. 1107.
      Subdivision (b) is a combination of the language of the enabling
    acts, supra, with respect to the kinds of proceedings in which the
    making of rules is authorized. It is subject to the qualifications
    expressed in the subdivisions which follow.
      Subdivision (c), singling out the rules of privilege for special
    treatment, is made necessary by the limited applicability of the
    remaining rules.
      Subdivision (d). The rule is not intended as an expression as to
    when due process or other constitutional provisions may require an
    evidentiary hearing. Paragraph (1) restates, for convenience, the
    provisions of the second sentence of Rule 104(a), supra. See
    Advisory Committee's Note to that rule.
      (2) While some states have statutory requirements that
    indictments be based on "legal evidence," and there is some case
    law to the effect that the rules of evidence apply to grand jury
    proceedings, 1 Wigmore Sec. 4(5), the Supreme Court has not
    accepted this view. In Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 76
    S.Ct. 406, 100 L.Ed. 397 (1965), the Court refused to allow an
    indictment to be attacked, for either constitutional or policy
    reasons, on the ground that only hearsay evidence was presented.
      "It would run counter to the whole history of the grand jury
    institution, in which laymen conduct their inquiries unfettered by
    technical rules. Neither justice nor the concept of a fair trial
    requires such a change." Id. at 364. The rule as drafted does not
    deal with the evidence required to support an indictment.
      (3) The rule exempts preliminary examinations in criminal cases.
    Authority as to the applicability of the rules of evidence to
    preliminary examinations has been meagre and conflicting.
    Goldstein, The State and the Accused: Balance of Advantage in
    Criminal Procedure, 69 Yale L.J. 1149, 1168, n. 53 (1960); Comment,
    Preliminary Hearings on Indictable Offenses in Philadelphia, 106 U.
    of Pa.L.Rev. 589, 592-593 (1958). Hearsay testimony is, however,
    customarily received in such examinations. Thus in a Dyer Act case,
    for example, an affidavit may properly be used in a preliminary
    examination to prove ownership of the stolen vehicle, thus saving
    the victim of the crime the hardship of having to travel twice to a
    distant district for the sole purpose of testifying as to
    ownership. It is believed that the extent of the applicability of
    the Rules of Evidence to preliminary examinations should be
    appropriately dealt with by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
    which regulate those proceedings.
      Extradition and rendition proceedings are governed in detail by
    statute. 18 U.S.C. Secs. 3181-3195. They are essentially
    administrative in character. Traditionally the rules of evidence
    have not applied. 1 Wigmore Sec. 4(6). Extradition proceedings are
    accepted from the operation of the Rules of Criminal Procedure.
    Rule 54(b)(5) of Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
      The rules of evidence have not been regarded as applicable to
    sentencing or probation proceedings, where great reliance is placed
    upon the presentence investigation and report. Rule 32(c) of the
    Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires a presentence
    investigation and report in every case unless the court otherwise
    directs. In Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 241, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93
    L.Ed. 1337 (1949), in which the judge overruled a jury
    recommendation of life imprisonment and imposed a death sentence,
    the Court said that due process does not require confrontation or
    cross-examination in sentencing or passing on probation, and that
    the judge has broad discretion as to the sources and types of
    information relied upon. Compare the recommendation that the
    substance of all derogatory information be disclosed to the
    defendant, in A.B.A. Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal
    Justice, Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures Sec. 4.4, Tentative
    Draft (1967, Sobeloff, Chm.). Williams was adhered to in Specht v.
    Patterson, 386 U.S. 605, 87 S.Ct. 1209, 18 L.Ed.2d 326 (1967), but
    not extended to a proceeding under the Colorado Sex Offenders Act,
    which was said to be a new charge leading in effect to punishment,
    more like the recidivist statutes where opportunity must be given
    to be heard on the habitual criminal issue.
      Warrants for arrest, criminal summonses, and search warrants are
    issued upon complaint or affidavit showing probable cause. Rules
    4(a) and 41(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The
    nature of the proceedings makes application of the formal rules of
    evidence inappropriate and impracticable.
      Criminal contempts are punishable summarily if the judge
    certifies that he saw or heard the contempt and that it was
    committed in the presence of the court. Rule 42(a) of the Federal
    Rules of Criminal Procedure. The circumstances which preclude
    application of the rules of evidence in this situation are not
    present, however, in other cases of criminal contempt.
      Proceedings with respect to release on bail or otherwise do not
    call for application of the rules of evidence. The governing
    statute specifically provides:
      "Information stated in, or offered in connection with, any order
    entered pursuant to this section need not conform to the rules
    pertaining to the admissibility of evidence in a court of law." 18
    U.S.C.A. Sec. 3146(f). This provision is consistent with the type
    of inquiry contemplated in A.B.A. Project on Minimum Standards for
    Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Pretrial Release, Sec.
    4.5(b), (c), p. 16 (1968). The references to the weight of the
    evidence against the accused, in Rule 46(a)(1), (c) of the Federal
    Rules of Criminal Procedure and in 18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 3146(b), as a
    factor to be considered, clearly do not have in view evidence
    introduced at a hearing.
      The rule does not exempt habeas corpus proceedings. The Supreme
    Court held in Walker v. Johnston, 312 U.S. 275, 61 S.Ct. 574, 85
    L.Ed. 830 (1941), that the practice of disposing of matters of fact
    on affidavit, which prevailed in some circuits, did not "satisfy
    the command of the statute that the judge shall proceed 'to
    determine the facts of the case, by hearing the testimony and
    arguments.' " This view accords with the emphasis in Townsend v.
    Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), upon trial-
    type proceedings, Id. 311, 83 S.Ct. 745, with demeanor evidence as
    a significant factor, Id. 322, 83 S.Ct. 745, in applications by
    state prisoners aggrieved by unconstitutional detentions. Hence
    subdivision (e) applies the rules to habeas corpus proceedings to
    the extent not inconsistent with the statute.
      Subdivision (e). In a substantial number of special proceedings,
    ad hoc evaluation has resulted in the promulgation of
    particularized evidentiary provisions, by Act of Congress or by
    rule adopted by the Supreme Court. Well adapted to the particular
    proceedings, though not apt candidates for inclusion in a set of
    general rules, they are left undisturbed. Otherwise, however, the
    rules of evidence are applicable to the proceedings enumerated in
    the subdivision.

       NOTES OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, HOUSE REPORT NO. 93-650   
      Subdivision (a) as submitted to the Congress, in stating the
    courts and judges to which the Rules of Evidence apply, omitted the
    Court of Claims and commissioners of that Court. At the request of
    the Court of Claims, the Committee amended the Rule to include the
    Court and its commissioners within the purview of the Rules.
      Subdivision (b) was amended merely to substitute positive law
    citations for those which were not.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to delete the reference to the
    District Court for the District of the Canal Zone, which no longer
    exists, and to add the District Court for the Northern Mariana
    Islands. The United States bankruptcy judges are added to conform
    the subdivision with Rule 1101(b) and Bankruptcy Rule 9017.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1988 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      This revision is made to conform the rule to changes in
    terminology made by Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Criminal
    Procedure and to the changes in the title of United States
    magistrates made by the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990.
