-STATUTE-
      (a) Establishment. - The United States Patent and Trademark
    Office is established as an agency of the United States, within the
    Department of Commerce. In carrying out its functions, the United
    States Patent and Trademark Office shall be subject to the policy
    direction of the Secretary of Commerce, but otherwise shall retain
    responsibility for decisions regarding the management and
    administration of its operations and shall exercise independent
    control of its budget allocations and expenditures, personnel
    decisions and processes, procurements, and other administrative and
    management functions in accordance with this title and applicable
    provisions of law. Those operations designed to grant and issue
    patents and those operations which are designed to facilitate the
    registration of trademarks shall be treated as separate operating
    units within the Office.
      (b) Offices. - The United States Patent and Trademark Office
    shall maintain its principal office in the metropolitan Washington,
    D.C., area, for the service of process and papers and for the
    purpose of carrying out its functions. The United States Patent and
    Trademark Office shall be deemed, for purposes of venue in civil
    actions, to be a resident of the district in which its principal
    office is located, except where jurisdiction is otherwise provided
    by law. The United States Patent and Trademark Office may establish
    satellite offices in such other places in the United States as it
    considers necessary and appropriate in the conduct of its business.
      (c) Reference. - For purposes of this title, the United States
    Patent and Trademark Office shall also be referred to as the
    "Office" and the "Patent and Trademark Office".

                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   
      Based on Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 1 (R.S. 475 and
    Executive Order 4175, Mar. 17, 1925).
      The word "all" is omitted from the corresponding section of the
    existing statute and "except as otherwise provided by law" added,
    since some old records are kept in the National Archives, see 44
    U.S.C., 1946 ed., ch. 8A.
      The word "models" has been omitted to remove emphasis on models
    since they are no longer generally required. They are included by
    the word "things."
      The phrase "and to trade-mark registrations" is added. There is
    no enactment corresponding to this section in the trade-mark law.
    The original chapter of the Revised Statutes containing this
    section deals with the Patent Office as such in its administration
    of trade-marks as well as patents. This is explicitly brought out
    in some of the corresponding sections of the present chapter.
    Changes in language are made.

    follows: "The Patent and Trademark Office shall continue as an
    office in the Department of Commerce, where records, books,
    drawings, specifications, and other papers and things pertaining to
    patents and to trademark registrations shall be kept and preserved,
    except as otherwise provided by law."
      1975 - Pub. L. 93-596 substituted "Patent and Trademark Office"
    for "Patent Office".

    of Patents and Trademarks', respectively."

-MISC1-
                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   
      Based on Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 2 (R.S. 476, amended
    (1) Feb. 15, 1916, ch. 22, Sec. 1, 39 Stat. 8, (2) Feb. 14, 1927,
    ch. 139, Sec. 1, 44 Stat. 1098, (3) Apr. 11, 1930, ch. 132, Sec. 1,
    46 Stat. 155).
      The temporary designation of the assistant commissioner as
    Commissioner in case of a vacancy in office is added. This will
    eliminate complications since present applicable general statutes
    (5 U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 7) permit a vacancy to be temporarily
    filled only for not more than 30 days.
      Changes in language are made. "Assistant commissioners" is used
    in the second sentence (and elsewhere in the bill) as referring to
    all three assistants.
      This entire title is subject to Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1950
    (64 Stat. 1263) which vests all functions of the Patent Office in
    the Secretary of Commerce and authorizes delegation by him. It has
    been found impractical to so word the various sections of the
    title, and a general provision has been inserted as the second
    paragraph of this section of the bill, leaving the wording of
    various sections of the title in terms of officers previously
    specified and to whom the functions presently stand delegated.

    an officer in such district authorized to take depositions and
    affidavits, at the time and place stated in the subpoena. The
    provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relating to the
    attendance of witnesses and to the production of documents and

    fees and traveling expenses in going to, and returning from, and
    one day's attendance at the place of examination, are paid or
    tendered him at the time of the service of the subpoena; nor for
    refusing to disclose any secret matter except upon appropriate
    order of the court which issued the subpoena.

      Examining Authority and the International Searching Authority,
      $670.

        (12) Basic national fee for an international application where
      the international preliminary examination fee has been paid to
      the Patent and Trademark Office, and the international

        (15) For each national stage of an international application
      containing a multiple dependent claim, $260.

    For the purpose of computing fees, a multiple dependent claim
    referred to in section 112 of this title or any claim depending
    therefrom shall be considered as separate dependent claims in
    accordance with the number of claims to which reference is made.
    Errors in payment of the additional fees may be rectified in
    accordance with regulations of the Director.
      (b) The Director shall charge the following fees for maintaining
    in force all patents based on applications filed on or after
    December 12, 1980:
        (1) 3 years and 6 months after grant, $830.
        (2) 7 years and 6 months after grant, $1,900.
        (3) 11 years and 6 months after grant, $2,910.

    Unless payment of the applicable maintenance fee is received in the
    Patent and Trademark Office on or before the date the fee is due or
    within a grace period of 6 months thereafter, the patent will
    expire as of the end of such grace period. The Director may require
    the payment of a surcharge as a condition of accepting within such
    6-month grace period the payment of an applicable maintenance fee.
    No fee may be established for maintaining a design or plant patent
    in force.
      (c)(1) The Director may accept the payment of any maintenance fee
    required by subsection (b) of this section which is made within
    twenty-four months after the six-month grace period if the delay is
    shown to the satisfaction of the Director to have been
    unintentional, or at any time after the six-month grace period if
    the delay is shown to the satisfaction of the Director to have been
    unavoidable. The Director may require the payment of a surcharge as
    a condition of accepting payment of any maintenance fee after the
    six-month grace period. If the Director accepts payment of a
    maintenance fee after the six-month grace period, the patent shall
    be considered as not having expired at the end of the grace period.
      (2) A patent, the term of which has been maintained as a result
    of the acceptance of a payment of a maintenance fee under this
    subsection, shall not abridge or affect the right of any person or
    that person's successors in business who made, purchased, offered
    to sell, or used anything protected by the patent within the United
    States, or imported anything protected by the patent into the
    United States after the 6-month grace period but prior to the
    acceptance of a maintenance fee under this subsection, to continue
    the use of, to offer for sale, or to sell to others to be used,
    offered for sale, or sold, the specific thing so made, purchased,
    offered for sale, used, or imported. The court before which such
    matter is in question may provide for the continued manufacture,
    use, offer for sale, or sale of the thing made, purchased, offered
    for sale, or used within the United States, or imported into the
    United States, as specified, or for the manufacture, use, offer for
    sale, or sale in the United States of which substantial preparation
    was made after the 6-month grace period but before the acceptance
    of a maintenance fee under this subsection, and the court may also
    provide for the continued practice of any process that is
    practiced, or for the practice of which substantial preparation was
    made, after the 6-month grace period but before the acceptance of a
    maintenance fee under this subsection, to the extent and under such
    terms as the court deems equitable for the protection of
    investments made or business commenced after the 6-month grace
    period but before the acceptance of a maintenance fee under this
    subsection.
      (d) The Director shall establish fees for all other processing,
    services, or materials relating to patents not specified in this
    section to recover the estimated average cost to the Office of such
    processing, services, or materials, except that the Director shall
    charge the following fees for the following services:
        (1) For recording a document affecting title, $40 per property.
        (2) For each photocopy, $.25 per page.
        (3) For each black and white copy of a patent, $3.

    The yearly fee for providing a library specified in section 13 (!1)
    of this title with uncertified printed copies of the specifications
    and drawings for all patents in that year shall be $50.

      (e) The Director may waive the payment of any fee for any service
    or material related to patents in connection with an occasional or
    incidental request made by a department or agency of the
    Government, or any officer thereof. The Director may provide any
    applicant issued a notice under section 132 of this title with a
    copy of the specifications and drawings for all patents referred to
    in that notice without charge.
      (f) The fees established in subsections (a) and (b) of this
    section may be adjusted by the Director on October 1, 1992, and
    every year thereafter, to reflect any fluctuations occurring during
    the previous 12 months in the Consumer Price Index, as determined
    by the Secretary of Labor. Changes of less than 1 per centum may be
    ignored.
      (g) No fee established by the Director under this section shall
    take effect until at least 30 days after notice of the fee has been
    published in the Federal Register and in the Official Gazette of
    the Patent and Trademark Office.
      (h)(1) Fees charged under subsection (a) or (b) shall be reduced
    by 50 percent with respect to their application to any small
    business concern as defined under section 3 of the Small Business
    Act, and to any independent inventor or nonprofit organization as
    defined in regulations issued by the Director.
      (2) With respect to its application to any entity described in
    paragraph (1), any surcharge or fee charged under subsection (c) or
    (d) shall not be higher than the surcharge or fee required of any
    other entity under the same or substantially similar circumstances.
      (i)(1) The Director shall maintain, for use by the public, paper,
    microform, or electronic collections of United States patents,
    foreign patent documents, and United States trademark registrations
    arranged to permit search for and retrieval of information. The
    Director may not impose fees directly for the use of such
    collections, or for the use of the public patent or trademark
    search rooms or libraries.
      (2) The Director shall provide for the full deployment of the
    automated search systems of the Patent and Trademark Office so that
    such systems are available for use by the public, and shall assure
    full access by the public to, and dissemination of, patent and
    trademark information, using a variety of automated methods,
    including electronic bulletin boards and remote access by users to
    mass storage and retrieval systems.
      (3) The Director may establish reasonable fees for access by the
    public to the automated search systems of the Patent and Trademark
    Office. If such fees are established, a limited amount of free
    access shall be made available to users of the systems for purposes
    of education and training. The Director may waive the payment by an
    individual of fees authorized by this subsection upon a showing of
    need or hardship, and if such a waiver is in the public interest.
      (4) The Director shall submit to the Congress an annual report on
    the automated search systems of the Patent and Trademark Office and
    the access by the public to such systems. The Director shall also
    publish such report in the Federal Register. The Director shall
    provide an opportunity for the submission of comments by interested
    persons on each such report.

      Based on Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 31 (R.S. 4886, amended
    (1) Mar. 3, 1897, ch. 391, Sec. 1, 29 Stat. 692, (2) May 23, 1930,
    ch. 312, Sec. 1, 46 Stat. 376, (3) Aug. 5, 1939, ch. 450, Sec. 1,
    53 Stat. 1212).
      The corresponding section of existing statute is split into two
    sections, section 101 relating to the subject matter for which
    patents may be obtained, and section 102 defining statutory novelty
    and stating other conditions for patentability.
      Section 101 follows the wording of the existing statute as to the
    subject matter for patents, except that reference to plant patents
    has been omitted for incorporation in section 301 and the word
    "art" has been replaced by "process", which is defined in section
    100. The word "art" in the corresponding section of the existing
    statute has a different meaning than the same word as used in other
    places in the statute; it has been interpreted by the courts as
    being practically synonymous with process or method. "Process" has
    been used as its meaning is more readily grasped than "art" as
    interpreted, and the definition in section 100(b) makes it clear
    that "process or method" is meant. The remainder of the definition
    clarifies the status of processes or methods which involve merely
    the new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition
    of matter, or material; they are processes or methods under the
    statute and may be patented provided the conditions for
    patentability are satisfied.

      to patent

-STATUTE-
      A person shall be entitled to a patent unless - 
      (a) the invention was known or used by others in this country, or
    patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign
    country, before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent,
    or
      (b) the invention was patented or described in a printed
    publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on
    sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of the
    application for patent in the United States, or
      (c) he has abandoned the invention, or
      (d) the invention was first patented or caused to be patented, or
    was the subject of an inventor's certificate, by the applicant or
    his legal representatives or assigns in a foreign country prior to
    the date of the application for patent in this country on an
    application for patent or inventor's certificate filed more than
    twelve months before the filing of the application in the United
    States, or
      (e) the invention was described in (1) an application for patent,
    published under section 122(b), by another filed in the United
    States before the invention by the applicant for patent or (2) a
    patent granted on an application for patent by another filed in the
    United States before the invention by the applicant for patent,
    except that an international application filed under the treaty
    defined in section 351(a) shall have the effects for the purposes
    of this subsection of an application filed in the United States
    only if the international application designated the United States
    and was published under Article 21(2) of such treaty in the English
    language; (!1) or

      (f) he did not himself invent the subject matter sought to be
    patented, or
      (g)(1) during the course of an interference conducted under
    section 135 or section 291, another inventor involved therein
    establishes, to the extent permitted in section 104, that before
    such person's invention thereof the invention was made by such
    other inventor and not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed, or (2)
    before such person's invention thereof, the invention was made in
    this country by another inventor who had not abandoned, suppressed,
    or concealed it. In determining priority of invention under this
    subsection, there shall be considered not only the respective dates
    of conception and reduction to practice of the invention, but also
    the reasonable diligence of one who was first to conceive and last
    to reduce to practice, from a time prior to conception by the
    other.

      The section has been changed so that the prior foreign patent is
    not a bar unless it was granted before the filing of the
    application in the United States.
      Paragraph (e) is new and enacts the rule of Milburn v. Davis-
    Bournonville, 270 U.S. 390, by reason of which a United States
    patent disclosing an invention dates from the date of filing the
    application for the purpose of anticipating a subsequent inventor.
      Paragraph (f) indicates the necessity for the inventor as the
    party applying for patent. Subsequent sections permit certain
    persons to apply in place of the inventor under special
    circumstances.
      Paragraph (g) is derived from Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 69
    (R.S. 4920, amended (1) Mar. 3, 1897, ch. 391, Sec. 2, 29 Stat.
    692, (2) Aug. 5, 1939, ch. 450, Sec. 1, 53 Stat. 1212), the second
    defense recited in this section. This paragraph retains the present
    rules of law governing the determination of priority of invention.
      Language relating specifically to designs is omitted for
    inclusion in subsequent sections.

      filed under the treaty defined in section 351(a) shall have the
      effect under this subsection of a national application published
      under section 122(b) only if the international application
      designating the United States was published under Article
      21(2)(a) of such treaty in the English language; or
        "(2) a patent granted on an application for patent by another

    invention was made in this country by another who had not
    abandoned, suppressed, or concealed it. In determining priority of
    invention there shall be considered not only the respective dates
    of conception and reduction to practice of the invention, but also
    the reasonable diligence of one who was first to conceive and last
    to reduce to practice, from a time prior to conception by the
    other."
      1975 - Par. (e). Pub. L. 94-131 inserted provision for

    CHAPTER 10 - PATENTABILITY OF INVENTIONS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 103. Conditions for patentability; non-obvious subject matter

-STATUTE-
      (a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not
    identically disclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of
    this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to
    be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a
    whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to
    a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject
    matter pertains. Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner
    in which the invention was made.
      (b)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a), and upon timely election
    by the applicant for patent to proceed under this subsection, a
    biotechnological process using or resulting in a composition of
    matter that is novel under section 102 and nonobvious under
    subsection (a) of this section shall be considered nonobvious if - 
        (A) claims to the process and the composition of matter are
      contained in either the same application for patent or in
      separate applications having the same effective filing date; and
        (B) the composition of matter, and the process at the time it
      was invented, were owned by the same person or subject to an
      obligation of assignment to the same person.

      (2) A patent issued on a process under paragraph (1) - 
        (A) shall also contain the claims to the composition of matter
      used in or made by that process, or
        (B) shall, if such composition of matter is claimed in another
      patent, be set to expire on the same date as such other patent,
      notwithstanding section 154.

      (3) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term "biotechnological
    process" means - 
        (A) a process of genetically altering or otherwise inducing a
      single- or multi-celled organism to - 
          (i) express an exogenous nucleotide sequence,
          (ii) inhibit, eliminate, augment, or alter expression of an
        endogenous nucleotide sequence, or
          (iii) express a specific physiological characteristic not
        naturally associated with said organism;

        (B) cell fusion procedures yielding a cell line that expresses
      a specific protein, such as a monoclonal antibody; and
        (C) a method of using a product produced by a process defined
      by subparagraph (A) or (B), or a combination of subparagraphs (A)
      and (B).

      (c)(1) Subject matter developed by another person, which
    qualifies as prior art only under one or more of subsections (e),
    (f), and (g) of section 102 of this title, shall not preclude
    patentability under this section where the subject matter and the
    claimed invention were, at the time the claimed invention was made,
    owned by the same person or subject to an obligation of assignment
    to the same person.
      (2) For purposes of this subsection, subject matter developed by
    another person and a claimed invention shall be deemed to have been
    owned by the same person or subject to an obligation of assignment
    to the same person if - 
        (A) the claimed invention was made by or on behalf of parties
      to a joint research agreement that was in effect on or before the
      date the claimed invention was made;
        (B) the claimed invention was made as a result of activities
      undertaken within the scope of the joint research agreement; and
        (C) the application for patent for the claimed invention
      discloses or is amended to disclose the names of the parties to
      the joint research agreement.

      (3) For purposes of paragraph (2), the term "joint research
    agreement" means a written contract, grant, or cooperative
    agreement entered into by two or more persons or entities for the
    performance of experimental, developmental, or research work in the
    field of the claimed invention.

-MISC1-
                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   
      There is no provision corresponding to the first sentence
    explicitly stated in the present statutes, but the refusal of
    patents by the Patent Office, and the holding of patents invalid by
    the courts, on the ground of lack of invention or lack of
    patentable novelty has been followed since at least as early as
    1850. This paragraph is added with the view that an explicit
    statement in the statute may have some stabilizing effect, and also
    to serve as a basis for the addition at a later time of some
    criteria which may be worked out.
      The second sentence states that patentability as to this
    requirement is not to be negatived by the manner in which the
    invention was made, that is, it is immaterial whether it resulted
    from long toil and experimentation or from a flash of genius.

                                AMENDMENTS                            
      2004 - Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 108-453 amended subsec. (c)

    prior art only under one or more of subsections (e), (f), and (g)
    of section 102 of this title, shall not preclude patentability
    under this section where the subject matter and the claimed
    invention were, at the time the invention was made, owned by the
    same person or subject to an obligation of assignment to the same
    person."
      1999 - Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 106-113 substituted "one or more of
    subsections (e), (f), and (g)" for "subsection (f) or (g)".

    date of enactment, including (in either case) an application for
    the reissuance of a patent."

                     EFFECTIVE DATE OF 1984 AMENDMENT                 
      Section 106 of Pub. L. 98-622 provided that:
      "(a) Subject to subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this
    section, the amendments made by this Act [probably should be "this
    title", meaning title I of Pub. L. 98-622, enacting section 157 of

    1984].
      "(d) No United States patent granted before the date of enactment
    of this Act [Nov. 8, 1984] shall abridge or affect the right of any
    person or his successors in business who made, purchased, or used
    prior to such effective date anything protected by the patent, to
    continue the use of, or to sell to others to be used or sold, the
    specific thing so made, purchased, or used, if the patent claims
    were invalid or otherwise unenforceable on a ground obviated by
    section 103 or 104 of this Act [amending this section and sections
    116 and 120 of this title] and the person made, purchased, or used

    Sec. 112. Specification

-STATUTE-
      The specification shall contain a written description of the
    invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in
    such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person
    skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most
    nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the
    best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his
    invention.
      The specification shall conclude with one or more claims
    particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject
    matter which the applicant regards as his invention.
      A claim may be written in independent or, if the nature of the
    case admits, in dependent or multiple dependent form.
      Subject to the following paragraph, a claim in dependent form
    shall contain a reference to a claim previously set forth and then
    specify a further limitation of the subject matter claimed. A claim
    in dependent form shall be construed to incorporate by reference
    all the limitations of the claim to which it refers.
      A claim in multiple dependent form shall contain a reference, in
    the alternative only, to more than one claim previously set forth
    and then specify a further limitation of the subject matter
    claimed. A multiple dependent claim shall not serve as a basis for
    any other multiple dependent claim. A multiple dependent claim
    shall be construed to incorporate by reference all the limitations
    of the particular claim in relation to which it is being
    considered.
      An element in a claim for a combination may be expressed as a
    means or step for performing a specified function without the
    recital of structure, material, or acts in support thereof, and
    such claim shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure,
    material, or acts described in the specification and equivalents
    thereof.

      The clause relating to machines is omitted as unnecessary and the
    requirement for disclosing the best mode of carrying out the
    invention is stated as generally applicable to all types of
    invention (derived from Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 69, first
    defense).
      The clause relating to the claim is made a separate paragraph to
    emphasize the distinction between the description and the claim or
    definition, and the language is modified.

    writing of claims, if the nature of the case admits, in dependent
    or multiple dependent form for prior provision for writing claims
    in dependent form, required claims in dependent form to contain a
    reference to a claim previously set forth and then specify a
    further limitation of the subject matter claimed, substituted text
    respecting construction of a claim in dependent form so as to
    incorporate by reference all the limitations of the claim to which
    it refers for prior text for construction of a dependent claim to
    include all the limitations of the claim incorporated by reference
    into the dependent claim, and inserted paragraph respecting certain
    requirements for claims in multiple dependent form.
      1965 - Pub. L. 89-83 permitted a claim to be written in

    may require its submission within a time period of not less than
    two months from the sending of a notice thereof. Drawings submitted
    after the filing date of the application may not be used (i) to
    overcome any insufficiency of the specification due to lack of an
    enabling disclosure or otherwise inadequate disclosure therein, or
    (ii) to supplement the original disclosure thereof for the purpose
    of interpretation of the scope of any claim.

    country, before any diplomatic or consular officer of the United
    States authorized to administer oaths, or before any officer having
    an official seal and authorized to administer oaths in the foreign
    country in which the applicant may be, whose authority is proved by
    certificate of a diplomatic or consular officer of the United
    States, or apostille of an official designated by a foreign country
    which, by treaty or convention, accords like effect to apostilles
    of designated officials in the United States, and such oath shall
    be valid if it complies with the laws of the state or country where
    made. When the application is made as provided in this title by a
    person other than the inventor, the oath may be so varied in form
    that it can be made by him. For purposes of this section, a
    consular officer shall include any United States citizen serving

-STATUTE-
      When an invention is made by two or more persons jointly, they
    shall apply for patent jointly and each make the required oath,
    except as otherwise provided in this title. Inventors may apply for
    a patent jointly even though (1) they did not physically work
    together or at the same time, (2) each did not make the same type
    or amount of contribution, or (3) each did not make a contribution
    to the subject matter of every claim of the patent.
      If a joint inventor refuses to join in an application for patent
    or cannot be found or reached after diligent effort, the
    application may be made by the other inventor on behalf of himself
    and the omitted inventor. The Director, on proof of the pertinent
    facts and after such notice to the omitted inventor as he
    prescribes, may grant a patent to the inventor making the
    application, subject to the same rights which the omitted inventor
    would have had if he had been joined. The omitted inventor may
    subsequently join in the application.
      Whenever through error a person is named in an application for
    patent as the inventor, or through error an inventor is not named
    in an application, and such error arose without any deceptive
    intention on his part, the Director may permit the application to
    be amended accordingly, under such terms as he prescribes.

    the pertinent facts and a showing that such action is necessary to
    preserve the rights of the parties or to prevent irreparable
    damage; and the Director may grant a patent to such inventor upon
    such notice to him as the Director deems sufficient, and on
    compliance with such regulations as he prescribes.

    TITLE 35 - PATENTS
    PART II - PATENTABILITY OF INVENTIONS AND GRANT OF PATENTS
    CHAPTER 11 - APPLICATION FOR PATENT

-HEAD-
    Sec. 119. Benefit of earlier filing date; right of priority

-STATUTE-
      (a) An application for patent for an invention filed in this
    country by any person who has, or whose legal representatives or
    assigns have, previously regularly filed an application for a
    patent for the same invention in a foreign country which affords
    similar privileges in the case of applications filed in the United
    States or to citizens of the United States, or in a WTO member
    country, shall have the same effect as the same application would
    have if filed in this country on the date on which the application
    for patent for the same invention was first filed in such foreign
    country, if the application in this country is filed within twelve
    months from the earliest date on which such foreign application was
    filed; but no patent shall be granted on any application for patent
    for an invention which had been patented or described in a printed
    publication in any country more than one year before the date of
    the actual filing of the application in this country, or which had
    been in public use or on sale in this country more than one year
    prior to such filing.
      (b)(1) No application for patent shall be entitled to this right
    of priority unless a claim is filed in the Patent and Trademark
    Office, identifying the foreign application by specifying the
    application number on that foreign application, the intellectual
    property authority or country in or for which the application was
    filed, and the date of filing the application, at such time during
    the pendency of the application as required by the Director.
      (2) The Director may consider the failure of the applicant to
    file a timely claim for priority as a waiver of any such claim. The
    Director may establish procedures, including the payment of a
    surcharge, to accept an unintentionally delayed claim under this
    section.
      (3) The Director may require a certified copy of the original
    foreign application, specification, and drawings upon which it is
    based, a translation if not in the English language, and such other
    information as the Director considers necessary. Any such
    certification shall be made by the foreign intellectual property
    authority in which the foreign application was filed and show the
    date of the application and of the filing of the specification and
    other papers.
      (c) In like manner and subject to the same conditions and
    requirements, the right provided in this section may be based upon
    a subsequent regularly filed application in the same foreign
    country instead of the first filed foreign application, provided
    that any foreign application filed prior to such subsequent
    application has been withdrawn, abandoned, or otherwise disposed
    of, without having been laid open to public inspection and without
    leaving any rights outstanding, and has not served, nor thereafter
    shall serve, as a basis for claiming a right of priority.
      (d) Applications for inventors' certificates filed in a foreign
    country in which applicants have a right to apply, at their
    discretion, either for a patent or for an inventor's certificate
    shall be treated in this country in the same manner and have the
    same effect for purpose of the right of priority under this section
    as applications for patents, subject to the same conditions and
    requirements of this section as apply to applications for patents,
    provided such applicants are entitled to the benefits of the
    Stockholm Revision of the Paris Convention at the time of such
    filing.
      (e)(1) An application for patent filed under section 111(a) or
    section 363 of this title for an invention disclosed in the manner
    provided by the first paragraph of section 112 of this title in a
    provisional application filed under section 111(b) of this title,
    by an inventor or inventors named in the provisional application,
    shall have the same effect, as to such invention, as though filed
    on the date of the provisional application filed under section
    111(b) of this title, if the application for patent filed under
    section 111(a) or section 363 of this title is filed not later than
    12 months after the date on which the provisional application was
    filed and if it contains or is amended to contain a specific
    reference to the provisional application. No application shall be
    entitled to the benefit of an earlier filed provisional application
    under this subsection unless an amendment containing the specific
    reference to the earlier filed provisional application is submitted
    at such time during the pendency of the application as required by
    the Director. The Director may consider the failure to submit such
    an amendment within that time period as a waiver of any benefit
    under this subsection. The Director may establish procedures,
    including the payment of a surcharge, to accept an unintentionally
    delayed submission of an amendment under this subsection during the
    pendency of the application.
      (2) A provisional application filed under section 111(b) of this
    title may not be relied upon in any proceeding in the Patent and
    Trademark Office unless the fee set forth in subparagraph (A) or
    (C) of section 41(a)(1) of this title has been paid.
      (3) If the day that is 12 months after the filing date of a
    provisional application falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal
    holiday within the District of Columbia, the period of pendency of
    the provisional application shall be extended to the next
    succeeding secular or business day.
      (f) Applications for plant breeder's rights filed in a WTO member
    country (or in a foreign UPOV Contracting Party) shall have the
    same effect for the purpose of the right of priority under
    subsections (a) through (c) of this section as applications for
    patents, subject to the same conditions and requirements of this
    section as apply to applications for patents.
      (g) As used in this section - 
        (1) the term "WTO member country" has the same meaning as the
      term is defined in section 104(b)(2) of this title; and
        (2) the term "UPOV Contracting Party" means a member of the
      International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of
      Plants.

      The second paragraph is new, making an additional procedural
    requirement for obtaining the right of priority. Copies of the
    foreign papers on which the right of priority is based are required
    so that the record of the United States patent will be complete in
    this country.

    earlier filed application under this section unless an amendment
    containing the specific reference to the earlier filed application
    is submitted at such time during the pendency of the application as
    required by the Director. The Director may consider the failure to
    submit such an amendment within that time period as a waiver of any
    benefit under this section. The Director may establish procedures,
    including the payment of a surcharge, to accept an unintentionally
    delayed submission of an amendment under this section.

    Sec. 121. Divisional applications

-STATUTE-
      If two or more independent and distinct inventions are claimed in
    one application, the Director may require the application to be
    restricted to one of the inventions. If the other invention is made
    the subject of a divisional application which complies with the
    requirements of section 120 of this title it shall be entitled to
    the benefit of the filing date of the original application. A
    patent issuing on an application with respect to which a
    requirement for restriction under this section has been made, or on
    an application filed as a result of such a requirement, shall not
    be used as a reference either in the Patent and Trademark Office or
    in the courts against a divisional application or against the
    original application or any patent issued on either of them, if the
    divisional application is filed before the issuance of the patent
    on the other application. If a divisional application is directed
    solely to subject matter described and claimed in the original
    application as filed, the Director may dispense with signing and
    execution by the inventor. The validity of a patent shall not be
    questioned for failure of the Director to require the application
    to be restricted to one invention.

      This section enacts as law existing practice with respect to
    division, at the same time introducing a number of changes.
    Division is made discretionary with the Commissioner. The
    requirements of section 120 are made applicable and neither of the
    resulting patents can be held invalid over the other merely because
    of their being divided in several patents. In some cases a
    divisional application may be filed by the assignee.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 122. Confidential status of applications; publication of
      patent applications

-STATUTE-
      (a) Confidentiality. - Except as provided in subsection (b),
    applications for patents shall be kept in confidence by the Patent
    and Trademark Office and no information concerning the same given
    without authority of the applicant or owner unless necessary to
    carry out the provisions of an Act of Congress or in such special
    circumstances as may be determined by the Director.
      (b) Publication. - 
        (1) In general. - (A) Subject to paragraph (2), each
      application for a patent shall be published, in accordance with
      procedures determined by the Director, promptly after the
      expiration of a period of 18 months from the earliest filing date
      for which a benefit is sought under this title. At the request of
      the applicant, an application may be published earlier than the
      end of such 18-month period.
        (B) No information concerning published patent applications
      shall be made available to the public except as the Director
      determines.
        (C) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a determination
      by the Director to release or not to release information
      concerning a published patent application shall be final and
      nonreviewable.
        (2) Exceptions. - (A) An application shall not be published if
      that application is - 
          (i) no longer pending;
          (ii) subject to a secrecy order under section 181 of this
        title;
          (iii) a provisional application filed under section 111(b) of
        this title; or
          (iv) an application for a design patent filed under chapter
        16 of this title.

        (B)(i) If an applicant makes a request upon filing, certifying
      that the invention disclosed in the application has not and will
      not be the subject of an application filed in another country, or
      under a multilateral international agreement, that requires
      publication of applications 18 months after filing, the
      application shall not be published as provided in paragraph (1).
        (ii) An applicant may rescind a request made under clause (i)
      at any time.
        (iii) An applicant who has made a request under clause (i) but
      who subsequently files, in a foreign country or under a
      multilateral international agreement specified in clause (i), an
      application directed to the invention disclosed in the
      application filed in the Patent and Trademark Office, shall
      notify the Director of such filing not later than 45 days after
      the date of the filing of such foreign or international
      application. A failure of the applicant to provide such notice
      within the prescribed period shall result in the application
      being regarded as abandoned, unless it is shown to the
      satisfaction of the Director that the delay in submitting the
      notice was unintentional.
        (iv) If an applicant rescinds a request made under clause (i)
      or notifies the Director that an application was filed in a
      foreign country or under a multilateral international agreement
      specified in clause (i), the application shall be published in
      accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) on or as soon as
      is practical after the date that is specified in clause (i).
        (v) If an applicant has filed applications in one or more
      foreign countries, directly or through a multilateral
      international agreement, and such foreign filed applications
      corresponding to an application filed in the Patent and Trademark
      Office or the description of the invention in such foreign filed
      applications is less extensive than the application or
      description of the invention in the application filed in the
      Patent and Trademark Office, the applicant may submit a redacted
      copy of the application filed in the Patent and Trademark Office
      eliminating any part or description of the invention in such
      application that is not also contained in any of the
      corresponding applications filed in a foreign country. The
      Director may only publish the redacted copy of the application
      unless the redacted copy of the application is not received
      within 16 months after the earliest effective filing date for
      which a benefit is sought under this title. The provisions of
      section 154(d) shall not apply to a claim if the description of
      the invention published in the redacted application filed under
      this clause with respect to the claim does not enable a person
      skilled in the art to make and use the subject matter of the
      claim.

      (c) Protest and Pre-Issuance Opposition. - The Director shall
    establish appropriate procedures to ensure that no protest or other
    form of pre-issuance opposition to the grant of a patent on an
    application may be initiated after publication of the application
    without the express written consent of the applicant.
      (d) National Security. - No application for patent shall be
    published under subsection (b)(1) if the publication or disclosure
    of such invention would be detrimental to the national security.
    The Director shall establish appropriate procedures to ensure that
    such applications are promptly identified and the secrecy of such
    inventions is maintained in accordance with chapter 17 of this
    title.

    PART II - PATENTABILITY OF INVENTIONS AND GRANT OF PATENTS
    CHAPTER 12 - EXAMINATION OF APPLICATION

-HEAD-
    Sec. 135. Interferences

-STATUTE-
      (a) Whenever an application is made for a patent which, in the
    opinion of the Director, would interfere with any pending
    application, or with any unexpired patent, an interference may be
    declared and the Director shall give notice of such declaration to
    the applicants, or applicant and patentee, as the case may be. The
    Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences shall determine questions
    of priority of the inventions and may determine questions of
    patentability. Any final decision, if adverse to the claim of an
    applicant, shall constitute the final refusal by the Patent and
    Trademark Office of the claims involved, and the Director may issue
    a patent to the applicant who is adjudged the prior inventor. A
    final judgment adverse to a patentee from which no appeal or other
    review has been or can be taken or had shall constitute
    cancellation of the claims involved in the patent, and notice of
    such cancellation shall be endorsed on copies of the patent
    distributed after such cancellation by the Patent and Trademark
    Office.
      (b)(1) A claim which is the same as, or for the same or
    substantially the same subject matter as, a claim of an issued
    patent may not be made in any application unless such a claim is
    made prior to one year from the date on which the patent was
    granted.
      (2) A claim which is the same as, or for the same or
    substantially the same subject matter as, a claim of an application
    published under section 122(b) of this title may be made in an
    application filed after the application is published only if the
    claim is made before 1 year after the date on which the application
    is published.
      (c) Any agreement or understanding between parties to an
    interference, including any collateral agreements referred to
    therein, made in connection with or in contemplation of the
    termination of the interference, shall be in writing and a true
    copy thereof filed in the Patent and Trademark Office before the
    termination of the interference as between the said parties to the
    agreement or understanding. If any party filing the same so
    requests, the copy shall be kept separate from the file of the
    interference, and made available only to Government agencies on
    written request, or to any person on a showing of good cause.
    Failure to file the copy of such agreement or understanding shall
    render permanently unenforceable such agreement or understanding
    and any patent of such parties involved in the interference or any
    patent subsequently issued on any application of such parties so
    involved. The Director may, however, on a showing of good cause for
    failure to file within the time prescribed, permit the filing of
    the agreement or understanding during the six-month period
    subsequent to the termination of the interference as between the
    parties to the agreement or understanding.
      The Director shall give notice to the parties or their attorneys
    of record, a reasonable time prior to said termination, of the
    filing requirement of this section. If the Director gives such
    notice at a later time, irrespective of the right to file such
    agreement or understanding within the six-month period on a showing
    of good cause, the parties may file such agreement or understanding
    within sixty days of the receipt of such notice.
      Any discretionary action of the Director under this subsection
    shall be reviewable under section 10 of the Administrative
    Procedure Act.
      (d) Parties to a patent interference, within such time as may be
    specified by the Director by regulation, may determine such contest
    or any aspect thereof by arbitration. Such arbitration shall be
    governed by the provisions of title 9 to the extent such title is
    not inconsistent with this section. The parties shall give notice
    of any arbitration award to the Director, and such award shall, as
    between the parties to the arbitration, be dispositive of the
    issues to which it relates. The arbitration award shall be
    unenforceable until such notice is given. Nothing in this
    subsection shall preclude the Director from determining
    patentability of the invention involved in the interference.

-STATUTE-
      Any party to an interference dissatisfied with the decision of
    the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences on the interference,
    may have remedy by civil action, if commenced within such time
    after such decision, not less than sixty days, as the Director
    appoints or as provided in section 141 of this title, unless he has
    appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
    Circuit, and such appeal is pending or has been decided. In such
    suits the record in the Patent and Trademark Office shall be
    admitted on motion of either party upon the terms and conditions as
    to costs, expenses, and the further cross-examination of the
    witnesses as the court imposes, without prejudice to the right of
    the parties to take further testimony. The testimony and exhibits
    of the record in the Patent and Trademark Office when admitted
    shall have the same effect as if originally taken and produced in
    the suit.
      Such suit may be instituted against the party in interest as
    shown by the records of the Patent and Trademark Office at the time
    of the decision complained of, but any party in interest may become
    a party to the action. If there be adverse parties residing in a
    plurality of districts not embraced within the same state, or an
    adverse party residing in a foreign country, the United States
    District Court for the District of Columbia shall have jurisdiction
    and may issue summons against the adverse parties directed to the
    marshal of any district in which any adverse party resides. Summons
    against adverse parties residing in foreign countries may be served
    by publication or otherwise as the court directs. The Director
    shall not be a necessary party but he shall be notified of the
    filing of the suit by the clerk of the court in which it is filed
    and shall have the right to intervene. Judgment of the court in
    favor of the right of an applicant to a patent shall authorize the
    Director to issue such patent on the filing in the Patent and
    Trademark Office of a certified copy of the judgment and on
    compliance with the requirements of law.

    Sec. 151. Issue of patent

-STATUTE-
      If it appears that applicant is entitled to a patent under the
    law, a written notice of allowance of the application shall be
    given or mailed to the applicant. The notice shall specify a sum,
    constituting the issue fee or a portion thereof, which shall be
    paid within three months thereafter.
      Upon payment of this sum the patent shall issue, but if payment
    is not timely made, the application shall be regarded as abandoned.
      Any remaining balance of the issue fee shall be paid within three
    months from the sending of a notice thereof and, if not paid, the
    patent shall lapse at the termination of this three-month period.
    In calculating the amount of a remaining balance, charges for a
    page or less may be disregarded.
      If any payment required by this section is not timely made, but
    is submitted with the fee for delayed payment and the delay in
    payment is shown to have been unavoidable, it may be accepted by
    the Director as though no abandonment or lapse had ever occurred.

         ACCEPTANCE OF LATE PAYMENT OF ISSUE FEES BY COMMISSIONER     
      Section 4(a) of Pub. L. 93-601 provided that: "The Commissioner
    of Patents [now Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual
    Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark
    Office] may, in accordance with Section 3 of this Act [amending
    this section], accept late payment of issue fees, the payment of
    which was governed by the provisions of Public Law 89-93 [probably
    should refer to Public Law 89-83, which amended sections 41, 112,
    and 151 of this title and section 1113 of Title 15, Commerce and
    Trade]; Provided: the term of the patent for which late payment of
    such an issue fee is accepted shall expire earlier than the time
    specified in Section 154 of Title 35, United States Code by a
    period equal to the delay between the time the application became
    abandoned or the patent lapsed for failure to pay the issue fee and
    the time the late payment is accepted after enactment of this Act
    [Jan. 2, 1975]; Further Provided: no patent with respect to which
    the issue fee was governed by the provisions of PL 89-83 and for
    which a late payment of the issue fee is accepted under the
    authority created by Section 3 of this Act, shall abridge or affect
    the right of any person or his successors in business who made,
    purchased or used anything covered by the patent, after the date of
    the application became abandoned or patent lapsed for failure to
    pay the issue fee but prior to the grant or restoration of the
    patent, to continue the use of or to sell to others to be used or
    sold, the specific thing so made, purchased, or used. A court
    before which such matter is in question may provide for the
    continued manufacture, use or sale of the thing made, purchased or
    used as specified, or for the manufacture, use or sale of which
    substantial preparation was made after the date the application
    became abandoned or patent lapsed for failure to pay the fee but
    prior to the grant or restoration of the patent, and it may also
    provide for the continued practice of any process covered by the
    patent, practiced, or for the practice of which substantial
    preparation was made, after the date the application became
    abandoned or patent lapsed for failure to pay the issue fee but
    prior to the grant or restoration of the patent, to the extent and
    under such terms as the court deems equitable for the protection of
    investments made or business commenced before the grant or
    restoration of the patent."

      such grant shall be for a term beginning on the date on which the

            (i) provide at least one of the notifications under section
          132 of this title or a notice of allowance under section 151

        in such clause is taken.
          (B) Guarantee of no more than 3-year application pendency. -
        Subject to the limitations under paragraph (2), if the issue of

        years after the actual filing date of the application in the
        United States, not including -

          Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences or by a Federal
          court; or
            (iii) any delay in the processing of the application by the
          United States Patent and Trademark Office requested by the
          applicant except as permitted by paragraph (3)(C),

        the term of the patent shall be extended 1 day for each day

          (C) Guarantee or adjustments for delays due to interferences,
        secrecy orders, and appeals. - Subject to the limitations under
        paragraph (2), if the issue of an original patent is delayed

            (i) a proceeding under section 135(a);
            (ii) the imposition of an order under section 181; or
            (iii) appellate review by the Board of Patent Appeals and
          Interferences or by a Federal court in a case in which the
          patent was issued under a decision in the review reversing an
          adverse determination of patentability,

        the term of the patent shall be extended 1 day for each day of
        the pendency of the proceeding, order, or review, as the case
        may be.

        (2) Limitations. - 
          (A) In general. - To the extent that periods of delay
        attributable to grounds specified in paragraph (1) overlap, the
        period of any adjustment granted under this subsection shall
        not exceed the actual number of days the issuance of the patent
        was delayed.
          (B) Disclaimed term. - No patent the term of which has been
        disclaimed beyond a specified date may be adjusted under this
        section beyond the expiration date specified in the disclaimer.
          (C) Reduction of period of adjustment. - 
            (i) The period of adjustment of the term of a patent under
          paragraph (1) shall be reduced by a period equal to the
          period of time during which the applicant failed to engage in
          reasonable efforts to conclude prosecution of the
          application.
            (ii) With respect to adjustments to patent term made under
          the authority of paragraph (1)(B), an applicant shall be
          deemed to have failed to engage in reasonable efforts to
          conclude processing or examination of an application for the
          cumulative total of any periods of time in excess of 3 months
          that are taken to respond to a notice from the Office making
          any rejection, objection, argument, or other request,
          measuring such 3-month period from the date the notice was

        Director, and the Director shall thereafter alter the term of

      Notwithstanding the provisions of section 154, the term of a
    patent which encompasses within its scope a composition of matter
    or a process for using such composition shall be extended if such
    composition or process has been subjected to a regulatory review by
    the Federal Food and Drug Administration pursuant to the Federal
    Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act leading to the publication of
    regulation permitting the interstate distribution and sale of such
    composition or process and for which there has thereafter been a
    stay of regulation of approval imposed pursuant to section 409 of
    the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act which stay was in effect
    on January 1, 1981, by a length of time to be measured from the
    date such stay of regulation of approval was imposed until such
    proceedings are finally resolved and commercial marketing
    permitted. The patentee, his heirs, successors or assigns shall
    notify the Director within ninety days of the date of enactment of
    this section or the date the stay of regulation of approval has
    been removed, whichever is later, of the number of the patent to be
    extended and the date the stay was imposed and the date commercial
    marketing was permitted. On receipt of such notice, the Director
    shall promptly issue to the owner of record of the patent a
    certificate of extension, under seal, stating the fact and length
    of the extension and identifying the composition of matter or
    process for using such composition to which such extension is
    applicable. Such certificate shall be recorded in the official file
    of each patent extended and such certificate shall be considered as
    part of the original patent, and an appropriate notice shall be
    published in the Official Gazette of the Patent and Trademark
    Office.

    Sec. 156. Extension of patent term

-STATUTE-
      (a) The term of a patent which claims a product, a method of
    using a product, or a method of manufacturing a product shall be
    extended in accordance with this section from the original
    expiration date of the patent, which shall include any patent term
    adjustment granted under section 154(b), if - 
        (1) the term of the patent has not expired before an
      application is submitted under subsection (d)(1) for its
      extension;
        (2) the term of the patent has never been extended under
      subsection (e)(1) of this section;
        (3) an application for extension is submitted by the owner of
      record of the patent or its agent and in accordance with the
      requirements of paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (d);
        (4) the product has been subject to a regulatory review period
      before its commercial marketing or use;
        (5)(A) except as provided in subparagraph (B) or (C), the
      permission for the commercial marketing or use of the product
      after such regulatory review period is the first permitted
      commercial marketing or use of the product under the provision of
      law under which such regulatory review period occurred;
        (B) in the case of a patent which claims a method of
      manufacturing the product which primarily uses recombinant DNA
      technology in the manufacture of the product, the permission for
      the commercial marketing or use of the product after such
      regulatory review period is the first permitted commercial
      marketing or use of a product manufactured under the process
      claimed in the patent; or
        (C) for purposes of subparagraph (A), in the case of a patent
      which - 
          (i) claims a new animal drug or a veterinary biological
        product which (I) is not covered by the claims in any other
        patent which has been extended, and (II) has received
        permission for the commercial marketing or use in non-food-
        producing animals and in food-producing animals, and
          (ii) was not extended on the basis of the regulatory review
        period for use in non-food-producing animals,

      the permission for the commercial marketing or use of the drug or
      product after the regulatory review period for use in food-
      producing animals is the first permitted commercial marketing or
      use of the drug or product for administration to a food-producing
      animal.

    The product referred to in paragraphs (4) and (5) is hereinafter in
    this section referred to as the "approved product".
      (b) Except as provided in subsection (d)(5)(F), the rights
    derived from any patent the term of which is extended under this
    section shall during the period during which the term of the patent
    is extended - 
        (1) in the case of a patent which claims a product, be limited
      to any use approved for the product - 
          (A) before the expiration of the term of the patent - 
            (i) under the provision of law under which the applicable
          regulatory review occurred, or
            (ii) under the provision of law under which any regulatory
          review described in paragraph (1), (4), or (5) of subsection
          (g) occurred, and

          (B) on or after the expiration of the regulatory review
        period upon which the extension of the patent was based;

        (2) in the case of a patent which claims a method of using a
      product, be limited to any use claimed by the patent and approved
      for the product - 
          (A) before the expiration of the term of the patent - 
            (i) under any provision of law under which an applicable
          regulatory review occurred, and
            (ii) under the provision of law under which any regulatory
          review described in paragraph (1), (4), or (5) of subsection
          (g) occurred, and

          (B) on or after the expiration of the regulatory review
        period upon which the extension of the patent was based; and

        (3) in the case of a patent which claims a method of
      manufacturing a product, be limited to the method of
      manufacturing as used to make - 
          (A) the approved product, or
          (B) the product if it has been subject to a regulatory review
        period described in paragraph (1), (4), or (5) of subsection
        (g).

    As used in this subsection, the term "product" includes an approved
    product.
      (c) The term of a patent eligible for extension under subsection
    (a) shall be extended by the time equal to the regulatory review
    period for the approved product which period occurs after the date
    the patent is issued, except that - 
        (1) each period of the regulatory review period shall be
      reduced by any period determined under subsection (d)(2)(B)
      during which the applicant for the patent extension did not act
      with due diligence during such period of the regulatory review
      period;
        (2) after any reduction required by paragraph (1), the period
      of extension shall include only one-half of the time remaining in
      the periods described in paragraphs (1)(B)(i), (2)(B)(i),
      (3)(B)(i), (4)(B)(i), and (5)(B)(i) of subsection (g);
        (3) if the period remaining in the term of a patent after the
      date of the approval of the approved product under the provision
      of law under which such regulatory review occurred when added to
      the regulatory review period as revised under paragraphs (1) and
      (2) exceeds fourteen years, the period of extension shall be
      reduced so that the total of both such periods does not exceed
      fourteen years; and
        (4) in no event shall more than one patent be extended under
      subsection (e)(1) for the same regulatory review period for any
      product.

      (d)(1) To obtain an extension of the term of a patent under this
    section, the owner of record of the patent or its agent shall
    submit an application to the Director. Except as provided in
    paragraph (5), such an application may only be submitted within the
    sixty-day period beginning on the date the product received
    permission under the provision of law under which the applicable
    regulatory review period occurred for commercial marketing or use.
    The application shall contain - 
        (A) the identity of the approved product and the Federal
      statute under which regulatory review occurred;
        (B) the identity of the patent for which an extension is being
      sought and the identity of each claim of such patent which claims
      the approved product or a method of using or manufacturing the
      approved product;
        (C) information to enable the Director to determine under
      subsections (a) and (b) the eligibility of a patent for extension
      and the rights that will be derived from the extension and
      information to enable the Director and the Secretary of Health
      and Human Services or the Secretary of Agriculture to determine
      the period of the extension under subsection (g);
        (D) a brief description of the activities undertaken by the
      applicant during the applicable regulatory review period with
      respect to the approved product and the significant dates
      applicable to such activities; and
        (E) such patent or other information as the Director may
      require.

      (2)(A) Within 60 days of the submittal of an application for
    extension of the term of a patent under paragraph (1), the Director
    shall notify - 
        (i) the Secretary of Agriculture if the patent claims a drug
      product or a method of using or manufacturing a drug product and
      the drug product is subject to the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act, and
        (ii) the Secretary of Health and Human Services if the patent
      claims any other drug product, a medical device, or a food
      additive or color additive or a method of using or manufacturing
      such a product, device, or additive and if the product, device,
      and additive are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
      Act,

    of the extension application and shall submit to the Secretary who
    is so notified a copy of the application. Not later than 30 days
    after the receipt of an application from the Director, the
    Secretary receiving the application shall review the dates
    contained in the application pursuant to paragraph (1)(C) and
    determine the applicable regulatory review period, shall notify the
    Director of the determination, and shall publish in the Federal
    Register a notice of such determination.
      (B)(i) If a petition is submitted to the Secretary making the
    determination under subparagraph (A), not later than 180 days after
    the publication of the determination under subparagraph (A), upon
    which it may reasonably be determined that the applicant did not
    act with due diligence during the applicable regulatory review
    period, the Secretary making the determination shall, in accordance
    with regulations promulgated by such Secretary, determine if the
    applicant acted with due diligence during the applicable regulatory
    review period. The Secretary making the determination shall make
    such determination not later than 90 days after the receipt of such
    a petition. For a drug product, device, or additive subject to the
    Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or the Public Health Service
    Act, the Secretary may not delegate the authority to make the
    determination prescribed by this clause to an office below the
    Office of the Director (!1) of Food and Drugs. For a product
    subject to the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act, the Secretary of Agriculture

    person may request, within the 60-day period beginning on the
    publication of a determination, the Secretary making the
    determination to hold an informal hearing on the determination. If
    such a request is made within such period, such Secretary shall
    hold such hearing not later than 30 days after the date of the
    request, or at the request of the person making the request, not
    later than 60 days after such date. The Secretary who is holding
    the hearing shall provide notice of the hearing to the owner of the
    patent involved and to any interested person and provide the owner
    and any interested person an opportunity to participate in the
    hearing. Within 30 days after the completion of the hearing, such
    Secretary shall affirm or revise the determination which was the
    subject of the hearing and shall notify the Director of any

    in the Federal Register.
      (3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(B), the term "due
    diligence" means that degree of attention, continuous directed
    effort, and timeliness as may reasonably be expected from, and are
    ordinarily exercised by, a person during a regulatory review
    period.

    subject to the disclosure requirements prescribed by the Director.
      (5)(A) If the owner of record of the patent or its agent
    reasonably expects that the applicable regulatory review period
    described in paragraph (1)(B)(ii), (2)(B)(ii), (3)(B)(ii),

    product that is the subject of such patent may extend beyond the
    expiration of the patent term in effect, the owner or its agent may
    submit an application to the Director for an interim extension
    during the period beginning 6 months, and ending 15 days, before
    such term is due to expire. The application shall contain - 
        (i) the identity of the product subject to regulatory review
      and the Federal statute under which such review is occurring;
        (ii) the identity of the patent for which interim extension is
      being sought and the identity of each claim of such patent which
      claims the product under regulatory review or a method of using
      or manufacturing the product;
        (iii) information to enable the Director to determine under
      subsection (a)(1), (2), and (3) the eligibility of a patent for
      extension;
        (iv) a brief description of the activities undertaken by the
      applicant during the applicable regulatory review period to date
      with respect to the product under review and the significant
      dates applicable to such activities; and
        (v) such patent or other information as the Director may
      require.

      (B) If the Director determines that, except for permission to
    market or use the product commercially, the patent would be
    eligible for an extension of the patent term under this section,
    the Director shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of such
    determination, including the identity of the product under
    regulatory review, and shall issue to the applicant a certificate
    of interim extension for a period of not more than 1 year.
      (C) The owner of record of a patent, or its agent, for which an
    interim extension has been granted under subparagraph (B), may
    apply for not more than 4 subsequent interim extensions under this
    paragraph, except that, in the case of a patent subject to
    subsection (g)(6)(C), the owner of record of the patent, or its
    agent, may apply for only 1 subsequent interim extension under this
    paragraph. Each such subsequent application shall be made during
    the period beginning 60 days before, and ending 30 days before, the
    expiration of the preceding interim extension.
      (D) Each certificate of interim extension under this paragraph
    shall be recorded in the official file of the patent and shall be
    considered part of the original patent.
      (E) Any interim extension granted under this paragraph shall
    terminate at the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date on
    which the product involved receives permission for commercial
    marketing or use, except that, if within that 60-day period the
    applicant notifies the Director of such permission and submits any
    additional information under paragraph (1) of this subsection not
    previously contained in the application for interim extension, the
    patent shall be further extended, in accordance with the provisions
    of this section - 
        (i) for not to exceed 5 years from the date of expiration of
      the original patent term; or
        (ii) if the patent is subject to subsection (g)(6)(C), from the
      date on which the product involved receives approval for
      commercial marketing or use.

      (F) The rights derived from any patent the term of which is
    extended under this paragraph shall, during the period of interim
    extension - 
        (i) in the case of a patent which claims a product, be limited
      to any use then under regulatory review;
        (ii) in the case of a patent which claims a method of using a
      product, be limited to any use claimed by the patent then under
      regulatory review; and
        (iii) in the case of a patent which claims a method of
      manufacturing a product, be limited to the method of
      manufacturing as used to make the product then under regulatory
      review.

      (e)(1) A determination that a patent is eligible for extension
    may be made by the Director solely on the basis of the
    representations contained in the application for the extension. If
    the Director determines that a patent is eligible for extension
    under subsection (a) and that the requirements of paragraphs (1)
    through (4) of subsection (d) have been complied with, the Director
    shall issue to the applicant for the extension of the term of the
    patent a certificate of extension, under seal, for the period
    prescribed by subsection (c). Such certificate shall be recorded in
    the official file of the patent and shall be considered as part of
    the original patent.
      (2) If the term of a patent for which an application has been
    submitted under subsection (d)(1) would expire before a certificate
    of extension is issued or denied under paragraph (1) respecting the
    application, the Director shall extend, until such determination is
    made, the term of the patent for periods of up to one year if he
    determines that the patent is eligible for extension.

    Sec. 157. Statutory invention registration

-STATUTE-
      (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the
    Director is authorized to publish a statutory invention
    registration containing the specification and drawings of a
    regularly filed application for a patent without examination if the
    applicant - 
        (1) meets the requirements of section 112 of this title;
        (2) has complied with the requirements for printing, as set
      forth in regulations of the Director;
        (3) waives the right to receive a patent on the invention
      within such period as may be prescribed by the Director; and
        (4) pays application, publication, and other processing fees
      established by the Director.

    If an interference is declared with respect to such an application,
    a statutory invention registration may not be published unless the
    issue of priority of invention is finally determined in favor of
    the applicant.
      (b) The waiver under subsection (a)(3) of this section by an
    applicant shall take effect upon publication of the statutory
    invention registration.
      (c) A statutory invention registration published pursuant to this
    section shall have all of the attributes specified for patents in
    this title except those specified in section 183 and sections 271
    through 289 of this title. A statutory invention registration shall
    not have any of the attributes specified for patents in any other
    provision of law other than this title. A statutory invention
    registration published pursuant to this section shall give
    appropriate notice to the public, pursuant to regulations which the
    Director shall issue, of the preceding provisions of this
    subsection. The invention with respect to which a statutory
    invention certificate is published is not a patented invention for
    purposes of section 292 of this title.
      (d) The Director shall report to the Congress annually on the use
    of statutory invention registrations. Such report shall include an
    assessment of the degree to which agencies of the Federal
    Government are making use of the statutory invention registration
    system, the degree to which it aids the management of federally
    developed technology, and an assessment of the cost savings to the
    Federal Government of the use of such procedures.

    right to exclude others from asexually reproducing the plant or
    selling or using the plant so reproduced."

                     EFFECTIVE DATE OF 1998 AMENDMENT                 
      Pub. L. 105-289, Sec. 3(b), Oct. 27, 1998, 112 Stat. 2781,

                           FINDINGS AND PURPOSES                       
      Pub. L. 105-289, Sec. 2, Oct. 27, 1998, 112 Stat. 2780, provided
    that:
      "(a) Findings. - The Congress makes the following findings:
        "(1) The protection provided by plant patents under title 35,
      United States Code, dating back to 1930, has historically
      benefited American agriculture and horticulture and the public by
      providing an incentive for breeders to develop new plant
      varieties.
        "(2) Domestic and foreign agricultural trade is rapidly
      expanding and is very different from the trade of the past. An
      unforeseen ambiguity in the provisions of title 35, United States
      Code, is undermining the orderly collection of royalties due
      breeders holding United States plant patents.
        "(3) Plant parts produced from plants protected by United
      States plant patents are being taken from illegally reproduced
      plants and traded in United States markets to the detriment of
      plant patent holders.
        "(4) Resulting lost royalty income inhibits investment in
      domestic research and breeding activities associated with a wide
      variety of crops - an area where the United States has
      historically enjoyed a strong international position. Such
      research is the foundation of a strong horticultural industry.
        "(5) Infringers producing such plant parts from unauthorized
      plants enjoy an unfair competitive advantage over producers who
      pay royalties on varieties protected by United States plant
      patents.
      "(b) Purposes. - The purposes of this Act [see section 1 of Pub.
    L. 105-289, set out as a Short Title of 1998 Amendments note under
    section 1 of this title] are - 
        "(1) to clearly and explicitly provide that title 35, United
      States Code, protects the owner of a plant patent against the
      unauthorized sale of plant parts taken from plants illegally
      reproduced;
        "(2) to make the protections provided under such title more
      consistent with those provided breeders of sexually reproduced
      plants under the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321 et
      seq.), as amended by the Plant Variety Protection Act Amendments
      of 1994 (Public Law 103-349); and
        "(3) to strengthen the ability of United States plant patent
      holders to enforce their patent rights with regard to importation
      of plant parts produced from plants protected by United States
      plant patents, which are propagated without the authorization of
      the patent holder."

-HEAD-
    Sec. 181. Secrecy of certain inventions and withholding of patent

-STATUTE-
      Whenever publication or disclosure by the publication of an
    application or by the grant of a patent on an invention in which
    the Government has a property interest might, in the opinion of the
    head of the interested Government agency, be detrimental to the
    national security, the Commissioner of Patents upon being so
    notified shall order that the invention be kept secret and shall
    withhold the publication of the application or the grant of a
    patent therefor under the conditions set forth hereinafter.
      Whenever the publication or disclosure of an invention by the
    publication of an application or by the granting of a patent, in
    which the Government does not have a property interest, might, in
    the opinion of the Commissioner of Patents, be detrimental to the
    national security, he shall make the application for patent in
    which such invention is disclosed available for inspection to the
    Atomic Energy Commission, the Secretary of Defense, and the chief
    officer of any other department or agency of the Government
    designated by the President as a defense agency of the United
    States.
      Each individual to whom the application is disclosed shall sign a
    dated acknowledgment thereof, which acknowledgment shall be entered
    in the file of the application. If, in the opinion of the Atomic
    Energy Commission, the Secretary of a Defense Department, or the
    chief officer of another department or agency so designated, the
    publication or disclosure of the invention by the publication of an
    application or by the granting of a patent therefor would be
    detrimental to the national security, the Atomic Energy Commission,
    the Secretary of a Defense Department, or such other chief officer
    shall notify the Commissioner of Patents and the Commissioner of
    Patents shall order that the invention be kept secret and shall
    withhold the publication of the application or the grant of a
    patent for such period as the national interest requires, and
    notify the applicant thereof. Upon proper showing by the head of
    the department or agency who caused the secrecy order to be issued
    that the examination of the application might jeopardize the
    national interest, the Commissioner of Patents shall thereupon
    maintain the application in a sealed condition and notify the
    applicant thereof. The owner of an application which has been
    placed under a secrecy order shall have a right to appeal from the
    order to the Secretary of Commerce under rules prescribed by him.
      An invention shall not be ordered kept secret and the publication
    of the application or the grant of a patent withheld for a period
    of more than one year. The Commissioner of Patents shall renew the
    order at the end thereof, or at the end of any renewal period, for
    additional periods of one year upon notification by the head of the
    department or the chief officer of the agency who caused the order
    to be issued that an affirmative determination has been made that
    the national interest continues so to require. An order in effect,
    or issued, during a time when the United States is at war, shall
    remain in effect for the duration of hostilities and one year
    following cessation of hostilities. An order in effect, or issued,
    during a national emergency declared by the President shall remain
    in effect for the duration of the national emergency and six months
    thereafter. The Commissioner of Patents may rescind any order upon
    notification by the heads of the departments and the chief officers
    of the agencies who caused the order to be issued that the
    publication or disclosure of the invention is no longer deemed
    detrimental to the national security.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 183. Right to compensation

-STATUTE-
      An applicant, his successors, assigns, or legal representatives,
    whose patent is withheld as herein provided, shall have the right,
    beginning at the date the applicant is notified that, except for
    such order, his application is otherwise in condition for
    allowance, or February 1, 1952, whichever is later, and ending six
    years after a patent is issued thereon, to apply to the head of any
    department or agency who caused the order to be issued for
    compensation for the damage caused by the order of secrecy and/or
    for the use of the invention by the Government, resulting from his
    disclosure. The right to compensation for use shall begin on the
    date of the first use of the invention by the Government. The head
    of the department or agency is authorized, upon the presentation of
    a claim, to enter into an agreement with the applicant, his
    successors, assigns, or legal representatives, in full settlement
    for the damage and/or use. This settlement agreement shall be
    conclusive for all purposes notwithstanding any other provision of
    law to the contrary. If full settlement of the claim cannot be
    effected, the head of the department or agency may award and pay to
    such applicant, his successors, assigns, or legal representatives,
    a sum not exceeding 75 per centum of the sum which the head of the
    department or agency considers just compensation for the damage
    and/or use. A claimant may bring suit against the United States in
    the United States Court of Federal Claims or in the District Court
    of the United States for the district in which such claimant is a
    resident for an amount which when added to the award shall
    constitute just compensation for the damage and/or use of the
    invention by the Government. The owner of any patent issued upon an
    application that was subject to a secrecy order issued pursuant to
    section 181 of this title, who did not apply for compensation as
    above provided, shall have the right, after the date of issuance of
    such patent, to bring suit in the United States Court of Federal
    Claims for just compensation for the damage caused by reason of the
    order of secrecy and/or use by the Government of the invention
    resulting from his disclosure. The right to compensation for use
    shall begin on the date of the first use of the invention by the
    Government. In a suit under the provisions of this section the
    United States may avail itself of all defenses it may plead in an
    action under section 1498 of title 28. This section shall not
    confer a right of action on anyone or his successors, assigns, or
    legal representatives who, while in the full-time employment or
    service of the United States, discovered, invented, or developed
    the invention on which the claim is based.

    Sec. 184. Filing of application in foreign country

-STATUTE-
      Except when authorized by a license obtained from the
    Commissioner of Patents a person shall not file or cause or
    authorize to be filed in any foreign country prior to six months
    after filing in the United States an application for patent or for
    the registration of a utility model, industrial design, or model in
    respect of an invention made in this country. A license shall not
    be granted with respect to an invention subject to an order issued
    by the Commissioner of Patents pursuant to section 181 of this
    title without the concurrence of the head of the departments and
    the chief officers of the agencies who caused the order to be
    issued. The license may be granted retroactively where an
    application has been filed abroad through error and without
    deceptive intent and the application does not disclose an invention
    within the scope of section 181 of this title.
      The term "application" when used in this chapter includes
    applications and any modifications, amendments, or supplements
    thereto, or divisions thereof.
      The scope of a license shall permit subsequent modifications,
    amendments, and supplements containing additional subject matter if
    the application upon which the request for the license is based is
    not, or was not, required to be made available for inspection under
    section 181 of this title and if such modifications, amendments,
    and supplements do not change the general nature of the invention
    in a manner which would require such application to be made
    available for inspection under such section 181. In any case in
    which a license is not, or was not, required in order to file an
    application in any foreign country, such subsequent modifications,
    amendments, and supplements may be made, without a license, to the
    application filed in the foreign country if the United States
    application was not required to be made available for inspection
    under section 181 and if such modifications, amendments, and
    supplements do not, or did not, change the general nature of the
    invention in a manner which would require the United States
    application to have been made available for inspection under such
    section 181.

      Section 9101(d) of Pub. L. 100-418 provided that:
      "(1) Subject to paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this subsection,
    the amendments made by this section [amending sections 184 to 186
    of this title] shall apply to all United States patents granted
    before, on, or after the date of enactment of this section [Aug.
    23, 1988], to all applications for United States patents pending on
    or filed after such date of enactment, and to all licenses under
    section 184 granted before, on, or after the date of enactment of
    this section.
      "(2) The amendments made by this section shall not affect any
    final decision made by a court or the Patent and Trademark Office
    before the date of enactment of this section [Aug. 23, 1988] with
    respect to a patent or application for patent, if no appeal from
    such decision is pending and the time for filing an appeal has
    expired.
      "(3) No United States patent granted before the date of enactment
    of this section [Aug. 23, 1988] shall abridge or affect the right
    of any person or his successors in business who made, purchased, or
    used, prior to such date of enactment, anything protected by the
    patent, to continue the use of, or to sell to others to be used or
    sold, the specific thing so made, purchased, or used, if the patent
    claims were invalid or otherwise unenforceable on a ground obviated
    by this section and the person made, purchased, or used the
    specific thing in reasonable reliance on such invalidity or
    unenforceability. If a person reasonably relied on such invalidity
    or unenforceability, the court before which such matter is in
    question may provide for the continued manufacture, use, or sale of
    the thing made, purchased, or used as specified, or for the
    manufacture, use, or sale of which substantial preparation was made
    before the date of enactment of this section, and it may also
    provide for the continued practice of any process practiced, or for
    the practice of which substantial preparation was made, prior to
    the date of enactment of this section, to the extent and under such
    terms as the court deems equitable for the protection of
    investments made or business commenced before such date of
    enactment.
      "(4) The amendments made by this section shall not affect the
    right of any party in any case pending in court on the date of
    enactment of this section [Aug. 23, 1988] to have its rights or
    liabilities - 
        "(A) under any patent before the court, or
        "(B) under any patent granted after such date of enactment
      which is related to the patent before the court by deriving
      priority rights under section 120 or 121 of title 35, United
      States Code, from a patent or an application for patent common to
      both patents,
    determined on the basis of the substantive law in effect before the
    date of enactment of this section."

    model, industrial design, or model in respect of the invention. A
    United States patent issued to such person, his successors,

    commercial concerns and nonprofit organizations, including
    universities; to ensure that inventions made by nonprofit
    organizations and small business firms are used in a manner to
    promote free competition and enterprise without unduly encumbering
    future research and discovery; to promote the commercialization and
    public availability of inventions made in the United States by
    United States industry and labor; to ensure that the Government
    obtains sufficient rights in federally supported inventions to meet
    the needs of the Government and protect the public against nonuse
    or unreasonable use of inventions; and to minimize the costs of
    administering policies in this area.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 202. Disposition of rights

-STATUTE-
      (a) Each nonprofit organization or small business firm may,
    within a reasonable time after disclosure as required by paragraph
    (c)(1) of this section, elect to retain title to any subject
    invention: Provided, however, That a funding agreement may provide
    otherwise (i) when the contractor is not located in the United
    States or does not have a place of business located in the United
    States or is subject to the control of a foreign government, (ii)
    in exceptional circumstances when it is determined by the agency
    that restriction or elimination of the right to retain title to any
    subject invention will better promote the policy and objectives of
    this chapter (iii) when it is determined by a Government authority
    which is authorized by statute or Executive order to conduct
    foreign intelligence or counter-intelligence activities that the
    restriction or elimination of the right to retain title to any
    subject invention is necessary to protect the security of such
    activities or, (iv) when the funding agreement includes the
    operation of a Government-owned, contractor-operated facility of
    the Department of Energy primarily dedicated to that Department's
    naval nuclear propulsion or weapons related programs and all
    funding agreement limitations under this subparagraph on the
    contractor's right to elect title to a subject invention are
    limited to inventions occurring under the above two programs of the
    Department of Energy. The rights of the nonprofit organization or
    small business firm shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph
    (c) of this section and the other provisions of this chapter.
      (b)(1) The rights of the Government under subsection (a) shall
    not be exercised by a Federal agency unless it first determines
    that at least one of the conditions identified in clauses (i)
    through (iv) of subsection (a) exists. Except in the case of
    subsection (a)(iii), the agency shall file with the Secretary of
    Commerce, within thirty days after the award of the applicable
    funding agreement, a copy of such determination. In the case of a
    determination under subsection (a)(ii), the statement shall include
    an analysis justifying the determination. In the case of
    determinations applicable to funding agreements with small business
    firms, copies shall also be sent to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
    of the Small Business Administration. If the Secretary of Commerce
    believes that any individual determination or pattern of
    determinations is contrary to the policies and objectives of this
    chapter or otherwise not in conformance with this chapter, the
    Secretary shall so advise the head of the agency concerned and the
    Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, and
    recommend corrective actions.
      (2) Whenever the Administrator of the Office of Federal
    Procurement Policy has determined that one or more Federal agencies
    are utilizing the authority of clause (i) or (ii) of subsection (a)
    of this section in a manner that is contrary to the policies and
    objectives of this chapter, the Administrator is authorized to
    issue regulations describing classes of situations in which
    agencies may not exercise the authorities of those clauses.
      (3) If the contractor believes that a determination is contrary
    to the policies and objectives of this chapter or constitutes an
    abuse of discretion by the agency, the determination shall be
    subject to the (!1) section 203(b).

      (c) Each funding agreement with a small business firm or
    nonprofit organization shall contain appropriate provisions to
    effectuate the following:
        (1) That the contractor disclose each subject invention to the
      Federal agency within a reasonable time after it becomes known to
      contractor personnel responsible for the administration of patent
      matters, and that the Federal Government may receive title to any
      subject invention not disclosed to it within such time.
        (2) That the contractor make a written election within two
      years after disclosure to the Federal agency (or such additional
      time as may be approved by the Federal agency) whether the
      contractor will retain title to a subject invention: Provided,
      That in any case where publication, on sale, or public use, has
      initiated the one year statutory period in which valid patent
      protection can still be obtained in the United States, the period
      for election may be shortened by the Federal agency to a date
      that is not more than sixty days prior to the end of the
      statutory period: And provided further, That the Federal
      Government may receive title to any subject invention in which
      the contractor does not elect to retain rights or fails to elect
      rights within such times.
        (3) That a contractor electing rights in a subject invention
      agrees to file a patent application prior to any statutory bar
      date that may occur under this title due to publication, on sale,
      or public use, and shall thereafter file corresponding patent
      applications in other countries in which it wishes to retain
      title within reasonable times, and that the Federal Government
      may receive title to any subject inventions in the United States
      or other countries in which the contractor has not filed patent
      applications on the subject invention within such times.
        (4) With respect to any invention in which the contractor
      elects rights, the Federal agency shall have a nonexclusive,
      nontransferrable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or
      have practiced for or on behalf of the United States any subject
      invention throughout the world: Provided, That the funding
      agreement may provide for such additional rights, including the
      right to assign or have assigned foreign patent rights in the
      subject invention, as are determined by the agency as necessary
      for meeting the obligations of the United States under any
      treaty, international agreement, arrangement of cooperation,
      memorandum of understanding, or similar arrangement, including
      military agreement relating to weapons development and
      production.
        (5) The right of the Federal agency to require periodic
      reporting on the utilization or efforts at obtaining utilization
      that are being made by the contractor or his licensees or
      assignees: Provided, That any such information as well as any
      information on utilization or efforts at obtaining utilization
      obtained as part of a proceeding under section 203 of this
      chapter shall be treated by the Federal agency as commercial and
      financial information obtained from a person and privileged and
      confidential and not subject to disclosure under section 552 of
      title 5.
        (6) An obligation on the part of the contractor, in the event a
      United States patent application is filed by or on its behalf or
      by any assignee of the contractor, to include within the
      specification of such application and any patent issuing thereon,
      a statement specifying that the invention was made with
      Government support and that the Government has certain rights in
      the invention.
        (7) In the case of a nonprofit organization, (A) a prohibition
      upon the assignment of rights to a subject invention in the
      United States without the approval of the Federal agency, except
      where such assignment is made to an organization which has as one
      of its primary functions the management of inventions (provided
      that such assignee shall be subject to the same provisions as the
      contractor); (B) a requirement that the contractor share
      royalties with the inventor; (C) except with respect to a funding
      agreement for the operation of a Government-owned-contractor-
      operated facility, a requirement that the balance of any
      royalties or income earned by the contractor with respect to
      subject inventions, after payment of expenses (including payments
      to inventors) incidental to the administration of subject
      inventions, be utilized for the support of scientific research or
      education; (D) a requirement that, except where it proves
      infeasible after a reasonable inquiry, in the licensing of
      subject inventions shall be given to small business firms; and
      (E) with respect to a funding agreement for the operation of a
      Government-owned-contractor-operated facility, requirements (i)
      that after payment of patenting costs, licensing costs, payments
      to inventors, and other expenses incidental to the administration
      of subject inventions, 100 percent of the balance of any
      royalties or income earned and retained by the contractor during
      any fiscal year up to an amount equal to 5 percent of the annual
      budget of the facility, shall be used by the contractor for
      scientific research, development, and education consistent with
      the research and development mission and objectives of the
      facility, including activities that increase the licensing
      potential of other inventions of the facility; provided that if
      said balance exceeds 5 percent of the annual budget of the
      facility, that 75 percent of such excess shall be paid to the
      Treasury of the United States and the remaining 25 percent shall
      be used for the same purposes as described above in this clause
      (D); and (ii) that, to the extent it provides the most effective
      technology transfer, the licensing of subject inventions shall be
      administered by contractor employees on location at the facility.
        (8) The requirements of sections 203 and 204 of this chapter.

      (d) If a contractor does not elect to retain title to a subject
    invention in cases subject to this section, the Federal agency may
    consider and after consultation with the contractor grant requests
    for retention of rights by the inventor subject to the provisions
    of this Act and regulations promulgated hereunder.
      (e) In any case when a Federal employee is a coinventor of any
    invention made with a nonprofit organization, a small business
    firm, or a non-Federal inventor, the Federal agency employing such
    coinventor may, for the purpose of consolidating rights in the
    invention and if it finds that it would expedite the development of
    the invention - 
        (1) license or assign whatever rights it may acquire in the
      subject invention to the nonprofit organization, small business
      firm, or non-Federal inventor in accordance with the provisions
      of this chapter; or
        (2) acquire any rights in the subject invention from the
      nonprofit organization, small business firm, or non-Federal
      inventor, but only to the extent the party from whom the rights
      are acquired voluntarily enters into the transaction and no other
      transaction under this chapter is conditioned on such
      acquisition.

      (f)(1) No funding agreement with a small business firm or
    nonprofit organization shall contain a provision allowing a Federal
    agency to require the licensing to third parties of inventions
    owned by the contractor that are not subject inventions unless such
    provision has been approved by the head of the agency and a written
    justification has been signed by the head of the agency. Any such
    provision shall clearly state whether the licensing may be required
    in connection with the practice of a subject invention, a
    specifically identified work object, or both. The head of the
    agency may not delegate the authority to approve provisions or sign
    justifications required by this paragraph.
      (2) A Federal agency shall not require the licensing of third
    parties under any such provision unless the head of the agency
    determines that the use of the invention by others is necessary for
    the practice of a subject invention or for the use of a work object
    of the funding agreement and that such action is necessary to
    achieve the practical application of the subject invention or work
    object. Any such determination shall be on the record after an
    opportunity for an agency hearing. Any action commenced for
    judicial review of such determination shall be brought within sixty
    days after notification of such determination.

    Sec. 203. March-in rights

-STATUTE-
      (a) With respect to any subject invention in which a small
    business firm or nonprofit organization has acquired title under
    this chapter, the Federal agency under whose funding agreement the
    subject invention was made shall have the right, in accordance with
    such procedures as are provided in regulations promulgated
    hereunder to require the contractor, an assignee or exclusive
    licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially
    exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a
    responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable
    under the circumstances, and if the contractor, assignee, or
    exclusive licensee refuses such request, to grant such a license
    itself, if the Federal agency determines that such - 
        (1) action is necessary because the contractor or assignee has
      not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time,
      effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject
      invention in such field of use;
        (2) action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs
      which are not reasonably satisfied by the contractor, assignee,
      or their licensees;
        (3) action is necessary to meet requirements for public use
      specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not
      reasonably satisfied by the contractor, assignee, or licensees;
      or
        (4) action is necessary because the agreement required by
      section 204 has not been obtained or waived or because a licensee
      of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in
      the United States is in breach of its agreement obtained pursuant
      to section 204.

      (b) A determination pursuant to this section or section 202(b)(4)
    (!1) shall not be subject to the Contract Disputes Act (41 U.S.C.
    Sec. 601 et seq.). An administrative appeals procedure shall be
    established by regulations promulgated in accordance with section
    206. Additionally, any contractor, inventor, assignee, or exclusive
    licensee adversely affected by a determination under this section
    may, at any time within sixty days after the determination is
    issued, file a petition in the United States Court of Federal
    Claims, which shall have jurisdiction to determine the appeal on
    the record and to affirm, reverse, remand or modify, as
    appropriate, the determination of the Federal agency. In cases
    described in paragraphs (1) and (3) of subsection (a), the agency's
    determination shall be held in abeyance pending the exhaustion of
    appeals or petitions filed under the preceding sentence.

-STATUTE-
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no small
    business firm or nonprofit organization which receives title to any
    subject invention and no assignee of any such small business firm
    or nonprofit organization shall grant to any person the exclusive
    right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States
    unless such person agrees that any products embodying the subject
    invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will
    be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in
    individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be
    waived by the Federal agency under whose funding agreement the
    invention was made upon a showing by the small business firm,
    nonprofit organization, or assignee that reasonable but
    unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar
    terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture
    substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances
    domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.

    separate register for the recording of all rights and interests of
    the Government in or under patents and applications for patents.
      2. The several departments and other executive agencies of the
    Government, including Government-owned or Government-controlled
    corporations, shall forward promptly to the Commissioner of Patents
    [now Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and

    recording in the separate register provided for in paragraph 1
    hereof all licenses, assignments, or other interests of the
    Government in or under patents or applications for patents, in
    accordance with such rules and regulations as may be prescribed
    pursuant to paragraph 4 hereof; but the lack of recordation in such
    register of any right or interest of the Government in or under any
    patent or application therefor shall not prejudice in any way the
    assertion of such right or interest by the Government.
      3. The register shall be open to inspection except as to such
    entries or documents which, in the opinion of the department or
    agency submitting them for recording, should be maintained in
    secrecy: Provided, however, That the right of inspection may be
    restricted to authorized representatives of the Government pending
    the final report to the President by the National Patent Planning
    Commission under Executive Order No. 8977 of December 12, 1941, and
    action thereon by the President.
      4. The Commissioner of Patents [now Under Secretary of Commerce
    for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent
    and Trademark Office], with the approval of the Secretary of

    hereafter acquire title to inventions or the right to file patent
    applications abroad thereon, shall fully and continuously inform

    Commerce. See Ex. Ord. No. 10930 set out as a note below]
    concerning such inventions, except as provided in section 6 hereof,
    and shall make recommendations to the Chairman of Government
    Patents Board as to which of such inventions should receive patent
    protection by the United States abroad and the foreign
    jurisdictions in which such patent protection should be sought. The
    recommendations of such departments and agencies shall indicate the
    immediate or future industrial, commercial or other value of the
    invention concerned, including its value to public health.
      3. The Chairman of Government Patents Board shall determine
    whether, and in what foreign jurisdictions, the United States
    should seek patents for such inventions, and, to the extent of
    appropriations available therefor, shall procure patent protection
    for such inventions, taking all action, consistent with existing
    law, necessary to acquire and maintain patent rights abroad. Such
    determinations of the said Department shall be made after full
    consultation with United States industry and commerce, with the
    Department of State, and with other Government agencies familiar
    with the technical, scientific, industrial, commercial or other
    economic or social factors affecting the invention involved, and
    after consideration of the availability of valid patent protection
    in the countries determined to be immediate or potential markets
    for, or producers of, products, processes, or services covered by
    or relating to the invention.

    foreign patents acquired by the United States under the terms of
    this order and shall issue licenses thereunder in accordance with
    law under such rules and regulations as he shall prescribe.
    Nationals of the United States shall be granted licenses on a
    nonexclusive royalty free basis except in such cases as he shall
    determine and proclaim it to be inconsistent with the public
    interest to issue such licenses on a nonexclusive royalty free
    basis.
      5. The Department of State, in consultation with the Chairman of
    Government Patents Board, shall negotiate arrangements among
    governments under which each government and its nationals shall
    have access to the foreign patents of the other participating
    governments. Patents relating to matters of public health may be
    licensed by the Chairman of Government Patents Board, with the
    approval of the Secretary of State, to any country or its nationals
    upon such terms and conditions as are in accordance with law and as
    the Chairman of Government Patents Board determines to be
    appropriate, regardless of whether such country is a party to the
    arrangements provided for in this section.
      6. There shall be exempted from the provisions of this order (a)
    all inventions within the jurisdiction of the Atomic Energy
    Commission except in such cases as the said Commission specifically
    authorizes the inclusion of an invention under the terms of this
    order; and (b) all other inventions officially classified as secret
    or confidential for reasons of the national security. Nothing in
    this order shall supersede the declassification policies and
    procedures established by Executive Orders Nos. 9568 of June 8,
    1945, 9604 of August 25, 1945, and 9809 of December 12, 1946.

    EX. ORD. NO. 10096. UNIFORM GOVERNMENT PATENT POLICY FOR INVENTIONS
                          BY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES
      Ex. Ord. No. 10096, Jan. 23, 1950, 15 F.R. 389, as amended by Ex.
    Ord. No. 10695, Jan. 16, 1957, 22 F.R. 365; Ex. Ord. No. 10930,
    Mar. 24, 1961, 26 F.R. 2583, provided:
      NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
    Constitution and statutes, and as President of the United States
    and Commander in Chief of the armed forces of the United States, in
    the interest of the establishment and operation of a uniform patent
    policy for the Government with respect to inventions made by
    Government employees, it is hereby ordered as follows:
      1. The following basic policy is established for all Government
    agencies with respect to inventions hereafter made by any
    Government employee:
      (a) The Government shall obtain the entire right, title, and
    interest in and to all inventions made by any Government employee
    (1) during working hours, or (2) with a contribution by the
    Government of facilities, equipment, materials, funds, or
    information, or of time or services of other Government employees
    on official duty, or (3) which bear a direct relation to or are
    made in consequence of the official duties of the inventor.
      (b) In any case where the contribution of the Government, as
    measured by any one or more of the criteria set forth in paragraph
    (a) last above, to the invention, is insufficient equitably to
    justify a requirement of assignment to the Government of the entire
    right, title and interest to such invention, or in any case where
    the Government has insufficient interest in an invention to obtain
    entire right, title and interest therein (although the Government
    could obtain some under paragraph (a), above), the Government
    agency concerned, subject to the approval of the Chairman of the
    Government Patents Board [now Secretary of Commerce. See Ex. Ord.
    No. 10930 set out as a note below] (provided for in paragraph 3 of
    this order and hereinafter referred to as the Chairman), shall
    leave title to such invention in the employee, subject, however, to
    the reservation to the Government of a non-exclusive, irrevocable,
    royalty-free license in the invention with power to grant licenses
    for all governmental purposes, such reservation, in the terms
    thereof, to appear, where practicable, in any patent, domestic or
    foreign, which may issue on such invention.
      (c) In applying the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b), above,
    to the facts and circumstances relating to the making of any
    particular invention, it shall be presumed that an invention made
    by an employee who is employed or assigned (i) to invent or improve
    or perfect any art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter,
    (ii) to conduct or perform research, development work, or both,
    (iii) to supervise, direct, coordinate, or review Government
    financed or conducted research, development work, or both, or (iv)
    to act in a liaison capacity among governmental or nongovernmental
    agencies or individuals engaged in such work, or made by an
    employee included within any other category of employees specified
    by regulations issued pursuant to section 4(b) hereof, falls within
    the provisions of paragraph (a), above, and it shall be presumed
    that any invention made by any other employee falls within the
    provisions of paragraph (b), above. Either presumption may be
    rebutted by the facts or circumstances attendant upon the
    conditions under which any particular invention is made and,
    notwithstanding the foregoing, shall not preclude a determination
    that the invention falls within the provisions of paragraph (d)
    next below.
      (d) In any case wherein the Government neither (1) pursuant to
    the provisions of paragraph (a) above, obtains entire right, title
    and interest in and to an invention nor (2) pursuant to the
    provisions of paragraph (b) above, reserves a non-exclusive,
    irrevocable, royalty-free license in the invention with power to
    grant licenses for all governmental purposes, the Government shall
    leave the entire right, title and interest in and to the invention
    in the Government employee, subject to law.
      (e) Actions taken, and rights acquired, under the foregoing
    provisions of this section, shall be reported to the Chairman in
    accordance with procedures established by him.
      2. Subject to considerations of national security, or public
    health, safety, or welfare, the following basic policy is
    established for the collection, and dissemination to the public, of
    information concerning inventions resulting from Government
    research and development activities:
      (a) When an invention is made under circumstances defined in
    paragraph 1(a) of this order giving the United States the right to
    title thereto, the Government agency concerned shall either prepare
    and file an application for patent therefor in the United States
    Patent Office [now Patent and Trademark Office] or make a full
    disclosure of the invention promptly to the Chairman, who may, if
    he determines the Government interest so requires, cause
    application for patent to be filed or cause the invention to be
    fully disclosed by publication thereof: Provided, however, That,
    consistent with present practice of the Department of Agriculture,
    no application for patent shall, without the approval of the
    Secretary of Agriculture, be filed in respect of any variety of
    plant invented by any employee of that Department.
      (b) [Revoked. Ex. Ord. No. 10695, Jan. 16, 1957, 22 F.R. 365]
      3. (a) [Revoked. Ex. Ord. No. 10930, Mar. 24, 1961, 26 F.R. 2583]
      (b) The Government Patents Board shall advise and confer with the
    Chairman concerning the operation of those aspects of the
    Government's patent policy which are affected by the provisions of
    this order or of Executive Order No. 9865 [set out above], and
    suggest modifications or improvements where necessary.
      (c) [Revoked. Ex. Ord. No. 10930, Mar. 24, 1961, 26 F.R. 2583]
      (d) The Chairman shall establish such committees and other
    working groups as may be required to advise or assist him in the
    performance of any of his functions.
      (e) The Chairman of the Government Patents Board and the Chairman
    of the Interdepartmental Committee on Scientific Research and
    Development (provided for by Executive Order No. 9912 of December
    24, 1947), shall establish and maintain such mutual consultation as
    will effect the proper coordination of affairs of common concern.
      4. With a view to obtaining uniform application of the policies
    set out in this order and uniform operations thereunder, the
    Chairman is authorized and directed:
      (a) To consult and advise with Government agencies concerning the
    application and operation of the policies outlined herein;
      (b) After consultation with the Government Patents Board, to
    formulate and submit to the President for approval such proposed
    rules and regulations as may be necessary or desirable to implement
    and effectuate the aforesaid policies, together with the
    recommendations of the Government Patents Board thereon;
      (c) To submit annually a report to the President concerning the
    operation of such policies, and from time to time such
    recommendations for modification thereof as may be deemed
    desirable;
      (d) To determine with finality any controversies or disputes
    between any Government agency and its employees, to the extent
    submitted by any party to the dispute, concerning the ownership of
    inventions made by such employees or rights therein; and
      (e) To perform such other or further functions or duties as may
    from time to time be prescribed by the President or by statute.
      5. The functions and duties of the Secretary of Commerce and the
    Department of Commerce under the provisions of Executive Order No.
    9865 of June 14, 1947 [set out above] are hereby transferred to the
    Chairman and the whole or any part of such functions and duties may
    be delegated by him to any Government agency or officer: Provided,
    That said Executive Order No. 9865 shall not be deemed to be
    amended or affected by any provision of this Executive order other
    than this paragraph 5.
      6. Each Government agency shall take all steps appropriate to
    effectuate this order, including the promulgation of necessary
    regulations which shall not be inconsistent with this order or with
    regulations issued pursuant to paragraph 4(b) hereof.
      7. As used in this Executive order, the next stated terms, in
    singular and plural, are defined as follows for the purposes
    hereof:
      (a) "Government agency" includes any executive department and any
    independent commission, board, office, agency, authority, or other
    establishment of the Executive Branch of the Government of the

      (c) "Invention" includes any art, machine, manufacture, design,
    or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement
    thereof, or any variety of plant, which is or may be patentable
    under the patent laws of the United States.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 209. Licensing federally owned inventions

-STATUTE-
      (a) Authority. - A Federal agency may grant an exclusive or
    partially exclusive license on a federally owned invention under
    section 207(a)(2) only if - 
        (1) granting the license is a reasonable and necessary
      incentive to - 
          (A) call forth the investment capital and expenditures needed
        to bring the invention to practical application; or
          (B) otherwise promote the invention's utilization by the
        public;

        (2) the Federal agency finds that the public will be served by
      the granting of the license, as indicated by the applicant's
      intentions, plans, and ability to bring the invention to
      practical application or otherwise promote the invention's
      utilization by the public, and that the proposed scope of
      exclusivity is not greater than reasonably necessary to provide
      the incentive for bringing the invention to practical
      application, as proposed by the applicant, or otherwise to
      promote the invention's utilization by the public;
        (3) the applicant makes a commitment to achieve practical
      application of the invention within a reasonable time, which time
      may be extended by the agency upon the applicant's request and
      the applicant's demonstration that the refusal of such extension
      would be unreasonable;
        (4) granting the license will not tend to substantially lessen
      competition or create or maintain a violation of the Federal
      antitrust laws; and
        (5) in the case of an invention covered by a foreign patent
      application or patent, the interests of the Federal Government or
      United States industry in foreign commerce will be enhanced.

      (b) Manufacture in United States. - A Federal agency shall
    normally grant a license under section 207(a)(2) to use or sell any
    federally owned invention in the United States only to a licensee
    who agrees that any products embodying the invention or produced
    through the use of the invention will be manufactured substantially
    in the United States.
      (c) Small Business. - First preference for the granting of any
    exclusive or partially exclusive licenses under section 207(a)(2)
    shall be given to small business firms having equal or greater
    likelihood as other applicants to bring the invention to practical
    application within a reasonable time.
      (d) Terms and Conditions. - Any licenses granted under section
    207(a)(2) shall contain such terms and conditions as the granting
    agency considers appropriate, and shall include provisions - 
        (1) retaining a nontransferrable, irrevocable, paid-up license
      for any Federal agency to practice the invention or have the
      invention practiced throughout the world by or on behalf of the
      Government of the United States;
        (2) requiring periodic reporting on utilization of the
      invention, and utilization efforts, by the licensee, but only to
      the extent necessary to enable the Federal agency to determine
      whether the terms of the license are being complied with, except
      that any such report shall be treated by the Federal agency as
      commercial and financial information obtained from a person and
      privileged and confidential and not subject to disclosure under
      section 552 of title 5; and
        (3) empowering the Federal agency to terminate the license in
      whole or in part if the agency determines that - 
          (A) the licensee is not executing its commitment to achieve
        practical application of the invention, including commitments
        contained in any plan submitted in support of its request for a
        license, and the licensee cannot otherwise demonstrate to the
        satisfaction of the Federal agency that it has taken, or can be
        expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to
        achieve practical application of the invention;
          (B) the licensee is in breach of an agreement described in
        subsection (b);
          (C) termination is necessary to meet requirements for public
        use specified by Federal regulations issued after the date of
        the license, and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied
        by the licensee; or
          (D) the licensee has been found by a court of competent
        jurisdiction to have violated the Federal antitrust laws in
        connection with its performance under the license agreement.

      (e) Public Notice. - No exclusive or partially exclusive license
    may be granted under section 207(a)(2) unless public notice of the
    intention to grant an exclusive or partially exclusive license on a
    federally owned invention has been provided in an appropriate
    manner at least 15 days before the license is granted, and the
    Federal agency has considered all comments received before the end
    of the comment period in response to that public notice. This
    subsection shall not apply to the licensing of inventions made
    under a cooperative research and development agreement entered into
    under section 12 of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act
    of 1980 (15 U.S.C. 3710a).
      (f) Plan. - No Federal agency shall grant any license under a
    patent or patent application on a federally owned invention unless
    the person requesting the license has supplied the agency with a
    plan for development or marketing of the invention, except that any
    such plan shall be treated by the Federal agency as commercial and
    financial information obtained from a person and privileged and
    confidential and not subject to disclosure under section 552 of
    title 5.

    Sec. 251. Reissue of defective patents

-STATUTE-
      Whenever any patent is, through error without any deceptive
    intention, deemed wholly or partly inoperative or invalid, by
    reason of a defective specification or drawing, or by reason of the
    patentee claiming more or less than he had a right to claim in the
    patent, the Director shall, on the surrender of such patent and the
    payment of the fee required by law, reissue the patent for the
    invention disclosed in the original patent, and in accordance with
    a new and amended application, for the unexpired part of the term
    of the original patent. No new matter shall be introduced into the
    application for reissue.
      The Director may issue several reissued patents for distinct and
    separate parts of the thing patented, upon demand of the applicant,
    and upon payment of the required fee for a reissue for each of such
    reissued patents.
      The provisions of this title relating to applications for patent
    shall be applicable to applications for reissue of a patent, except
    that application for reissue may be made and sworn to by the
    assignee of the entire interest if the application does not seek to
    enlarge the scope of the claims of the original patent.
      No reissued patent shall be granted enlarging the scope of the
    claims of the original patent unless applied for within two years
    from the grant of the original patent.

    reissues is added, codifying the present rule of decision with a
    fixed period.

    Sec. 252. Effect of reissue

-STATUTE-
      The surrender of the original patent shall take effect upon the
    issue of the reissued patent, and every reissued patent shall have
    the same effect and operation in law, on the trial of actions for
    causes thereafter arising, as if the same had been originally
    granted in such amended form, but in so far as the claims of the
    original and reissued patents are substantially identical, such
    surrender shall not affect any action then pending nor abate any
    cause of action then existing, and the reissued patent, to the
    extent that its claims are substantially identical with the
    original patent, shall constitute a continuation thereof and have
    effect continuously from the date of the original patent.
      A reissued patent shall not abridge or affect the right of any
    person or that person's successors in business who, prior to the
    grant of a reissue, made, purchased, offered to sell, or used
    within the United States, or imported into the United States,
    anything patented by the reissued patent, to continue the use of,
    to offer to sell, or to sell to others to be used, offered for
    sale, or sold, the specific thing so made, purchased, offered for
    sale, used, or imported unless the making, using, offering for
    sale, or selling of such thing infringes a valid claim of the
    reissued patent which was in the original patent. The court before
    which such matter is in question may provide for the continued
    manufacture, use, offer for sale, or sale of the thing made,
    purchased, offered for sale, used, or imported as specified, or for
    the manufacture, use, offer for sale, or sale in the United States
    of which substantial preparation was made before the grant of the
    reissue, and the court may also provide for the continued practice
    of any process patented by the reissue that is practiced, or for
    the practice of which substantial preparation was made, before the
    grant of the reissue, to the extent and under such terms as the
    court deems equitable for the protection of investments made or
    business commenced before the grant of the reissue.

    business who made, purchased or used prior to the grant of a
    reissue anything patented by the reissued patent, to continue the
    use of, or to sell to others to be used or sold, the specific thing
    so made, purchased or used, unless the making, using or selling of
    such thing infringes a valid claim of the reissued patent which was
    in the original patent. The court before which such matter is in
    question may provide for the continued manufacture, use or sale of
    the thing made, purchased or used as specified, or for the
    manufacture, use or sale of which substantial preparation was made
    before the grant of the reissue, and it may also provide for the

      Whenever, without any deceptive intention, a claim of a patent is
    invalid the remaining claims shall not thereby be rendered invalid.
    A patentee, whether of the whole or any sectional interest therein,
    may, on payment of the fee required by law, make disclaimer of any
    complete claim, stating therein the extent of his interest in such
    patent. Such disclaimer shall be in writing, and recorded in the
    Patent and Trademark Office; and it shall thereafter be considered
    as part of the original patent to the extent of the interest
    possessed by the disclaimant and by those claiming under him.
      In like manner any patentee or applicant may disclaim or dedicate
    to the public the entire term, or any terminal part of the term, of
    the patent granted or to be granted.

    Sec. 261. Ownership; assignment

-STATUTE-
      Subject to the provisions of this title, patents shall have the
    attributes of personal property.
      Applications for patent, patents, or any interest therein, shall
    be assignable in law by an instrument in writing. The applicant,
    patentee, or his assigns or legal representatives may in like
    manner grant and convey an exclusive right under his application
    for patent, or patents, to the whole or any specified part of the
    United States.

    of a person authorized to administer oaths within the United
    States, or, in a foreign country, of a diplomatic or consular
    officer of the United States or an officer authorized to administer
    oaths whose authority is proved by a certificate of a diplomatic or
    consular officer of the United States, or apostille of an official
    designated by a foreign country which, by treaty or convention,
    accords like effect to apostilles of designated officials in the
    United States, shall be prima facie evidence of the execution of an
    assignment, grant or conveyance of a patent or application for
    patent.
      An assignment, grant or conveyance shall be void as against any
    subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration,
    without notice, unless it is recorded in the Patent and Trademark
    Office within three months from its date or prior to the date of
    such subsequent purchase or mortgage.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 271. Infringement of patent

-STATUTE-
      (a) Except as otherwise provided in this title, whoever without
    authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any patented
    invention, within the United States or imports into the United
    States any patented invention during the term of the patent
    therefor, infringes the patent.
      (b) Whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be
    liable as an infringer.
      (c) Whoever offers to sell or sells within the United States or
    imports into the United States a component of a patented machine,
    manufacture, combination or composition, or a material or apparatus
    for use in practicing a patented process, constituting a material
    part of the invention, knowing the same to be especially made or
    especially adapted for use in an infringement of such patent, and
    not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for
    substantial noninfringing use, shall be liable as a contributory
    infringer.
      (d) No patent owner otherwise entitled to relief for infringement
    or contributory infringement of a patent shall be denied relief or
    deemed guilty of misuse or illegal extension of the patent right by
    reason of his having done one or more of the following: (1) derived
    revenue from acts which if performed by another without his consent
    would constitute contributory infringement of the patent; (2)
    licensed or authorized another to perform acts which if performed
    without his consent would constitute contributory infringement of
    the patent; (3) sought to enforce his patent rights against
    infringement or contributory infringement; (4) refused to license
    or use any rights to the patent; or (5) conditioned the license of
    any rights to the patent or the sale of the patented product on the
    acquisition of a license to rights in another patent or purchase of
    a separate product, unless, in view of the circumstances, the
    patent owner has market power in the relevant market for the patent
    or patented product on which the license or sale is conditioned.
      (e)(1) It shall not be an act of infringement to make, use, offer
    to sell, or sell within the United States or import into the United
    States a patented invention (other than a new animal drug or
    veterinary biological product (as those terms are used in the
    Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Act of March 4, 1913)
    which is primarily manufactured using recombinant DNA, recombinant
    RNA, hybridoma technology, or other processes involving site
    specific genetic manipulation techniques) solely for uses
    reasonably related to the development and submission of information
    under a Federal law which regulates the manufacture, use, or sale
    of drugs or veterinary biological products.
      (2) It shall be an act of infringement to submit - 
        (A) an application under section 505(j) of the Federal Food,
      Drug, and Cosmetic Act or described in section 505(b)(2) of such
      Act for a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed
      in a patent, or
        (B) an application under section 512 of such Act or under the
      Act of March 4, 1913 (21 U.S.C. 151-158) for a drug or veterinary
      biological product which is not primarily manufactured using
      recombinant DNA, recombinant RNA, hybridoma technology, or other
      processes involving site specific genetic manipulation techniques
      and which is claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed
      in a patent,

    if the purpose of such submission is to obtain approval under such
    Act to engage in the commercial manufacture, use, or sale of a drug
    or veterinary biological product claimed in a patent or the use of
    which is claimed in a patent before the expiration of such patent.
      (3) In any action for patent infringement brought under this
    section, no injunctive or other relief may be granted which would
    prohibit the making, using, offering to sell, or selling within the
    United States or importing into the United States of a patented
    invention under paragraph (1).
      (4) For an act of infringement described in paragraph (2) - 
        (A) the court shall order the effective date of any approval of
      the drug or veterinary biological product involved in the
      infringement to be a date which is not earlier than the date of
      the expiration of the patent which has been infringed,
        (B) injunctive relief may be granted against an infringer to
      prevent the commercial manufacture, use, offer to sell, or sale
      within the United States or importation into the United States of
      an approved drug or veterinary biological product, and
        (C) damages or other monetary relief may be awarded against an
      infringer only if there has been commercial manufacture, use,
      offer to sell, or sale within the United States or importation
      into the United States of an approved drug or veterinary
      biological product.

    The remedies prescribed by subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) are the
    only remedies which may be granted by a court for an act of
    infringement described in paragraph (2), except that a court may
    award attorney fees under section 285.
      (5) Where a person has filed an application described in
    paragraph (2) that includes a certification under subsection
    (b)(2)(A)(iv) or (j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) of section 505 of the Federal
    Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355), and neither the owner
    of the patent that is the subject of the certification nor the
    holder of the approved application under subsection (b) of such
    section for the drug that is claimed by the patent or a use of
    which is claimed by the patent brought an action for infringement
    of such patent before the expiration of 45 days after the date on
    which the notice given under subsection (b)(3) or (j)(2)(B) of such
    section was received, the courts of the United States shall, to the
    extent consistent with the Constitution, have subject matter
    jurisdiction in any action brought by such person under section
    2201 of title 28 for a declaratory judgment that such patent is
    invalid or not infringed.
      (f)(1) Whoever without authority supplies or causes to be
    supplied in or from the United States all or a substantial portion
    of the components of a patented invention, where such components
    are uncombined in whole or in part, in such manner as to actively
    induce the combination of such components outside of the United
    States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such
    combination occurred within the United States, shall be liable as
    an infringer.
      (2) Whoever without authority supplies or causes to be supplied
    in or from the United States any component of a patented invention
    that is especially made or especially adapted for use in the
    invention and not a staple article or commodity of commerce
    suitable for substantial noninfringing use, where such component is
    uncombined in whole or in part, knowing that such component is so
    made or adapted and intending that such component will be combined
    outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the
    patent if such combination occurred within the United States, shall
    be liable as an infringer.
      (g) Whoever without authority imports into the United States or
    offers to sell, sells, or uses within the United States a product
    which is made by a process patented in the United States shall be
    liable as an infringer, if the importation, offer to sell, sale, or
    use of the product occurs during the term of such process patent.
    In an action for infringement of a process patent, no remedy may be
    granted for infringement on account of the noncommercial use or
    retail sale of a product unless there is no adequate remedy under
    this title for infringement on account of the importation or other
    use, offer to sell, or sale of that product. A product which is
    made by a patented process will, for purposes of this title, not be
    considered to be so made after - 
        (1) it is materially changed by subsequent processes; or
        (2) it becomes a trivial and nonessential component of another
      product.

      (h) As used in this section, the term "whoever" includes any
    State, any instrumentality of a State, and any officer or employee
    of a State or instrumentality of a State acting in his official
    capacity. Any State, and any such instrumentality, officer, or
    employee, shall be subject to the provisions of this title in the
    same manner and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity.
      (i) As used in this section, an "offer for sale" or an "offer to
    sell" by a person other than the patentee, or any designee of the
    patentee, is that in which the sale will occur before the
    expiration of the term of the patent.

      The first paragraph of this section is declaratory only, defining
    infringement.
      Paragraphs (b) and (c) define and limit contributory infringement
    of a patent and paragraph (d) is ancillary to these paragraphs, see
    preliminary general description of bill. One who actively induces
    infringement as by aiding and abetting the same is liable as an
    infringer, and so is one who sells a component part of a patented
    invention or material or apparatus for use therein knowing the same
    to be especially made or especially adapted for use in the
    infringement of the patent except in the case of a staple article
    or commodity of commerce having other uses. A patentee is not

    TITLE 35 - PATENTS
    PART III - PATENTS AND PROTECTION OF PATENT RIGHTS
    CHAPTER 28 - INFRINGEMENT OF PATENTS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 273. Defense to infringement based on earlier inventor

-STATUTE-
      (a) Definitions. - For purposes of this section - 
        (1) the terms "commercially used" and "commercial use" mean use
      of a method in the United States, so long as such use is in
      connection with an internal commercial use or an actual arm's-
      length sale or other arm's-length commercial transfer of a
      useful end result, whether or not the subject matter at issue is
      accessible to or otherwise known to the public, except that the
      subject matter for which commercial marketing or use is subject
      to a premarketing regulatory review period during which the
      safety or efficacy of the subject matter is established,
      including any period specified in section 156(g), shall be deemed
      "commercially used" and in "commercial use" during such
      regulatory review period;
        (2) in the case of activities performed by a nonprofit research
      laboratory, or nonprofit entity such as a university, research
      center, or hospital, a use for which the public is the intended
      beneficiary shall be considered to be a use described in
      paragraph (1), except that the use - 
          (A) may be asserted as a defense under this section only for
        continued use by and in the laboratory or nonprofit entity; and
          (B) may not be asserted as a defense with respect to any
        subsequent commercialization or use outside such laboratory or
        nonprofit entity;

        (3) the term "method" means a method of doing or conducting
      business; and
        (4) the "effective filing date" of a patent is the earlier of
      the actual filing date of the application for the patent or the
      filing date of any earlier United States, foreign, or
      international application to which the subject matter at issue is
      entitled under section 119, 120, or 365 of this title.

      (b) Defense to Infringement. - 
        (1) In general. - It shall be a defense to an action for
      infringement under section 271 of this title with respect to any
      subject matter that would otherwise infringe one or more claims
      for a method in the patent being asserted against a person, if
      such person had, acting in good faith, actually reduced the
      subject matter to practice at least 1 year before the effective
      filing date of such patent, and commercially used the subject
      matter before the effective filing date of such patent.
        (2) Exhaustion of right. - The sale or other disposition of a
      useful end product produced by a patented method, by a person
      entitled to assert a defense under this section with respect to
      that useful end result shall exhaust the patent owner's rights
      under the patent to the extent such rights would have been
      exhausted had such sale or other disposition been made by the
      patent owner.
        (3) Limitations and qualifications of defense. - The defense to
      infringement under this section is subject to the following:
          (A) Patent. - A person may not assert the defense under this
        section unless the invention for which the defense is asserted
        is for a method.
          (B) Derivation. - A person may not assert the defense under
        this section if the subject matter on which the defense is
        based was derived from the patentee or persons in privity with
        the patentee.
          (C) Not a general license. - The defense asserted by a person
        under this section is not a general license under all claims of
        the patent at issue, but extends only to the specific subject
        matter claimed in the patent with respect to which the person
        can assert a defense under this chapter, except that the
        defense shall also extend to variations in the quantity or
        volume of use of the claimed subject matter, and to
        improvements in the claimed subject matter that do not infringe
        additional specifically claimed subject matter of the patent.

        (4) Burden of proof. - A person asserting the defense under
      this section shall have the burden of establishing the defense by
      clear and convincing evidence.
        (5) Abandonment of use. - A person who has abandoned commercial
      use of subject matter may not rely on activities performed before
      the date of such abandonment in establishing a defense under this
      section with respect to actions taken after the date of such
      abandonment.
        (6) Personal defense. - The defense under this section may be
      asserted only by the person who performed the acts necessary to
      establish the defense and, except for any transfer to the patent
      owner, the right to assert the defense shall not be licensed or
      assigned or transferred to another person except as an ancillary
      and subordinate part of a good faith assignment or transfer for
      other reasons of the entire enterprise or line of business to
      which the defense relates.
        (7) Limitation on sites. - A defense under this section, when
      acquired as part of a good faith assignment or transfer of an
      entire enterprise or line of business to which the defense
      relates, may only be asserted for uses at sites where the subject
      matter that would otherwise infringe one or more of the claims is
      in use before the later of the effective filing date of the
      patent or the date of the assignment or transfer of such
      enterprise or line of business.
        (8) Unsuccessful assertion of defense. - If the defense under
      this section is pleaded by a person who is found to infringe the
      patent and who subsequently fails to demonstrate a reasonable
      basis for asserting the defense, the court shall find the case
      exceptional for the purpose of awarding attorney fees under
      section 285 of this title.
        (9) Invalidity. - A patent shall not be deemed to be invalid
      under section 102 or 103 of this title solely because a defense
      is raised or established under this section.

    TITLE 35 - PATENTS
    PART III - PATENTS AND PROTECTION OF PATENT RIGHTS
    CHAPTER 29 - REMEDIES FOR INFRINGEMENT OF PATENT, AND OTHER ACTIONS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 282. Presumption of validity; defenses

-STATUTE-
      A patent shall be presumed valid. Each claim of a patent (whether
    in independent, dependent, or multiple dependent form) shall be
    presumed valid independently of the validity of other claims;
    dependent or multiple dependent claims shall be presumed valid even
    though dependent upon an invalid claim. Notwithstanding the
    preceding sentence, if a claim to a composition of matter is held
    invalid and that claim was the basis of a determination of
    nonobviousness under section 103(b)(1), the process shall no longer
    be considered nonobvious solely on the basis of section 103(b)(1).
    The burden of establishing invalidity of a patent or any claim
    thereof shall rest on the party asserting such invalidity.
      The following shall be defenses in any action involving the
    validity or infringement of a patent and shall be pleaded:
        (1) Noninfringement, absence of liability for infringement or
      unenforceability,
        (2) Invalidity of the patent or any claim in suit on any ground
      specified in part II of this title as a condition for
      patentability,
        (3) Invalidity of the patent or any claim in suit for failure
      to comply with any requirement of sections 112 or 251 of this
      title,
        (4) Any other fact or act made a defense by this title.

      In actions involving the validity or infringement of a patent the
    party asserting invalidity or noninfringement shall give notice in
    the pleadings or otherwise in writing to the adverse party at least
    thirty days before the trial, of the country, number, date, and
    name of the patentee of any patent, the title, date, and page
    numbers of any publication to be relied upon as anticipation of the
    patent in suit or, except in actions in the United States Court of
    Federal Claims, as showing the state of the art, and the name and
    address of any person who may be relied upon as the prior inventor
    or as having prior knowledge of or as having previously used or
    offered for sale the invention of the patent in suit. In the
    absence of such notice proof of the said matters may not be made at
    the trial except on such terms as the court requires. Invalidity of
    the extension of a patent term or any portion thereof under section
    154(b) or 156 of this title because of the material failure - 
        (1) by the applicant for the extension, or
        (2) by the Director,

    to comply with the requirements of such section shall be a defense
    in any action involving the infringement of a patent during the
    period of the extension of its term and shall be pleaded. A due
    diligence determination under section 156(d)(2) is not subject to
    review in such an action.

    article, this can not be done, by fixing to it, or to the package
    wherein one or more of them is contained, a label containing a like
    notice. In the event of failure so to mark, no damages shall be
    recovered by the patentee in any action for infringement, except on
    proof that the infringer was notified of the infringement and
    continued to infringe thereafter, in which event damages may be
    recovered only for infringement occurring after such notice. Filing
    of an action for infringement shall constitute such notice.
      (b)(1) An infringer under section 271(g) shall be subject to all
    the provisions of this title relating to damages and injunctions
    except to the extent those remedies are modified by this subsection
    or section 9006 of the Process Patent Amendments Act of 1988. The
    modifications of remedies provided in this subsection shall not be
    available to any person who - 
        (A) practiced the patented process;
        (B) owns or controls, or is owned or controlled by, the person
      who practiced the patented process; or
        (C) had knowledge before the infringement that a patented
      process was used to make the product the importation, use, offer
      for sale, or sale of which constitutes the infringement.

      (2) No remedies for infringement under section 271(g) of this
    title shall be available with respect to any product in the
    possession of, or in transit to, the person subject to liability
    under such section before that person had notice of infringement
    with respect to that product. The person subject to liability shall
    bear the burden of proving any such possession or transit.
      (3)(A) In making a determination with respect to the remedy in an
    action brought for infringement under section 271(g), the court
    shall consider - 
        (i) the good faith demonstrated by the defendant with respect
      to a request for disclosure,
        (ii) the good faith demonstrated by the plaintiff with respect
      to a request for disclosure, and
        (iii) the need to restore the exclusive rights secured by the
      patent.

      (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the following are evidence
    of good faith:
        (i) a request for disclosure made by the defendant;
        (ii) a response within a reasonable time by the person
      receiving the request for disclosure; and
        (iii) the submission of the response by the defendant to the
      manufacturer, or if the manufacturer is not known, to the
      supplier, of the product to be purchased by the defendant,
      together with a request for a written statement that the process
      claimed in any patent disclosed in the response is not used to
      produce such product.

    The failure to perform any acts described in the preceding sentence
    is evidence of absence of good faith unless there are mitigating
    circumstances. Mitigating circumstances include the case in which,
    due to the nature of the product, the number of sources for the
    product, or like commercial circumstances, a request for disclosure
    is not necessary or practicable to avoid infringement.
      (4)(A) For purposes of this subsection, a "request for
    disclosure" means a written request made to a person then engaged
    in the manufacture of a product to identify all process patents
    owned by or licensed to that person, as of the time of the request,
    that the person then reasonably believes could be asserted to be
    infringed under section 271(g) if that product were imported into,
    or sold, offered for sale, or used in, the United States by an
    unauthorized person. A request for disclosure is further limited to
    a request - 
        (i) which is made by a person regularly engaged in the United
      States in the sale of the same type of products as those
      manufactured by the person to whom the request is directed, or
      which includes facts showing that the person making the request
      plans to engage in the sale of such products in the United
      States;
        (ii) which is made by such person before the person's first
      importation, use, offer for sale, or sale of units of the product
      produced by an infringing process and before the person had
      notice of infringement with respect to the product; and
        (iii) which includes a representation by the person making the
      request that such person will promptly submit the patents
      identified pursuant to the request to the manufacturer, or if the
      manufacturer is not known, to the supplier, of the product to be
      purchased by the person making the request, and will request from
      that manufacturer or supplier a written statement that none of
      the processes claimed in those patents is used in the manufacture
      of the product.

      (B) In the case of a request for disclosure received by a person
    to whom a patent is licensed, that person shall either identify the
    patent or promptly notify the licensor of the request for
    disclosure.
      (C) A person who has marked, in the manner prescribed by
    subsection (a), the number of the process patent on all products
    made by the patented process which have been offered for sale or
    sold by that person in the United States, or imported by the person
    into the United States, before a request for disclosure is received
    is not required to respond to the request for disclosure. For
    purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "all products" does
    not include products made before the effective date of the Process
    Patent Amendments Act of 1988.
      (5)(A) For purposes of this subsection, notice of infringement
    means actual knowledge, or receipt by a person of a written
    notification, or a combination thereof, of information sufficient
    to persuade a reasonable person that it is likely that a product
    was made by a process patented in the United States.
      (B) A written notification from the patent holder charging a
    person with infringement shall specify the patented process alleged
    to have been used and the reasons for a good faith belief that such
    process was used. The patent holder shall include in the
    notification such information as is reasonably necessary to explain
    fairly the patent holder's belief, except that the patent holder is
    not required to disclose any trade secret information.
      (C) A person who receives a written notification described in
    subparagraph (B) or a written response to a request for disclosure
    described in paragraph (4) shall be deemed to have notice of
    infringement with respect to any patent referred to in such written
    notification or response unless that person, absent mitigating
    circumstances - 
        (i) promptly transmits the written notification or response to
      the manufacturer or, if the manufacturer is not known, to the
      supplier, of the product purchased or to be purchased by that
      person; and
        (ii) receives a written statement from the manufacturer or
      supplier which on its face sets forth a well grounded factual
      basis for a belief that the identified patents are not infringed.

      (D) For purposes of this subsection, a person who obtains a
    product made by a process patented in the United States in a
    quantity which is abnormally large in relation to the volume of
    business of such person or an efficient inventory level shall be
    rebuttably presumed to have actual knowledge that the product was
    made by such patented process.
      (6) A person who receives a response to a request for disclosure
    under this subsection shall pay to the person to whom the request
    was made a reasonable fee to cover actual costs incurred in
    complying with the request, which may not exceed the cost of a
    commercially available automated patent search of the matter
    involved, but in no case more than $500.
      (c)(1) With respect to a medical practitioner's performance of a
    medical activity that constitutes an infringement under section
    271(a) or (b) of this title, the provisions of sections 281, 283,
    284, and 285 of this title shall not apply against the medical
    practitioner or against a related health care entity with respect
    to such medical activity.
      (2) For the purposes of this subsection:
        (A) the term "medical activity" means the performance of a
      medical or surgical procedure on a body, but shall not include
      (i) the use of a patented machine, manufacture, or composition of
      matter in violation of such patent, (ii) the practice of a
      patented use of a composition of matter in violation of such
      patent, or (iii) the practice of a process in violation of a
      biotechnology patent.
        (B) the term "medical practitioner" means any natural person
      who is licensed by a State to provide the medical activity
      described in subsection (c)(1) or who is acting under the
      direction of such person in the performance of the medical
      activity.
        (C) the term "related health care entity" shall mean an entity
      with which a medical practitioner has a professional affiliation
      under which the medical practitioner performs the medical
      activity, including but not limited to a nursing home, hospital,
      university, medical school, health maintenance organization,
      group medical practice, or a medical clinic.
        (D) the term "professional affiliation" shall mean staff
      privileges, medical staff membership, employment or contractual
      relationship, partnership or ownership interest, academic
      appointment, or other affiliation under which a medical
      practitioner provides the medical activity on behalf of, or in
      association with, the health care entity.
        (E) the term "body" shall mean a human body, organ or cadaver,
      or a nonhuman animal used in medical research or instruction
      directly relating to the treatment of humans.
        (F) the term "patented use of a composition of matter" does not
      include a claim for a method of performing a medical or surgical
      procedure on a body that recites the use of a composition of
      matter where the use of that composition of matter does not
      directly contribute to achievement of the objective of the
      claimed method.
        (G) the term "State" shall mean any state (!1) or territory of
      the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth
      of Puerto Rico.


      (3) This subsection does not apply to the activities of any
    person, or employee or agent of such person (regardless of whether
    such person is a tax exempt organization under section 501(c) of
    the Internal Revenue Code), who is engaged in the commercial
    development, manufacture, sale, importation, or distribution of a
    machine, manufacture, or composition of matter or the provision of
    pharmacy or clinical laboratory services (other than clinical
    laboratory services provided in a physician's office), where such
    activities are:
        (A) directly related to the commercial development,
      manufacture, sale, importation, or distribution of a machine,
      manufacture, or composition of matter or the provision of
      pharmacy or clinical laboratory services (other than clinical
      laboratory services provided in a physician's office), and
        (B) regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
      the Public Health Service Act, or the Clinical Laboratories
      Improvement Act.

      (4) This subsection shall not apply to any patent issued based on
    an application the earliest effective filing date of which is prior
    to September 30, 1996.

    States by or with the consent of the patentee; or
      Whoever marks upon, or affixes to, or uses in advertising in

    "patent pending," or any word importing that an application for
    patent has been made, when no application for patent has been made,
    or if made, is not pending, for the purpose of deceiving the public
    - 
      Shall be fined not more than $500 for every such offense.
      (b) Any person may sue for the penalty, in which event one-half
    shall go to the person suing and the other to the use of the United

-HEAD-
    Sec. 294. Voluntary arbitration

-STATUTE-
      (a) A contract involving a patent or any right under a patent may
    contain a provision requiring arbitration of any dispute relating
    to patent validity or infringement arising under the contract. In
    the absence of such a provision, the parties to an existing patent
    validity or infringement dispute may agree in writing to settle
    such dispute by arbitration. Any such provision or agreement shall
    be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, except for any grounds that
    exist at law or in equity for revocation of a contract.
      (b) Arbitration of such disputes, awards by arbitrators and
    confirmation of awards shall be governed by title 9, to the extent
    such title is not inconsistent with this section. In any such
    arbitration proceeding, the defenses provided for under section 282
    of this title shall be considered by the arbitrator if raised by
    any party to the proceeding.
      (c) An award by an arbitrator shall be final and binding between
    the parties to the arbitration but shall have no force or effect on
    any other person. The parties to an arbitration may agree that in
    the event a patent which is the subject matter of an award is
    subsequently determined to be invalid or unenforceable in a
    judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction from which
    no appeal can or has been taken, such award may be modified by any
    court of competent jurisdiction upon application by any party to
    the arbitration. Any such modification shall govern the rights and
    obligations between such parties from the date of such
    modification.
      (d) When an award is made by an arbitrator, the patentee, his
    assignee or licensee shall give notice thereof in writing to the
    Director. There shall be a separate notice prepared for each patent
    involved in such proceeding. Such notice shall set forth the names
    and addresses of the parties, the name of the inventor, and the
    name of the patent owner, shall designate the number of the patent,
    and shall contain a copy of the award. If an award is modified by a
    court, the party requesting such modification shall give notice of
    such modification to the Director. The Director shall, upon receipt
    of either notice, enter the same in the record of the prosecution
    of such patent. If the required notice is not filed with the
    Director, any party to the proceeding may provide such notice to
    the Director.
      (e) The award shall be unenforceable until the notice required by
    subsection (d) is received by the Director.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 297. Improper and deceptive invention promotion

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - An invention promoter shall have a duty to
    disclose the following information to a customer in writing, prior
    to entering into a contract for invention promotion services:
        (1) the total number of inventions evaluated by the invention
      promoter for commercial potential in the past 5 years, as well as
      the number of those inventions that received positive
      evaluations, and the number of those inventions that received
      negative evaluations;
        (2) the total number of customers who have contracted with the
      invention promoter in the past 5 years, not including customers
      who have purchased trade show services, research, advertising, or
      other nonmarketing services from the invention promoter, or who
      have defaulted in their payment to the invention promoter;
        (3) the total number of customers known by the invention
      promoter to have received a net financial profit as a direct
      result of the invention promotion services provided by such
      invention promoter;
        (4) the total number of customers known by the invention
      promoter to have received license agreements for their inventions
      as a direct result of the invention promotion services provided
      by such invention promoter; and
        (5) the names and addresses of all previous invention promotion
      companies with which the invention promoter or its officers have
      collectively or individually been affiliated in the previous 10
      years.

      (b) Civil Action. - (1) Any customer who enters into a contract
    with an invention promoter and who is found by a court to have been
    injured by any material false or fraudulent statement or
    representation, or any omission of material fact, by that invention
    promoter (or any agent, employee, director, officer, partner, or
    independent contractor of such invention promoter), or by the
    failure of that invention promoter to disclose such information as
    required under subsection (a), may recover in a civil action
    against the invention promoter (or the officers, directors, or
    partners of such invention promoter), in addition to reasonable
    costs and attorneys' fees - 
        (A) the amount of actual damages incurred by the customer; or
        (B) at the election of the customer at any time before final
      judgment is rendered, statutory damages in a sum of not more than
      $5,000, as the court considers just.

      (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in a case where the customer
    sustains the burden of proof, and the court finds, that the
    invention promoter intentionally misrepresented or omitted a
    material fact to such customer, or willfully failed to disclose
    such information as required under subsection (a), with the purpose
    of deceiving that customer, the court may increase damages to not
    more than three times the amount awarded, taking into account past
    complaints made against the invention promoter that resulted in
    regulatory sanctions or other corrective actions based on those
    records compiled by the Commissioner of Patents under subsection
    (d).
      (c) Definitions. - For purposes of this section -

-STATUTE-
      (a) Within three months following the filing of a request for
    reexamination under the provisions of section 302 of this title,
    the Director will determine whether a substantial new question of
    patentability affecting any claim of the patent concerned is raised
    by the request, with or without consideration of other patents or
    printed publications. On his own initiative, and any time, the
    Director may determine whether a substantial new question of
    patentability is raised by patents and publications discovered by
    him or cited under the provisions of section 301 of this title. The
    existence of a substantial new question of patentability is not
    precluded by the fact that a patent or printed publication was
    previously cited by or to the Office or considered by the Office.
      (b) A record of the Director's determination under subsection (a)
    of this section will be placed in the official file of the patent,
    and a copy promptly will be given or mailed to the owner of record
    of the patent and to the person requesting reexamination, if any.
      (c) A determination by the Director pursuant to subsection (a) of
    this section that no substantial new question of patentability has
    been raised will be final and nonappealable. Upon such a
    determination, the Director may refund a portion of the
    reexamination fee required under section 302 of this title.

-STATUTE-
      (a) In a reexamination proceeding under this chapter, when the
    time for appeal has expired or any appeal proceeding has
    terminated, the Director will issue and publish a certificate
    canceling any claim of the patent finally determined to be
    unpatentable, confirming any claim of the patent determined to be

    Director shall determine whether a substantial new question of
    patentability affecting any claim of the patent concerned is raised

-STATUTE-
      (a) Patent Owner. - The patent owner involved in an inter partes
    reexamination proceeding under this chapter - 
        (1) may appeal under the provisions of section 134 and may
      appeal under the provisions of sections 141 through 144, with
      respect to any decision adverse to the patentability of any
      original or proposed amended or new claim of the patent; and
        (2) may be a party to any appeal taken by a third-party
      requester under subsection (b).

      (b) Third-Party Requester. - A third-party requester - 
        (1) may appeal under the provisions of section 134, and may
      appeal under the provisions of sections 141 through 144, with
      respect to any final decision favorable to the patentability of
      any original or proposed amended or new claim of the patent; and
        (2) may, subject to subsection (c), be a party to any appeal
      taken by the patent owner under the provisions of section 134 or
      sections 141 through 144.

      (c) Civil Action. - A third-party requester whose request for an
    inter partes reexamination results in an order under section 313 is
    estopped from asserting at a later time, in any civil action
    arising in whole or in part under section 1338 of title 28, the
    invalidity of any claim finally determined to be valid and
    patentable on any ground which the third-party requester raised or
    could have raised during the inter partes reexamination
    proceedings. This subsection does not prevent the assertion of
    invalidity based on newly discovered prior art unavailable to the
    third-party requester and the Patent and Trademark Office at the
    time of the inter partes reexamination proceedings.

      (b) Amended or New Claim. - Any proposed amended or new claim
    determined to be patentable and incorporated into a patent

    used within the United States, or imported into the United States,
    anything patented by such proposed amended or new claim, or who

-HEAD-
    Sec. 317. Inter partes reexamination prohibited

-STATUTE-
      (a) Order for Reexamination. - Notwithstanding any provision of
    this chapter, once an order for inter partes reexamination of a
    patent has been issued under section 313, neither the third-party
    requester nor its privies,(!1) may file a subsequent request for
    inter partes reexamination of the patent until an inter partes
    reexamination certificate is issued and published under section
    316, unless authorized by the Director.

      (b) Final Decision. - Once a final decision has been entered
    against a party in a civil action arising in whole or in part under
    section 1338 of title 28,(!1) that the party has not sustained its
    burden of proving the invalidity of any patent claim in suit or if
    a final decision in an inter partes reexamination proceeding
    instituted by a third-party requester is favorable to the
    patentability of any original or proposed amended or new claim of
    the patent, then neither that party nor its privies may thereafter
    request an inter partes reexamination of any such patent claim on
    the basis of issues which that party or its privies raised or could
    have raised in such civil action or inter partes reexamination
    proceeding, and an inter partes reexamination requested by that
    party or its privies on the basis of such issues may not thereafter
    be maintained by the Office, notwithstanding any other provision of
    this chapter. This subsection does not prevent the assertion of
    invalidity based on newly discovered prior art unavailable to the
    third-party requester and the Patent and Trademark Office at the
    time of the inter partes reexamination proceedings.

-STATUTE-
      Once an order for inter partes reexamination of a patent has been
    issued under section 313, the patent owner may obtain a stay of any
    pending litigation which involves an issue of patentability of any
    claims of the patent which are the subject of the inter partes
    reexamination order, unless the court before which such litigation
    is pending determines that a stay would not serve the interests of
    justice.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Receipt from the International Bureau of copies of
    international applications with any amendments to the claims,
    international search reports, and international preliminary
    examination reports including any annexes thereto may be required
    in the case of international applications designating or electing
    the United States.
      (b) Subject to subsection (f) of this section, the national stage
    shall commence with the expiration of the applicable time limit
    under article 22(1) or (2), or under article 39(1)(a) of the treaty
    (!1)

      (c) The applicant shall file in the Patent and Trademark Office -
    
        (1) the national fee provided in section 41(a) of this title;
        (2) a copy of the international application, unless not
      required under subsection (a) of this section or already
      communicated by the International Bureau, and a translation into
      the English language of the international application, if it was
      filed in another language;
        (3) amendments, if any, to the claims in the international
      application, made under article 19 of the treaty, unless such
      amendments have been communicated to the Patent and Trademark
      Office by the International Bureau, and a translation into the
      English language if such amendments were made in another
      language;
        (4) an oath or declaration of the inventor (or other person
      authorized under chapter 11 of this title) complying with the
      requirements of section 115 of this title and with regulations
      prescribed for oaths or declarations of applicants;
        (5) a translation into the English language of any annexes to
      the international preliminary examination report, if such annexes
      were made in another language.

      (d) The requirements with respect to the national fee referred to
    in subsection (c)(1), the translation referred to in subsection
    (c)(2), and the oath or declaration referred to in subsection
    (c)(4) of this section shall be complied with by the date of the
    commencement of the national stage or by such later time as may be
    fixed by the Director. The copy of the international application
    referred to in subsection (c)(2) shall be submitted by the date of
    the commencement of the national stage. Failure to comply with
    these requirements shall be regarded as abandonment of the
    application by the parties thereof, unless it be shown to the
    satisfaction of the Director that such failure to comply was
    unavoidable. The payment of a surcharge may be required as a
    condition of accepting the national fee referred to in subsection
    (c)(1) or the oath or declaration referred to in subsection (c)(4)
    of this section if these requirements are not met by the date of
    the commencement of the national stage. The requirements of
    subsection (c)(3) of this section shall be complied with by the
    date of the commencement of the national stage, and failure to do
    so shall be regarded as a cancellation of the amendments to the
    claims in the international application made under article 19 of
    the treaty. The requirement of subsection (c)(5) shall be complied
    with at such time as may be fixed by the Director and failure to do
    so shall be regarded as cancellation of the amendments made under
    article 34(2)(b) of the treaty.
      (e) After an international application has entered the national
    stage, no patent may be granted or refused thereon before the
    expiration of the applicable time limit under article 28 or article
    41 of the treaty, except with the express consent of the applicant.
    The applicant may present amendments to the specification, claims
    and drawings of the application after the national stage has
    commenced.
      (f) At the express request of the applicant, the national stage
    of processing may be commenced at any time at which the application
    is in order for such purpose and the applicable requirements of
    subsection (c) of this section have been complied with.

    stage if it was filed by anyone not qualified under chapter 11 of

    shall not serve as the basis for the benefit of an earlier filing
    date under section 120 of this title in a subsequently filed
    application, but may serve as the basis for a claim of the right of
    priority under subsections (a) through (d) of section 119 of this
    title, if the United States was not the sole country designated in
    such international application.

      Chapter 38, as added by Pub. L. 96-517, Sec. 6(a), Dec. 12, 1980,
    94 Stat. 3018, was originally editorially inserted after chapter 17
    of this title because the probable intent of Congress was to
    designate the chapter as "18", in view of the numerical designation
    of the sections contained in the chapter as sections 200 to 211 and
    in view of the subject matter of the chapter in relation to the
    subject matter of Part II of this title. Pub. L. 97-256, title I,
    Sec. 101(5), Sept. 8, 1982, 96 Stat. 816, redesignated chapter 38
    as chapter 18 and transferred chapter 18, as so redesignated, from
    the end of this part to the end of Part II. See 1982 Amendment note
