    and amended text generally. Prior to amendment, text read as
    follows: "The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, 'I pledge
    allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the
    Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible,
    with liberty and justice for all.', should be rendered by standing

                                 FINDINGS                             
      Pub. L. 107-293, Sec. 1, Nov. 13, 2002, 116 Stat. 2057, provided
    that: "Congress finds the following:
        "(1) On November 11, 1620, prior to embarking for the shores of
      America, the Pilgrims signed the Mayflower Compact that declared:
      'Having undertaken, for the Glory of God and the advancement of
      the Christian Faith and honor of our King and country, a voyage
      to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia,'.
        "(2) On July 4, 1776, America's Founding Fathers, after
      appealing to the 'Laws of Nature, and of Nature's God' to justify
      their separation from Great Britain, then declared: 'We hold
      these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal,
      that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
      Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of
      Happiness'.
        "(3) In 1781, Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration
      of Independence and later the Nation's third President, in his
      work titled 'Notes on the State of Virginia' wrote: 'God who gave
      us life gave us liberty. And can the liberties of a nation be
      thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a
      conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of
      the Gift of God. That they are not to be violated but with His
      wrath? Indeed, I tremble for my country when I reflect that God
      is just; that his justice cannot sleep forever.'
        "(4) On May 14, 1787, George Washington, as President of the
      Constitutional Convention, rose to admonish and exhort the
      delegates and declared: 'If to please the people we offer what we
      ourselves disapprove, how can we afterward defend our work? Let
      us raise a standard to which the wise and the honest can repair;
      the event is in the hand of God!'
        "(5) On July 21, 1789, on the same day that it approved the
      Establishment Clause concerning religion, the First Congress of
      the United States also passed the Northwest Ordinance, providing
      for a territorial government for lands northwest of the Ohio
      River, which declared: 'Religion, morality, and knowledge, being
      necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind,
      schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.'
        "(6) On September 25, 1789, the First Congress unanimously
      approved a resolution calling on President George Washington to
      proclaim a National Day of Thanksgiving for the people of the
      United States by declaring, 'a day of public thanksgiving and
      prayer, to be observed by acknowledging, with grateful hearts,
      the many signal favors of Almighty God, especially by affording
      them an opportunity peaceably to establish a constitution of
      government for their safety and happiness.'
        "(7) On November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln delivered
      his Gettysburg Address on the site of the battle and declared:
      'It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task
      remaining before us - that from these honored dead we take
      increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last
      full measure of devotion - that we here highly resolve that these
      dead shall not have died in vain - that this Nation, under God,
      shall have a new birth of freedom - and that Government of the
      people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the
      earth.'
        "(8) On April 28, 1952, in the decision of the Supreme Court of
      the United States in Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306 (1952), in
      which school children were allowed to be excused from public
      schools for religious observances and education, Justice William
      O. Douglas, in writing for the Court stated: 'The First
      Amendment, however, does not say that in every and all respects
      there shall be a separation of Church and State. Rather, it
      studiously defines the manner, the specific ways, in which there
      shall be no concern or union or dependency one on the other. That
      is the common sense of the matter. Otherwise the State and
      religion would be aliens to each other - hostile, suspicious, and
      even unfriendly. Churches could not be required to pay even
      property taxes. Municipalities would not be permitted to render
      police or fire protection to religious groups. Policemen who
      helped parishioners into their places of worship would violate
      the Constitution. Prayers in our legislative halls; the appeals
      to the Almighty in the messages of the Chief Executive; the
      proclamations making Thanksgiving Day a holiday; "so help me God"
      in our courtroom oaths - these and all other references to the
      Almighty that run through our laws, our public rituals, our
      ceremonies would be flouting the First Amendment. A fastidious
      atheist or agnostic could even object to the supplication with
      which the Court opens each session: "God save the United States
      and this Honorable Court." '
        "(9) On June 15, 1954, Congress passed and President Eisenhower
      signed into law a statute that was clearly consistent with the
      text and intent of the Constitution of the United States, that
      amended the Pledge of Allegiance to read: 'I pledge allegiance to
      the Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for
      which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty
      and justice for all.'
        "(10) On July 20, 1956, Congress proclaimed that the national
      motto of the United States is 'In God We Trust', and that motto
      is inscribed above the main door of the Senate, behind the Chair
      of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and on the
      currency of the United States.
        "(11) On June 17, 1963, in the decision of the Supreme Court of
      the United States in Abington School District v. Schempp, 374
      U.S. 203 (1963), in which compulsory school prayer was held
      unconstitutional, Justices Goldberg and Harlan, concurring in the
      decision, stated: 'But untutored devotion to the concept of
      neutrality can lead to invocation or approval of results which
      partake not simply of that noninterference and noninvolvement
      with the religious which the Constitution commands, but of a
      brooding and pervasive devotion to the secular and a passive, or
      even active, hostility to the religious. Such results are not
      only not compelled by the Constitution, but, it seems to me, are
      prohibited by it. Neither government nor this Court can or should
      ignore the significance of the fact that a vast portion of our
      people believe in and worship God and that many of our legal,
      political, and personal values derive historically from religious
      teachings. Government must inevitably take cognizance of the
      existence of religion and, indeed, under certain circumstances
      the First Amendment may require that it do so.'
        "(12) On March 5, 1984, in the decision of the Supreme Court of
      the United States in Lynch v. Donelly, 465 U.S. 668 (1984), in
      which a city government's display of a nativity scene was held to
      be constitutional, Chief Justice Burger, writing for the Court,
      stated: 'There is an unbroken history of official acknowledgment
      by all three branches of government of the role of religion in
      American life from at least 1789 .  .  . [E]xamples of reference
      to our religious heritage are found in the statutorily prescribed
      national motto "In God We Trust" (36 U.S.C. 186) [now 36 U.S.C.
      302], which Congress and the President mandated for our currency,
      see (31 U.S.C. 5112(d)(1) (1982 ed.)), and in the language "One
      Nation under God", as part of the Pledge of Allegiance to the
      American flag. That pledge is recited by many thousands of public
      school children - and adults - every year .  .  . Art galleries
      supported by public revenues display religious paintings of the
      15th and 16th centuries, predominantly inspired by one religious
      faith. The National Gallery in Washington, maintained with
      Government support, for example, has long exhibited masterpieces
      with religious messages, notably the Last Supper, and paintings
      depicting the Birth of Christ, the Crucifixion, and the
      Resurrection, among many others with explicit Christian themes
      and messages. The very chamber in which oral arguments on this
      case were heard is decorated with a notable and permanent - not
      seasonal - symbol of religion: Moses with the Ten Commandments.
      Congress has long provided chapels in the Capitol for religious
      worship and meditation.'
        "(13) On June 4, 1985, in the decision of the Supreme Court of
      the United States in Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38 (1985), in
      which a mandatory moment of silence to be used for meditation or
      voluntary prayer was held unconstitutional, Justice O'Connor,
      concurring in the judgment and addressing the contention that the
      Court's holding would render the Pledge of Allegiance
      unconstitutional because Congress amended it in 1954 to add the
      words 'under God,' stated 'In my view, the words "under God" in
      the Pledge, as codified at (36 U.S.C. 172) [now 4 U.S.C. 4],
      serve as an acknowledgment of religion with "the legitimate
      secular purposes of solemnizing public occasions, [and]
      expressing confidence in the future." '
        "(14) On November 20, 1992, the United States Court of Appeals
      for the 7th Circuit, in Sherman v. Community Consolidated School
      District 21, 980 F.2d 437 (7th Cir. 1992), held that a school
      district's policy for voluntary recitation of the Pledge of
      Allegiance including the words 'under God' was constitutional.
        "(15) The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals erroneously held, in
      Newdow v. U.S. Congress (9th Cir. June 26, 2002), that the Pledge
      of Allegiance's use of the express religious reference 'under
      God' violates the First Amendment to the Constitution, and that,
      therefore, a school district's policy and practice of teacher-led
      voluntary recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance is
      unconstitutional.
        "(16) The erroneous rationale of the 9th Circuit Court of
      Appeals in Newdow would lead to the absurd result that the
      Constitution's use of the express religious reference 'Year of
      our Lord' in Article VII violates the First Amendment to the
      Constitution, and that, therefore, a school district's policy and
      practice of teacher-led voluntary recitations of the Constitution
      itself would be unconstitutional."

                         REAFFIRMATION OF LANGUAGE                     
      Pub. L. 107-293, Sec. 2(b), Nov. 13, 2002, 116 Stat. 2060,
    provided that: "In codifying this subsection [probably should be
    "section", meaning section 2 of Pub. L. 107-293, which amended this
    section], the Office of the Law Revision Counsel shall show in the
    historical and statutory notes that the 107th Congress reaffirmed
    the exact language that has appeared in the Pledge for decades."

    TITLE 4 - FLAG AND SEAL, SEAT OF GOVERNMENT, AND THE STATES
    CHAPTER 1 - THE FLAG

-HEAD-
    Sec. 7. Position and manner of display

-STATUTE-
      The flag, when carried in a procession with another flag or
    flags, should be either on the marching right; that is, the flag's
    own right, or, if there is a line of other flags, in front of the
    center of that line.
      (a) The flag should not be displayed on a float in a parade
    except from a staff, or as provided in subsection (i) of this
    section.
      (b) The flag should not be draped over the hood, top, sides, or
    back of a vehicle or of a railroad train or a boat. When the flag
    is displayed on a motorcar, the staff shall be fixed firmly to the
    chassis or clamped to the right fender.
      (c) No other flag or pennant should be placed above or, if on the
    same level, to the right of the flag of the United States of
    America, except during church services conducted by naval chaplains
    at sea, when the church pennant may be flown above the flag during
    church services for the personnel of the Navy. No person shall
    display the flag of the United Nations or any other national or
    international flag equal, above, or in a position of superior
    prominence or honor to, or in place of, the flag of the United
    States at any place within the United States or any Territory or
    possession thereof: Provided, That nothing in this section shall
    make unlawful the continuance of the practice heretofore followed
    of displaying the flag of the United Nations in a position of
    superior prominence or honor, and other national flags in positions
    of equal prominence or honor, with that of the flag of the United
    States at the headquarters of the United Nations.
      (d) The flag of the United States of America, when it is
    displayed with another flag against a wall from crossed staffs,
    should be on the right, the flag's own right, and its staff should
    be in front of the staff of the other flag.
      (e) The flag of the United States of America should be at the
    center and at the highest point of the group when a number of flags
    of States or localities or pennants of societies are grouped and
    displayed from staffs.
      (f) When flags of States, cities, or localities, or pennants of
    societies are flown on the same halyard with the flag of the United
    States, the latter should always be at the peak. When the flags are
    flown from adjacent staffs, the flag of the United States should be
    hoisted first and lowered last. No such flag or pennant may be
    placed above the flag of the United States or to the United States
    flag's right.
      (g) When flags of two or more nations are displayed, they are to
    be flown from separate staffs of the same height. The flags should
    be of approximately equal size. International usage forbids the
    display of the flag of one nation above that of another nation in
    time of peace.
      (h) When the flag of the United States is displayed from a staff
    projecting horizontally or at an angle from the window sill,
    balcony, or front of a building, the union of the flag should be
    placed at the peak of the staff unless the flag is at half-staff.
    When the flag is suspended over a sidewalk from a rope extending
    from a house to a pole at the edge of the sidewalk, the flag should
    be hoisted out, union first, from the building.
      (i) When displayed either horizontally or vertically against a
    wall, the union should be uppermost and to the flag's own right,
    that is, to the observer's left. When displayed in a window, the
    flag should be displayed in the same way, with the union or blue
    field to the left of the observer in the street.
      (j) When the flag is displayed over the middle of the street, it
    should be suspended vertically with the union to the north in an
    east and west street or to the east in a north and south street.
      (k) When used on a speaker's platform, the flag, if displayed
    flat, should be displayed above and behind the speaker. When
    displayed from a staff in a church or public auditorium, the flag
    of the United States of America should hold the position of
    superior prominence, in advance of the audience, and in the
    position of honor at the clergyman's or speaker's right as he faces
    the audience. Any other flag so displayed should be placed on the
    left of the clergyman or speaker or to the right of the audience.
      (l) The flag should form a distinctive feature of the ceremony of
    unveiling a statue or monument, but it should never be used as the
    covering for the statue or monument.
      (m) The flag, when flown at half-staff, should be first hoisted
    to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff
    position. The flag should be again raised to the peak before it is
    lowered for the day. On Memorial Day the flag should be displayed
    at half-staff until noon only, then raised to the top of the staff.
    By order of the President, the flag shall be flown at half-staff
    upon the death of principal figures of the United States Government
    and the Governor of a State, territory, or possession, as a mark of
    respect to their memory. In the event of the death of other
    officials or foreign dignitaries, the flag is to be displayed at
    half-staff according to Presidential instructions or orders, or in
    accordance with recognized customs or practices not inconsistent
    with law. In the event of the death of a present or former official
    of the government of any State, territory, or possession of the
    United States or the death of a member of the Armed Forces from any
    State, territory, or possession who dies while serving on active
    duty, the Governor of that State, territory, or possession may
    proclaim that the National flag shall be flown at half-staff, and
    the same authority is provided to the Mayor of the District of
    Columbia with respect to present or former officials of the
    District of Columbia and members of the Armed Forces from the
    District of Columbia. When the Governor of a State, territory, or
    possession, or the Mayor of the District of Columbia, issues a
    proclamation under the preceding sentence that the National flag be
    flown at half-staff in that State, territory, or possession or in
    the District of Columbia because of the death of a member of the
    Armed Forces, the National flag flown at any Federal installation
    or facility in the area covered by that proclamation shall be flown
    at half-staff consistent with that proclamation. The flag shall be
    flown at half-staff 30 days from the death of the President or a
    former President; 10 days from the day of death of the Vice
    President, the Chief Justice or a retired Chief Justice of the
    United States, or the Speaker of the House of Representatives; from
    the day of death until interment of an Associate Justice of the
    Supreme Court, a Secretary of an executive or military department,
    a former Vice President, or the Governor of a State, territory, or
    possession; and on the day of death and the following day for a
    Member of Congress. The flag shall be flown at half-staff on Peace
    Officers Memorial Day, unless that day is also Armed Forces Day. As
    used in this subsection - 
        (1) the term "half-staff" means the position of the flag when
      it is one-half the distance between the top and bottom of the
      staff;
        (2) the term "executive or military department" means any
      agency listed under sections 101 and 102 of title 5, United
      States Code; and
        (3) the term "Member of Congress" means a Senator, a
      Representative, a Delegate, or the Resident Commissioner from
      Puerto Rico.

      (n) When the flag is used to cover a casket, it should be so
    placed that the union is at the head and over the left shoulder.
    The flag should not be lowered into the grave or allowed to touch
    the ground.
      (o) When the flag is suspended across a corridor or lobby in a
    building with only one main entrance, it should be suspended
    vertically with the union of the flag to the observer's left upon
    entering. If the building has more than one main entrance, the flag
    should be suspended vertically near the center of the corridor or
    lobby with the union to the north, when entrances are to the east
    and west or to the east when entrances are to the north and south.
    If there are entrances in more than two directions, the union
    should be to the east.

    CHAPTER 1 - THE FLAG

-HEAD-
    Sec. 8. Respect for flag

-STATUTE-
      No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of
    America; the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing.
    Regimental colors, State flags, and organization or institutional
    flags are to be dipped as a mark of honor.
      (a) The flag should never be displayed with the union down,
    except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger
    to life or property.
      (b) The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the
    ground, the floor, water, or merchandise.
      (c) The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but
    always aloft and free.
      (d) The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or
    drapery. It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in
    folds, but always allowed to fall free. Bunting of blue, white, and
    red, always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle,
    and the red below, should be used for covering a speaker's desk,
    draping the front of the platform, and for decoration in general.
      (e) The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored
    in such a manner as to permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or
    damaged in any way.
      (f) The flag should never be used as a covering for a ceiling.
      (g) The flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of
    it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure,
    design, picture, or drawing of any nature.
      (h) The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving,
    holding, carrying, or delivering anything.
      (i) The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any
    manner whatsoever. It should not be embroidered on such articles as
    cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise
    impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed
    for temporary use and discard. Advertising signs should not be
    fastened to a staff or halyard from which the flag is flown.
      (j) No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or
    athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to the
    uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of
    patriotic organizations. The flag represents a living country and
    is itself considered a living thing. Therefore, the lapel flag pin
    being a replica, should be worn on the left lapel near the heart.
      (k) The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a
    fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way,
    preferably by burning.

      Proc. No. 2605, Feb. 18, 1944, 9 F.R. 1957, 58 Stat. 1126,
    provided:
      The flag of the United States of America is universally
    representative of the principles of the justice, liberty, and
    democracy enjoyed by the people of the United States; and
      People all over the world recognize the flag of the United States
    as symbolic of the United States; and
      The effective prosecution of the war requires a proper
    understanding by the people of other countries of the material
    assistance being given by the Government of the United States:
      NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the power vested in me by the
    Constitution and laws of the United States, particularly by the
    Joint Resolution approved June 22, 1942, as amended by the Joint
    Resolution approved December 22, 1942 [now sections 4 to 10 of this
    title], as President and Commander in Chief, it is hereby
    proclaimed as follows:
      1. The use of the flag of the United States or any representation
    thereof, if approved by the Foreign Economic Administration, on
    labels, packages, cartons, cases, or other containers for articles
    or products of the United States intended for export as lend-lease
    aid, as relief and rehabilitation aid, or as emergency supplies for
    the Territories and possessions of the United States, or similar
    purposes, shall be considered a proper use of the flag of the
    United States and consistent with the honor and respect due to the
    flag.
      2. If any article or product so labelled, packaged or otherwise
    bearing the flag of the United States or any representation
    thereof, as provided for in section 1, should, by force of
    circumstances, be diverted to the ordinary channels of domestic
    trade, no person shall be considered as violating the rules and
    customs pertaining to the display of the flag of the United States,
    as set forth in the Joint Resolution approved June 22, 1942, as
    amended by the Joint Resolution approved December 22, 1942 (U.S.C.,
    Supp. II, title 36, secs. 171-178) [now sections 4 to 10 of this
    title] for possessing, transporting, displaying, selling or
    otherwise transferring any such article or product solely because
    the label, package, carton, case, or other container bears the flag
    of the United States or any representation thereof.

        Revenue Code of 1986 that is exempt under section 501(a) from
        taxation;
          (B) a simplified employee pension as defined in section

          (G) a governmental plan (as defined in section 414(d) of such
        Code);
          (H) a trust described in section 501(c)(18) of such Code; or
          (I) any plan, program, or arrangement described in section
        3121(v)(2)(C) of such Code (or any plan, program, or
        arrangement that is in writing, that provides for retirement
        payments in recognition of prior service to be made to a
        retired partner, and that is in effect immediately before
        retirement begins), if such income - 
            (i) is part of a series of substantially equal periodic
          payments (not less frequently than annually which may include
          income described in subparagraphs (A) through (H)) made for -
          
              (I) the life or life expectancy of the recipient (or the
            joint lives or joint life expectancies of the recipient and
            the designated beneficiary of the recipient), or
              (II) a period of not less than 10 years, or

            (ii) is a payment received after termination of employment
          and under a plan, program, or arrangement (to which such
          employment relates) maintained solely for the purpose of
          providing retirement benefits for employees in excess of the
          limitations imposed by 1 or more of sections 401(a)(17),
          401(k), 401(m), 402(g), 403(b), 408(k), or 415 of such Code
          or any other limitation on contributions or benefits in such
          Code on plans to which any of such sections apply.

        The fact that payments may be adjusted from time to time
        pursuant to such plan, program, or arrangement to limit total
        disbursements under a predetermined formula, or to provide cost
        of living or similar adjustments, will not cause the periodic
        payments provided under such plan, program, or arrangement to
        fail the "substantially equal periodic payments" test.

      Such term includes any retired or retainer pay of a member or
      former member of a uniform service computed under chapter 71 of
      title 10, United States Code.
        (2) The term "income tax" has the meaning given such term by
      section 110(c).
        (3) The term "State" includes any political subdivision of a
      State, the District of Columbia, and the possessions of the
      United States.
        (4) For purposes of this section, the term "retired partner" is
      an individual who is described as a partner in section 7701(a)(2)
      of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and who is retired under
      such individual's partnership agreement.

      (e) (!1) Nothing in this section shall be construed as having any
    effect on the application of section 514 of the Employee Retirement
    Income Security Act of 1974.

      (a) Application of This Section Through Section 126. - This
    section through (!1) 126 of this title apply to any tax, charge, or
    fee levied by a taxing jurisdiction as a fixed charge for each
    customer or measured by gross amounts charged to customers for
    mobile telecommunications services, regardless of whether such tax,
    charge, or fee is imposed on the vendor or customer of the service
    and regardless of the terminology used to describe the tax, charge,
    or fee.

      (b) General Exceptions. - This section through (!1) 126 of this
    title do not apply to - 
        (1) any tax, charge, or fee levied upon or measured by the net
      income, capital stock, net worth, or property value of the
      provider of mobile telecommunications service;
        (2) any tax, charge, or fee that is applied to an equitably
      apportioned amount that is not determined on a transactional
      basis;
        (3) any tax, charge, or fee that represents compensation for a
      mobile telecommunications service provider's use of public rights
      of way or other public property, provided that such tax, charge,
      or fee is not levied by the taxing jurisdiction as a fixed charge
      for each customer or measured by gross amounts charged to
      customers for mobile telecommunication services;
        (4) any generally applicable business and occupation tax that
      is imposed by a State, is applied to gross receipts or gross
      proceeds, is the legal liability of the home service provider,
      and that statutorily allows the home service provider to elect to

      mobile telecommunications services or subsequent resale of such
      services, whether as sales of such services alone or as a part of
      a bundled product, if the Internet Tax Freedom Act would preclude
      a taxing jurisdiction from subjecting the charges of the sale of
      such services to a tax, charge, or fee, but this section provides
      no evidence of the intent of Congress with respect to the
      applicability of the Internet Tax Freedom Act to such charges;
      and
        (3) do not apply to the determination of the taxing situs of
      air-ground radiotelephone service as defined in section 22.99 of
      title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations as in effect on June
      1, 1999.

      jurisdictional codes

-STATUTE-
      (a) Electronic Database. - 
        (1) Provision of database. - A State may provide an electronic
      database to a home service provider or, if a State does not
      provide such an electronic database to home service providers,
      then the designated database provider may provide an electronic
      database to a home service provider.
        (2) Format. - (A) Such electronic database, whether provided by
      the State or the designated database provider, shall be provided
      in a format approved by the American National Standards
      Institute's Accredited Standards Committee X12, that, allowing
      for de minimis deviations, designates for each street address in
      the State, including to the extent practicable, any multiple
      postal street addresses applicable to one street location, the
      appropriate taxing jurisdictions, and the appropriate code for
      each taxing jurisdiction, for each level of taxing jurisdiction,
      identified by one nationwide standard numeric code.
        (B) Such electronic database shall also provide the appropriate
      code for each street address with respect to political
      subdivisions which are not taxing jurisdictions when reasonably
      needed to determine the proper taxing jurisdiction.
        (C) The nationwide standard numeric codes shall contain the
      same number of numeric digits with each digit or combination of
      digits referring to the same level of taxing jurisdiction
      throughout the United States using a format similar to FIPS 55-3
      or other appropriate standard approved by the Federation of Tax
      Administrators and the Multistate Tax Commission, or their
      successors. Each address shall be provided in standard postal
      format.

      (b) Notice; Updates. - A State or designated database provider
    that provides or maintains an electronic database described in
    subsection (a) shall provide notice of the availability of the then
    current electronic database, and any subsequent revisions thereof,
    by publication in the manner normally employed for the publication
    of informational tax, charge, or fee notices to taxpayers in such
    State.
      (c) User Held Harmless. - A home service provider using the data
    contained in an electronic database described in subsection (a)
    shall be held harmless from any tax, charge, or fee liability that
    otherwise would be due solely as a result of any error or omission
    in such database provided by a State or designated database
    provider. The home service provider shall reflect changes made to
    such database during a calendar quarter not later than 30 days
    after the end of such calendar quarter for each State that issues
    notice of the availability of an electronic database reflecting
    such changes under subsection (b).

    Sec. 120. Procedure if no electronic database provided

-STATUTE-
      (a) Safe Harbor. - If neither a State nor designated database
    provider provides an electronic database under section 119, a home
    service provider shall be held harmless from any tax, charge, or
    fee liability in such State that otherwise would be due solely as a
    result of an assignment of a street address to an incorrect taxing
    jurisdiction if, subject to section 121, the home service provider
    employs an enhanced zip code to assign each street address to a
    specific taxing jurisdiction for each level of taxing jurisdiction
    and exercises due diligence at each level of taxing jurisdiction to
    ensure that each such street address is assigned to the correct
    taxing jurisdiction. If an enhanced zip code overlaps boundaries of
    taxing jurisdictions of the same level, the home service provider
    must designate one specific jurisdiction within such enhanced zip
    code for use in taxing the activity for such enhanced zip code for
    each level of taxing jurisdiction. Any enhanced zip code assignment
    changed in accordance with section 121 is deemed to be in
    compliance with this section. For purposes of this section, there
    is a rebuttable presumption that a home service provider has
    exercised due diligence if such home service provider demonstrates
    that it has - 
        (1) expended reasonable resources to implement and maintain an
      appropriately detailed electronic database of street address
      assignments to taxing jurisdictions;
        (2) implemented and maintained reasonable internal controls to
      promptly correct misassignments of street addresses to taxing
      jurisdictions; and
        (3) used all reasonably obtainable and usable data pertaining
      to municipal annexations, incorporations, reorganizations and any
      other changes in jurisdictional boundaries that materially affect
      the accuracy of such database.

      (b) Termination of Safe Harbor. - Subsection (a) applies to a
    home service provider that is in compliance with the requirements
    of subsection (a), with respect to a State for which an electronic
    database is not provided under section 119 until the later of - 
        (1) 18 months after the nationwide standard numeric code
      described in section 119(a) has been approved by the Federation
      of Tax Administrators and the Multistate Tax Commission; or
        (2) 6 months after such State or a designated database provider
      in such State provides such database as prescribed in section
      119(a).

        (1) determine that the address used for purposes of determining
      the taxing jurisdictions to which taxes, charges, or fees for
      mobile telecommunications services are remitted does not meet the
      definition of place of primary use in section 124(8) and give

        (2) determine that the assignment of a taxing jurisdiction by a
      home service provider under section 120 does not reflect the
      correct taxing jurisdiction and give binding notice to the home
      service provider to change the assignment on a prospective basis
      from the date of notice of determination if -

    primary use (as defined in section 124). Subject to section 121,
    and if the home service provider's reliance on information provided

        (1) allow a home service provider to rely on the applicable
      residential or business street address supplied by the home
      service provider's customer; and

-STATUTE-
      (a) Act Does Not Supersede Customer's Liability to Taxing
    Jurisdiction. - Nothing in sections 116 through 126 modifies,
    impairs, supersedes, or authorizes the modification, impairment, or
    supersession of, any law allowing a taxing jurisdiction to collect
    a tax, charge, or fee from a customer that has failed to provide
    its place of primary use.
      (b) Additional Taxable Charges. - If a taxing jurisdiction does
    not otherwise subject charges for mobile telecommunications
    services to taxation and if these charges are aggregated with and
    not separately stated from charges that are subject to taxation,
    then the charges for nontaxable mobile telecommunications services
    may be subject to taxation unless the home service provider can
    reasonably identify charges not subject to such tax, charge, or fee
    from its books and records that are kept in the regular course of
    business.
      (c) Nontaxable Charges. - If a taxing jurisdiction does not
    subject charges for mobile telecommunications services to taxation,
    a customer may not rely upon the nontaxability of charges for
    mobile telecommunications services unless the customer's home
    service provider separately states the charges for nontaxable
    mobile telecommunications services from taxable charges or the home
    service provider elects, after receiving a written request from the
    customer in the form required by the provider, to provide
    verifiable data based upon the home service provider's books and
    records that are kept in the regular course of business that
    reasonably identifies the nontaxable charges.
