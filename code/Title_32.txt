                          POSITIVE LAW; CITATION                      
      This title has been made positive law by section 2 of act Aug.
    10, 1956, ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 596, which provided in part that:

      Section 53 of act Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 641,
    repealed the sections or parts of sections of the Revised Statutes
    or Statutes at Large covering provisions codified in this act,
    "except with respect to rights and duties that matured, penalties
    that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun, before the
    effective date of this act [Aug. 10, 1956] and except as provided
    in section 49".

                    SAVINGS AND SEVERABILITY PROVISIONS                
      Section 49 of act Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 640,

      "(a) In sections 1-48 of this Act, it is the legislative purpose
    to restate, without substantive change, the law replaced by those
    sections on the effective date of this Act. However, laws effective
    after March 31, 1955, that are inconsistent with this Act shall be
    considered as superseding it to the extent of the inconsistency.
      "(b) References that other laws, regulations, and orders make to
    the replaced law shall be considered to be made to the
    corresponding provisions of sections 1-48.
      "(c) Actions taken and offenses committed under the replaced law
    shall be considered to have been taken or committed under the
    corresponding provisions of sections 1-48.
      "(d) If a part of this Act is invalid, all valid parts that are
    severable from the invalid part remain in effect. If a part of this
    Act is invalid in one or more of its applications, the part remains
    in effect in all valid applications that are severable from the
    invalid applications.
      "(e) In chapter 47 of title 10, United States Code, enacted by
    section 1 of this Act, no inference of a legislative construction
    is to be drawn from the part in which any article is placed nor
    from the catchlines of the part or the article as set out in that
    chapter.
      "(f) The enactment of this Act does not increase or decrease the
    pay or allowances, including retired pay and retainer pay, of any
    person.
      "(g) The enactment of this Act does not affect the status of
    persons who, on the effective date of this Act, have the status of
    warrant officer, of the Army Mine Planter Service."

       RESTATEMENT OF SUSPENDED OR TEMPORARILY SUPERSEDED PROVISIONS   
      Section 50 of act Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 640,
    provided that: "If on the effective date of this Act a provision of
    law that is restated in this Act and repealed by section 53 would
    have been in a suspended or temporarily superseded status but for
    its repeal, the provisions of this Act that restate that provision
    have the same suspended or temporarily superseded status."

     PROVISIONS; SAVINGS AND SEVERABILITY PROVISIONS; STATUS; REPEALS
      Section 34 of Pub. L. 85-861 provided that:
      "(a) In sections 1-32 of this Act, it is the legislative purpose
    to restate, without substantive change, the law replaced by those
    sections on the effective date of this Act. However, laws effective
    after December 31, 1957, that are inconsistent with this Act shall
    be considered as superseding it to the extent of the inconsistency.
      "(b) References that other laws, regulations, and orders make to
    the replaced law shall be considered to be made to the
    corresponding provisions of sections 1-32.
      "(c) Actions taken under the replaced law shall be considered to
    have been taken under the corresponding provisions of sections 1-
    32.
      "(d) If a part of this Act is invalid, all valid parts that are
    severable from the invalid part remain in effect. If a part of this
    Act is invalid in one or more of its applications, the part remains
    in effect in all valid applications that are severable from the
    invalid applications.

    pay or allowances, including retired and retainer pay, of any
    person."

    date of this Act [Sept. 2, 1958] a provision of law that is

    a suspended or temporarily superseded status but for its repeal,
    the provisions of this Act that restate that provision have the
    same suspended or temporarily superseded status."

    respect to rights and duties that matured, penalties that were
    incurred, and proceedings that were begun, before Sept. 2, 1958.

      The definitions in clauses (2) and (9)-(17) reflect the adoption
    of terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes
    restated in this title, represent the closest practicable
    approximation of the ways in which the terms defined have been most
    commonly used. Where established uses conflict, a choice has been
    made.
      In clause (1), the definition of "Territory" in 32:4c is executed
    throughout this revised title by specific reference, where
    applicable, to the Territories, Puerto Rico, and the Canal Zone.
      In clause (2), a definition of "National Guard" is inserted for
    clarity.
      In clause (3)(A), the words "a land force" are substituted for
    32:2. The National Defense Act of 1916, Sec. 117 (last 66 words),
    39 Stat. 212, is not contained in 32:2. It is also omitted from the
    revised section as repealed by the act of February 28, 1925, ch.
    374, Sec. 3, 43 Stat. 1081.
      In clauses (3) and (4), the word "Army" is inserted to
    distinguish the organizations defined from their Air Force
    counterparts.
      In clauses (3) and (5), the words "unless the context or subject
    matter otherwise requires - " and "as provided in this title", in
    32:4b, are omitted as surplusage.
      In clauses (3)(B) and (5)(B), the words "has its officers
    appointed" are substituted for the word "officered", in 32:4b.
      In clauses (4) and (6), only that much of the description of the
    composition of the Army National Guard of the United States and the
    Air National Guard of the United States is used as is necessary to
    distinguish these reserve components, respectively, from the other
    reserve components.
      In clause (5)(A), the words "an air force" are substituted for
    the words "for which Federal responsibility has been vested in the
    Secretary of the Air Force or the Department of the Air Force
    pursuant to law", in 10:1835, and for 32:2 (less applicability to
    Army National Guard), to make the definition of "Air National
    Guard" parallel with the definition of "Army National Guard", and
    to make explicit the intent of Congress in creating the Air
    National Guard, that the organized militia henceforth should
    consist of three mutually exhaustive classes comprising the Army,
    Air, and Naval militia.
      In clause (8), words showing how enlisted members became such are
    inserted to make clear that enlistment is not the only method of
    becoming a member in an enlisted grade.

      In clause (2), the term "armed forces" is defined for legislative
    convenience and is defined the same as that term is defined in
    section 101(4) of title 10, United States Code.
      The definition in clause (18) reflects the adoption of
    terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes restated

    of the first line defenses of the United States be maintained and
    assured at all times. Whenever Congress determines that more units
    and organizations are needed for the national security than are in
    the regular components of the ground and air forces, the Army
    National Guard of the United States and the Air National Guard of
    the United States, or such parts of them as are needed, together
    with such units of other reserve components as are necessary for a
    balanced force, shall be ordered to active Federal duty and
    retained as long as so needed.

    TITLE 32 - NATIONAL GUARD
    CHAPTER 1 - ORGANIZATION

-HEAD-
    Sec. 104. Units: location; organization; command

-STATUTE-
      (a) Each State, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the
    Virgin Islands may fix the location of the units and headquarters
    of its National Guard.
      (b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this title, the
    organization of the Army National Guard and the composition of its
    units shall be the same as those prescribed for the Army, subject,
    in time of peace, to such general exceptions as the Secretary of
    the Army may authorize; and the organization of the Air National
    Guard and the composition of its units shall be the same as those
    prescribed for the Air Force, subject, in time of peace, to such
    general exceptions as the Secretary of the Air Force may authorize.
      (c) To secure a force the units of which when combined will form
    complete higher tactical units, the President may designate the
    units of the National Guard, by branch of the Army or organization
    of the Air Force, to be maintained in each State, the Commonwealth
    of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin
    Islands. However, no change in the branch, organization, or
    allotment of a unit located entirely within a State may be made
    without the approval of its governor.
      (d) To maintain appropriate organization and to assist in
    training and instruction, the President may assign the National
    Guard to divisions, wings, and other tactical units, and may detail
    commissioned officers of the National Guard or of the Regular Army
    or the Regular Air Force, as the case may be, to command those
    units. However, the commanding officer of a unit organized wholly
    within a State, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of
    Columbia, Guam, or the Virgin Islands may not be displaced under
    this subsection.
      (e) To insure prompt mobilization of the National Guard in time
    of war or other emergency, the President may, in time of peace,
    detail a commissioned officer of the Regular Army to perform the
    duties of chief of staff for each fully organized division of the
    Army National Guard, and a commissioned officer of the Regular Air
    Force to perform the duties of the corresponding position for each
    fully organized wing of the Air National Guard.
      (f) Unless the President consents - 
        (1) an organization of the National Guard whose members have
      received compensation from the United States as members of the
      National Guard may not be disbanded; and
        (2) the actual strength of such an organization in commissioned
      officers or enlisted members may not be reduced below the minimum
      strength prescribed by the President.

      In subsection (a), the words "within their respective borders"
    are omitted as surplusage.
      In subsection (b), the word "Army" is substituted for the words
    "Regular Army", since the Army is the category for which the
    organization is prescribed, and the Regular Army is a personnel
    category for which no organization is prescribed. Similarly, the
    words "Air Force" are used instead of the words "Regular Air
    Force".
      In subsection (c), the words "by branch of the Army or
    organization of the Air Force" are substituted for the words "as to
    branch or arm of service". The words "branch, organization, or
    allotment of a unit" are substituted for the words "allotment,
    branch, or arm of units or organizations".
      In subsections (d) and (e) the word "commissioned" is inserted,
    since 32:8 and 10 historically applied only to commissioned
    officers (see opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army
    (JAGA 1953/4078, 6 May 1953)).

      In subsection (e), the word "tactical" is omitted as surplusage.
      In subsection (f), the words "have received compensation from the
    United States as members of the National Guard" are substituted for
    the words "shall be entitled to and shall have received
    compensation under the provisions of this title". The words "actual

-STATUTE-
      (a) In time of peace, a State, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,
    the District of Columbia, Guam, or the Virgin Islands may maintain
    no troops other than those of its National Guard and defense forces
    authorized by subsection (c).
      (b) Nothing in this title limits the right of a State, the
    Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, or the
    Virgin Islands to use its National Guard or its defense forces
    authorized by subsection (c) within its borders in time of peace,
    or prevents it from organizing and maintaining police or

      (c) In addition to its National Guard, if any, a State, the
    Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, or the
    Virgin Islands may, as provided by its laws, organize and maintain
    defense forces. A defense force established under this section may
    be used within the jurisdiction concerned, as its chief executive

    considers necessary, but it may not be called, ordered, or drafted
    into the armed forces.
      (d) A member of a defense force established under subsection (c)
    is not, because of that membership, exempt from service in the
    armed forces, nor is he entitled to pay, allowances, subsistence,
    transportation, or medical care or treatment, from funds of the
    United States.
      (e) A person may not become a member of a defense force
    established under subsection (c) if he is a member of a reserve
    component of the armed forces.

    TITLE 32 - NATIONAL GUARD
    CHAPTER 1 - ORGANIZATION

-HEAD-
    Sec. 112. Drug interdiction and counter-drug activities

-STATUTE-
      (a) Funding Assistance. - The Secretary of Defense may provide
    funds to the Governor of a State who submits to the Secretary a
    State drug interdiction and counter-drug activities plan satisfying
    the requirements of subsection (c). Such funds shall be used for
    the following:
        (1) The pay, allowances, clothing, subsistence, gratuities,
      travel, and related expenses, as authorized by State law, of
      personnel of the National Guard of that State used, while not in
      Federal service, for the purpose of drug interdiction and counter-
      drug activities.
        (2) The operation and maintenance of the equipment and
      facilities of the National Guard of that State used for the
      purpose of drug interdiction and counter-drug activities.
        (3) The procurement of services and equipment, and the leasing
      of equipment, for the National Guard of that State used for the
      purpose of drug interdiction and counter-drug activities.
      However, the use of such funds for the procurement of equipment
      may not exceed $5,000 per item, unless approval for procurement
      of equipment in excess of that amount is granted in advance by
      the Secretary of Defense.

      (b) Use of Personnel Performing Full-Time National Guard Duty. -
    (1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense,
    personnel of the National Guard of a State may, in accordance with
    the State drug interdiction and counter-drug activities plan
    referred to in subsection (c), be ordered to perform full-time
    National Guard duty under section 502(f) of this title for the
    purpose of carrying out drug interdiction and counter-drug
    activities.
      (2)(A) A member of the National Guard serving on full-time
    National Guard duty under orders authorized under paragraph (1)
    shall participate in the training required under section 502(a) of
    this title in addition to the duty performed for the purpose
    authorized under that paragraph. The pay, allowances, and other
    benefits of the member while participating in the training shall be
    the same as those to which the member is entitled while performing
    duty for the purpose of carrying out drug interdiction and counter-
    drug activities. The member is not entitled to additional pay,
    allowances, or other benefits for participation in training
    required under section 502(a)(1) of this title.
      (B) Appropriations available for the Department of Defense for
    drug interdiction and counter-drug activities may be used for
    paying costs associated with a member's participation in training
    described in subparagraph (A). The appropriation shall be
    reimbursed in full, out of appropriations available for paying
    those costs, for the amounts paid. Appropriations available for
    paying those costs shall be available for making the
    reimbursements.
      (C) To ensure that the use of units and personnel of the National
    Guard of a State pursuant to a State drug interdiction and counter-
    drug activities plan does not degrade the training and readiness
    of such units and personnel, the following requirements shall apply
    in determining the drug interdiction and counter-drug activities
    that units and personnel of the National Guard of a State may
    perform:
        (i) The performance of the activities may not adversely affect
      the quality of that training or otherwise interfere with the
      ability of a member or unit of the National Guard to perform the
      military functions of the member or unit.
        (ii) National Guard personnel will not degrade their military
      skills as a result of performing the activities.
        (iii) The performance of the activities will not result in a
      significant increase in the cost of training.
        (iv) In the case of drug interdiction and counter-drug
      activities performed by a unit organized to serve as a unit, the
      activities will support valid unit training requirements.

      (3) A unit or member of the National Guard of a State may be
    used, pursuant to a State drug interdiction and counter-drug
    activities plan approved by the Secretary of Defense under this
    section, to provide services or other assistance (other than air
    transportation) to an organization eligible to receive services
    under section 508 of this title if - 
        (A) the State drug interdiction and counter-drug activities
      plan specifically recognizes the organization as being eligible
      to receive the services or assistance;
        (B) in the case of services, the performance of the services
      meets the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection

      The word "individual" is inserted for clarity to distinguish the

    an officer from the general Federal recognition that is necessary
    to all membership in the National Guard (see section 301 of this
    title).
      The words "June 4, 1920" are omitted as obsolete. The words "Only
    persons selected from the following categories are eligible for
    individual Federal recognition as commissioned officers" are

    Sec. 307. Federal recognition of officers: examination; certificate
      of eligibility

-STATUTE-
      (a) To be eligible for Federal recognition as an officer of the
    National Guard, a person must - 
        (1) receive an appointment with a view to filling a vacancy in
      a federally recognized unit or organization of the National
      Guard;
        (2) have the qualifications prescribed by the Secretary
      concerned for the grade, branch, position, and type of unit or
      organization involved; and
        (3) except as provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this
      section, pass an examination for physical, moral, and
      professional fitness to be prescribed by the President, and
      subscribe to the oath of office prescribed by section 312 of this
      title.

      (b) The examination prescribed by subsection (a) - 
        (1) shall be conducted, for the Army National Guard, by a board
      of three commissioned officers designated by the Secretary of the
      Army from members of the Regular Army or the Army National Guard
      of the United States, or both, and for the Air National Guard, by
      a board of three commissioned officers designated by the
      Secretary of the Air Force from members of the Regular Air Force
      or the Air National Guard of the United States, or both; and
        (2) may be held before original appointment or promotion.

      (c) If such a board finds a person qualified, the Chief of the
    National Guard Bureau may issue to him a certificate of eligibility
    for Federal recognition for the office for which he was found
    qualified. If he is originally appointed or promoted within two
    years to that office, he is entitled to Federal recognition without
    further examination, except as to physical condition.
      (d) Subject to subsection (a)(1) and (2) and to such physical
    examination as may be prescribed, Federal recognition shall be
    extended to each officer of the Army Reserve who has qualified for
    appointment as an officer of the Army National Guard in his reserve
    grade. Similarly, Federal recognition shall be extended to each
    officer of the Air Force Reserve who has qualified for appointment
    as an officer of the Air National Guard. Federal recognition
    extended under this subsection is effective from the date of
    appointment in the Army National Guard or the Air National Guard,
    as the case may be.
      (e) Subject to subsection (a)(1) and (2), Federal recognition
    shall be extended to each officer of the Air Force Reserve who is
    appointed in a commissioned grade in the Air National Guard to fill
    a vacancy, if on the date on which he is appointed his reserve
    grade is the same as the grade in which he is appointed or his name
    is on a recommended list for promotion to that reserve grade.
      (f) Federal recognition extended under subsection (d) or (e) is
    effective from the date of appointment in the Army National Guard
    or the Air National Guard, as the case may be.

      In subsection (b), the words "prescribed by subsection (a)" are
    substituted for the words "to determine such qualifications for
    appointment". The word "designated" is substituted for the word
    "appointed", since the filling of the positions involved is not an
    appointment to office in the constitutional sense. The words "of an
    individual as an officer or warrant officer" are omitted as
    surplusage.
      In subsection (c), the word "originally" is inserted for clarity.
    The words "If such a board finds a person" are substituted for the
    words "if the applicant has been found". The words "for individual
    Federal recognition for the office for which he was found
    qualified" are inserted for clarity. The words "that office" are
    substituted for the words "the office for which he was found
    qualified".
      In subsection (d), the words "Notwithstanding the provisions of
    section 113 of Title 32" are omitted as covered by the words of
    exception in revised subsection (a). The words "Subject to
    subsection (a)(1) and (2)" are inserted, since 50:1115(a) (less
    last 39 words) was not an exception to that part of 50:1113
    relating to qualifications prescribed by the Secretary, or to the
    requirement that only members of federally recognized units can be
    federally recognized. The words "in his reserve grade" are
    substituted for the words "in the same grade in which he is
    appointed as a Reserve officer of the appropriate Armed Force of
    the United States". The last sentence is inserted for clarity.

      (a) The Secretary of the Army may authorize the extension of
    temporary Federal recognition as an officer of the Army National
    Guard to any person who has passed the examination prescribed in
    section 307(b) of this title, pending his appointment as a reserve

    for a person who has passed that examination pending his
    appointment as a reserve officer of the Air Force. Temporary
    recognition so extended may be withdrawn at any time. If not sooner
    withdrawn or replaced by permanent recognition upon appointment as
    a reserve officer in the same grade, it terminates one year after
    its effective date.
      (b) To be eligible for temporary Federal recognition under
    subsection (a), a person must take an oath that during the period
    of temporary recognition he will perform his Federal duties as if
    he had been appointed as a reserve officer of the Army or the Air
    Force, as the case may be.

      The words "not in Federal service" are inserted to show that the
    revised section applies only to joint exercises involving National
    Guard troops not in Federal service, since 32:72 was enacted before
    the establishment of the National Guard of the United States, in
    1933. The words "troops in Federal service" are substituted for the
    words "troops of the United States". The words "officers in Federal
    service who command" are substituted for the words "commander of
    the United States troops". The words "post, air base, or other
    place" are substituted for the words "military post, or
    reservation, or elsewhere". The words "that place and the Federal
    troops on duty there" are substituted for the words "there or
    elsewhere" The words "including outdoor target practice" and "field
    and coast defense instruction" are omitted as surplusage.

    by the primary Federal agency and its supporting Federal entities,
    and the Adjutant General of the State or his or her subordinate
    designee normally should be the principal military authority
    supported by the dual-status commander when acting in his or her

      In subsection (a) the words "ceases to have the qualifications
    prescribed under section 300 of this title" are substituted for
    32:154 (last 26 words of last par.), since it is implicit that a
    member who could not be paid would lose his federally recognized
    status (see JAGA 1953/9033, 3 Dec. 1953). The last 23 words of
    subsection (a) are inserted as a necessary implication of the rule
    stated in section 309(c) of this title.
      In subsection (b), the words "or warrant officer" are omitted,
    since section 101(9) of this title defines "officer" to include
    warrant officers. The word "detailed" is substituted for the word
    "appointed", since the filling of the positions involved is not
    appointment to an office in the constitutional sense. The word
    "commissioned" is inserted after the words "composed of", since the
    word "officer" alone, in 32:115, referred to a commissioned officer
    only (see opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA
    1953/4078, 6 May 1953)). The words "who outrank him" are
    substituted for the words "senior in rank to the officer under
    investigation".
      In subsection (c), the opening clause is substituted for the
    words "such transfer". The words "his Federal recognition is
    withdrawn" are substituted for the words "shall terminate his
    federally recognized National Guard or Air National Guard status".

      In subsection (a), the words "that of" are substituted for the
    words "the system which is or may be prescribed for". The word
    "Army" is substituted for the words "Regular Army", since the Army
    is the category for which the discipline and training is prescribed
    and the Regular Army is a personnel category for which no
    discipline and training is prescribed. Similarly, the words "Air

    Sec. 708. Property and fiscal officers

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Governor of each State, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,
    Guam, and the Virgin Islands, and the commanding general of the
    National Guard of the District of Columbia, shall appoint,
    designate or detail, subject to the approval of the Secretary of
    the Army and the Secretary of the Air Force, a qualified
    commissioned officer of the National Guard of that jurisdiction who
    is also a commissioned officer of the Army National Guard of the
    United States or the Air National Guard of the United States, as
    the case may be, to be the property and fiscal officer of that
    jurisdiction. If the officer is not on active duty, the President
    may order him to active duty, with his consent, to serve as a
    property and fiscal officer.
      (b) Each property and fiscal officer shall - 
        (1) receipt and account for all funds and property of the
      United States in the possession of the National Guard for which
      he is property and fiscal officer; and
        (2) make returns and reports concerning those funds and that
      property, as required by the Secretary concerned.

      (c) When he ceases to hold that assignment, a property and fiscal
    officer resumes his status as an officer of the National Guard.
      (d) The Secretaries shall prescribe a maximum grade, commensurate
    with the functions and responsibilities of the office, but not
    above colonel, for the property and fiscal officer of the United
    States for the National Guard of each State, the Commonwealth of
    Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin
    Islands.
      (e) The Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Air Force
    shall prescribe joint regulations necessary to carry out
    subsections (a)-(d).
      (f) A property and fiscal officer may intrust money to an officer
    of the National Guard to make disbursements as his agent. Both the
    officer to whom money is intrusted, and the property and disbursing
    officer intrusting the money to him, are pecuniarily responsible
    for that money to the United States. The agent officer is subject,
    for misconduct as an agent, to the liabilities and penalties
    prescribed by law in like cases for the property and fiscal officer
    for whom he is acting.

      In subsection (b)(1), the words "the duties of that assignment"
    are substituted for the words "his duties as property and fiscal
    officer". The words "be required to" are omitted as surplusage.
      In subsection (b)(2), the words "of the National Guard for which
    he is property and fiscal officer" are substituted for the words
    "of the National Guard or Air National Guard of the State,
    Territory, or District of Columbia".
      In subsection (c), 32:49 (5th sentence) is omitted, since the
    officer concerned would be entitled, under section 201 of the
    Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 232), to the pay and
    allowances of the grade in which he is serving.
      In subsection (e), the words "The Secretaries shall prescribe"
    are substituted for the words "which rules and regulations shall
    establish". The word "duties" is omitted as surplusage.
      In subsection (f), the words "rules and" and "the provisions of"
    are omitted as surplusage.
      In subsection (g), the words "Under such regulations as may be
    prescribed by the Secretary of the Army" are omitted, since the
    Secretary has inherent authority to issue regulations appropriate
    to exercising his statutory functions. The words "an officer" are
    substituted for the words "other officers", since, under revised
    subsection (a), the property and fiscal officer is not required to
    be an officer of the National Guard. The words "accountable for
    public moneys" and "as agent" are omitted as surplusage.

        jurisdiction concerned;

        (2) a technician may, at any time, be separated from his
      technician employment for cause by the adjutant general of the
      jurisdiction concerned;
        (3) a reduction in force, removal, or an adverse action

    "organizations of all kinds". The words "the support of" are

    one caretaker" are substituted for the words "but if there are as
    many as two caretakers in any unit". The words "under this
    section", in the first sentence of the revised subsection, are

    sentence of the revised subsection, are substituted for the words
    "paid to caretakers who belong to the National Guard, as herein

    each heavier-than-air squadron; and one such officer not above the
    grade of captain for each pool".

    substituted for the words "Funds hereafter appropriated under the
    provisions of this title for the support of", in 32:42, and "such
    moneys", in 32:42a. The words "are in addition to" are substituted

    employed". The words "person to employ them" are substituted for
    the words "by whom they shall be employed". The words "by
    regulations" are omitted, since the Secretary has inherent
    authority to issue regulations appropriate to exercising his
    statutory functions.

    TITLE 32 - NATIONAL GUARD
    CHAPTER 7 - SERVICE, SUPPLY, AND PROCUREMENT

-HEAD-
    Sec. 710. Accountability for property issued to the National Guard

-STATUTE-
      (a) All military property issued by the United States to the
    National Guard remains the property of the United States.
      (b) The Secretary of the Army shall prescribe regulations for
    accounting for property issued by the United States to the Army
    National Guard and for the fixing of responsibility for that
    property. The Secretary of the Air Force shall prescribe
    regulations for accounting for property issued by the United States
    to the Air National Guard and for the fixing of responsibility for
    that property. So far as practicable, regulations prescribed under
    this section shall be uniform among the components of each service.
      (c) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned under
    subsection (b), liability for the value of property issued by the
    United States to the National Guard that is lost, damaged, or
    destroyed may be charged (1) to a member of the Army National Guard
    or the Air National Guard when in similar circumstances a member of
    the Army or Air Force serving on active duty would be so charged,
    or (2) to a State, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of
    Columbia, Guam, or the Virgin Islands when the property is lost,
    damaged, or destroyed incident to duty directed pursuant to the
    laws of, and in support of the authorities of, such jurisdiction.
    Liability charged to a member of the Army National Guard or the Air
    National Guard shall be paid out of pay due to the member for
    duties performed as a member of the National Guard, unless the
    Secretary concerned shall for good cause remit or cancel that
    liability. Liability charged to a State, the Commonwealth of Puerto
    Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, or the Virgin Islands shall
    be paid from its funds or from any other non-Federal funds.
      (d) If property surveyed under this section is found to be
    unserviceable or unsuitable, the Secretary concerned or his
    designated representative shall direct its disposition by sale or
    otherwise. The proceeds of the following under this subsection
    shall be deposited in the Treasury under section 4(b)(22) of the
    Permanent Appropriation Repeal Act, 1934:
        (1) A sale.
        (2) A stoppage against a member of the National Guard.
        (3) A collection from a person, or from a State, the
      Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, or
      the Virgin Islands, to reimburse the United States for the loss
      or destruction of, or damage to, the property.

      (e) If a State, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of
    Columbia, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, whichever is concerned,
    neglects or refuses to pay for the loss or destruction of, or
    damage to, property charged against it under subsection (c), the
    Secretary concerned may bar it from receiving any part of
    appropriations for the Army National Guard or the Air National
    Guard, as the case may be, until the payment is made.
      (f)(1) Instead of the procedure prescribed by subsections (b),
    (c), and (d), property issued to the National Guard that becomes
    unserviceable through fair wear and tear in service may, under
    regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary concerned, be sold or
    otherwise disposed of after an inspection, and a finding of
    unserviceability because of that wear and tear, by a commissioned
    officer designated by the Secretary. The State, the Commonwealth of
    Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, or the Virgin Islands,
    whichever is concerned, is relieved of accountability for that
    property.
      (2) In designating an officer to conduct inspections and make
    findings for purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned
    shall designate - 
        (A) in the case of the Army National Guard, a commissioned
      officer of the Regular Army or a commissioned officer of the Army
      National Guard who is also a commissioned officer of the Army
      National Guard of the United States; and
        (B) in the case of the Air National Guard, a commissioned
      officer of the Regular Air Force or a commissioned officer of the
      Air National Guard who is also a commissioned officer of the Air
      National Guard of the United States.

      In subsection (a), the words "as herein provided" are omitted as

    opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1953/4078,
    6 May 1953)).
      In subsection (b), the words "by use in service or from any other
    cause" and "surveying" are omitted as surplusage. The words "a
    survey of the circumstances thereof" are substituted for the word
    "it".
      In subsection (c), the first 12 words of the second sentence are
    substituted for 32:47 (38th through 77th words of 2d sentence).

      In subsection (d), the last sentence is substituted for 32:47

      In subsection (e), the words "charged against it under subsection
    (c)" are substituted for the words "changed against such State,
    Territory, or the District of Columbia by the Secretary of the Army
    after survey by a disinterested officer appointed as hereinbefore
    provided". The words "may bar it from receiving" are substituted
    for the words "is authorized to debar such State, Territory, or the
    District of Columbia from further participation in any and all".
      In subsection (f), the words "Instead of the procedure prescribed
    by subsections (b)-(d)" are substituted for the words "and to
    constitute as to such property a discretional substitute for the
    examination, report, and disposition provided for elsewhere in this
    section". The words "a finding of unserviceability because of that
    wear and tear" are substituted for the words "finding to that
    effect".

      certain sections of this title

-STATUTE-
      (a) Under such regulations as the Secretary of the Army or
    Secretary of the Air Force may prescribe, he or, subject to appeal
    to him, the Judge Advocate General of the armed force under his
    jurisdiction, if designated by him, may settle and pay in an amount
    not more than $100,000 a claim against the United States for - 
        (1) damage to, or loss of, real property, including damage or
      loss incident to use and occupancy;
        (2) damage to, or loss of, personal property, including
      property bailed to the United States or the National Guard and
      including registered or insured mail damaged, lost, or destroyed
      by a criminal act while in the possession of the National Guard;
      or
        (3) personal injury or death; either caused by a member of the
      Army National Guard or the Air National Guard, as the case may
      be, while engaged in training or duty under section 316, 502,
      503, 504, or 505 of this title or any other provision of law for
      which he is entitled to pay under section 206 of title 37, or for
      which he has waived that pay, and acting within the scope of his
      employment; or otherwise incident to noncombat activities of the
      Army National Guard or the Air National Guard, as the case may
      be, under one of those sections.

      (b) A claim may be allowed under subsection (a) only if - 
        (1) it is presented in writing within two years after it
      accrues, except that if the claim accrues in time of war or armed
      conflict or if such a war or armed conflict intervenes within two
      years after it accrues, and if good cause is shown, the claim may
      be presented not later than two years after the war or armed
      conflict is terminated;
        (2) it is not covered by section 2734 of title 10 or section
      2672 of title 28;
        (3) it is not for personal injury or death of such a member or
      a person employed under section 709 of this title, whose injury
      or death is incident to his service;
        (4) the damage to, or loss of, property, or the personal injury
      or death, was not caused wholly or partly by a negligent or
      wrongful act of the claimant, his agent, or his employee, or, if
      so caused, allowed only to the extent that the law of the place
      where the act or omission complained of occurred would permit
      recovery from a private individual under like circumstances; and
        (5) it is substantiated as prescribed in regulations of the
      Secretary concerned.

    For the purposes of clause (1), the dates of the beginning and end
    of an armed conflict are the dates established by concurrent
    resolution of Congress or by a determination of the President.
      (c) Payment may not be made under this section for reimbursement
    for medical, hospital, or burial services furnished at the expense
    of the United States or of any State or the District of Columbia or
    Puerto Rico.
      (d) If the Secretary concerned considers that a claim in excess
    of $100,000 is meritorious, and the claim otherwise is payable
    under this section, the Secretary may pay the claimant $100,000 and
    report any meritorious amount in excess of $100,000 to the
    Secretary of the Treasury for payment under section 1304 of title
    31.
      (e) Except as provided in subsection (d), no claim may be paid
    under this section unless the amount tendered is accepted by the
    claimant in full satisfaction.
      (f) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, an
    officer or employee under the jurisdiction of the Secretary may
    settle a claim that otherwise would be payable under this section
    in an amount not to exceed $25,000. A decision of the officer or
    employee who makes a final settlement decision under this section
    may be appealed by the claimant to the Secretary concerned or an
    officer or employee designated by the Secretary for that purpose.
      (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the settlement of
    a claim under this section is final and conclusive.
      (h) In this section, "settle" means consider, ascertain, adjust,
    determine, and dispose of a claim, whether by full or partial
    allowance or disallowance.

-STATUTE-
      (a) A claim of the United States against a person arising out of
    an erroneous payment of any pay or allowances made before, on, or
    after October 2, 1972, or arising out of an erroneous payment of
    travel and transportation allowances, to or on behalf of a member
    or former member of the National Guard, the collection of which
    would be against equity and good conscience and not in the best
    interest of the United States, may be waived in whole or in part by
    - 
        (1) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; or
        (2) the Secretary concerned, as defined in section 101(5) of
      title 37, when - 
          (A) the claim is in an amount aggregating not more than
        $10,000; and
          (B) the waiver is made in accordance with standards which the
        Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall
        prescribe.

      (b) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget or the
    Secretary concerned, as the case may be, may not exercise his
    authority under this section to waive any claim - 
        (1) if, in his opinion, there exists, in connection with the
      claim, an indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack
      of good faith on the part of the member or any other person
      having an interest in obtaining a waiver of the claim; or
        (2) if application for waiver is received in his office after
      the expiration of five years immediately following the date on
      which the erroneous payment was discovered.

      (c) A person who has repaid to the United States all or part of
    the amount of a claim, with respect to which a waiver is granted
    under this section, is entitled, to the extent of the waiver, to
    refund, by the department concerned at the time of the erroneous
    payment, of the amount repaid to the United States, if he applies
    to that department for that refund within two years following the
    effective date of the waiver. The Secretary concerned shall pay
    from current applicable appropriations that refund in accordance
    with this section.
      (d) In the audit and settlement of accounts of any accountable
    officer or official, full credit shall be given for any amounts
    with respect to which collection by the United States is waived
    under this section.
      (e) An erroneous payment, the collection of which is waived under
    this section, is considered a valid payment for all purposes.
      (f) This section does not affect any authority under any other
    law to litigate, settle, compromise, or waive any claim of the
    United States.
