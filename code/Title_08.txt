      (2) The giving, loaning, or promising of support or of money or
    any other thing of value for any purpose to any organization shall
    be presumed to constitute affiliation therewith; but nothing in
    this paragraph shall be construed as an exclusive definition of
    affiliation.
      (3) Advocating the economic, international, and governmental
    doctrines of world communism means advocating the establishment of
    a totalitarian Communist dictatorship in any or all of the
    countries of the world through the medium of an internationally
    coordinated Communist movement.
      (f) For the purposes of this chapter - 
      No person shall be regarded as, or found to be, a person of good
    moral character who, during the period for which good moral
    character is required to be established is, or was - 
        (1) a habitual drunkard;
        (2) Repealed. Pub. L. 97-116, Sec. 2(c)(1), Dec. 29, 1981, 95
      Stat. 1611.
        (3) a member of one or more of the classes of persons, whether
      inadmissible or not, described in paragraphs (2)(D), (6)(E), and
      (10)(A) of section 1182(a) of this title; or subparagraphs (A)

      thereof of such section (!8) (except as such paragraph relates to
      a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of
      marihuana), if the offense described therein, for which such
      person was convicted or of which he admits the commission, was
      committed during such period;

        (4) one whose income is derived principally from illegal
      gambling activities;
        (5) one who has been convicted of two or more gambling offenses
      committed during such period;
        (6) one who has given false testimony for the purpose of
      obtaining any benefits under this chapter;
        (7) one who during such period has been confined, as a result
      of conviction, to a penal institution for an aggregate period of
      one hundred and eighty days or more, regardless of whether the
      offense, or offenses, for which he has been confined were
      committed within or without such period;

      this title (relating to severe violations of religious freedom).

      The fact that any person is not within any of the foregoing
    classes shall not preclude a finding that for other reasons such
    person is or was not of good moral character. In the case of an
    alien who makes a false statement or claim of citizenship, or who
    registers to vote or votes in a Federal, State, or local election
    (including an initiative, recall, or referendum) in violation of a
    lawful restriction of such registration or voting to citizens, if
    each natural parent of the alien (or, in the case of an adopted
    alien, each adoptive parent of the alien) is or was a citizen
    (whether by birth or naturalization), the alien permanently resided
    in the United States prior to attaining the age of 16, and the
    alien reasonably believed at the time of such statement, claim, or
    violation that he or she was a citizen, no finding that the alien
    is, or was, not of good moral character may be made based on it.
      (g) For the purposes of this chapter any alien ordered deported
    or removed (whether before or after the enactment of this chapter)
    who has left the United States, shall be considered to have been
    deported or removed in pursuance of law, irrespective of the source
    from which the expenses of his transportation were defrayed or of
    the place to which he departed.
      (h) For purposes of section 1182(a)(2)(E) of this title, the term
    "serious criminal offense" means - 
        (1) any felony;
        (2) any crime of violence, as defined in section 16 of title
      18; or
        (3) any crime of reckless driving or of driving while
      intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol or of prohibited
      substances if such crime involves personal injury to another.

      (i) With respect to each nonimmigrant alien described in
    subsection (a)(15)(T)(i) of this section - 
        (1) the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General,
      and other Government officials, where appropriate, shall provide
      the alien with a referral to a nongovernmental organization that
      would advise the alien regarding the alien's options while in the
      United States and the resources available to the alien; and
        (2) the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, during the period
      the alien is in lawful temporary resident status under that
      subsection, grant the alien authorization to engage in employment
      in the United States and provide the alien with an "employment
      authorized" endorsement or other appropriate work permit.

      Pub. L. 106-386, div. B, title V, Sec. 1502, Oct. 28, 2000, 114
    Stat. 1518, provided that:
      "(a) Findings. - Congress finds that - 
        "(1) the goal of the immigration protections for battered
      immigrants included in the Violence Against Women Act of 1994
      [Pub. L. 103-322, title IV, see Tables for classification] was to
      remove immigration laws as a barrier that kept battered immigrant
      women and children locked in abusive relationships;
        "(2) providing battered immigrant women and children who were
      experiencing domestic violence at home with protection against
      deportation allows them to obtain protection orders against their
      abusers and frees them to cooperate with law enforcement and
      prosecutors in criminal cases brought against their abusers and
      the abusers of their children without fearing that the abuser
      will retaliate by withdrawing or threatening withdrawal of access
      to an immigration benefit under the abuser's control; and
        "(3) there are several groups of battered immigrant women and
      children who do not have access to the immigration protections of
      the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 which means that their
      abusers are virtually immune from prosecution because their
      victims can be deported as a result of action by their abusers
      and the Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot offer them
      protection no matter how compelling their case under existing
      law.
      "(b) Purposes. - The purposes of this title [see Short Title of
    2000 Amendments note above] are - 
        "(1) to remove barriers to criminal prosecutions of persons who
      commit acts of battery or extreme cruelty against immigrant women
      and children; and
        "(2) to offer protection against domestic violence occurring in

     PROTECTION FOR CERTAIN CRIME VICTIMS INCLUDING VICTIMS OF CRIMES
                               AGAINST WOMEN
      Pub. L. 106-386, div. B, title V, Sec. 1513(a), Oct. 28, 2000,
    114 Stat. 1533, provided that:
      "(a) Findings and Purpose. - 
        "(1) Findings. - Congress makes the following findings:
          "(A) Immigrant women and children are often targeted to be
        victims of crimes committed against them in the United States,
        including rape, torture, kidnaping, trafficking, incest,
        domestic violence, sexual assault, female genital mutilation,
        forced prostitution, involuntary servitude, being held hostage
        or being criminally restrained.
          "(B) All women and children who are victims of these crimes
        committed against them in the United States must be able to
        report these crimes to law enforcement and fully participate in
        the investigation of the crimes committed against them and the
        prosecution of the perpetrators of such crimes.
        "(2) Purpose. - 
          "(A) The purpose of this section [amending this section and
        sections 1182, 1184, 1255, and 1367 of this title] is to create
        a new nonimmigrant visa classification that will strengthen the
        ability of law enforcement agencies to detect, investigate, and
        prosecute cases of domestic violence, sexual assault,
        trafficking of aliens, and other crimes described in section
        101(a)(15)(U)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8
        U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii)] committed against aliens, while
        offering protection to victims of such offenses in keeping with
        the humanitarian interests of the United States. This visa will
        encourage law enforcement officials to better serve immigrant
        crime victims and to prosecute crimes committed against aliens.
          "(B) Creating a new nonimmigrant visa classification will
        facilitate the reporting of crimes to law enforcement officials
        by trafficked, exploited, victimized, and abused aliens who are
        not in lawful immigration status. It also gives law enforcement
        officials a means to regularize the status of cooperating
        individuals during investigations or prosecutions. Providing
        temporary legal status to aliens who have been severely
        victimized by criminal activity also comports with the
        humanitarian interests of the United States.
          "(C) Finally, this section gives the Attorney General
        discretion to convert the status of such nonimmigrants to that
        of permanent residents when doing so is justified on
        humanitarian grounds, for family unity, or is otherwise in the
        public interest."

    EX. ORD. NO. 12711. POLICY IMPLEMENTATION WITH RESPECT TO NATIONALS
                       OF PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
      Ex. Ord. No. 12711, Apr. 11, 1990, 55 F.R. 13897, provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and laws of the United States of America, the Attorney General and
    the Secretary of State are hereby ordered to exercise their
    authority, including that under the Immigration and Nationality Act
    (8 U.S.C. 1101-1557), as follows:
      Section 1. The Attorney General is directed to take any steps
    necessary to defer until January 1, 1994, the enforced departure of
    all nationals of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and their
    dependents who were in the United States on or after June 5, 1989,
    up to and including the date of this order (hereinafter "such PRC
    nationals").
      Sec. 2. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General are
    directed to take all steps necessary with respect to such PRC
    nationals (a) to waive through January 1, 1994, the requirement of
    a valid passport and (b) to process and provide necessary
    documents, both within the United States and at U.S. consulates
    overseas, to facilitate travel across the borders of other nations
    and reentry into the United States in the same status such PRC
    nationals had upon departure.
      Sec. 3. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General are
    directed to provide the following protections:
      (a) irrevocable waiver of the 2-year home country residence
    requirement that may be exercised until January 1, 1994, for such
    PRC nationals;
      (b) maintenance of lawful status for purposes of adjustment of
    status or change of nonimmigrant status for such PRC nationals who
    were in lawful status at any time on or after June 5, 1989, up to
    and including the date of this order;
      (c) authorization for employment of such PRC nationals through
    January 1, 1994; and
      (d) notice of expiration of nonimmigrant status (if applicable)
    rather than the institution of deportation proceedings, and
    explanation of options available for such PRC nationals eligible
    for deferral of enforced departure whose nonimmigrant status has
    expired.
      Sec. 4. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General are
    directed to provide for enhanced consideration under the
    immigration laws for individuals from any country who express a
    fear of persecution upon return to their country related to that
    country's policy of forced abortion or coerced sterilization, as
    implemented by the Attorney General's regulation effective January
    29, 1990.
      Sec. 5. The Attorney General is directed to ensure that the
    Immigration and Naturalization Service finalizes and makes public
    its position on the issue of training for individuals in F-1 visa
    status and on the issue of reinstatement into lawful nonimmigrant
    status of such PRC nationals who have withdrawn their applications
    for asylum.
      Sec. 6. The Departments of Justice and State are directed to
    consider other steps to assist such PRC nationals in their efforts
    to utilize the protections that I have extended pursuant to this
    order.
      Sec. 7. This order shall be effective immediately.

                       DETERRING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION                   
      Memorandum of President of the United States, Feb. 7, 1995, 60
    F.R. 7885, provided:
      Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
      It is a fundamental right and duty for a nation to protect the
    integrity of its borders and its laws. This Administration shall
    stand firm against illegal immigration and the continued abuse of
    our immigration laws. By closing the back door to illegal
    immigration, we will continue to open the front door to legal
    immigrants.
      My Administration has moved swiftly to reverse the course of a
    decade of failed immigration policies. Our initiatives have
    included increasing overall Border personnel by over 50 percent
    since 1993. We also are strengthening worksite enforcement and work
    authorization verification to deter employment of illegal aliens.
    Asylum rules have been reformed to end abuse by those falsely
    claiming asylum, while offering protection to those in genuine fear
    of persecution. We are cracking down on smugglers of illegal aliens
    and reforming criminal alien deportation for quicker removal. And
    we are the first Administration to obtain funding to reimburse
    States for a share of the costs of incarcerating criminal illegal
    aliens.
      While we already are doing more to stem the flow of illegal
    immigration than has any previous Administration, more remains to
    be done. In conjunction with the Administration's unprecedented
    budget proposal to support immigration initiatives, this directive
    provides a blueprint of policies and priorities for this
    Administration's continuing work to curtail illegal immigration.
    With its focus on strong border deterrence backed up by effective
    worksite enforcement, removal of criminal and other deportable
    aliens and assistance to states, this program protects the security
    of our borders, our jobs and our communities for all Americans -
    citizens and legal immigrants alike.


-MISC3-
                   COMPREHENSIVE BORDER CONTROL STRATEGY               

      A. Deterring Illegal Immigration At Our Borders
      I have directed the Attorney General to move expeditiously toward
    full implementation of our comprehensive border control strategy,
    including efforts at the southwest border. To support sustained
    long-term strengthening of our deterrence capacity, the
    Administration shall seek funding to add new Border Patrol agents
    to reach the goal of at least 7,000 agents protecting our borders
    by the year 2000.

        Flexible Border Response Capacity
      To further this strategy, the Department of Justice shall
    implement the capacity to respond to emerging situations anywhere
    along our national borders to deter buildups of illegal border
    crossers, smuggling operations, or other developing problems.

        Strategic Use of High Technology
      Through the strategic use of sensors, night scopes, helicopters,
    light planes, all-terrain vehicles, fingerprinting and automated
    recordkeeping, we have freed many Border Patrol agents from long
    hours of bureaucratic tasks and increased the effectiveness of
    these highly-trained personnel. Because these tools are essential
    for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to do its job,
    I direct the Attorney General to accelerate to the greatest extent
    possible their utilization and enhancement to support
    implementation of our deterrence strategy.

        Strong Enforcement Against Repeat Illegal Crossers
      The Department of Justice shall assess the effectiveness of
    efforts underway to deter repeat illegal crossers, such as
    fingerprinting and dedicating prosecution resources to enforce the
    new prosecution authority provided by the Violent Crime Control and
    Law Enforcement Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103-322, see Tables for
    classification].
      The Department of Justice shall determine whether accelerated
    expansion of these techniques to additional border sectors is
    warranted.

      B. Deterring Alien Smuggling
      This Administration has had success deterring large ship-based
    smuggling directly to United States shores. In response, smugglers
    are testing new routes and tactics. Our goal: similar success in
    choking off these attempts by adjusting our anti-smuggling
    initiatives to anticipate shifting smuggling patterns.
      To meet new and continuing challenges posed along transport
    routes and in foreign locations by smuggling organizations, we will
    augment diplomatic and enforcement resources at overseas locations
    to work with host governments, and increase related intelligence
    gathering efforts.
      The Departments of State and Justice, in cooperation with other
    relevant agencies, will report to the National Security Council
    within 30 days on the structure of interagency coordination to
    achieve these objectives.
      Congressional action will be important to provide U.S. law
    enforcement agencies with needed authority to deal with
    international smuggling operations. I will propose that the
    Congress pass legislation providing wiretap authority for
    investigation of alien smuggling cases and providing authorization
    to seize the assets of groups engaged in trafficking in human
    cargo.
      In addition, I will propose legislation to give the Attorney
    General authority to implement procedures for expedited exclusion
    to deal with large flows of undocumented migrants, smuggling
    operations, and other extraordinary migration situations.

      C. Visa Overstay Deterrence
      Nearly half of this country's illegal immigrants come into the
    country legally and then stay after they are required by law to
    depart, often using fraudulent documentation. No Administration has
    ever made a serious effort to identify and deport these
    individuals. This Administration is committed to curtailing this
    form of illegal immigration.
      Therefore, relevant departments and agencies are directed to
    review their policies and practices to identify necessary reforms
    to curtail visa overstayers and to enhance investigations and
    prosecution of those who fraudulently produce or misuse passports,
    visas, and other travel related documents. Recommendations for
    administrative initiatives and legislative reform shall be
    presented to the White House Interagency Working Group on
    Immigration by June 30, 1995.

     REDUCING THE MAGNET OF WORK OPPORTUNITIES, WORKSITE ENFORCEMENT,
                              AND DETERRENCE
      Border deterrence cannot succeed if the lure of jobs in the
    United States remains. Therefore, a second major component of the
    Administration's deterrence strategy is to toughen worksite
    enforcement and employer sanctions. Employers who hire illegal
    immigrants not only obtain unfair competitive advantage over law-
    abiding employers, their unlawful use of illegal immigrants
    suppresses wages and working conditions for our country's legal
    workers. Our strategy, which targets enforcement efforts at
    employers and industries that historically have relied upon
    employment of illegal immigrants, will not only strengthen
    deterrence of illegal immigration, but better protect American
    workers and businesses that do not hire illegal immigrants.
      Central to this effort is an effective, nondiscriminatory means
    of verifying the employment authorization of all new employees. The
    Administration fully supports the recommendation of the Commission
    on Legal Immigration Reform to create pilot projects to test
    various techniques for improving workplace verification, including
    a computer database test to validate a new worker's social security
    number for work authorization purposes. The Immigration and
    Naturalization Service (INS) and Social Security Administration are
    directed to establish, implement, monitor, and review the pilots
    and provide me with an interim report on the progress of this
    program by March 1, 1996.
      In addition, the INS is directed to finalize the Administration's
    reduction of the number of authorized documents to support work
    verification for noncitizens. Concurrently, the Administration will
    seek further reduction legislatively in the number of documents
    that are acceptable for proving identity and work authorization.
    The Administration will improve the security of existing documents
    to be used for work authorization and seek increased penalties for
    immigration fraud, including fraudulent production and use of
    documents.
      The Department of Labor shall intensify its investigations in
    industries with patterns of labor law violations that promote
    illegal immigration.
      I also direct the Department of Labor, INS, and other relevant
    Federal agencies to expand their collaboration in cracking down on
    those who subvert fair competition by hiring illegal aliens. This
    may include increased Federal authority to confiscate assets that
    are the fruits of that unfair competition.
      The White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration shall
    further examine the link between immigration and employment,
    including illegal immigration, and recommend to me other
    appropriate measures.

            DETENTION AND REMOVAL OF DEPORTABLE ILLEGAL ALIENS        
      The Administration's deterrence strategy includes strengthening
    the country's detention and deportation capability. No longer will
    criminals and other high risk deportable aliens be released back
    into communities because of a shortage of detention space and
    ineffective deportation procedures.

      A. Comprehensive Deportation Process Reform
      The Department of Justice, in consultation with other relevant
    agencies, shall develop a streamlined, fair, and effective
    procedure to expedite removal of deportable aliens. As necessary,
    additional legislative authority will be sought in this area. In
    addition, the Department of Justice shall increase its capacity to
    staff deportation and exclusion hearings to support these
    objectives.

      B. National Detention and Removal Plan
      To address the shortage of local detention space for illegal
    aliens, the Administration shall devise a National Detention,
    Transportation, and Removal Policy that will permit use of
    detention space across the United States and improve the ability to
    remove individuals with orders of deportation. The Department of
    Justice, in consultation with other agencies as appropriate and
    working under the auspices of the White House Interagency Working
    Group on Immigration, shall finalize this plan by April 30, 1995.
      The Administration will seek support and funding from the
    Congress for this plan and for our efforts to double the removal of
    illegal aliens with final orders of deportation.

      C. Identification and Removal of Criminal Aliens
      The Institutional Hearing Program is successfully expediting
    deportation of incarcerated criminal aliens after they serve their
    sentences.
      To further expedite removal of criminal aliens from this country
    and reduce costs to Federal and State governments, the Department
    of Justice is directed to develop an expanded program of
    verification of the immigration status of criminal aliens within
    our country's prisons. In developing this program, the viability of
    expanding the work of the Law Enforcement Support Center should be
    assessed and all necessary steps taken to increase coordination and
    cooperative efforts with State, and local law enforcement officers
    in identification of criminal aliens.

                         TARGETED DETERRENCE AREAS                     
      Many of the Administration's illegal immigration enforcement
    initiatives are mutually reinforcing. For example, strong interior
    enforcement supports border control. While there have been efforts
    over the years at piecemeal cooperation, this Administration will
    examine, develop, and test a more comprehensive coordinated package
    of deterrence strategies in selected metropolitan areas by multiple
    Federal, State, and local agencies.
      The White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration shall
    coordinate the development of this interagency and
    intergovernmental operation.

                 VERIFICATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS             
      The law denies most government benefits to illegal aliens. The
    government has a duty to assure that taxpayer-supported public
    assistance programs are not abused. As with work authorization,
    enforcement of eligibility requirements relies upon a credible
    system of verification. The INS, working with the White House
    Interagency Working Group on Immigration as appropriate, shall
    review means of improving the existing benefits verification
    program. In addition, we will seek new mechanisms - including
    increased penalties for false information used to qualify for
    benefits - to protect the integrity of public programs.

                            ANTI-DISCRIMINATION                        
      Our efforts to combat illegal immigration must not violate the
    privacy and civil rights of legal immigrants and U.S. citizens.
    Therefore, I direct the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health
    and Human Services, the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity
    Commission, and other relevant Administration officials to
    vigorously protect our citizens and legal immigrants from
    immigration-related instances of discrimination and harassment. All
    illegal immigration enforcement measures shall be taken with due
    regard for the basic human rights of individuals and in accordance
    with our obligations under applicable international agreements.

                           ASSISTANCE TO STATES                       
      States today face significant costs for services provided to
    illegal immigrants as a result of failed policies of the past.
    Deterring illegal immigration is the best long-term solution to
    protect States from growing costs for illegal immigration. This is
    the first Administration to address this primary responsibility
    squarely. We are targeting most of our Federal dollars to those
    initiatives that address the root causes that lead to increased
    burdens on States.
      The Federal Government provides States with billions of dollars
    to provide for health care, education, and other services and
    benefits for immigrants. This Administration is proposing increases
    for immigration and immigration-related spending of 25 percent in
    1996 compared to 1993 levels. In addition, this Administration is
    the first to obtain funding from the Congress to reimburse States
    for a share of the costs of incarcerated illegal aliens.
      This Administration will continue to work with States to obtain
    more Federal help for certain State costs and will oppose
    inappropriate cost-shifting to the States.

                         INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION                     
      This Administration will continue to emphasize international
    cooperative efforts to address illegal immigration.
      Pursuant to a Presidential Review Directive (PRD), the Department
    of State is now coordinating a study on United States policy toward
    international refugee and migration affairs. I hereby direct that,
    as part of that PRD process, this report to the National Security
    Council include the relationship of economic development and
    migration in the Western Hemisphere and, in particular, provide
    recommendations for further foreign economic policy measures to
    address causes of illegal immigration.
      The Department of State shall coordinate an interagency effort to
    consider expanded arrangements with foreign governments for return
    of criminal and deportable aliens.
      The Department of State also shall seek to negotiate readmission
    agreements for persons who could have sought asylum in the last
    country from which they arrived. Such agreements will take due
    regard of U.S. obligations under the Protocol Relating to the
    Status of Refugees.
      The Department of State further shall implement cooperative
    efforts with other nations receiving smuggled aliens or those used
    as transhipment points by smugglers. In particular, we will look to
    countries in our hemisphere to join us by denying their territory
    as bases for smuggling operations.
      The Department of State shall initiate negotiations with foreign
    countries to secure authority for the United States Coast Guard to
    board source country vessels suspected of transporting smuggled
    aliens.
      This directive shall be published in the Federal Register.
                                                     William J. Clinton.

      (6) He is authorized to confer or impose upon any employee of the
    United States, with the consent of the head of the Department or

      (8) After consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney
    General may authorize officers of a foreign country to be stationed

    to that foreign country comply with that country's immigration and
    related laws.
      (9) Those officers may exercise such authority and perform such
    duties as United States immigration officers are authorized to
    exercise and perform in that foreign country under reciprocal
    agreement, and they shall enjoy such reasonable privileges and
    immunities necessary for the performance of their duties as the
    government of their country extends to United States immigration
    officers.
      (10) In the event the Attorney General determines that an actual
    or imminent mass influx of aliens arriving off the coast of the
    United States, or near a land border, presents urgent circumstances
    requiring an immediate Federal response, the Attorney General may
    authorize any State or local law enforcement officer, with the
    consent of the head of the department, agency, or establishment
    under whose jurisdiction the individual is serving, to perform or
    exercise any of the powers, privileges, or duties conferred or
    imposed by this chapter or regulations issued thereunder upon

    (b) Land acquisition authority
      (1) The Attorney General may contract for or buy any interest in
    land, including temporary use rights, adjacent to or in the

    borders of the United States against any violation of this chapter.
      (2) The Attorney General may contract for or buy any interest in
    land identified pursuant to paragraph (1) as soon as the lawful
    owner of that interest fixes a price for it and the Attorney
    General considers that price to be reasonable.
      (3) When the Attorney General and the lawful owner of an interest
    identified pursuant to paragraph (1) are unable to agree upon a
    reasonable price, the Attorney General may commence condemnation
    proceedings pursuant to section 3113 of title 40.

    as may be delegated to him by the Attorney General or which may be
    prescribed by the Attorney General. The Commissioner may enter into
    cooperative agreements with State and local law enforcement
    agencies for the purpose of assisting in the enforcement of the
    immigration laws.
    (d) Statistical information system
      (1) The Commissioner, in consultation with interested
    academicians, government agencies, and other parties, shall provide
    for a system for collection and dissemination, to Congress and the
    public, of information (not in individually identifiable form)
    useful in evaluating the social, economic, environmental, and
    demographic impact of immigration laws.
      (2) Such information shall include information on the alien
    population in the United States, on the rates of naturalization and
    emigration of resident aliens, on aliens who have been admitted,
    paroled, or granted asylum, on nonimmigrants in the United States
    (by occupation, basis for admission, and duration of stay), on
    aliens who have not been admitted or have been removed from the
    United States, on the number of applications filed and granted for
    cancellation of removal, and on the number of aliens estimated to
    be present unlawfully in the United States in each fiscal year.
      (3) Such system shall provide for the collection and
    dissemination of such information not less often than annually.
    (e) Annual report

    which contains a summary of the information collected under
    subsection (d) of this section and an analysis of trends in
    immigration and naturalization.

      The Attorney General shall allocate to each State not fewer than

    in order to ensure the effective enforcement of this chapter.
    (g) Attorney General
      (1) In general
        The Attorney General shall have such authorities and functions
      under this chapter and all other laws relating to the immigration
      and naturalization of aliens as were exercised by the Executive
      Office for Immigration Review, or by the Attorney General with
      respect to the Executive Office for Immigration Review, on the
      day before the effective date of the Immigration Reform,
      Accountability and Security Enhancement Act of 2002.
      (2) Powers
        The Attorney General shall establish such regulations,
      prescribe such forms of bond, reports, entries, and other papers,
      issue such instructions, review such administrative
      determinations in immigration proceedings, delegate such
      authority, and perform such other acts as the Attorney General
      determines to be necessary for carrying out this section.

    Identification Index (NCIC-III), Wanted Persons File, and to any
    other files maintained by the National Crime Information Center
    that may be mutually agreed upon by the Attorney General and the
    agency receiving the access, for the purpose of determining whether
    or not a visa applicant or applicant for admission has a criminal
    history record indexed in any such file.
      (2) Such access shall be provided by means of extracts of the
    records for placement in the automated visa lookout or other
    appropriate database, and shall be provided without any fee or
    charge.
      (3) The Federal Bureau of Investigation shall provide periodic
    updates of the extracts at intervals mutually agreed upon with the
    agency receiving the access. Upon receipt of such updated extracts,
    the receiving agency shall make corresponding updates to its
    database and destroy previously provided extracts.
      (4) Access to an extract does not entitle the Department of State
    to obtain the full content of the corresponding automated criminal
    history record. To obtain the full content of a criminal history
    record, the Department of State shall submit the applicant's
    fingerprints and any appropriate fingerprint processing fee
    authorized by law to the Criminal Justice Information Services
    Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
    (c) Reconsideration upon development of more cost effective means
      of sharing information
      The provision of the extracts described in subsection (b) of this
    section may be reconsidered by the Attorney General and the
    receiving agency upon the development and deployment of a more cost-
    effective and efficient means of sharing the information.
    (d) Regulations
      For purposes of administering this section, the Department of
    State shall, prior to receiving access to NCIC data but not later
    than 4 months after October 26, 2001, promulgate final regulations -
     
        (1) to implement procedures for the taking of fingerprints; and
        (2) to establish the conditions for the use of the information
      received from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in order - 
          (A) to limit the redissemination of such information;
          (B) to ensure that such information is used solely to
        determine whether or not to issue a visa to an alien or to
        admit an alien to the United States;
          (C) to ensure the security, confidentiality, and destruction
        of such information; and
          (D) to protect any privacy rights of individuals who are
        subjects of such information.

    Sec. 1151. Worldwide level of immigration

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      Exclusive of aliens described in subsection (b) of this section,
    aliens born in a foreign state or dependent area who may be issued
    immigrant visas or who may otherwise acquire the status of an alien
    lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence are
    limited to - 
        (1) family-sponsored immigrants described in section 1153(a) of
      this title (or who are admitted under section 1181(a) of this
      title on the basis of a prior issuance of a visa to their
      accompanying parent under section 1153(a) of this title) in a
      number not to exceed in any fiscal year the number specified in
      subsection (c) of this section for that year, and not to exceed
      in any of the first 3 quarters of any fiscal year 27 percent of
      the worldwide level under such subsection for all of such fiscal
      year;
        (2) employment-based immigrants described in section 1153(b) of
      this title (or who are admitted under section 1181(a) of this
      title on the basis of a prior issuance of a visa to their
      accompanying parent under section 1153(b) of this title), in a
      number not to exceed in any fiscal year the number specified in
      subsection (d) of this section for that year, and not to exceed
      in any of the first 3 quarters of any fiscal year 27 percent of
      the worldwide level under such subsection for all of such fiscal
      year; and
        (3) for fiscal years beginning with fiscal year 1995, diversity
      immigrants described in section 1153(c) of this title (or who are
      admitted under section 1181(a) of this title on the basis of a
      prior issuance of a visa to their accompanying parent under
      section 1153(c) of this title) in a number not to exceed in any
      fiscal year the number specified in subsection (e) of this
      section for that year, and not to exceed in any of the first 3
      quarters of any fiscal year 27 percent of the worldwide level
      under such subsection for all of such fiscal year.
    (b) Aliens not subject to direct numerical limitations
      Aliens described in this subsection, who are not subject to the
    worldwide levels or numerical limitations of subsection (a) of this
    section, are as follows:
        (1)(A) Special immigrants described in subparagraph (A) or (B)
      of section 1101(a)(27) of this title.
        (B) Aliens who are admitted under section 1157 of this title or
      whose status is adjusted under section 1159 of this title.
        (C) Aliens whose status is adjusted to permanent residence
      under section 1160 or 1255a of this title.
        (D) Aliens whose removal is canceled under section 1229b(a) of
      this title.
        (E) Aliens provided permanent resident status under section
      1259 of this title.
        (2)(A)(i) Immediate relatives. - For purposes of this
      subsection, the term "immediate relatives" means the children,
      spouses, and parents of a citizen of the United States, except
      that, in the case of parents, such citizens shall be at least 21
      years of age. In the case of an alien who was the spouse of a
      citizen of the United States and was not legally separated from
      the citizen at the time of the citizen's death, the alien (and
      each child of the alien) shall be considered, for purposes of
      this subsection, to remain an immediate relative after the date
      of the citizen's death but only if the spouse files a petition
      under section 1154(a)(1)(A)(ii) of this title within 2 years
      after such date and only until the date the spouse remarries. For
      purposes of this clause, an alien who has filed a petition under
      clause (iii) or (iv) of section 1154(a)(1)(A) of this title
      remains an immediate relative in the event that the United States
      citizen spouse or parent loses United States citizenship on
      account of the abuse.
        (ii) Aliens admitted under section 1181(a) of this title on the
      basis of a prior issuance of a visa to their accompanying parent
      who is such an immediate relative.
        (B) Aliens born to an alien lawfully admitted for permanent
      residence during a temporary visit abroad.
    (c) Worldwide level of family-sponsored immigrants
      (1)(A) The worldwide level of family-sponsored immigrants under
    this subsection for a fiscal year is, subject to subparagraph (B),
    equal to - 
        (i) 480,000, minus
        (ii) the sum of the number computed under paragraph (2) and the
      number computed under paragraph (4), plus
        (iii) the number (if any) computed under paragraph (3).

      (B)(i) For each of fiscal years 1992, 1993, and 1994, 465,000
    shall be substituted for 480,000 in subparagraph (A)(i).
      (ii) In no case shall the number computed under subparagraph (A)
    be less than 226,000.
      (2) The number computed under this paragraph for a fiscal year is
    the sum of the number of aliens described in subparagraphs (A) and
    (B) of subsection (b)(2) of this section who were issued immigrant
    visas or who otherwise acquired the status of aliens lawfully
    admitted to the United States for permanent residence in the
    previous fiscal year.
      (3)(A) The number computed under this paragraph for fiscal year
    1992 is zero.
      (B) The number computed under this paragraph for fiscal year 1993
    is the difference (if any) between the worldwide level established
    under paragraph (1) for the previous fiscal year and the number of
    visas issued under section 1153(a) of this title during that fiscal
    year.
      (C) The number computed under this paragraph for a subsequent
    fiscal year is the difference (if any) between the maximum number
    of visas which may be issued under section 1153(b) of this title
    (relating to employment-based immigrants) during the previous
    fiscal year and the number of visas issued under that section
    during that year.
      (4) The number computed under this paragraph for a fiscal year
    (beginning with fiscal year 1999) is the number of aliens who were
    paroled into the United States under section 1182(d)(5) of this
    title in the second preceding fiscal year - 
        (A) who did not depart from the United States (without advance
      parole) within 365 days; and
        (B) who (i) did not acquire the status of aliens lawfully
      admitted to the United States for permanent residence in the two
      preceding fiscal years, or (ii) acquired such status in such
      years under a provision of law (other than subsection (b) of this
      section) which exempts such adjustment from the numerical
      limitation on the worldwide level of immigration under this

        (2), (3), (4), or (5) of section 1153(b) of this title for a
        calendar quarter exceeds the number of qualified immigrants who
        may otherwise be issued such visas, the visas made available
        under that paragraph shall be issued without regard to the
        numerical limitation under paragraph (2) of this subsection
        during the remainder of the calendar quarter.
        (B) Limiting fall across for certain countries subject to
          subsection (e) of this section
          In the case of a foreign state or dependent area to which
        subsection (e) of this section applies, if the total number of
        visas issued under section 1153(b) of this title exceeds the
        maximum number of visas that may be made available to
        immigrants of the state or area under section 1153(b) of this
        title consistent with subsection (e) of this section
        (determined without regard to this paragraph), in applying
        subsection (e) of this section all visas shall be deemed to
        have been required for the classes of aliens specified in
        section 1153(b) of this title.
    (b) Rules for chargeability
      Each independent country, self-governing dominion, mandated
    territory, and territory under the international trusteeship system
    of the United Nations, other than the United States and its
    outlying possessions, shall be treated as a separate foreign state
    for the purposes of a numerical level established under subsection
    (a)(2) of this section when approved by the Secretary of State. All
    other inhabited lands shall be attributed to a foreign state
    specified by the Secretary of State. For the purposes of this
    chapter the foreign state to which an immigrant is chargeable shall
    be determined by birth within such foreign state except that (1) an
    alien child, when accompanied by or following to join his alien
    parent or parents, may be charged to the foreign state of either
    parent if such parent has received or would be qualified for an
    immigrant visa, if necessary to prevent the separation of the child
    from the parent or parents, and if immigration charged to the
    foreign state to which such parent has been or would be chargeable
    has not reached a numerical level established under subsection
    (a)(2) of this section for that fiscal year; (2) if an alien is
    chargeable to a different foreign state from that of his spouse,
    the foreign state to which such alien is chargeable may, if
    necessary to prevent the separation of husband and wife, be
    determined by the foreign state of the spouse he is accompanying or
    following to join, if such spouse has received or would be
    qualified for an immigrant visa and if immigration charged to the
    foreign state to which such spouse has been or would be chargeable
    has not reached a numerical level established under subsection
    (a)(2) of this section for that fiscal year; (3) an alien born in
    the United States shall be considered as having been born in the
    country of which he is a citizen or subject, or, if he is not a
    citizen or subject of any country, in the last foreign country in
    which he had his residence as determined by the consular officer;
    and (4) an alien born within any foreign state in which neither of
    his parents was born and in which neither of his parents had a
    residence at the time of such alien's birth may be charged to the
    foreign state of either parent.
    (c) Chargeability for dependent areas
      Any immigrant born in a colony or other component or dependent
    area of a foreign state overseas from the foreign state, other than
    an alien described in section 1151(b) of this title, shall be
    chargeable for the purpose of the limitation set forth in
    subsection (a) of this section, to the foreign state.
    (d) Changes in territory
      In the case of any change in the territorial limits of foreign
    states, the Secretary of State shall, upon recognition of such
    change issue appropriate instructions to all diplomatic and
    consular offices.
    (e) Special rules for countries at ceiling
      If it is determined that the total number of immigrant visas made
    available under subsections (a) and (b) of section 1153 of this
    title to natives of any single foreign state or dependent area will
    exceed the numerical limitation specified in subsection (a)(2) of
    this section in any fiscal year, in determining the allotment of
    immigrant visa numbers to natives under subsections (a) and (b) of
    section 1153 of this title, visa numbers with respect to natives of
    that state or area shall be allocated (to the extent practicable
    and otherwise consistent with this section and section 1153 of this
    title) in a manner so that - 
        (1) the ratio of the visa numbers made available under section
      1153(a) of this title to the visa numbers made available under
      section 1153(b) of this title is equal to the ratio of the
      worldwide level of immigration under section 1151(c) of this
      title to such level under section 1151(d) of this title;
        (2) except as provided in subsection (a)(4) of this section,
      the proportion of the visa numbers made available under each of
      paragraphs (1) through (4) of section 1153(a) of this title is
      equal to the ratio of the total number of visas made available
      under the respective paragraph to the total number of visas made
      available under section 1153(a) of this title, and
        (3) except as provided in subsection (a)(5) of this section,
      the proportion of the visa numbers made available under each of
      paragraphs (1) through (5) of section 1153(b) of this title is
      equal to the ratio of the total number of visas made available
      under the respective paragraph to the total number of visas made
      available under section 1153(b) of this title.

    Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as limiting the
    number of visas that may be issued to natives of a foreign state or
    dependent area under section 1153(a) or 1153(b) of this title if
    there is insufficient demand for visas for such natives under
    section 1153(b) or 1153(a) of this title, respectively, or as
    limiting the number of visas that may be issued under section
    1153(a)(2)(A) of this title pursuant to subsection (a)(4)(A) of
    this section.

            section 1255 of this title.
        (C) Determination of exceptional ability
          In determining under subparagraph (A) whether an immigrant
        has exceptional ability, the possession of a degree, diploma,
        certificate, or similar award from a college, university,
        school, or other institution of learning or a license to
        practice or certification for a particular profession or
        occupation shall not by itself be considered sufficient
        evidence of such exceptional ability.

          (iii) Reduction in employment-based immigrant classifications
            within per country ceiling
            In the case of a foreign state subject to section 1152(e)
          of this title in a fiscal year (and in the previous fiscal
          year), the number of visas made available and allocated to
          each of paragraphs (1) through (3) of this subsection in the
          fiscal year shall be reduced by  1/3  of the number of visas
          made available in the previous fiscal year to special
          immigrants described in section 1101(a)(27)(K) of this title
          who are natives of the foreign state.

      (1) In general
        Except as provided in paragraph (2), aliens subject to the
      worldwide level specified in section 1151(e) of this title for
      diversity immigrants shall be allotted visas each fiscal year as
      follows:
        (A) Determination of preference immigration
          The Attorney General shall determine for the most recent
        previous 5-fiscal-year period for which data are available, the
        total number of aliens who are natives of each foreign state
        and who (i) were admitted or otherwise provided lawful
        permanent resident status (other than under this subsection)
        and (ii) were subject to the numerical limitations of section
        1151(a) of this title (other than paragraph (3) thereof) or who
        were admitted or otherwise provided lawful permanent resident
        status as an immediate relative or other alien described in
        section 1151(b)(2) of this title.
        (B) Identification of high-admission and low-admission regions
          and high-admission and low-admission states
          The Attorney General - 
            (i) shall identify - 
              (I) each region (each in this paragraph referred to as a
            "high-admission region") for which the total of the numbers
            determined under subparagraph (A) for states in the region
            is greater than  1/6  of the total of all such numbers, and
              (II) each other region (each in this paragraph referred
            to as a "low-admission region"); and

            (ii) shall identify - 
              (I) each foreign state for which the number determined
            under subparagraph (A) is greater than 50,000 (each such
            state in this paragraph referred to as a "high-admission
            state"), and
              (II) each other foreign state (each such state in this
            paragraph referred to as a "low-admission state").
        (C) Determination of percentage of worldwide immigration
          attributable to high-admission regions
          The Attorney General shall determine the percentage of the
        total of the numbers determined under subparagraph (A) that are
        numbers for foreign states in high-admission regions.

          admission states and ratios of populations of regions within
          low-admission regions and high-admission regions
          The Attorney General shall determine - 
            (i) based on available estimates for each region, the total
          population of each region not including the population of any
          high-admission state;
            (ii) for each low-admission region, the ratio of the
          population of the region determined under clause (i) to the
          total of the populations determined under such clause for all
          the low-admission regions; and
            (iii) for each high-admission region, the ratio of the
          population of the region determined under clause (i) to the
          total of the populations determined under such clause for all
          the high-admission regions.

          (ii) For low-admission states in low-admission regions
            Subject to clauses (iv) and (v), the percentage of visas
          made available under this paragraph to natives (other than
          natives of a high-admission state) in a low-admission region
          is the product of - 
              (I) the percentage determined under subparagraph (C), and
              (II) the population ratio for that region determined
            under subparagraph (D)(ii).
          (iii) For low-admission states in high-admission regions
            Subject to clauses (iv) and (v), the percentage of visas
          made available under this paragraph to natives (other than
          natives of a high-admission state) in a high-admission region
          is the product of - 
              (I) 100 percent minus the percentage determined under
            subparagraph (C), and
              (II) the population ratio for that region determined
            under subparagraph (D)(iii).
          (iv) Redistribution of unused visa numbers
            If the Secretary of State estimates that the number of
          immigrant visas to be issued to natives in any region for a
          fiscal year under this paragraph is less than the number of
          immigrant visas made available to such natives under this
          paragraph for the fiscal year, subject to clause (v), the
          excess visa numbers shall be made available to natives (other
          than natives of a high-admission state) of the other regions
          in proportion to the percentages otherwise specified in
          clauses (ii) and (iii).
          (v) Limitation on visas for natives of a single foreign state
            The percentage of visas made available under this paragraph
          to natives of any single foreign state for any fiscal year
          shall not exceed 7 percent.
        (F) "Region" defined
          Only for purposes of administering the diversity program
        under this subsection, Northern Ireland shall be treated as a
        separate foreign state, each colony or other component or
        dependent area of a foreign state overseas from the foreign
        state shall be treated as part of the foreign state, and the
        areas described in each of the following clauses shall be
        considered to be a separate region:
            (i) Africa.

          (A) has at least a high school education or its equivalent,
        or
          (B) has, within 5 years of the date of application for a visa
        under this subsection, at least 2 years of work experience in
        an occupation which requires at least 2 years of training or
        experience.
      (3) Maintenance of information
        The Secretary of State shall maintain information on the age,
      occupation, education level, and other relevant characteristics
      of immigrants issued visas under this subsection.
    (d) Treatment of family members
      A spouse or child as defined in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D),
    or (E) of section 1101(b)(1) of this title shall, if not otherwise
    entitled to an immigrant status and the immediate issuance of a
    visa under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section, be entitled
    to the same status, and the same order of consideration provided in
    the respective subsection, if accompanying or following to join,
    the spouse or parent.
    (e) Order of consideration
      (1) Immigrant visas made available under subsection (a) or (b) of
    this section shall be issued to eligible immigrants in the order in
    which a petition in behalf of each such immigrant is filed with the
    Attorney General (or in the case of special immigrants under
    section 1101(a)(27)(D) of this title, with the Secretary of State)
    as provided in section 1154(a) of this title.
      (2) Immigrant visa numbers made available under subsection (c) of
    this section (relating to diversity immigrants) shall be issued to
    eligible qualified immigrants strictly in a random order
    established by the Secretary of State for the fiscal year involved.
      (3) Waiting lists of applicants for visas under this section
    shall be maintained in accordance with regulations prescribed by
    the Secretary of State.
    (f) Authorization for issuance

    immigrant visa to be described in section 1151(b)(2) of this title
    or in subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section, the consular
    officer shall not grant such status until he has been authorized to
    do so as provided by section 1154 of this title.
    (g) Lists
      For purposes of carrying out the Secretary's responsibilities in
    the orderly administration of this section, the Secretary of State
    may make reasonable estimates of the anticipated numbers of visas
    to be issued during any quarter of any fiscal year within each of
    the categories under subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section
    and to rely upon such estimates in authorizing the issuance of
    visas. The Secretary of State shall terminate the registration of
    any alien who fails to apply for an immigrant visa within one year
    following notification to the alien of the availability of such
    visa, but the Secretary shall reinstate the registration of any
    such alien who establishes within 2 years following the date of
    notification of the availability of such visa that such failure to
    apply was due to circumstances beyond the alien's control.
    (h) Rules for determining whether certain aliens are children
      (1) In general
        For purposes of subsections (a)(2)(A) and (d) of this section,
      a determination of whether an alien satisfies the age requirement
      in the matter preceding subparagraph (A) of section 1101(b)(1) of
      this title shall be made using - 
          (A) the age of the alien on the date on which an immigrant
        visa number becomes available for such alien (or, in the case
        of subsection (d) of this section, the date on which an
        immigrant visa number became available for the alien's parent),
        but only if the alien has sought to acquire the status of an
        alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence within one year
        of such availability; reduced by
          (B) the number of days in the period during which the
        applicable petition described in paragraph (2) was pending.
      (2) Petitions described
        The petition described in this paragraph is - 
          (A) with respect to a relationship described in subsection
        (a)(2)(A) of this section, a petition filed under section 1154
        of this title for classification of an alien child under
        subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section; or
          (B) with respect to an alien child who is a derivative
        beneficiary under subsection (d) of this section, a petition
        filed under section 1154 of this title for classification of
        the alien's parent under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this
        section.
      (3) Retention of priority date
        If the age of an alien is determined under paragraph (1) to be
      21 years of age or older for the purposes of subsections
      (a)(2)(A) and (d) of this section, the alien's petition shall
      automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the
      alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt
      of the original petition.
      (4) Application to self-petitions
        Paragraphs (1) through (3) shall apply to self-petitioners and
      derivatives of self-petitioners.

    Secretary of State, together with the Secretary of Homeland
    Security, shall set aside visas for a program to implement the
    provisions of such section. Such program shall involve a regional
    center in the United States, designated by the Secretary of
    Homeland Security on the basis of a general proposal, for the
    promotion of economic growth, including increased export sales,
    improved regional productivity, job creation, or increased domestic
    capital investment. A regional center shall have jurisdiction over
    a limited geographic area, which shall be described in the proposal

    in defined economic zones. The establishment of a regional center
    may be based on general predictions, contained in the proposal,
    concerning the kinds of commercial enterprises that will receive
    capital from aliens, the jobs that will be created directly or
    indirectly as a result of such capital investments, and the other
    positive economic effects such capital investments will have.

    beginning on October 1, 1992, but no later than October 1, 1993,

    requirements of 8 CFR 204.6, the Secretary of Homeland Security
    shall permit aliens admitted under the program described in this
    section to establish reasonable methodologies for determining the
    number of jobs created by the program, including such jobs which
    are estimated to have been created indirectly through revenues
    generated from increased exports, improved regional productivity,
    job creation, or increased domestic capital investment resulting
    from the program.
      "(d) In processing petitions under section 204(a)(1)(H) of the
    Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1154(a)(1)(H)) for
    classification under section 203(b)(5) of such Act (8 U.S.C.
    1153(b)(5)), the Secretary of Homeland Security may give priority
    to petitions filed by aliens seeking admission under the program
    described in this section. Notwithstanding section 203(e) of such
    Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(e)), immigrant visas made available under such
    section 203(b)(5) may be issued to such aliens in an order that

    sentence."

      residence, or
        (ii) the alien establishes to the satisfaction of the Attorney
      General by clear and convincing evidence that the prior marriage
      (on the basis of which the alien obtained the status of an alien

    section 1151(b) of this title or is eligible for preference under
    subsection (a) or (b) of section 1153 of this title, approve the

    residence, by reason of a marriage determined by the Attorney

    this section, no petition may be approved on behalf of a child
    defined in section 1101(b)(1)(G) of this title unless the Secretary

    country of origin has notified the United States central authority
    under the convention referred to in such section 1101(b)(1)(G) of
    this title that a United States citizen habitually resident in the
    United States has effected final adoption of the child, or has been
    granted custody of the child for the purpose of emigration and
    adoption, in accordance with such convention and the Intercountry
    Adoption Act of 2000 [42 U.S.C. 14901 et seq.].
    (e) Subsequent finding of non-entitlement to preference
      classification

      referred to as the "sponsor") who is twenty-one years of age or
      older, is of good moral character, and is a citizen of the United
      States or alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, and

      the laws of the State where the alien and the sponsor will
      reside, and (II) to furnish, during the five-year period
      beginning on the date of the alien's acquiring the status of an
      alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or during the
      period beginning on the date of the alien's acquiring the status
      of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence and ending

    approved to grant an alien immediate relative status or preference
    status by reason of a marriage which was entered into during the

    alien has resided outside the United States for a 2-year period
    beginning after the date of the marriage.
    (h) Survival of rights to petition
      The legal termination of a marriage may not be the sole basis for
    revocation under section 1155 of this title of a petition filed
    under subsection (a)(1)(A)(iii) of this section or a petition filed
    under subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section pursuant to
    conditions described in subsection (a)(1)(A)(iii)(I) of this
    section. Remarriage of an alien whose petition was approved under
    subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) or (a)(1)(A)(iii) of this section or
    marriage of an alien described in clause (iv) or (vi) of subsection
    (a)(1)(A) of this section or in subsection (a)(1)(B)(iii) of this
    section shall not be the basis for revocation of a petition
    approval under section 1155 of this title.
    (i) Professional athletes
      (1) In general
        A petition under subsection (a)(4)(D) (!4) of this section for
      classification of a professional athlete shall remain valid for
      the athlete after the athlete changes employers, if the new
      employer is a team in the same sport as the team which was the
      employer who filed the petition.

      (2) "Professional athlete" defined
        For purposes of paragraph (1), the term "professional athlete"
      means an individual who is employed as an athlete by - 
          (A) a team that is a member of an association of 6 or more
        professional sports teams whose total combined revenues exceed
        $10,000,000 per year, if the association governs the conduct of
        its members and regulates the contests and exhibitions in which
        its member teams regularly engage; or
          (B) any minor league team that is affiliated with such an
        association.
    (j) Job flexibility for long delayed applicants for adjustment of
      status to permanent residence
      A petition under subsection (a)(1)(D) of this section for an
    individual whose application for adjustment of status pursuant to
    section 1255 of this title has been filed and remained
    unadjudicated for 180 days or more shall remain valid with respect
    to a new job if the individual changes jobs or employers if the new
    job is in the same or a similar occupational classification as the
    job for which the petition was filed.
    (k) Procedures for unmarried sons and daughters of citizens
      (1) In general
        Except as provided in paragraph (2), in the case of a petition
      under this section initially filed for an alien unmarried son or
      daughter's classification as a family-sponsored immigrant under
      section 1153(a)(2)(B) of this title, based on a parent of the son
      or daughter being an alien lawfully admitted for permanent
      residence, if such parent subsequently becomes a naturalized
      citizen of the United States, such petition shall be converted to
      a petition to classify the unmarried son or daughter as a family-
      sponsored immigrant under section 1153(a)(1) of this title.
      (2) Exception
        Paragraph (1) does not apply if the son or daughter files with
      the Attorney General a written statement that he or she elects
      not to have such conversion occur (or if it has occurred, to have
      such conversion revoked). Where such an election has been made,
      any determination with respect to the son or daughter's
      eligibility for admission as a family-sponsored immigrant shall
      be made as if such naturalization had not taken place.
      (3) Priority date
        Regardless of whether a petition is converted under this
      subsection or not, if an unmarried son or daughter described in
      this subsection was assigned a priority date with respect to such
      petition before such naturalization, he or she may maintain that
      priority date.
      (4) Clarification
        This subsection shall apply to a petition if it is properly
      filed, regardless of whether it was approved or not before such
      naturalization.
    (l) Surviving relative consideration for certain petitions and
      applications
      (1) In general
        An alien described in paragraph (2) who resided in the United
      States at the time of the death of the qualifying relative and
      who continues to reside in the United States shall have such
      petition described in paragraph (2), or an application for
      adjustment of status to that of a person admitted for lawful
      permanent residence based upon the family relationship described
      in paragraph (2), and any related applications, adjudicated
      notwithstanding the death of the qualifying relative, unless the
      Secretary of Homeland Security determines, in the unreviewable
      discretion of the Secretary, that approval would not be in the
      public interest.
      (2) Alien described
        An alien described in this paragraph is an alien who,
      immediately prior to the death of his or her qualifying relative,
      was - 
          (A) the beneficiary of a pending or approved petition for
        classification as an immediate relative (as described in
        section 1151(b)(2)(A)(i) of this title);

        petition for classification under section 1153(b) of this title
        (as described in section 1153(d) of this title);
          (D) the beneficiary of a pending or approved refugee/asylee
        relative petition under section 1157 or 1158 of this title;
          (E) an alien admitted in "T" nonimmigrant status as described
        in section 1101(a)(15)(T)(ii) of this title or in "U"
        nonimmigrant status as described in section 1101(a)(15)(U)(ii)
        of this title; or
          (F) an asylee (as described in section 1158(b)(3) of this

    Sec. 1157. Annual admission of refugees and admission of emergency
      situation refugees

-STATUTE-
    (a) Maximum number of admissions; increases for humanitarian
      concerns; allocations
      (1) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the
    number of refugees who may be admitted under this section in fiscal
    year 1980, 1981, or 1982, may not exceed fifty thousand unless the
    President determines, before the beginning of the fiscal year and
    after appropriate consultation (as defined in subsection (e) of
    this section), that admission of a specific number of refugees in
    excess of such number is justified by humanitarian concerns or is
    otherwise in the national interest.
      (2) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the
    number of refugees who may be admitted under this section in any
    fiscal year after fiscal year 1982 shall be such number as the
    President determines, before the beginning of the fiscal year and
    after appropriate consultation, is justified by humanitarian
    concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.
      (3) Admissions under this subsection shall be allocated among
    refugees of special humanitarian concern to the United States in
    accordance with a determination made by the President after
    appropriate consultation.
      (4) In the determination made under this subsection for each
    fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1992), the President shall
    enumerate, with the respective number of refugees so determined,
    the number of aliens who were granted asylum in the previous year.
    (b) Determinations by President respecting number of admissions for
      humanitarian concerns
      If the President determines, after appropriate consultation, that
    (1) an unforeseen emergency refugee situation exists, (2) the
    admission of certain refugees in response to the emergency refugee
    situation is justified by grave humanitarian concerns or is
    otherwise in the national interest, and (3) the admission to the
    United States of these refugees cannot be accomplished under
    subsection (a) of this section, the President may fix a number of
    refugees to be admitted to the United States during the succeeding
    period (not to exceed twelve months) in response to the emergency
    refugee situation and such admissions shall be allocated among
    refugees of special humanitarian concern to the United States in
    accordance with a determination made by the President after the
    appropriate consultation provided under this subsection.
    (c) Admission by Attorney General of refugees; criteria; admission
      status of spouse or child; applicability of other statutory
      requirements; termination of refugee status of alien, spouse or
      child
      (1) Subject to the numerical limitations established pursuant to
    subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the Attorney General may,
    in the Attorney General's discretion and pursuant to such
    regulations as the Attorney General may prescribe, admit any
    refugee who is not firmly resettled in any foreign country, is
    determined to be of special humanitarian concern to the United
    States, and is admissible (except as otherwise provided under
    paragraph (3)) as an immigrant under this chapter.
      (2)(A) A spouse or child (as defined in section 1101(b)(1)(A),
    (B), (C), (D), or (E) of this title) of any refugee who qualifies
    for admission under paragraph (1) shall, if not otherwise entitled
    to admission under paragraph (1) and if not a person described in
    the second sentence of section 1101(a)(42) of this title, be
    entitled to the same admission status as such refugee if
    accompanying, or following to join, such refugee and if the spouse
    or child is admissible (except as otherwise provided under
    paragraph (3)) as an immigrant under this chapter. Upon the
    spouse's or child's admission to the United States, such admission
    shall be charged against the numerical limitation established in
    accordance with the appropriate subsection under which the
    refugee's admission is charged.
      (B) An unmarried alien who seeks to accompany, or follow to join,
    a parent granted admission as a refugee under this subsection, and
    who was under 21 years of age on the date on which such parent
    applied for refugee status under this section, shall continue to be
    classified as a child for purposes of this paragraph, if the alien
    attained 21 years of age after such application was filed but while
    it was pending.
      (3) The provisions of paragraphs (4), (5), and (7)(A) of section
    1182(a) of this title shall not be applicable to any alien seeking
    admission to the United States under this subsection, and the
    Attorney General may waive any other provision of such section
    (other than paragraph (2)(C) or subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (E)
    of paragraph (3)) with respect to such an alien for humanitarian
    purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the
    public interest. Any such waiver by the Attorney General shall be
    in writing and shall be granted only on an individual basis
    following an investigation. The Attorney General shall provide for
    the annual reporting to Congress of the number of waivers granted
    under this paragraph in the previous fiscal year and a summary of
    the reasons for granting such waivers.
      (4) The refugee status of any alien (and of the spouse or child
    of the alien) may be terminated by the Attorney General pursuant to
    such regulations as the Attorney General may prescribe if the
    Attorney General determines that the alien was not in fact a
    refugee within the meaning of section 1101(a)(42) of this title at
    the time of the alien's admission.
    (d) Oversight reporting and consultation requirements
      (1) Before the start of each fiscal year the President shall
    report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of
    Representatives and of the Senate regarding the foreseeable number
    of refugees who will be in need of resettlement during the fiscal
    year and the anticipated allocation of refugee admissions during
    the fiscal year. The President shall provide for periodic
    discussions between designated representatives of the President and
    members of such committees regarding changes in the worldwide
    refugee situation, the progress of refugee admissions, and the
    possible need for adjustments in the allocation of admissions among
    refugees.
      (2) As soon as possible after representatives of the President
    initiate appropriate consultation with respect to the number of
    refugee admissions under subsection (a) of this section or with
    respect to the admission of refugees in response to an emergency
    refugee situation under subsection (b) of this section, the
    Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of
    the Senate shall cause to have printed in the Congressional Record
    the substance of such consultation.
      (3)(A) After the President initiates appropriate consultation
    prior to making a determination under subsection (a) of this
    section, a hearing to review the proposed determination shall be
    held unless public disclosure of the details of the proposal would
    jeopardize the lives or safety of individuals.
      (B) After the President initiates appropriate consultation prior
    to making a determination, under subsection (b) of this section,
    that the number of refugee admissions should be increased because
    of an unforeseen emergency refugee situation, to the extent that
    time and the nature of the emergency refugee situation permit, a
    hearing to review the proposal to increase refugee admissions shall
    be held unless public disclosure of the details of the proposal
    would jeopardize the lives or safety of individuals.
    (e) "Appropriate consultation" defined
      For purposes of this section, the term "appropriate consultation"
    means, with respect to the admission of refugees and allocation of
    refugee admissions, discussions in person by designated Cabinet-
    level representatives of the President with members of the
    Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and of the House of
    Representatives to review the refugee situation or emergency
    refugee situation, to project the extent of possible participation
    of the United States therein, to discuss the reasons for believing
    that the proposed admission of refugees is justified by
    humanitarian concerns or grave humanitarian concerns or is
    otherwise in the national interest, and to provide such members
    with the following information:
        (1) A description of the nature of the refugee situation.
        (2) A description of the number and allocation of the refugees
      to be admitted and an analysis of conditions within the countries
      from which they came.
        (3) A description of the proposed plans for their movement and
      resettlement and the estimated cost of their movement and
      resettlement.
        (4) An analysis of the anticipated social, economic, and
      demographic impact of their admission to the United States.
        (5) A description of the extent to which other countries will
      admit and assist in the resettlement of such refugees.
        (6) An analysis of the impact of the participation of the
      United States in the resettlement of such refugees on the foreign
      policy interests of the United States.
        (7) Such additional information as may be appropriate or
      requested by such members.

    To the extent possible, information described in this subsection
    shall be provided at least two weeks in advance of discussions in
    person by designated representatives of the President with such
    members.
    (f) Training
      (1) The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of
    State, shall provide all United States officials adjudicating
    refugee cases under this section with the same training as that
    provided to officers adjudicating asylum cases under section 1158
    of this title.
      (2) Such training shall include country-specific conditions,
    instruction on the internationally recognized right to freedom of
    religion, instruction on methods of religious persecution practiced
    in foreign countries, and applicable distinctions within a country
    between the nature of and treatment of various religious practices
    and believers.

    Sec. 1158. Asylum

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authority to apply for asylum
      (1) In general
        Any alien who is physically present in the United States or who
      arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port
      of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United
      States after having been interdicted in international or United
      States waters), irrespective of such alien's status, may apply
      for asylum in accordance with this section or, where applicable,
      section 1225(b) of this title.
      (2) Exceptions
        (A) Safe third country
          Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien if the Attorney
        General determines that the alien may be removed, pursuant to a
        bilateral or multilateral agreement, to a country (other than
        the country of the alien's nationality or, in the case of an
        alien having no nationality, the country of the alien's last
        habitual residence) in which the alien's life or freedom would
        not be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality,
        membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,
        and where the alien would have access to a full and fair
        procedure for determining a claim to asylum or equivalent
        temporary protection, unless the Attorney General finds that it
        is in the public interest for the alien to receive asylum in
        the United States.
        (B) Time limit
          Subject to subparagraph (D), paragraph (1) shall not apply to
        an alien unless the alien demonstrates by clear and convincing
        evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year
        after the date of the alien's arrival in the United States.
        (C) Previous asylum applications
          Subject to subparagraph (D), paragraph (1) shall not apply to
        an alien if the alien has previously applied for asylum and had
        such application denied.
        (D) Changed circumstances
          An application for asylum of an alien may be considered,
        notwithstanding subparagraphs (B) and (C), if the alien
        demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either
        the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect
        the applicant's eligibility for asylum or extraordinary
        circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application
        within the period specified in subparagraph (B).
        (E) Applicability
          Subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply to an unaccompanied
        alien child (as defined in section 279(g) of title 6).
      (3) Limitation on judicial review
        No court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of
      the Attorney General under paragraph (2).
    (b) Conditions for granting asylum
      (1) In general
        (A) Eligibility
          The Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General
        may grant asylum to an alien who has applied for asylum in
        accordance with the requirements and procedures established by
        the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General
        under this section if the Secretary of Homeland Security or the
        Attorney General determines that such alien is a refugee within
        the meaning of section 1101(a)(42)(A) of this title.
        (B) Burden of proof
          (i) In general
            The burden of proof is on the applicant to establish that
          the applicant is a refugee, within the meaning of section
          1101(a)(42)(A) of this title. To establish that the applicant
          is a refugee within the meaning of such section, the
          applicant must establish that race, religion, nationality,
          membership in a particular social group, or political opinion
          was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting
          the applicant.
          (ii) Sustaining burden
            The testimony of the applicant may be sufficient to sustain
          the applicant's burden without corroboration, but only if the
          applicant satisfies the trier of fact that the applicant's
          testimony is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific
          facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a
          refugee. In determining whether the applicant has met the
          applicant's burden, the trier of fact may weigh the credible
          testimony along with other evidence of record. Where the
          trier of fact determines that the applicant should provide
          evidence that corroborates otherwise credible testimony, such
          evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not have
          the evidence and cannot reasonably obtain the evidence.
          (iii) Credibility determination
            Considering the totality of the circumstances, and all
          relevant factors, a trier of fact may base a credibility
          determination on the demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of
          the applicant or witness, the inherent plausibility of the
          applicant's or witness's account, the consistency between the
          applicant's or witness's written and oral statements
          (whenever made and whether or not under oath, and considering
          the circumstances under which the statements were made), the
          internal consistency of each such statement, the consistency
          of such statements with other evidence of record (including
          the reports of the Department of State on country
          conditions), and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such
          statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency,
          inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant's
          claim, or any other relevant factor. There is no presumption
          of credibility, however, if no adverse credibility
          determination is explicitly made, the applicant or witness
          shall have a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal.
      (2) Exceptions
        (A) In general
          Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien if the Attorney
        General determines that - 
            (i) the alien ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise
          participated in the persecution of any person on account of
          race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular
          social group, or political opinion;
            (ii) the alien, having been convicted by a final judgment
          of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the
          community of the United States;
            (iii) there are serious reasons for believing that the
          alien has committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside the
          United States prior to the arrival of the alien in the United
          States;
            (iv) there are reasonable grounds for regarding the alien
          as a danger to the security of the United States;
            (v) the alien is described in subclause (I), (II), (III),
          (IV), or (VI) of section 1182(a)(3)(B)(i) of this title or
          section 1227(a)(4)(B) of this title (relating to terrorist
          activity), unless, in the case only of an alien described in
          subclause (IV) of section 1182(a)(3)(B)(i) of this title, the
          Attorney General determines, in the Attorney General's
          discretion, that there are not reasonable grounds for
          regarding the alien as a danger to the security of the United
          States; or
            (vi) the alien was firmly resettled in another country
          prior to arriving in the United States.
        (B) Special rules
          (i) Conviction of aggravated felony
            For purposes of clause (ii) of subparagraph (A), an alien
          who has been convicted of an aggravated felony shall be
          considered to have been convicted of a particularly serious
          crime.
          (ii) Offenses
            The Attorney General may designate by regulation offenses
          that will be considered to be a crime described in clause
          (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (A).
        (C) Additional limitations
          The Attorney General may by regulation establish additional
        limitations and conditions, consistent with this section, under
        which an alien shall be ineligible for asylum under paragraph
        (1).
        (D) No judicial review
          There shall be no judicial review of a determination of the
        Attorney General under subparagraph (A)(v).
      (3) Treatment of spouse and children
        (A) In general
          A spouse or child (as defined in section 1101(b)(1)(A), (B),
        (C), (D), or (E) of this title) of an alien who is granted
        asylum under this subsection may, if not otherwise eligible for
        asylum under this section, be granted the same status as the
        alien if accompanying, or following to join, such alien.
        (B) Continued classification of certain aliens as children
          An unmarried alien who seeks to accompany, or follow to join,
        a parent granted asylum under this subsection, and who was
        under 21 years of age on the date on which such parent applied
        for asylum under this section, shall continue to be classified
        as a child for purposes of this paragraph and section
        1159(b)(3) of this title, if the alien attained 21 years of age
        after such application was filed but while it was pending.
        (C) Initial jurisdiction
          An asylum officer (as defined in section 1225(b)(1)(E) of
        this title) shall have initial jurisdiction over any asylum
        application filed by an unaccompanied alien child (as defined
        in section 279(g) of title 6), regardless of whether filed in
        accordance with this section or section 1225(b) of this title.
    (c) Asylum status
      (1) In general
        In the case of an alien granted asylum under subsection (b) of
      this section, the Attorney General - 
          (A) shall not remove or return the alien to the alien's
        country of nationality or, in the case of a person having no
        nationality, the country of the alien's last habitual
        residence;
          (B) shall authorize the alien to engage in employment in the
        United States and provide the alien with appropriate
        endorsement of that authorization; and
          (C) may allow the alien to travel abroad with the prior
        consent of the Attorney General.
      (2) Termination of asylum
        Asylum granted under subsection (b) of this section does not
      convey a right to remain permanently in the United States, and
      may be terminated if the Attorney General determines that - 
          (A) the alien no longer meets the conditions described in
        subsection (b)(1) of this section owing to a fundamental change
        in circumstances;
          (B) the alien meets a condition described in subsection
        (b)(2) of this section;
          (C) the alien may be removed, pursuant to a bilateral or
        multilateral agreement, to a country (other than the country of
        the alien's nationality or, in the case of an alien having no
        nationality, the country of the alien's last habitual
        residence) in which the alien's life or freedom would not be
        threatened on account of race, religion, nationality,
        membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,
        and where the alien is eligible to receive asylum or equivalent
        temporary protection;
          (D) the alien has voluntarily availed himself or herself of
        the protection of the alien's country of nationality or, in the
        case of an alien having no nationality, the alien's country of
        last habitual residence, by returning to such country with
        permanent resident status or the reasonable possibility of
        obtaining such status with the same rights and obligations
        pertaining to other permanent residents of that country; or
          (E) the alien has acquired a new nationality and enjoys the
        protection of the country of his or her new nationality.
      (3) Removal when asylum is terminated
        An alien described in paragraph (2) is subject to any
      applicable grounds of inadmissibility or deportability under
      section (!1) 1182(a) and 1227(a) of this title, and the alien's
      removal or return shall be directed by the Attorney General in
      accordance with sections 1229a and 1231 of this title.

    (d) Asylum procedure
      (1) Applications
        The Attorney General shall establish a procedure for the
      consideration of asylum applications filed under subsection (a)
      of this section. The Attorney General may require applicants to
      submit fingerprints and a photograph at such time and in such
      manner to be determined by regulation by the Attorney General.
      (2) Employment
        An applicant for asylum is not entitled to employment
      authorization, but such authorization may be provided under
      regulation by the Attorney General. An applicant who is not
      otherwise eligible for employment authorization shall not be
      granted such authorization prior to 180 days after the date of
      filing of the application for asylum.
      (3) Fees
        The Attorney General may impose fees for the consideration of
      an application for asylum, for employment authorization under
      this section, and for adjustment of status under section 1159(b)
      of this title. Such fees shall not exceed the Attorney General's
      costs in adjudicating the applications. The Attorney General may
      provide for the assessment and payment of such fees over a period
      of time or by installments. Nothing in this paragraph shall be
      construed to require the Attorney General to charge fees for
      adjudication services provided to asylum applicants, or to limit
      the authority of the Attorney General to set adjudication and
      naturalization fees in accordance with section 1356(m) of this
      title.
      (4) Notice of privilege of counsel and consequences of frivolous
        application
        At the time of filing an application for asylum, the Attorney
      General shall - 
          (A) advise the alien of the privilege of being represented by
        counsel and of the consequences, under paragraph (6), of
        knowingly filing a frivolous application for asylum; and
          (B) provide the alien a list of persons (updated not less
        often than quarterly) who have indicated their availability to
        represent aliens in asylum proceedings on a pro bono basis.
      (5) Consideration of asylum applications
        (A) Procedures
          The procedure established under paragraph (1) shall provide
        that - 
            (i) asylum cannot be granted until the identity of the
          applicant has been checked against all appropriate records or
          databases maintained by the Attorney General and by the
          Secretary of State, including the Automated Visa Lookout
          System, to determine any grounds on which the alien may be
          inadmissible to or deportable from the United States, or
          ineligible to apply for or be granted asylum;
            (ii) in the absence of exceptional circumstances, the
          initial interview or hearing on the asylum application shall
          commence not later than 45 days after the date an application
          is filed;
            (iii) in the absence of exceptional circumstances, final
          administrative adjudication of the asylum application, not
          including administrative appeal, shall be completed within
          180 days after the date an application is filed;
            (iv) any administrative appeal shall be filed within 30
          days of a decision granting or denying asylum, or within 30
          days of the completion of removal proceedings before an
          immigration judge under section 1229a of this title,
          whichever is later; and
            (v) in the case of an applicant for asylum who fails
          without prior authorization or in the absence of exceptional
          circumstances to appear for an interview or hearing,
          including a hearing under section 1229a of this title, the
          application may be dismissed or the applicant may be
          otherwise sanctioned for such failure.
        (B) Additional regulatory conditions
          The Attorney General may provide by regulation for any other
        conditions or limitations on the consideration of an
        application for asylum not inconsistent with this chapter.
      (6) Frivolous applications
        If the Attorney General determines that an alien has knowingly
      made a frivolous application for asylum and the alien has
      received the notice under paragraph (4)(A), the alien shall be
      permanently ineligible for any benefits under this chapter,
      effective as of the date of a final determination on such
      application.
      (7) No private right of action
        Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to create any
      substantive or procedural right or benefit that is legally
      enforceable by any party against the United States or its
      agencies or officers or any other person.
    (e) Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands
      The provisions of this section and section 1159(b) of this title
    shall apply to persons physically present in the Commonwealth of
    the Northern Mariana Islands or arriving in the Commonwealth
    (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including

-STATUTE-
    (a) Lawful residence
      (1) In general
        The Attorney General shall adjust the status of an alien to
      that of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence if the
      Attorney General determines that the alien meets the following
      requirements:
        (A) Application period
          The alien must apply for such adjustment during the 18-month
        period beginning on the first day of the seventh month that
        begins after November 6, 1986.
        (B) Performance of seasonal agricultural services and residence
          in the United States
          The alien must establish that he has - 
            (i) resided in the United States, and
            (ii) performed seasonal agricultural services in the United
          States for at least 90 man-days,

        during the 12-month period ending on May 1, 1986. For purposes
        of the previous sentence, performance of seasonal agricultural
        services in the United States for more than one employer on any
        one day shall be counted as performance of services for only 1
        man-day.
        (C) Admissible as immigrant
          The alien must establish that he is admissible to the United
        States as an immigrant, except as otherwise provided under
        subsection (c)(2) of this section.
      (2) Adjustment to permanent residence
        The Attorney General shall adjust the status of any alien
      provided lawful temporary resident status under paragraph (1) to
      that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence on the
      following date:
        (A) Group 1
          Subject to the numerical limitation established under
        subparagraph (C), in the case of an alien who has established,
        at the time of application for temporary residence under
        paragraph (1), that the alien performed seasonal agricultural
        services in the United States for at least 90 man-days during
        each of the 12-month periods ending on May 1, 1984, 1985, and
        1986, the adjustment shall occur on the first day after the end
        of the one-year period that begins on the later of (I) the date
        the alien was granted such temporary resident status, or (II)
        the day after the last day of the application period described
        in paragraph (1)(A).
        (B) Group 2
          In the case of aliens to which subparagraph (A) does not
        apply, the adjustment shall occur on the day after the last day
        of the two-year period that begins on the later of (I) the date
        the alien was granted such temporary resident status, or (II)
        the day after the last day of the application period described
        in paragraph (1)(A).
        (C) Numerical limitation
          Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to more than 350,000 aliens.
        If more than 350,000 aliens meet the requirements of such
        subparagraph, such subparagraph shall apply to the 350,000
        aliens whose applications for adjustment were first filed under
        paragraph (1) and subparagraph (B) shall apply to the remaining
        aliens.
      (3) Termination of temporary residence
        (A) During the period of temporary resident status granted an
      alien under paragraph (1), the Attorney General may terminate
      such status only upon a determination under this chapter that the
      alien is deportable.
        (B) Before any alien becomes eligible for adjustment of status
      under paragraph (2), the Attorney General may deny adjustment to
      permanent status and provide for termination of the temporary
      resident status granted such alien under paragraph (1) if - 
          (i) the Attorney General finds by a preponderance of the
        evidence that the adjustment to temporary resident status was
        the result of fraud or willful misrepresentation as set out in
        section 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) of this title, or
          (ii) the alien commits an act that (I) makes the alien
        inadmissible to the United States as an immigrant, except as
        provided under subsection (c)(2) of this section, or (II) is
        convicted of a felony or 3 or more misdemeanors committed in
        the United States.
      (4) Authorized travel and employment during temporary residence
        During the period an alien is in lawful temporary resident
      status granted under this subsection, the alien has the right to
      travel abroad (including commutation from a residence abroad) and
      shall be granted authorization to engage in employment in the
      United States and shall be provided an "employment authorized"
      endorsement or other appropriate work permit, in the same manner
      as for aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
      (5) In general
        Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, an alien who
      acquires the status of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary
      residence under paragraph (1), such status not having changed, is
      considered to be an alien lawfully admitted for permanent
      residence (as described in section 1101(a)(20) of this title),
      other than under any provision of the immigration laws.
    (b) Applications for adjustment of status
      (1) To whom may be made
        (A) Within the United States
          The Attorney General shall provide that applications for
        adjustment of status under subsection (a) may be filed - 
            (i) with the Attorney General, or
            (ii) with a designated entity (designated under paragraph
          (2)), but only if the applicant consents to the forwarding of
          the application to the Attorney General.
        (B) Outside the United States
          The Attorney General, in cooperation with the Secretary of
        State, shall provide a procedure whereby an alien may apply for
        adjustment of status under subsection (a)(1) of this section at
        an appropriate consular office outside the United States. If
        the alien otherwise qualifies for such adjustment, the Attorney
        General shall provide such documentation of authorization to
        enter the United States and to have the alien's status adjusted
        upon entry as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of
        this section.
      (2) Designation of entities to receive applications
        For purposes of receiving applications under this section, the
      Attorney General - 
          (A) shall designate qualified voluntary organizations and
        other qualified State, local, community, farm labor
        organizations, and associations of agricultural employers, and
          (B) may designate such other persons as the Attorney General
        determines are qualified and have substantial experience,
        demonstrated competence, and traditional long-term involvement
        in the preparation and submittal of applications for adjustment
        of status under section 1159 or 1255 of this title, Public Law
        89-732 [8 U.S.C. 1255 note], or Public Law 95-145 [8 U.S.C.
        1255 note].
      (3) Proof of eligibility
        (A) In general
          An alien may establish that he meets the requirement of
        subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section through government
        employment records, records supplied by employers or collective
        bargaining organizations, and such other reliable documentation
        as the alien may provide. The Attorney General shall establish
        special procedures to credit properly work in cases in which an
        alien was employed under an assumed name.
        (B) Documentation of work history
          (i) An alien applying for adjustment of status under
        subsection (a)(1) of this section has the burden of proving by
        a preponderance of the evidence that the alien has worked the
        requisite number of man-days (as required under subsection
        (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section).
          (ii) If an employer or farm labor contractor employing such
        an alien has kept proper and adequate records respecting such
        employment, the alien's burden of proof under clause (i) may be
        met by securing timely production of those records under
        regulations to be promulgated by the Attorney General.
          (iii) An alien can meet such burden of proof if the alien
        establishes that the alien has in fact performed the work
        described in subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section by
        producing sufficient evidence to show the extent of that
        employment as a matter of just and reasonable inference. In
        such a case, the burden then shifts to the Attorney General to
        disprove the alien's evidence with a showing which negates the
        reasonableness of the inference to be drawn from the evidence.
      (4) Treatment of applications by designated entities
        Each designated entity must agree to forward to the Attorney
      General applications filed with it in accordance with paragraph
      (1)(A)(ii) but not to forward to the Attorney General
      applications filed with it unless the applicant has consented to
      such forwarding. No such entity may make a determination required
      by this section to be made by the Attorney General.
      (5) Limitation on access to information
        Files and records prepared for purposes of this section by
      designated entities operating under this section are confidential
      and the Attorney General and the Service shall not have access to
      such files or records relating to an alien without the consent of
      the alien, except as allowed by a court order issued pursuant to
      paragraph (6) of this subsection.
      (6) Confidentiality of information
        (A) In general
          Except as provided in this paragraph, neither the Attorney
        General, nor any other official or employee of the Department
        of Justice, or bureau or agency thereof, may - 
            (i) use the information furnished by the applicant pursuant
          to an application filed under this section for any purpose
          other than to make a determination on the application,
          including a determination under subsection (a)(3)(B) of this
          section, or for enforcement of paragraph (7);
            (ii) make any publication whereby the information furnished
          by any particular individual can be identified; or
            (iii) permit anyone other than the sworn officers and
          employees of the Department or bureau or agency or, with
          respect to applications filed with a designated entity, that
          designated entity, to examine individual applications.
        (B) Required disclosures
          The Attorney General shall provide information furnished
        under this section, and any other information derived from such
        furnished information, to a duly recognized law enforcement
        entity in connection with a criminal investigation or
        prosecution, when such information is requested in writing by
        such entity, or to an official coroner for purposes of
        affirmatively identifying a deceased individual (whether or not
        such individual is deceased as a result of a crime).
        (C) Construction
          (i) In general
            Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the
          use, or release, for immigration enforcement purposes or law
          enforcement purposes of information contained in files or
          records of the Service pertaining to an application filed
          under this section, other than information furnished by an
          applicant pursuant to the application, or any other
          information derived from the application, that is not
          available from any other source.
          (ii) Criminal convictions
            Information concerning whether the applicant has at any
          time been convicted of a crime may be used or released for
          immigration enforcement or law enforcement purposes.
        (D) Crime
          Whoever knowingly uses, publishes, or permits information to
        be examined in violation of this paragraph shall be fined not
        more than $10,000.
      (7) Penalties for false statements in applications
        (A) Criminal penalty
          Whoever - 
            (i) files an application for adjustment of status under
          this section and knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals,
          or covers up a material fact or makes any false, fictitious,
          or fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses
          any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any
          false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry, or
            (ii) creates or supplies a false writing or document for
          use in making such an application,

        shall be fined in accordance with title 18 or imprisoned not
        more than five years, or both.
        (B) Exclusion
          An alien who is convicted of a crime under subparagraph (A)
        shall be considered to be inadmissible to the United States on
        the ground described in section 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) of this title.
    (c) Waiver of numerical limitations and certain grounds for
      exclusion
      (1) Numerical limitations do not apply
        The numerical limitations of sections 1151 and 1152 of this
      title shall not apply to the adjustment of aliens to lawful
      permanent resident status under this section.
      (2) Waiver of grounds for exclusion
        In the determination of an alien's admissibility under
      subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section - 
        (A) Grounds of exclusion not applicable
          The provisions of paragraphs (5) and (7)(A) of section
        1182(a) of this title shall not apply.
        (B) Waiver of other grounds
          (i) In general
            Except as provided in clause (ii), the Attorney General may
          waive any other provision of section 1182(a) of this title in
          the case of individual aliens for humanitarian purposes, to
          assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public
          interest.
          (ii) Grounds that may not be waived
            The following provisions of section 1182(a) of this title
          may not be waived by the Attorney General under clause (i):
              (I) Paragraphs (2)(A) and (2)(B) (relating to criminals).
              (II) Paragraph (4) (relating to aliens likely to become

              (III) Paragraph (2)(C) (relating to drug offenses),

            marihuana.
              (IV) Paragraph (3) (relating to security and related
            grounds), other than subparagraph (E) thereof.
        (C) Special rule for determination of public charge
          An alien is not ineligible for adjustment of status under
        this section due to being inadmissible under section 1182(a)(4)
        of this title if the alien demonstrates a history of employment
        in the United States evidencing self-support without reliance
        on public cash assistance.
    (d) Temporary stay of exclusion or deportation and work
      authorization for certain applicants
      (1) Before application period
        The Attorney General shall provide that in the case of an alien
      who is apprehended before the beginning of the application period
      described in subsection (a)(1) of this section and who can
      establish a nonfrivolous case of eligibility to have his status
      adjusted under subsection (a) of this section (but for the fact
      that he may not apply for such adjustment until the beginning of
      such period), until the alien has had the opportunity during the
      first 30 days of the application period to complete the filing of
      an application for adjustment, the alien - 
          (A) may not be excluded or deported, and
          (B) shall be granted authorization to engage in employment in
        the United States and be provided an "employment authorized"
        endorsement or other appropriate work permit.
      (2) During application period
        The Attorney General shall provide that in the case of an alien
      who presents a nonfrivolous application for adjustment of status
      under subsection (a) of this section during the application
      period, and until a final determination on the application has
      been made in accordance with this section, the alien - 
          (A) may not be excluded or deported, and
          (B) shall be granted authorization to engage in employment in
        the United States and be provided an "employment authorized"
        endorsement or other appropriate work permit.
      (3) Use of application fees to offset program costs
        No application fees collected by the Service pursuant to this
      subsection may be used by the Service to offset the costs of the
      special agricultural worker legalization program until the
      Service implements the program consistent with the statutory
      mandate as follows:
          (A) During the application period described in subsection
        (a)(1)(A) of this section the Service may grant temporary
        admission to the United States, work authorization, and provide
        an "employment authorized" endorsement or other appropriate
        work permit to any alien who presents a preliminary application
        for adjustment of status under subsection (a) of this section
        at a designated port of entry on the southern land border. An
        alien who does not enter through a port of entry is subject to
        deportation and removal as otherwise provided in this chapter.
          (B) During the application period described in subsection
        (a)(1)(A) of this section any alien who has filed an
        application for adjustment of status within the United States
        as provided in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section pursuant to
        the provision of 8 CFR section 210.1(j) is subject to paragraph
        (2) of this subsection.
          (C) A preliminary application is defined as a fully completed

        specific information concerning the performance of qualifying
        employment in the United States and the documentary evidence
        which the applicant intends to submit as proof of such
        employment. The applicant must be otherwise admissible to the
        United States and must establish to the satisfaction of the
        examining officer during an interview that his or her claim to
        eligibility for special agriculture worker status is credible.
    (e) Administrative and judicial review
      (1) Administrative and judicial review
        There shall be no administrative or judicial review of a
      determination respecting an application for adjustment of status
      under this section except in accordance with this subsection.
      (2) Administrative review
        (A) Single level of administrative appellate review
          The Attorney General shall establish an appellate authority
        to provide for a single level of administrative appellate
        review of such a determination.
        (B) Standard for review
          Such administrative appellate review shall be based solely
        upon the administrative record established at the time of the
        determination on the application and upon such additional or
        newly discovered evidence as may not have been available at the
        time of the determination.
      (3) Judicial review
        (A) Limitation to review of exclusion or deportation
          There shall be judicial review of such a denial only in the
        judicial review of an order of exclusion or deportation under
        section 1105a of this title (as in effect before October 1,
        1996).
        (B) Standard for judicial review
          Such judicial review shall be based solely upon the
        administrative record established at the time of the review by
        the appellate authority and the findings of fact and
        determinations contained in such record shall be conclusive
        unless the applicant can establish abuse of discretion or that
        the findings are directly contrary to clear and convincing
        facts contained in the record considered as a whole.
    (f) Temporary disqualification of newly legalized aliens from
      receiving aid to families with dependent children
      During the five-year period beginning on the date an alien was
    granted lawful temporary resident status under subsection (a) of
    this section, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the
    alien is not eligible for assistance under a State program funded
    under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601
    et seq.]. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in the case of an
    alien who would be eligible for assistance under a State program
    funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act but for
    the previous sentence, the provisions of paragraph (3) of section
    1255a(h) of this title shall apply in the same manner as they apply
    with respect to paragraph (1) of such section and, for this
    purpose, any reference in section 1255a(h)(3) of this title to
    paragraph (1) is deemed a reference to the previous sentence.
    (g) Treatment of special agricultural workers
      For all purposes (subject to subsections (a)(5) and (f) of this
    section) an alien whose status is adjusted under this section to
    that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, such
    status not having changed, shall be considered to be an alien
    lawfully admitted for permanent residence (within the meaning of
    section 1101(a)(20) of this title).
    (h) "Seasonal agricultural services" defined
      In this section, the term "seasonal agricultural services" means
    the performance of field work related to planting, cultural
    practices, cultivating, growing and harvesting of fruits and
    vegetables of every kind and other perishable commodities, as
    defined in regulations by the Secretary of Agriculture.

          (i) In general
            Any alien who has voted in violation of any Federal, State,

          regulation is inadmissible.
          (ii) Exception
            In the case of an alien who voted in a Federal, State, or
          local election (including an initiative, recall, or
          referendum) in violation of a lawful restriction of voting to
          citizens, if each natural parent of the alien (or, in the
          case of an adopted alien, each adoptive parent of the alien)
          is or was a citizen (whether by birth or naturalization), the
          alien permanently resided in the United States prior to
          attaining the age of 16, and the alien reasonably believed at
          the time of such violation that he or she was a citizen, the
          alien shall not be considered to be inadmissible under any
          provision of this subsection based on such violation.
        (E) Former citizens who renounced citizenship to avoid taxation
          Any alien who is a former citizen of the United States who

        determined by the Attorney General to have renounced United
        States citizenship for the purpose of avoiding taxation by the
        United States is inadmissible.
    (b) Notices of denials
      (1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), if an alien's application
    for a visa, for admission to the United States, or for adjustment
    of status is denied by an immigration or consular officer because
    the officer determines the alien to be inadmissible under
    subsection (a) of this section, the officer shall provide the alien
    with a timely written notice that - 
        (A) states the determination, and
        (B) lists the specific provision or provisions of law under
      which the alien is inadmissible or adjustment (!4) of status.

    (d) Temporary admission of nonimmigrants
      (1) The Attorney General shall determine whether a ground for
    inadmissibility exists with respect to a nonimmigrant described in
    section 1101(a)(15)(S) of this title. The Attorney General, in the
    Attorney General's discretion, may waive the application of
    subsection (a) of this section (other than paragraph (3)(E)) in the
    case of a nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(S) of this
    title, if the Attorney General considers it to be in the national
    interest to do so. Nothing in this section shall be regarded as
    prohibiting the Immigration and Naturalization Service from
    instituting removal proceedings against an alien admitted as a
    nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(S) of this title for conduct
    committed after the alien's admission into the United States, or
    for conduct or a condition that was not disclosed to the Attorney
    General prior to the alien's admission as a nonimmigrant under
    section 1101(a)(15)(S) of this title.
      (2) Repealed. Pub. L. 101-649, title VI, Sec. 601(d)(2)(A), Nov.
    29, 1990, 104 Stat. 5076.
      (3)(A) Except as provided in this subsection, an alien (i) who is
    applying for a nonimmigrant visa and is known or believed by the
    consular officer to be ineligible for such visa under subsection
    (a) of this section (other than paragraphs (3)(A)(i)(I),
    (3)(A)(ii), (3)(A)(iii), (3)(C), and clauses (i) and (ii) of
    paragraph (3)(E) of such subsection), may, after approval by the
    Attorney General of a recommendation by the Secretary of State or
    by the consular officer that the alien be admitted temporarily
    despite his inadmissibility, be granted such a visa and may be
    admitted into the United States temporarily as a nonimmigrant in
    the discretion of the Attorney General, or (ii) who is inadmissible
    under subsection (a) of this section (other than paragraphs
    (3)(A)(i)(I), (3)(A)(ii), (3)(A)(iii), (3)(C), and clauses (i) and
    (ii) of paragraph (3)(E) of such subsection), but who is in
    possession of appropriate documents or is granted a waiver thereof
    and is seeking admission, may be admitted into the United States
    temporarily as a nonimmigrant in the discretion of the Attorney
    General. The Attorney General shall prescribe conditions, including
    exaction of such bonds as may be necessary, to control and regulate
    the admission and return of inadmissible aliens applying for
    temporary admission under this paragraph.
      (B)(i) The Secretary of State, after consultation with the
    Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, or the
    Secretary of Homeland Security, after consultation with the
    Secretary of State and the Attorney General, may determine in such
    Secretary's sole unreviewable discretion that subsection (a)(3)(B)
    shall not apply with respect to an alien within the scope of that
    subsection or that subsection (a)(3)(B)(vi)(III) shall not apply to
    a group within the scope of that subsection, except that no such
    waiver may be extended to an alien who is within the scope of
    subsection (a)(3)(B)(i)(II), no such waiver may be extended to an
    alien who is a member or representative of, has voluntarily and
    knowingly engaged in or endorsed or espoused or persuaded others to
    endorse or espouse or support terrorist activity on behalf of, or
    has voluntarily and knowingly received military-type training from
    a terrorist organization that is described in subclause (I) or (II)
    of subsection (a)(3)(B)(vi), and no such waiver may be extended to
    a group that has engaged terrorist activity against the United
    States or another democratic country or that has purposefully
    engaged in a pattern or practice of terrorist activity that is
    directed at civilians. Such a determination shall neither prejudice
    the ability of the United States Government to commence criminal or
    civil proceedings involving a beneficiary of such a determination
    or any other person, nor create any substantive or procedural right
    or benefit for a beneficiary of such a determination or any other
    person. Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or
    nonstatutory), including section 2241 of title 28, or any other
    habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title,
    no court shall have jurisdiction to review such a determination or
    revocation except in a proceeding for review of a final order of
    removal pursuant to section 1252 of this title, and review shall be
    limited to the extent provided in section 1252(a)(2)(D). The
    Secretary of State may not exercise the discretion provided in this
    clause with respect to an alien at any time during which the alien
    is the subject of pending removal proceedings under section 1229a
    of this title.
      (ii) Not later than 90 days after the end of each fiscal year,
    the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall
    each provide to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of
    Representatives and of the Senate, the Committee on International
    Relations of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Foreign
    Relations of the Senate, and the Committee on Homeland Security of
    the House of Representatives a report on the aliens to whom such
    Secretary has applied clause (i). Within one week of applying
    clause (i) to a group, the Secretary of State or the Secretary of
    Homeland Security shall provide a report to such Committees.
      (4) Either or both of the requirements of paragraph (7)(B)(i) of
    subsection (a) of this section may be waived by the Attorney
    General and the Secretary of State acting jointly (A) on the basis
    of unforeseen emergency in individual cases, or (B) on the basis of
    reciprocity with respect to nationals of foreign contiguous
    territory or of adjacent islands and residents thereof having a
    common nationality with such nationals, or (C) in the case of
    aliens proceeding in immediate and continuous transit through the
    United States under contracts authorized in section 1223(c) of this
    title.
      (5)(A) The Attorney General may, except as provided in
    subparagraph (B) or in section 1184(f) of this title, in his
    discretion parole into the United States temporarily under such
    conditions as he may prescribe only on a case-by-case basis for
    urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit any alien
    applying for admission to the United States, but such parole of
    such alien shall not be regarded as an admission of the alien and
    when the purposes of such parole shall, in the opinion of the
    Attorney General, have been served the alien shall forthwith return
    or be returned to the custody from which he was paroled and
    thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same
    manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the United
    States.
      (B) The Attorney General may not parole into the United States an
    alien who is a refugee unless the Attorney General determines that
    compelling reasons in the public interest with respect to that
    particular alien require that the alien be paroled into the United
    States rather than be admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of
    this title.
      (6) Repealed. Pub. L. 101-649, title VI, Sec. 601(d)(2)(A), Nov.
    29, 1990, 104 Stat. 5076.
      (7) The provisions of subsection (a) of this section (other than
    paragraph (7)) shall be applicable to any alien who shall leave
    Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto
    Rico, or the Virgin Islands of the United States, and who seeks to
    enter the continental United States or any other place under the
    jurisdiction of the United States. The Attorney General shall by
    regulations provide a method and procedure for the temporary
    admission to the United States of the aliens described in this
    proviso.(!5) Any alien described in this paragraph, who is denied
    admission to the United States, shall be immediately removed in the
    manner provided by section 1231(c) of this title.

      (8) Upon a basis of reciprocity accredited officials of foreign
    governments, their immediate families, attendants, servants, and
    personal employees may be admitted in immediate and continuous
    transit through the United States without regard to the provisions
    of this section except paragraphs (3)(A), (3)(B), (3)(C), and
    (7)(B) of subsection (a) of this section.
      (9), (10) Repealed. Pub. L. 101-649, title VI, Sec. 601(d)(2)(A),
    Nov. 29, 1990, 104 Stat. 5076.
      (11) The Attorney General may, in his discretion for humanitarian
    purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the
    public interest, waive application of clause (i) of subsection
    (a)(6)(E) of this section in the case of any alien lawfully
    admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad
    voluntarily and not under an order of removal, and who is otherwise
    admissible to the United States as a returning resident under
    section 1181(b) of this title and in the case of an alien seeking
    admission or adjustment of status as an immediate relative or
    immigrant under section 1153(a) of this title (other than paragraph
    (4) thereof), if the alien has encouraged, induced, assisted,
    abetted, or aided only an individual who at the time of such action
    was the alien's spouse, parent, son, or daughter (and no other
    individual) to enter the United States in violation of law.
      (12) The Attorney General may, in the discretion of the Attorney
    General for humanitarian purposes or to assure family unity, waive
    application of clause (i) of subsection (a)(6)(F) of this section -
    
        (A) in the case of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent
      residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not
      under an order of deportation or removal and who is otherwise
      admissible to the United States as a returning resident under
      section 1181(b) of this title, and
        (B) in the case of an alien seeking admission or adjustment of
      status under section 1151(b)(2)(A) of this title or under section
      1153(a) of this title,

    if no previous civil money penalty was imposed against the alien
    under section 1324c of this title and the offense was committed
    solely to assist, aid, or support the alien's spouse or child (and
    not another individual). No court shall have jurisdiction to review
    a decision of the Attorney General to grant or deny a waiver under
    this paragraph.
      (13)(A) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall determine
    whether a ground for inadmissibility exists with respect to a
    nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(T) of this title,
    except that the ground for inadmissibility described in subsection
    (a)(4) of this section shall not apply with respect to such a
    nonimmigrant.
      (B) In addition to any other waiver that may be available under
    this section, in the case of a nonimmigrant described in section
    1101(a)(15)(T) of this title, if the Secretary of Homeland Security
    considers it to be in the national interest to do so, the Secretary
    of Homeland Security, in the Attorney General's (!6) discretion,
    may waive the application of - 

        (i) subsection (a)(1) of this section; and
        (ii) any other provision of subsection (a) of this section
      (excluding paragraphs (3), (4), (10)(C), and (10(E)) (!7) if the
      activities rendering the alien inadmissible under the provision
      were caused by, or were incident to, the victimization described
      in section 1101(a)(15)(T)(i)(I) of this title.


      (14) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall determine whether a
    ground of inadmissibility exists with respect to a nonimmigrant
    described in section 1101(a)(15)(U) of this title. The Secretary of
    Homeland Security, in the Attorney General's (!6) discretion, may
    waive the application of subsection (a) of this section (other than
    paragraph (3)(E)) in the case of a nonimmigrant described in
    section 1101(a)(15)(U) of this title, if the Secretary of Homeland
    Security considers it to be in the public or national interest to
    do so.
    (e) Educational visitor status; foreign residence requirement;
      waiver
      No person admitted under section 1101(a)(15)(J) of this title or
    acquiring such status after admission (i) whose participation in
    the program for which he came to the United States was financed in
    whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the
    Government of the United States or by the government of the country
    of his nationality or his last residence, (ii) who at the time of
    admission or acquisition of status under section 1101(a)(15)(J) of
    this title was a national or resident of a country which the
    Director of the United States Information Agency, pursuant to
    regulations prescribed by him, had designated as clearly requiring
    the services of persons engaged in the field of specialized
    knowledge or skill in which the alien was engaged, or (iii) who
    came to the United States or acquired such status in order to
    receive graduate medical education or training, shall be eligible
    to apply for an immigrant visa, or for permanent residence, or for
    a nonimmigrant visa under section 1101(a)(15)(H) or section
    1101(a)(15)(L) of this title until it is established that such
    person has resided and been physically present in the country of
    his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least
    two years following departure from the United States: Provided,
    That upon the favorable recommendation of the Director, pursuant to
    the request of an interested United States Government agency (or,
    in the case of an alien described in clause (iii), pursuant to the
    request of a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent),
    or of the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization after he
    has determined that departure from the United States would impose
    exceptional hardship upon the alien's spouse or child (if such
    spouse or child is a citizen of the United States or a lawfully
    resident alien), or that the alien cannot return to the country of
    his nationality or last residence because he would be subject to
    persecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion, the
    Attorney General may waive the requirement of such two-year foreign
    residence abroad in the case of any alien whose admission to the
    United States is found by the Attorney General to be in the public
    interest except that in the case of a waiver requested by a State
    Department of Public Health, or its equivalent, or in the case of a
    waiver requested by an interested United States Government agency
    on behalf of an alien described in clause (iii), the waiver shall
    be subject to the requirements of section 1184(l) of this title:
    And provided further, That, except in the case of an alien
    described in clause (iii), the Attorney General may, upon the
    favorable recommendation of the Director, waive such two-year
    foreign residence requirement in any case in which the foreign
    country of the alien's nationality or last residence has furnished
    the Director a statement in writing that it has no objection to
    such waiver in the case of such alien.
    (f) Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by President
      Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of
    any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to
    the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for
    such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all
    aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or
    impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be
    appropriate. Whenever the Attorney General finds that a commercial
    airline has failed to comply with regulations of the Attorney
    General relating to requirements of airlines for the detection of
    fraudulent documents used by passengers traveling to the United
    States (including the training of personnel in such detection), the
    Attorney General may suspend the entry of some or all aliens
    transported to the United States by such airline.
    (g) Bond and conditions for admission of alien inadmissible on
      health-related grounds
      The Attorney General may waive the application of - 
        (1) subsection (a)(1)(A)(i) in the case of any alien who - 
          (A) is the spouse or the unmarried son or daughter, or the
        minor unmarried lawfully adopted child, of a United States
        citizen, or of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent
        residence, or of an alien who has been issued an immigrant
        visa,
          (B) has a son or daughter who is a United States citizen, or
        an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or an alien
        who has been issued an immigrant visa; or
          (C) is a VAWA self-petitioner,

      in accordance with such terms, conditions, and controls, if any,
      including the giving of bond, as the Attorney General, in the
      discretion of the Attorney General after consultation with the
      Secretary of Health and Human Services, may by regulation
      prescribe;
        (2) subsection (a)(1)(A)(ii) of this section in the case of any
      alien - 
          (A) who receives vaccination against the vaccine-preventable
        disease or diseases for which the alien has failed to present
        documentation of previous vaccination,
          (B) for whom a civil surgeon, medical officer, or panel
        physician (as those terms are defined by section 34.2 of title
        42 of the Code of Federal Regulations) certifies, according to
        such regulations as the Secretary of Health and Human Services
        may prescribe, that such vaccination would not be medically
        appropriate, or
          (C) under such circumstances as the Attorney General provides
        by regulation, with respect to whom the requirement of such a
        vaccination would be contrary to the alien's religious beliefs
        or moral convictions; or

        (3) subsection (a)(1)(A)(iii) of this section in the case of
      any alien, in accordance with such terms, conditions, and
      controls, if any, including the giving of bond, as the Attorney
      General, in the discretion of the Attorney General after
      consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, may
      by regulation prescribe.
    (h) Waiver of subsection (a)(2)(A)(i)(I), (II), (B), (D), and (E)
      The Attorney General may, in his discretion, waive the
    application of subparagraphs (A)(i)(I), (B), (D), and (E) of
    subsection (a)(2) of this section and subparagraph (A)(i)(II) of
    such subsection insofar as it relates to a single offense of simple
    possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana if - 
        (1)(A) in the case of any immigrant it is established to the
      satisfaction of the Attorney General that - 
          (i) the alien is inadmissible only under subparagraph (D)(i)
        or (D)(ii) of such subsection or the activities for which the
        alien is inadmissible occurred more than 15 years before the
        date of the alien's application for a visa, admission, or
        adjustment of status,
          (ii) the admission to the United States of such alien would
        not be contrary to the national welfare, safety, or security of
        the United States, and
          (iii) the alien has been rehabilitated; or

        (B) in the case of an immigrant who is the spouse, parent, son,
      or daughter of a citizen of the United States or an alien
      lawfully admitted for permanent residence if it is established to
      the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the alien's denial
      of admission would result in extreme hardship to the United
      States citizen or lawfully resident spouse, parent, son, or
      daughter of such alien; or
        (C) the alien is a VAWA self-petitioner; and
        (2) the Attorney General, in his discretion, and pursuant to
      such terms, conditions and procedures as he may by regulations
      prescribe, has consented to the alien's applying or reapplying
      for a visa, for admission to the United States, or adjustment of
      status.

    No waiver shall be provided under this subsection in the case of an
    alien who has been convicted of (or who has admitted committing
    acts that constitute) murder or criminal acts involving torture, or
    an attempt or conspiracy to commit murder or a criminal act
    involving torture. No waiver shall be granted under this subsection
    in the case of an alien who has previously been admitted to the
    United States as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence
    if either since the date of such admission the alien has been
    convicted of an aggravated felony or the alien has not lawfully
    resided continuously in the United States for a period of not less
    than 7 years immediately preceding the date of initiation of
    proceedings to remove the alien from the United States. No court
    shall have jurisdiction to review a decision of the Attorney
    General to grant or deny a waiver under this subsection.
    (i) Admission of immigrant inadmissible for fraud or willful
      misrepresentation of material fact

    General, waive the application of clause (i) of subsection
    (a)(6)(C) of this section in the case of an immigrant who is the
    spouse, son, or daughter of a United States citizen or of an alien
    lawfully admitted for permanent residence if it is established to
    the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the refusal of
    admission to the United States of such immigrant alien would result
    in extreme hardship to the citizen or lawfully resident spouse or
    parent of such an alien or, in the case of a VAWA self-petitioner,
    the alien demonstrates extreme hardship to the alien or the alien's
    United States citizen, lawful permanent resident, or qualified
    alien parent or child.
      (2) No court shall have jurisdiction to review a decision or
    action of the Attorney General regarding a waiver under paragraph
    (1).

    United States under a program under which he will receive graduate
    medical education or training are as follows:
        (A) A school of medicine or of one of the other health
      professions, which is accredited by a body or bodies approved for

      program for which the alien is coming to the United States or to
      assume responsibility for arranging for the provision thereof by
      an appropriate public or nonprofit private institution or agency,
      except that, in the case of such an agreement by a school of
      medicine, any one or more of its affiliated hospitals which are
      to participate in the provision of the graduate medical education
      or training must join in the agreement.
        (B) Before making such agreement, the accredited school has
      been satisfied that the alien (i) is a graduate of a school of
      medicine which is accredited by a body or bodies approved for the
      purpose by the Secretary of Education (regardless of whether such
      school of medicine is in the United States); or (ii)(I) has
      passed parts I and II of the National Board of Medical Examiners
      Examination (or an equivalent examination as determined by the
      Secretary of Health and Human Services), (II) has competency in
      oral and written English, (III) will be able to adapt to the
      educational and cultural environment in which he will be
      receiving his education or training, and (IV) has adequate prior
      education and training to participate satisfactorily in the
      program for which he is coming to the United States. For the
      purposes of this subparagraph, an alien who is a graduate of a
      medical school shall be considered to have passed parts I and II
      of the National Board of Medical Examiners examination if the
      alien was fully and permanently licensed to practice medicine in
      a State on January 9, 1978, and was practicing medicine in a
      State on that date.
        (C) The alien has made a commitment to return to the country of
      his nationality or last residence upon completion of the
      education or training for which he is coming to the United
      States, and the government of the country of his nationality or
      last residence has provided a written assurance, satisfactory to
      the Secretary of Health and Human Services, that there is a need
      in that country for persons with the skills the alien will
      acquire in such education or training.
        (D) The duration of the alien's participation in the program of
      graduate medical education or training for which the alien is
      coming to the United States is limited to the time typically
      required to complete such program, as determined by the Director
      of the United States Information Agency at the time of the
      alien's admission into the United States, based on criteria which
      are established in coordination with the Secretary of Health and
      Human Services and which take into consideration the published
      requirements of the medical specialty board which administers
      such education or training program; except that - 
          (i) such duration is further limited to seven years unless
        the alien has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director
        that the country to which the alien will return at the end of
        such specialty education or training has an exceptional need
        for an individual trained in such specialty, and
          (ii) the alien may, once and not later than two years after
        the date the alien is admitted to the United States as an
        exchange visitor or acquires exchange visitor status, change
        the alien's designated program of graduate medical education or
        training if the Director approves the change and if a
        commitment and written assurance with respect to the alien's
        new program have been provided in accordance with subparagraph
        (C).

        (E) The alien furnishes the Attorney General each year with an
      affidavit (in such form as the Attorney General shall prescribe)
      that attests that the alien (i) is in good standing in the
      program of graduate medical education or training in which the
      alien is participating, and (ii) will return to the country of
      his nationality or last residence upon completion of the
      education or training for which he came to the United States.

      (2) An alien who is a graduate of a medical school and who is
    coming to the United States to perform services as a member of the
    medical profession may not be admitted as a nonimmigrant under
    section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this title unless - 
        (A) the alien is coming pursuant to an invitation from a public
      or nonprofit private educational or research institution or
      agency in the United States to teach or conduct research, or
      both, at or for such institution or agency, or
        (B)(i) the alien has passed the Federation licensing
      examination (administered by the Federation of State Medical
      Boards of the United States) or an equivalent examination as
      determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and
        (ii)(I) has competency in oral and written English or (II) is a
      graduate of a school of medicine which is accredited by a body or
      bodies approved for the purpose by the Secretary of Education
      (regardless of whether such school of medicine is in the United
      States).

      (3) Omitted.
    (k) Attorney General's discretion to admit otherwise inadmissible
      aliens who possess immigrant visas
      Any alien, inadmissible from the United States under paragraph
    (5)(A) or (7)(A)(i) of subsection (a) of this section, who is in
    possession of an immigrant visa may, if otherwise admissible, be
    admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General if the Attorney
    General is satisfied that inadmissibility was not known to, and
    could not have been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable
    diligence by, the immigrant before the time of departure of the
    vessel or aircraft from the last port outside the United States and
    outside foreign contiguous territory or, in the case of an
    immigrant coming from foreign contiguous territory, before the time
    of the immigrant's application for admission.
    (l) Guam and Northern Mariana Islands visa waiver program
      (1) In general
        The requirement of subsection (a)(7)(B)(i) may be waived by the
      Secretary of Homeland Security, in the case of an alien applying
      for admission as a nonimmigrant visitor for business or pleasure
      and solely for entry into and stay in Guam or the Commonwealth of
      the Northern Mariana Islands for a period not to exceed 45 days,
      if the Secretary of Homeland Security, after consultation with
      the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of State, the
      Governor of Guam and the Governor of the Commonwealth of the
      Northern Mariana Islands, determines that - 
          (A) an adequate arrival and departure control system has been
        developed in Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
        Islands; and
          (B) such a waiver does not represent a threat to the welfare,
        safety, or security of the United States or its territories and
        commonwealths.
      (2) Alien waiver of rights
        An alien may not be provided a waiver under this subsection
      unless the alien has waived any right - 
          (A) to review or appeal under this chapter an immigration
        officer's determination as to the admissibility of the alien at
        the port of entry into Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern
        Mariana Islands; or
          (B) to contest, other than on the basis of an application for
        withholding of removal under section 1231(b)(3) of this title
        or under the Convention Against Torture, or an application for
        asylum if permitted under section 1158 of this title, any
        action for removal of the alien.
      (3) Regulations
        All necessary regulations to implement this subsection shall be
      promulgated by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in
      consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary
      of State, on or before the 180th day after May 8, 2008. The
      promulgation of such regulations shall be considered a foreign
      affairs function for purposes of section 553(a) of title 5. At a
      minimum, such regulations should include, but not necessarily be
      limited to - 
          (A) a listing of all countries whose nationals may obtain the
        waiver also provided by this subsection, except that such
        regulations shall provide for a listing of any country from
        which the Commonwealth has received a significant economic
        benefit from the number of visitors for pleasure within the one-
        year period preceding May 8, 2008, unless the Secretary of
        Homeland Security determines that such country's inclusion on
        such list would represent a threat to the welfare, safety, or
        security of the United States or its territories; and
          (B) any bonding requirements for nationals of some or all of
        those countries who may present an increased risk of overstays
        or other potential problems, if different from such
        requirements otherwise provided by law for nonimmigrant
        visitors.
      (4) Factors
        In determining whether to grant or continue providing the
      waiver under this subsection to nationals of any country, the
      Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the
      Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of State, shall
      consider all factors that the Secretary deems relevant, including
      electronic travel authorizations, procedures for reporting lost
      and stolen passports, repatriation of aliens, rates of refusal
      for nonimmigrant visitor visas, overstays, exit systems, and
      information exchange.
      (5) Suspension
        The Secretary of Homeland Security shall monitor the admission
      of nonimmigrant visitors to Guam and the Commonwealth of the
      Northern Mariana Islands under this subsection. If the Secretary
      determines that such admissions have resulted in an unacceptable
      number of visitors from a country remaining unlawfully in Guam or
      the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, unlawfully
      obtaining entry to other parts of the United States, or seeking
      withholding of removal or asylum, or that visitors from a country
      pose a risk to law enforcement or security interests of Guam or
      the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or of the United
      States (including the interest in the enforcement of the
      immigration laws of the United States), the Secretary shall
      suspend the admission of nationals of such country under this
      subsection. The Secretary of Homeland Security may in the
      Secretary's discretion suspend the Guam and Northern Mariana
      Islands visa waiver program at any time, on a country-by-country
      basis, for other good cause.
      (6) Addition of countries
        The Governor of Guam and the Governor of the Commonwealth of
      the Northern Mariana Islands may request the Secretary of the
      Interior and the Secretary of Homeland Security to add a
      particular country to the list of countries whose nationals may
      obtain the waiver provided by this subsection, and the Secretary
      of Homeland Security may grant such request after consultation
      with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of State,
      and may promulgate regulations with respect to the inclusion of
      that country and any special requirements the Secretary of
      Homeland Security, in the Secretary's sole discretion, may impose
      prior to allowing nationals of that country to obtain the waiver
      provided by this subsection.
    (m) Requirements for admission of nonimmigrant nurses
      (1) The qualifications referred to in section
    1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of this title, with respect to an alien who is
    coming to the United States to perform nursing services for a
    facility, are that the alien - 
        (A) has obtained a full and unrestricted license to practice
      professional nursing in the country where the alien obtained
      nursing education or has received nursing education in the United
      States;
        (B) has passed an appropriate examination (recognized in
      regulations promulgated in consultation with the Secretary of
      Health and Human Services) or has a full and unrestricted license
      under State law to practice professional nursing in the State of
      intended employment; and
        (C) is fully qualified and eligible under the laws (including
      such temporary or interim licensing requirements which authorize
      the nurse to be employed) governing the place of intended
      employment to engage in the practice of professional nursing as a
      registered nurse immediately upon admission to the United States
      and is authorized under such laws to be employed by the facility.

      (2)(A) The attestation referred to in section
    1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of this title, with respect to a facility for
    which an alien will perform services, is an attestation as to the
    following:
        (i) The facility meets all the requirements of paragraph (6).
        (ii) The employment of the alien will not adversely affect the
      wages and working conditions of registered nurses similarly
      employed.
        (iii) The alien employed by the facility will be paid the wage
      rate for registered nurses similarly employed by the facility.
        (iv) The facility has taken and is taking timely and
      significant steps designed to recruit and retain sufficient
      registered nurses who are United States citizens or immigrants
      who are authorized to perform nursing services, in order to
      remove as quickly as reasonably possible the dependence of the
      facility on nonimmigrant registered nurses.
        (v) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor
      dispute, the facility did not lay off and will not lay off a
      registered nurse employed by the facility within the period
      beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date of
      filing of any visa petition, and the employment of such an alien
      is not intended or designed to influence an election for a
      bargaining representative for registered nurses of the facility.
        (vi) At the time of the filing of the petition for registered
      nurses under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of this title, notice
      of the filing has been provided by the facility to the bargaining
      representative of the registered nurses at the facility or, where
      there is no such bargaining representative, notice of the filing
      has been provided to the registered nurses employed at the
      facility through posting in conspicuous locations.
        (vii) The facility will not, at any time, employ a number of
      aliens issued visas or otherwise provided nonimmigrant status
      under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of this title that exceeds 33
      percent of the total number of registered nurses employed by the
      facility.
        (viii) The facility will not, with respect to any alien issued
      a visa or otherwise provided nonimmigrant status under section
      1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of this title - 
          (I) authorize the alien to perform nursing services at any
        worksite other than a worksite controlled by the facility; or
          (II) transfer the place of employment of the alien from one
        worksite to another.

      Nothing in clause (iv) shall be construed as requiring a facility
      to have taken significant steps described in such clause before
      November 12, 1999. A copy of the attestation shall be provided,
      within 30 days of the date of filing, to registered nurses
      employed at the facility on the date of filing.

      (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(iv), each of the following
    shall be considered a significant step reasonably designed to
    recruit and retain registered nurses:
        (i) Operating a training program for registered nurses at the
      facility or financing (or providing participation in) a training
      program for registered nurses elsewhere.
        (ii) Providing career development programs and other methods of
      facilitating health care workers to become registered nurses.
        (iii) Paying registered nurses wages at a rate higher than
      currently being paid to registered nurses similarly employed in
      the geographic area.
        (iv) Providing reasonable opportunities for meaningful salary
      advancement by registered nurses.

    The steps described in this subparagraph shall not be considered to
    be an exclusive list of the significant steps that may be taken to
    meet the conditions of subparagraph (A)(iv). Nothing in this
    subparagraph shall require a facility to take more than one step if
    the facility can demonstrate that taking a second step is not
    reasonable.
      (C) Subject to subparagraph (E), an attestation under
    subparagraph (A) - 
        (i) shall expire on the date that is the later of - 
          (I) the end of the one-year period beginning on the date of
        its filing with the Secretary of Labor; or
          (II) the end of the period of admission under section
        1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of this title of the last alien with
        respect to whose admission it was applied (in accordance with
        clause (ii)); and

        (ii) shall apply to petitions filed during the one-year period
      beginning on the date of its filing with the Secretary of Labor
      if the facility states in each such petition that it continues to
      comply with the conditions in the attestation.

      (D) A facility may meet the requirements under this paragraph
    with respect to more than one registered nurse in a single
    petition.
      (E)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall compile and make available
    for public examination in a timely manner in Washington, D.C., a
    list identifying facilities which have filed petitions for
    nonimmigrants under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of this title and,
    for each such facility, a copy of the facility's attestation under
    subparagraph (A) (and accompanying documentation) and each such
    petition filed by the facility.
      (ii) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process, including
    reasonable time limits, for the receipt, investigation, and
    disposition of complaints respecting a facility's failure to meet
    conditions attested to or a facility's misrepresentation of a
    material fact in an attestation. Complaints may be filed by any
    aggrieved person or organization (including bargaining
    representatives, associations deemed appropriate by the Secretary,
    and other aggrieved parties as determined under regulations of the
    Secretary). The Secretary shall conduct an investigation under this
    clause if there is reasonable cause to believe that a facility
    fails to meet conditions attested to. Subject to the time limits
    established under this clause, this subparagraph shall apply
    regardless of whether an attestation is expired or unexpired at the
    time a complaint is filed.
      (iii) Under such process, the Secretary shall provide, within 180
    days after the date such a complaint is filed, for a determination
    as to whether or not a basis exists to make a finding described in
    clause (iv). If the Secretary determines that such a basis exists,
    the Secretary shall provide for notice of such determination to the
    interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing on the
    complaint within 60 days of the date of the determination.
      (iv) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and
    opportunity for a hearing, that a facility (for which an
    attestation is made) has failed to meet a condition attested to or
    that there was a misrepresentation of material fact in the
    attestation, the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of
    such finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative
    remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to
    exceed $1,000 per nurse per violation, with the total penalty not
    to exceed $10,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to be
    appropriate. Upon receipt of such notice, the Attorney General
    shall not approve petitions filed with respect to a facility during
    a period of at least one year for nurses to be employed by the
    facility.
      (v) In addition to the sanctions provided for under clause (iv),
    if the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and an opportunity
    for a hearing, that a facility has violated the condition attested
    to under subparagraph (A)(iii) (relating to payment of registered
    nurses at the prevailing wage rate), the Secretary shall order the
    facility to provide for payment of such amounts of back pay as may
    be required to comply with such condition.
      (F)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall impose on a facility filing
    an attestation under subparagraph (A) a filing fee, in an amount
    prescribed by the Secretary based on the costs of carrying out the
    Secretary's duties under this subsection, but not exceeding $250.
      (ii) Fees collected under this subparagraph shall be deposited in
    a fund established for this purpose in the Treasury of the United
    States.
      (iii) The collected fees in the fund shall be available to the
    Secretary of Labor, to the extent and in such amounts as may be
    provided in appropriations Acts, to cover the costs described in
    clause (i), in addition to any other funds that are available to
    the Secretary to cover such costs.
      (3) The period of admission of an alien under section
    1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of this title shall be 3 years.
      (4) The total number of nonimmigrant visas issued pursuant to
    petitions granted under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of this title
    in each fiscal year shall not exceed 500. The number of such visas
    issued for employment in each State in each fiscal year shall not
    exceed the following:
        (A) For States with populations of less than 9,000,000, based
      upon the 1990 decennial census of population, 25 visas.
        (B) For States with populations of 9,000,000 or more, based
      upon the 1990 decennial census of population, 50 visas.
        (C) If the total number of visas available under this paragraph
      for a fiscal year quarter exceeds the number of qualified
      nonimmigrants who may be issued such visas during those quarters,
      the visas made available under this paragraph shall be issued
      without regard to the numerical limitation under subparagraph (A)
      or (B) of this paragraph during the last fiscal year quarter.

      (5) A facility that has filed a petition under section
    1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of this title to employ a nonimmigrant to
    perform nursing services for the facility - 
        (A) shall provide the nonimmigrant a wage rate and working
      conditions commensurate with those of nurses similarly employed
      by the facility;
        (B) shall require the nonimmigrant to work hours commensurate
      with those of nurses similarly employed by the facility; and
        (C) shall not interfere with the right of the nonimmigrant to
      join or organize a union.

      (6) For purposes of this subsection and section
    1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of this title, the term "facility" means a
    subsection (d) hospital (as defined in section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the
    Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(1)(B))) that meets the
    following requirements:
        (A) As of March 31, 1997, the hospital was located in a health
      professional shortage area (as defined in section 254e of title
      42).
        (B) Based on its settled cost report filed under title XVIII of
      the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.] for its cost
      reporting period beginning during fiscal year 1994 - 
          (i) the hospital has not less than 190 licensed acute care
        beds;
          (ii) the number of the hospital's inpatient days for such
        period which were made up of patients who (for such days) were
        entitled to benefits under part A of such title [42 U.S.C.
        1395c et seq.] is not less than 35 percent of the total number
        of such hospital's acute care inpatient days for such period;
        and
          (iii) the number of the hospital's inpatient days for such
        period which were made up of patients who (for such days) were
        eligible for medical assistance under a State plan approved
        under title XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et
        seq.], is not less than 28 percent of the total number of such
        hospital's acute care inpatient days for such period.

      (7) For purposes of paragraph (2)(A)(v), the term "lay off", with
    respect to a worker - 
        (A) means to cause the worker's loss of employment, other than
      through a discharge for inadequate performance, violation of
      workplace rules, cause, voluntary departure, voluntary
      retirement, or the expiration of a grant or contract; but
        (B) does not include any situation in which the worker is
      offered, as an alternative to such loss of employment, a similar
      employment opportunity with the same employer at equivalent or
      higher compensation and benefits than the position from which the
      employee was discharged, regardless of whether or not the
      employee accepts the offer.

    Nothing in this paragraph is intended to limit an employee's or an
    employer's rights under a collective bargaining agreement or other
    employment contract.
    (n) Labor condition application
      (1) No alien may be admitted or provided status as an H-1B
    nonimmigrant in an occupational classification unless the employer
    has filed with the Secretary of Labor an application stating the
    following:
        (A) The employer - 
          (i) is offering and will offer during the period of
        authorized employment to aliens admitted or provided status as
        an H-1B nonimmigrant wages that are at least - 
            (I) the actual wage level paid by the employer to all other
          individuals with similar experience and qualifications for
          the specific employment in question, or
            (II) the prevailing wage level for the occupational
          classification in the area of employment,

        whichever is greater, based on the best information available
        as of the time of filing the application, and
          (ii) will provide working conditions for such a nonimmigrant
        that will not adversely affect the working conditions of
        workers similarly employed.

        (B) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor
      dispute in the occupational classification at the place of
      employment.
        (C) The employer, at the time of filing the application - 
          (i) has provided notice of the filing under this paragraph to
        the bargaining representative (if any) of the employer's
        employees in the occupational classification and area for which
        aliens are sought, or
          (ii) if there is no such bargaining representative, has
        provided notice of filing in the occupational classification
        through such methods as physical posting in conspicuous
        locations at the place of employment or electronic notification
        to employees in the occupational classification for which H-1B
        nonimmigrants are sought.

        (D) The application shall contain a specification of the number
      of workers sought, the occupational classification in which the
      workers will be employed, and wage rate and conditions under
      which they will be employed.
        (E)(i) In the case of an application described in clause (ii),
      the employer did not displace and will not displace a United
      States worker (as defined in paragraph (4)) employed by the
      employer within the period beginning 90 days before and ending 90
      days after the date of filing of any visa petition supported by
      the application.
        (ii) An application described in this clause is an application
      filed on or after the date final regulations are first
      promulgated to carry out this subparagraph, and before (!8) by an
      H-1B-dependent employer (as defined in paragraph (3)) or by an
      employer that has been found, on or after October 21, 1998, under
      paragraph (2)(C) or (5) to have committed a willful failure or
      misrepresentation during the 5-year period preceding the filing
      of the application. An application is not described in this
      clause if the only H-1B nonimmigrants sought in the application
      are exempt H-1B nonimmigrants.

        (F) In the case of an application described in subparagraph
      (E)(ii), the employer will not place the nonimmigrant with
      another employer (regardless of whether or not such other
      employer is an H-1B-dependent employer) where - 
          (i) the nonimmigrant performs duties in whole or in part at
        one or more worksites owned, operated, or controlled by such
        other employer; and
          (ii) there are indicia of an employment relationship between
        the nonimmigrant and such other employer;

      unless the employer has inquired of the other employer as to
      whether, and has no knowledge that, within the period beginning
      90 days before and ending 90 days after the date of the placement
      of the nonimmigrant with the other employer, the other employer
      has displaced or intends to displace a United States worker
      employed by the other employer.
        (G)(i) In the case of an application described in subparagraph
      (E)(ii), subject to clause (ii), the employer, prior to filing
      the application - 
          (I) has taken good faith steps to recruit, in the United
        States using procedures that meet industry-wide standards and
        offering compensation that is at least as great as that
        required to be offered to H-1B nonimmigrants under subparagraph
        (A), United States workers for the job for which the
        nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or are sought; and
          (II) has offered the job to any United States worker who
        applies and is equally or better qualified for the job for
        which the nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or are sought.

        (ii) The conditions described in clause (i) shall not apply to
      an application filed with respect to the employment of an H-1B
      nonimmigrant who is described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of
      section 1153(b)(1) of this title.

    The employer shall make available for public examination, within
    one working day after the date on which an application under this
    paragraph is filed, at the employer's principal place of business
    or worksite, a copy of each such application (and such accompanying
    documents as are necessary). The Secretary shall compile, on a
    current basis, a list (by employer and by occupational
    classification) of the applications filed under this subsection.
    Such list shall include the wage rate, number of aliens sought,
    period of intended employment, and date of need. The Secretary
    shall make such list available for public examination in
    Washington, D.C. The Secretary of Labor shall review such an
    application only for completeness and obvious inaccuracies. Unless
    the Secretary finds that the application is incomplete or obviously
    inaccurate, the Secretary shall provide the certification described
    in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this title within 7 days of the
    date of the filing of the application. The application form shall
    include a clear statement explaining the liability under
    subparagraph (F) of a placing employer if the other employer
    described in such subparagraph displaces a United States worker as
    described in such subparagraph. Nothing in subparagraph (G) shall
    be construed to prohibit an employer from using legitimate
    selection criteria relevant to the job that are normal or customary
    to the type of job involved, so long as such criteria are not
    applied in a discriminatory manner.
      (2)(A) Subject to paragraph (5)(A), the Secretary shall establish
    a process for the receipt, investigation, and disposition of
    complaints respecting a petitioner's failure to meet a condition
    specified in an application submitted under paragraph (1) or a
    petitioner's misrepresentation of material facts in such an
    application. Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or
    organization (including bargaining representatives). No
    investigation or hearing shall be conducted on a complaint
    concerning such a failure or misrepresentation unless the complaint
    was filed not later than 12 months after the date of the failure or
    misrepresentation, respectively. The Secretary shall conduct an
    investigation under this paragraph if there is reasonable cause to
    believe that such a failure or misrepresentation has occurred.
      (B) Under such process, the Secretary shall provide, within 30
    days after the date such a complaint is filed, for a determination
    as to whether or not a reasonable basis exists to make a finding
    described in subparagraph (C). If the Secretary determines that
    such a reasonable basis exists, the Secretary shall provide for
    notice of such determination to the interested parties and an
    opportunity for a hearing on the complaint, in accordance with
    section 556 of title 5, within 60 days after the date of the
    determination. If such a hearing is requested, the Secretary shall
    make a finding concerning the matter by not later than 60 days
    after the date of the hearing. In the case of similar complaints
    respecting the same applicant, the Secretary may consolidate the
    hearings under this subparagraph on such complaints.
      (C)(i) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
    hearing, a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(B), (1)(E),
    or (1)(F), a substantial failure to meet a condition of paragraph
    (1)(C), (1)(D), or (1)(G)(i)(I), or a misrepresentation of material
    fact in an application - 
        (I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such
      finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative
      remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to
      exceed $1,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to be
      appropriate; and
        (II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed
      with respect to that employer under section 1154 or 1184(c) of
      this title during a period of at least 1 year for aliens to be
      employed by the employer.

      (ii) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
    hearing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1), a
    willful misrepresentation of material fact in an application, or a
    violation of clause (iv) - 
        (I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such
      finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative
      remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to
      exceed $5,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to be
      appropriate; and
        (II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed
      with respect to that employer under section 1154 or 1184(c) of
      this title during a period of at least 2 years for aliens to be
      employed by the employer.

      (iii) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
    hearing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1) or
    a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an application, in
    the course of which failure or misrepresentation the employer
    displaced a United States worker employed by the employer within
    the period beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the
    date of filing of any visa petition supported by the application - 
        (I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such
      finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative
      remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to
      exceed $35,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to be
      appropriate; and
        (II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed
      with respect to that employer under section 1154 or 1184(c) of
      this title during a period of at least 3 years for aliens to be
      employed by the employer.

      (iv) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has
    filed an application under this subsection to intimidate, threaten,
    restrain, coerce, blacklist, discharge, or in any other manner
    discriminate against an employee (which term, for purposes of this
    clause, includes a former employee and an applicant for employment)
    because the employee has disclosed information to the employer, or
    to any other person, that the employee reasonably believes
    evidences a violation of this subsection, or any rule or regulation
    pertaining to this subsection, or because the employee cooperates
    or seeks to cooperate in an investigation or other proceeding
    concerning the employer's compliance with the requirements of this
    subsection or any rule or regulation pertaining to this subsection.
      (v) The Secretary of Labor and the Attorney General shall devise
    a process under which an H-1B nonimmigrant who files a complaint
    regarding a violation of clause (iv) and is otherwise eligible to
    remain and work in the United States may be allowed to seek other
    appropriate employment in the United States for a period not to
    exceed the maximum period of stay authorized for such nonimmigrant
    classification.
      (vi)(I) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has
    filed an application under this subsection to require an H-1B
    nonimmigrant to pay a penalty for ceasing employment with the
    employer prior to a date agreed to by the nonimmigrant and the
    employer. The Secretary shall determine whether a required payment
    is a penalty (and not liquidated damages) pursuant to relevant
    State law.
      (II) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has
    filed an application under this subsection to require an alien who
    is the subject of a petition filed under section 1184(c)(1) of this
    title, for which a fee is imposed under section 1184(c)(9) of this
    title, to reimburse, or otherwise compensate, the employer for part
    or all of the cost of such fee. It is a violation of this clause
    for such an employer otherwise to accept such reimbursement or
    compensation from such an alien.
      (III) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
    hearing, that an employer has committed a violation of this clause,
    the Secretary may impose a civil monetary penalty of $1,000 for
    each such violation and issue an administrative order requiring the
    return to the nonimmigrant of any amount paid in violation of this
    clause, or, if the nonimmigrant cannot be located, requiring
    payment of any such amount to the general fund of the Treasury.
      (vii)(I) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A)
    for an employer, who has filed an application under this subsection
    and who places an H-1B nonimmigrant designated as a full-time
    employee on the petition filed under section 1184(c)(1) of this
    title by the employer with respect to the nonimmigrant, after the
    nonimmigrant has entered into employment with the employer, in
    nonproductive status due to a decision by the employer (based on
    factors such as lack of work), or due to the nonimmigrant's lack of
    a permit or license, to fail to pay the nonimmigrant full-time
    wages in accordance with paragraph (1)(A) for all such
    nonproductive time.
      (II) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for
    an employer, who has filed an application under this subsection and
    who places an H-1B nonimmigrant designated as a part-time employee
    on the petition filed under section 1184(c)(1) of this title by the
    employer with respect to the nonimmigrant, after the nonimmigrant
    has entered into employment with the employer, in nonproductive
    status under circumstances described in subclause (I), to fail to
    pay such a nonimmigrant for such hours as are designated on such
    petition consistent with the rate of pay identified on such
    petition.
      (III) In the case of an H-1B nonimmigrant who has not yet entered
    into employment with an employer who has had approved an
    application under this subsection, and a petition under section
    1184(c)(1) of this title, with respect to the nonimmigrant, the
    provisions of subclauses (I) and (II) shall apply to the employer
    beginning 30 days after the date the nonimmigrant first is admitted
    into the United States pursuant to the petition, or 60 days after
    the date the nonimmigrant becomes eligible to work for the employer
    (in the case of a nonimmigrant who is present in the United States
    on the date of the approval of the petition).
      (IV) This clause does not apply to a failure to pay wages to an H-
    1B nonimmigrant for nonproductive time due to non-work-related
    factors, such as the voluntary request of the nonimmigrant for an
    absence or circumstances rendering the nonimmigrant unable to work.
      (V) This clause shall not be construed as prohibiting an employer
    that is a school or other educational institution from applying to
    an H-1B nonimmigrant an established salary practice of the
    employer, under which the employer pays to H-1B nonimmigrants and
    United States workers in the same occupational classification an
    annual salary in disbursements over fewer than 12 months, if - 
        (aa) the nonimmigrant agrees to the compressed annual salary
      payments prior to the commencement of the employment; and
        (bb) the application of the salary practice to the nonimmigrant
      does not otherwise cause the nonimmigrant to violate any
      condition of the nonimmigrant's authorization under this chapter
      to remain in the United States.

      (VI) This clause shall not be construed as superseding clause
    (viii).
      (viii) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A)
    for an employer who has filed an application under this subsection
    to fail to offer to an H-1B nonimmigrant, during the nonimmigrant's
    period of authorized employment, benefits and eligibility for
    benefits (including the opportunity to participate in health, life,
    disability, and other insurance plans; the opportunity to
    participate in retirement and savings plans; and cash bonuses and
    noncash compensation, such as stock options (whether or not based
    on performance)) on the same basis, and in accordance with the same
    criteria, as the employer offers to United States workers.
      (D) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
    hearing, that an employer has not paid wages at the wage level
    specified under the application and required under paragraph (1),
    the Secretary shall order the employer to provide for payment of
    such amounts of back pay as may be required to comply with the
    requirements of paragraph (1), whether or not a penalty under
    subparagraph (C) has been imposed.
      (E) If an H-1B-dependent employer places a nonexempt H-1B
    nonimmigrant with another employer as provided under paragraph
    (1)(F) and the other employer has displaced or displaces a United
    States worker employed by such other employer during the period
    described in such paragraph, such displacement shall be considered
    for purposes of this paragraph a failure, by the placing employer,
    to meet a condition specified in an application submitted under
    paragraph (1); except that the Attorney General may impose a
    sanction described in subclause (II) of subparagraph (C)(i),
    (C)(ii), or (C)(iii) only if the Secretary of Labor found that such
    placing employer - 
        (i) knew or had reason to know of such displacement at the time
      of the placement of the nonimmigrant with the other employer; or
        (ii) has been subject to a sanction under this subparagraph
      based upon a previous placement of an H-1B nonimmigrant with the
      same other employer.

      (F) The Secretary may, on a case-by-case basis, subject an
    employer to random investigations for a period of up to 5 years,
    beginning on the date (on or after October 21, 1998) on which the
    employer is found by the Secretary to have committed a willful
    failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1) (or has been found
    under paragraph (5) to have committed a willful failure to meet the
    condition of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II)) or to have made a willful
    misrepresentation of material fact in an application. The preceding
    sentence shall apply to an employer regardless of whether or not
    the employer is an H-1B-dependent employer. The authority of the
    Secretary under this subparagraph shall not be construed to be
    subject to, or limited by, the requirements of subparagraph (A).
      (G)(i) The Secretary of Labor may initiate an investigation of
    any employer that employs nonimmigrants described in section
    1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this title if the Secretary of Labor has
    reasonable cause to believe that the employer is not in compliance
    with this subsection. In the case of an investigation under this
    clause, the Secretary of Labor (or the acting Secretary in the case
    of the absence of (!9) disability of the Secretary of Labor) shall
    personally certify that reasonable cause exists and shall approve
    commencement of the investigation. The investigation may be
    initiated for reasons other than completeness and obvious
    inaccuracies by the employer in complying with this subsection.

      (ii) If the Secretary of Labor receives specific credible
    information from a source who is likely to have knowledge of an
    employer's practices or employment conditions, or an employer's
    compliance with the employer's labor condition application under
    paragraph (1), and whose identity is known to the Secretary of
    Labor, and such information provides reasonable cause to believe
    that the employer has committed a willful failure to meet a
    condition of paragraph (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(C), (1)(E), (1)(F), or
    (1)(G)(i)(I), has engaged in a pattern or practice of failures to
    meet such a condition, or has committed a substantial failure to
    meet such a condition that affects multiple employees, the
    Secretary of Labor may conduct an investigation into the alleged
    failure or failures. The Secretary of Labor may withhold the
    identity of the source from the employer, and the source's identity
    shall not be subject to disclosure under section 552 of title 5.
      (iii) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a procedure for any
    person desiring to provide to the Secretary of Labor information
    described in clause (ii) that may be used, in whole or in part, as
    the basis for the commencement of an investigation described in
    such clause, to provide the information in writing on a form
    developed and provided by the Secretary of Labor and completed by
    or on behalf of the person. The person may not be an officer or
    employee of the Department of Labor, unless the information
    satisfies the requirement of clause (iv)(II) (although an officer
    or employee of the Department of Labor may complete the form on
    behalf of the person).
      (iv) Any investigation initiated or approved by the Secretary of
    Labor under clause (ii) shall be based on information that
    satisfies the requirements of such clause and that - 
        (I) originates from a source other than an officer or employee
      of the Department of Labor; or
        (II) was lawfully obtained by the Secretary of Labor in the
      course of lawfully conducting another Department of Labor
      investigation under this chapter of (!9) any other Act.

      (v) The receipt by the Secretary of Labor of information
    submitted by an employer to the Attorney General or the Secretary
    of Labor for purposes of securing the employment of a nonimmigrant
    described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this title shall not
    be considered a receipt of information for purposes of clause (ii).
      (vi) No investigation described in clause (ii) (or hearing
    described in clause (viii) based on such investigation) may be
    conducted with respect to information about a failure to meet a
    condition described in clause (ii), unless the Secretary of Labor
    receives the information not later than 12 months after the date of
    the alleged failure.
      (vii) The Secretary of Labor shall provide notice to an employer
    with respect to whom there is reasonable cause to initiate an
    investigation described in clauses (!10) (i) or (ii), prior to the
    commencement of an investigation under such clauses, of the intent
    to conduct an investigation. The notice shall be provided in such a
    manner, and shall contain sufficient detail, to permit the employer
    to respond to the allegations before an investigation is commenced.
    The Secretary of Labor is not required to comply with this clause
    if the Secretary of Labor determines that to do so would interfere
    with an effort by the Secretary of Labor to secure compliance by
    the employer with the requirements of this subsection. There shall
    be no judicial review of a determination by the Secretary of Labor
    under this clause.

      (viii) An investigation under clauses (!10) (i) or (ii) may be
    conducted for a period of up to 60 days. If the Secretary of Labor
    determines after such an investigation that a reasonable basis
    exists to make a finding that the employer has committed a willful
    failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(C),
    (1)(E), (1)(F), or (1)(G)(i)(I), has engaged in a pattern or
    practice of failures to meet such a condition, or has committed a
    substantial failure to meet such a condition that affects multiple
    employees, the Secretary of Labor shall provide for notice of such
    determination to the interested parties and an opportunity for a
    hearing in accordance with section 556 of title 5 within 120 days
    after the date of the determination. If such a hearing is
    requested, the Secretary of Labor shall make a finding concerning
    the matter by not later than 120 days after the date of the
    hearing.
      (H)(i) Except as provided in clauses (ii) and (iii), a person or
    entity is considered to have complied with the requirements of this
    subsection, notwithstanding a technical or procedural failure to
    meet such requirements, if there was a good faith attempt to comply
    with the requirements.
      (ii) Clause (i) shall not apply if - 
        (I) the Department of Labor (or another enforcement agency) has
      explained to the person or entity the basis for the failure;
        (II) the person or entity has been provided a period of not
      less than 10 business days (beginning after the date of the
      explanation) within which to correct the failure; and
        (III) the person or entity has not corrected the failure
      voluntarily within such period.

      (iii) A person or entity that, in the course of an investigation,
    is found to have violated the prevailing wage requirements set
    forth in paragraph (1)(A), shall not be assessed fines or other
    penalties for such violation if the person or entity can establish
    that the manner in which the prevailing wage was calculated was
    consistent with recognized industry standards and practices.
      (iv) Clauses (i) and (iii) shall not apply to a person or entity
    that has engaged in or is engaging in a pattern or practice of
    willful violations of this subsection.
      (I) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as superseding
    or preempting any other enforcement-related authority under this
    chapter (such as the authorities under section 1324b of this
    title), or any other Act.
      (3)(A) For purposes of this subsection, the term "H-1B-dependent
    employer" means an employer that - 
        (i)(I) has 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees who are
      employed in the United States; and (II) employs more than 7 H-1B
      nonimmigrants;
        (ii)(I) has at least 26 but not more than 50 full-time
      equivalent employees who are employed in the United States; and
      (II) employs more than 12 H-1B nonimmigrants; or
        (iii)(I) has at least 51 full-time equivalent employees who are
      employed in the United States; and (II) employs H-1B
      nonimmigrants in a number that is equal to at least 15 percent of
      the number of such full-time equivalent employees.

      (B) For purposes of this subsection - 
        (i) the term "exempt H-1B nonimmigrant" means an H-1B
      nonimmigrant who - 
          (I) receives wages (including cash bonuses and similar
        compensation) at an annual rate equal to at least $60,000; or
          (II) has attained a master's or higher degree (or its
        equivalent) in a specialty related to the intended employment;
        and

        (ii) the term "nonexempt H-1B nonimmigrant" means an H-1B
      nonimmigrant who is not an exempt H-1B nonimmigrant.

      (C) For purposes of subparagraph (A) - 
        (i) in computing the number of full-time equivalent employees
      and the number of H-1B nonimmigrants, exempt H-1B nonimmigrants
      shall not be taken into account during the longer of - 
          (I) the 6-month period beginning on October 21, 1998; or
          (II) the period beginning on October 21, 1998, and ending on
        the date final regulations are issued to carry out this
        paragraph; and

        (ii) any group treated as a single employer under subsection
      (b), (c), (m), or (o) of section 414 of title 26 shall be treated
      as a single employer.

      (4) For purposes of this subsection:
        (A) The term "area of employment" means the area within normal
      commuting distance of the worksite or physical location where the
      work of the H-1B nonimmigrant is or will be performed. If such
      worksite or location is within a Metropolitan Statistical Area,
      any place within such area is deemed to be within the area of
      employment.
        (B) In the case of an application with respect to one or more H-
      1B nonimmigrants by an employer, the employer is considered to
      "displace" a United States worker from a job if the employer lays
      off the worker from a job that is essentially the equivalent of
      the job for which the nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or are
      sought. A job shall not be considered to be essentially
      equivalent of another job unless it involves essentially the same
      responsibilities, was held by a United States worker with
      substantially equivalent qualifications and experience, and is
      located in the same area of employment as the other job.
        (C) The term "H-1B nonimmigrant" means an alien admitted or
      provided status as a nonimmigrant described in section
      1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this title.
        (D)(i) The term "lays off", with respect to a worker - 
          (I) means to cause the worker's loss of employment, other
        than through a discharge for inadequate performance, violation
        of workplace rules, cause, voluntary departure, voluntary
        retirement, or the expiration of a grant or contract (other
        than a temporary employment contract entered into in order to
        evade a condition described in subparagraph (E) or (F) of
        paragraph (1)); but
          (II) does not include any situation in which the worker is
        offered, as an alternative to such loss of employment, a
        similar employment opportunity with the same employer (or, in
        the case of a placement of a worker with another employer under
        paragraph (1)(F), with either employer described in such
        paragraph) at equivalent or higher compensation and benefits
        than the position from which the employee was discharged,
        regardless of whether or not the employee accepts the offer.

        (ii) Nothing in this subparagraph is intended to limit an
      employee's rights under a collective bargaining agreement or
      other employment contract.
        (E) The term "United States worker" means an employee who - 
          (i) is a citizen or national of the United States; or
          (ii) is an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent
        residence, is admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of this
        title, is granted asylum under section 1158 of this title, or
        is an immigrant otherwise authorized, by this chapter or by the
        Attorney General, to be employed.

      (5)(A) This paragraph shall apply instead of subparagraphs (A)
    through (E) of paragraph (2) in the case of a violation described
    in subparagraph (B), but shall not be construed to limit or affect
    the authority of the Secretary or the Attorney General with respect
    to any other violation.
      (B) The Attorney General shall establish a process for the
    receipt, initial review, and disposition in accordance with this
    paragraph of complaints respecting an employer's failure to meet
    the condition of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II) or a petitioner's
    misrepresentation of material facts with respect to such condition.
    Complaints may be filed by an aggrieved individual who has
    submitted a resume or otherwise applied in a reasonable manner for
    the job that is the subject of the condition. No proceeding shall
    be conducted under this paragraph on a complaint concerning such a
    failure or misrepresentation unless the Attorney General determines
    that the complaint was filed not later than 12 months after the
    date of the failure or misrepresentation, respectively.
      (C) If the Attorney General finds that a complaint has been filed
    in accordance with subparagraph (B) and there is reasonable cause
    to believe that such a failure or misrepresentation described in
    such complaint has occurred, the Attorney General shall initiate
    binding arbitration proceedings by requesting the Federal Mediation
    and Conciliation Service to appoint an arbitrator from the roster
    of arbitrators maintained by such Service. The procedure and rules
    of such Service shall be applicable to the selection of such
    arbitrator and to such arbitration proceedings. The Attorney
    General shall pay the fee and expenses of the arbitrator.
      (D)(i) The arbitrator shall make findings respecting whether a
    failure or misrepresentation described in subparagraph (B)
    occurred. If the arbitrator concludes that failure or
    misrepresentation was willful, the arbitrator shall make a finding
    to that effect. The arbitrator may not find such a failure or
    misrepresentation (or that such a failure or misrepresentation was
    willful) unless the complainant demonstrates such a failure or
    misrepresentation (or its willful character) by clear and
    convincing evidence. The arbitrator shall transmit the findings in
    the form of a written opinion to the parties to the arbitration and
    the Attorney General. Such findings shall be final and conclusive,
    and, except as provided in this subparagraph, no official or court
    of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review any
    such findings.
      (ii) The Attorney General may review and reverse or modify the
    findings of an arbitrator only on the same bases as an award of an
    arbitrator may be vacated or modified under section 10 or 11 of
    title 9.
      (iii) With respect to the findings of an arbitrator, a court may
    review only the actions of the Attorney General under clause (ii)
    and may set aside such actions only on the grounds described in
    subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of section 706(a)(2) of title 5.
    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, such judicial review
    may only be brought in an appropriate United States court of
    appeals.
      (E) If the Attorney General receives a finding of an arbitrator
    under this paragraph that an employer has failed to meet the
    condition of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II) or has misrepresented a
    material fact with respect to such condition, unless the Attorney
    General reverses or modifies the finding under subparagraph (D)(ii)
    - 
        (i) the Attorney General may impose administrative remedies
      (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed
      $1,000 per violation or $5,000 per violation in the case of a
      willful failure or misrepresentation) as the Attorney General
      determines to be appropriate; and
        (ii) the Attorney General is authorized to not approve
      petitions filed, with respect to that employer and for aliens to
      be employed by the employer, under section 1154 or 1184(c) of
      this title - 
          (I) during a period of not more than 1 year; or
          (II) in the case of a willful failure or willful
        misrepresentation, during a period of not more than 2 years.

      (F) The Attorney General shall not delegate, to any other
    employee or official of the Department of Justice, any function of
    the Attorney General under this paragraph, until 60 days after the
    Attorney General has submitted a plan for such delegation to the
    Committees on the Judiciary of the United States House of
    Representatives and the Senate.
    (o) Omitted
    (p) Computation of prevailing wage level
      (1) In computing the prevailing wage level for an occupational
    classification in an area of employment for purposes of subsections
    (a)(5)(A), (n)(1)(A)(i)(II), and (t)(1)(A)(i)(II) of this section
    in the case of an employee of - 
        (A) an institution of higher education (as defined in section
      1001(a) of title 20), or a related or affiliated nonprofit
      entity; or
        (B) a nonprofit research organization or a Governmental
      research organization,

    the prevailing wage level shall only take into account employees at
    such institutions and organizations in the area of employment.
      (2) With respect to a professional athlete (as defined in
    subsection (a)(5)(A)(iii)(II) of this section) when the job
    opportunity is covered by professional sports league rules or
    regulations, the wage set forth in those rules or regulations shall
    be considered as not adversely affecting the wages of United States
    workers similarly employed and be considered the prevailing wage.
      (3) The prevailing wage required to be paid pursuant to
    subsections (a)(5)(A), (n)(1)(A)(i)(II), and (t)(1)(A)(i)(II) of
    this section shall be 100 percent of the wage determined pursuant
    to those sections.
      (4) Where the Secretary of Labor uses, or makes available to
    employers, a governmental survey to determine the prevailing wage,
    such survey shall provide at least 4 levels of wages commensurate
    with experience, education, and the level of supervision. Where an
    existing government survey has only 2 levels, 2 intermediate levels
    may be created by dividing by 3, the difference between the 2
    levels offered, adding the quotient thus obtained to the first
    level and subtracting that quotient from the second level.
    (q) Academic honoraria
      Any alien admitted under section 1101(a)(15)(B) of this title may
    accept an honorarium payment and associated incidental expenses for
    a usual academic activity or activities (lasting not longer than 9
    days at any single institution), as defined by the Attorney General
    in consultation with the Secretary of Education, if such payment is
    offered by an institution or organization described in subsection
    (p)(1) of this section and is made for services conducted for the
    benefit of that institution or entity and if the alien has not
    accepted such payment or expenses from more than 5 institutions or
    organizations in the previous 6-month period.
    (r) Exception for certain alien nurses
      Subsection (a)(5)(C) of this section shall not apply to an alien
    who seeks to enter the United States for the purpose of performing
    labor as a nurse who presents to the consular officer (or in the
    case of an adjustment of status, the Attorney General) a certified
    statement from the Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing
    Schools (or an equivalent independent credentialing organization
    approved for the certification of nurses under subsection (a)(5)(C)
    of this section by the Attorney General in consultation with the
    Secretary of Health and Human Services) that - 
        (1) the alien has a valid and unrestricted license as a nurse
      in a State where the alien intends to be employed and such State
      verifies that the foreign licenses of alien nurses are authentic
      and unencumbered;
        (2) the alien has passed the National Council Licensure
      Examination (NCLEX);
        (3) the alien is a graduate of a nursing program - 
          (A) in which the language of instruction was English;
          (B) located in a country - 
            (i) designated by such commission not later than 30 days
          after November 12, 1999, based on such commission's
          assessment that the quality of nursing education in that
          country, and the English language proficiency of those who
          complete such programs in that country, justify the country's
          designation; or
            (ii) designated on the basis of such an assessment by
          unanimous agreement of such commission and any equivalent
          credentialing organizations which have been approved under
          subsection (a)(5)(C) of this section for the certification of
          nurses under this subsection; and

          (C)(i) which was in operation on or before November 12, 1999;
        or
          (ii) has been approved by unanimous agreement of such
        commission and any equivalent credentialing organizations which
        have been approved under subsection (a)(5)(C) of this section
        for the certification of nurses under this subsection.
    (s) Consideration of benefits received as battered alien in
      determination of inadmissibility as likely to become public
      charge
      In determining whether an alien described in subsection
    (a)(4)(C)(i) of this section is inadmissible under subsection
    (a)(4) of this section or ineligible to receive an immigrant visa
    or otherwise to adjust to the status of permanent resident by
    reason of subsection (a)(4) of this section, the consular officer
    or the Attorney General shall not consider any benefits the alien
    may have received that were authorized under section 1641(c) of
    this title.
    (t) (!11) Nonimmigrant professionals; labor attestations

      (1) No alien may be admitted or provided status as a nonimmigrant
    under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title or section
    1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title in an occupational classification

          the specific employment in question; or
            (II) the prevailing wage level for the occupational
          classification in the area of employment,

        whichever is greater, based on the best information available
        as of the time of filing the attestation; and
          (ii) will provide working conditions for such a nonimmigrant
        that will not adversely affect the working conditions of
        workers similarly employed.

        (B) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor
      dispute in the occupational classification at the place of
      employment.
        (C) The employer, at the time of filing the attestation - 
          (i) has provided notice of the filing under this paragraph to
        the bargaining representative (if any) of the employer's

        aliens are sought; or
          (ii) if there is no such bargaining representative, has
        provided notice of filing in the occupational classification
        through such methods as physical posting in conspicuous
        locations at the place of employment or electronic notification
        to employees in the occupational classification for which
        nonimmigrants under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title
        or section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title are sought.

        (D) A specification of the number of workers sought, the
      occupational classification in which the workers will be
      employed, and wage rate and conditions under which they will be
      employed.

    within one working day after the date on which an attestation under
    this subsection is filed, at the employer's principal place of
    business or worksite, a copy of each such attestation (and such
    accompanying documents as are necessary).
      (B)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall compile, on a current basis,
    a list (by employer and by occupational classification) of the
    attestations filed under this subsection. Such list shall include,

    attestation is incomplete or obviously inaccurate, the Secretary of
    Labor shall provide the certification described in section
    1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title or section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii)
    of this title within 7 days of the date of the filing of the
    attestation.
      (3)(A) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process for the
    receipt, investigation, and disposition of complaints respecting
    the failure of an employer to meet a condition specified in an
    attestation submitted under this subsection or misrepresentation by
    the employer of material facts in such an attestation. Complaints
    may be filed by any aggrieved person or organization (including
    bargaining representatives). No investigation or hearing shall be
    conducted on a complaint concerning such a failure or
    misrepresentation unless the complaint was filed not later than 12
    months after the date of the failure or misrepresentation,
    respectively. The Secretary of Labor shall conduct an investigation
    under this paragraph if there is reasonable cause to believe that
    such a failure or misrepresentation has occurred.
      (B) Under the process described in subparagraph (A), the
    Secretary of Labor shall provide, within 30 days after the date a
    complaint is filed, for a determination as to whether or not a
    reasonable basis exists to make a finding described in subparagraph
    (C). If the Secretary of Labor determines that such a reasonable
    basis exists, the Secretary of Labor shall provide for notice of
    such determination to the interested parties and an opportunity for
    a hearing on the complaint, in accordance with section 556 of title
    5, within 60 days after the date of the determination. If such a
    hearing is requested, the Secretary of Labor shall make a finding
    concerning the matter by not later than 60 days after the date of
    the hearing. In the case of similar complaints respecting the same
    applicant, the Secretary of Labor may consolidate the hearings
    under this subparagraph on such complaints.
      (C)(i) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and
    opportunity for a hearing, a failure to meet a condition of
    paragraph (1)(B), a substantial failure to meet a condition of
    paragraph (1)(C) or (1)(D), or a misrepresentation of material fact
    in an attestation - 
        (I) the Secretary of Labor shall notify the Secretary of State
      and the Secretary of Homeland Security of such finding and may,
      in addition, impose such other administrative remedies (including
      civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per
      violation) as the Secretary of Labor determines to be
      appropriate; and
        (II) the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland
      Security, as appropriate, shall not approve petitions or
      applications filed with respect to that employer under section
      1154, 1184(c), 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1), or 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of
      this title during a period of at least 1 year for aliens to be
      employed by the employer.

      (ii) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and
    opportunity for a hearing, a willful failure to meet a condition of
    paragraph (1), a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an
    attestation, or a violation of clause (iv) - 
        (I) the Secretary of Labor shall notify the Secretary of State
      and the Secretary of Homeland Security of such finding and may,
      in addition, impose such other administrative remedies (including
      civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per
      violation) as the Secretary of Labor determines to be
      appropriate; and
        (II) the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland
      Security, as appropriate, shall not approve petitions or
      applications filed with respect to that employer under section
      1154, 1184(c), 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1), or 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of
      this title during a period of at least 2 years for aliens to be
      employed by the employer.

      (iii) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and
    opportunity for a hearing, a willful failure to meet a condition of
    paragraph (1) or a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an
    attestation, in the course of which failure or misrepresentation
    the employer displaced a United States worker employed by the
    employer within the period beginning 90 days before and ending 90
    days after the date of filing of any visa petition or application
    supported by the attestation - 
        (I) the Secretary of Labor shall notify the Secretary of State
      and the Secretary of Homeland Security of such finding and may,
      in addition, impose such other administrative remedies (including
      civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed $35,000 per
      violation) as the Secretary of Labor determines to be
      appropriate; and
        (II) the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland
      Security, as appropriate, shall not approve petitions or
      applications filed with respect to that employer under section
      1154, 1184(c), 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1), or 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of
      this title during a period of at least 3 years for aliens to be
      employed by the employer.

      (iv) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has
    filed an attestation under this subsection to intimidate, threaten,
    restrain, coerce, blacklist, discharge, or in any other manner
    discriminate against an employee (which term, for purposes of this
    clause, includes a former employee and an applicant for employment)
    because the employee has disclosed information to the employer, or
    to any other person, that the employee reasonably believes
    evidences a violation of this subsection, or any rule or regulation
    pertaining to this subsection, or because the employee cooperates
    or seeks to cooperate in an investigation or other proceeding
    concerning the employer's compliance with the requirements of this
    subsection or any rule or regulation pertaining to this subsection.
      (v) The Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Homeland Security
    shall devise a process under which a nonimmigrant under section
    1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title or section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii)
    of this title who files a complaint regarding a violation of clause
    (iv) and is otherwise eligible to remain and work in the United
    States may be allowed to seek other appropriate employment in the
    United States for a period not to exceed the maximum period of stay
    authorized for such nonimmigrant classification.
      (vi)(I) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has
    filed an attestation under this subsection to require a
    nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title or
    section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title to pay a penalty for
    ceasing employment with the employer prior to a date agreed to by
    the nonimmigrant and the employer. The Secretary of Labor shall
    determine whether a required payment is a penalty (and not
    liquidated damages) pursuant to relevant State law.
      (II) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and
    opportunity for a hearing, that an employer has committed a
    violation of this clause, the Secretary of Labor may impose a civil
    monetary penalty of $1,000 for each such violation and issue an
    administrative order requiring the return to the nonimmigrant of
    any amount paid in violation of this clause, or, if the
    nonimmigrant cannot be located, requiring payment of any such
    amount to the general fund of the Treasury.
      (vii)(I) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A)
    for an employer who has filed an attestation under this subsection
    and who places a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1)
    of this title or section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title
    designated as a full-time employee in the attestation, after the
    nonimmigrant has entered into employment with the employer, in
    nonproductive status due to a decision by the employer (based on
    factors such as lack of work), or due to the nonimmigrant's lack of
    a permit or license, to fail to pay the nonimmigrant full-time
    wages in accordance with paragraph (1)(A) for all such
    nonproductive time.
      (II) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for
    an employer who has filed an attestation under this subsection and
    who places a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of
    this title or section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title designated
    as a part-time employee in the attestation, after the nonimmigrant
    has entered into employment with the employer, in nonproductive
    status under circumstances described in subclause (I), to fail to
    pay such a nonimmigrant for such hours as are designated on the
    attestation consistent with the rate of pay identified on the
    attestation.
      (III) In the case of a nonimmigrant under section
    1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title or section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii)
    of this title who has not yet entered into employment with an
    employer who has had approved an attestation under this subsection
    with respect to the nonimmigrant, the provisions of subclauses (I)
    and (II) shall apply to the employer beginning 30 days after the
    date the nonimmigrant first is admitted into the United States, or
    60 days after the date the nonimmigrant becomes eligible to work
    for the employer in the case of a nonimmigrant who is present in
    the United States on the date of the approval of the attestation
    filed with the Secretary of Labor.
      (IV) This clause does not apply to a failure to pay wages to a
    nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title or
    section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title for nonproductive time
    due to non-work-related factors, such as the voluntary request of
    the nonimmigrant for an absence or circumstances rendering the
    nonimmigrant unable to work.
      (V) This clause shall not be construed as prohibiting an employer
    that is a school or other educational institution from applying to
    a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title or
    section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title an established salary
    practice of the employer, under which the employer pays to
    nonimmigrants under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title or
    section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title and United States workers
    in the same occupational classification an annual salary in
    disbursements over fewer than 12 months, if - 
        (aa) the nonimmigrant agrees to the compressed annual salary
      payments prior to the commencement of the employment; and
        (bb) the application of the salary practice to the nonimmigrant
      does not otherwise cause the nonimmigrant to violate any
      condition of the nonimmigrant's authorization under this chapter
      to remain in the United States.

      (VI) This clause shall not be construed as superseding clause
    (viii).
      (viii) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A)
    for an employer who has filed an attestation under this subsection
    to fail to offer to a nonimmigrant under section
    1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title or section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii)
    of this title, during the nonimmigrant's period of authorized
    employment, benefits and eligibility for benefits (including the
    opportunity to participate in health, life, disability, and other
    insurance plans; the opportunity to participate in retirement and
    savings plans; and cash bonuses and non-cash compensation, such as
    stock options (whether or not based on performance)) on the same
    basis, and in accordance with the same criteria, as the employer
    offers to United States workers.
      (D) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
    for a hearing, that an employer has not paid wages at the wage
    level specified in the attestation and required under paragraph
    (1), the Secretary of Labor shall order the employer to provide for
    payment of such amounts of back pay as may be required to comply
    with the requirements of paragraph (1), whether or not a penalty
    under subparagraph (C) has been imposed.
      (E) The Secretary of Labor may, on a case-by-case basis, subject
    an employer to random investigations for a period of up to 5 years,
    beginning on the date on which the employer is found by the
    Secretary of Labor to have committed a willful failure to meet a
    condition of paragraph (1) or to have made a willful
    misrepresentation of material fact in an attestation. The authority
    of the Secretary of Labor under this subparagraph shall not be
    construed to be subject to, or limited by, the requirements of
    subparagraph (A).
      (F) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as superseding
    or preempting any other enforcement-related authority under this
    chapter (such as the authorities under section 1324b of this
    title), or any other Act.
      (4) For purposes of this subsection:
        (A) The term "area of employment" means the area within normal
      commuting distance of the worksite or physical location where the
      work of the nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of
      this title or section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title is or
      will be performed. If such worksite or location is within a
      Metropolitan Statistical Area, any place within such area is
      deemed to be within the area of employment.
        (B) In the case of an attestation with respect to one or more
      nonimmigrants under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title
      or section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title by an employer, the
      employer is considered to "displace" a United States worker from
      a job if the employer lays off the worker from a job that is
      essentially the equivalent of the job for which the nonimmigrant
      or nonimmigrants is or are sought. A job shall not be considered
      to be essentially equivalent of another job unless it involves
      essentially the same responsibilities, was held by a United
      States worker with substantially equivalent qualifications and
      experience, and is located in the same area of employment as the
      other job.
        (C)(i) The term "lays off", with respect to a worker - 
          (I) means to cause the worker's loss of employment, other
        than through a discharge for inadequate performance, violation
        of workplace rules, cause, voluntary departure, voluntary
        retirement, or the expiration of a grant or contract; but
          (II) does not include any situation in which the worker is
        offered, as an alternative to such loss of employment, a
        similar employment opportunity with the same employer at
        equivalent or higher compensation and benefits than the
        position from which the employee was discharged, regardless of
        whether or not the employee accepts the offer.

        (ii) Nothing in this subparagraph is intended to limit an
      employee's rights under a collective bargaining agreement or
      other employment contract.
        (D) The term "United States worker" means an employee who - 
          (i) is a citizen or national of the United States; or
          (ii) is an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent
        residence, is admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of this
        title, is granted asylum under section 1158 of this title, or
        is an immigrant otherwise authorized, by this chapter or by the
        Secretary of Homeland Security, to be employed.
    (t) (!12) Foreign residence requirement

      (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no person admitted under
    section 1101(a)(15)(Q)(ii)(I) of this title, or acquiring such
    status after admission, shall be eligible to apply for nonimmigrant
    status, an immigrant visa, or permanent residence under this
    chapter until it is established that such person has resided and
    been physically present in the person's country of nationality or
    last residence for an aggregate of at least 2 years following
    departure from the United States.
      (2) The Secretary of Homeland Security may waive the requirement
    of such 2-year foreign residence abroad if the Secretary determines
    that - 
        (A) departure from the United States would impose exceptional
      hardship upon the alien's spouse or child (if such spouse or
      child is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully
      admitted for permanent residence); or
        (B) the admission of the alien is in the public interest or the
      national interest of the United States.

         PROC. NO. 4865. HIGH SEAS INTERDICTION OF ILLEGAL ALIENS     
      Proc. No. 4865, Sept. 29, 1981, 46 F.R. 48107, provided:
      The ongoing migration of persons to the United States in
    violation of our laws is a serious national problem detrimental to
    the interests of the United States. A particularly difficult aspect
    of the problem is the continuing illegal migration by sea of large
    numbers of undocumented aliens into the southeastern United States.
    These arrivals have severely strained the law enforcement resources
    of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and have threatened
    the welfare and safety of communities in that region.
      As a result of our discussions with the Governments of affected
    foreign countries and with agencies of the Executive Branch of our
    Government, I have determined that new and effective measures to
    curtail these unlawful arrivals are necessary. In this regard, I
    have determined that international cooperation to intercept vessels
    trafficking in illegal migrants is a necessary and proper means of
    insuring the effective enforcement of our laws.
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States
    of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
    the statutes of the United States, including Sections 212(f) and
    215(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8
    U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a)(1)), in order to protect the sovereignty
    of the United States, and in accordance with cooperative
    arrangements with certain foreign governments, and having found
    that the entry of undocumented aliens, arriving at the borders of
    the United States from the high seas, is detrimental to the
    interests of the United States, do proclaim that:
      The entry of undocumented aliens from the high seas is hereby
    suspended and shall be prevented by the interdiction of certain
    vessels carrying such aliens.
      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth
    day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and
    eighty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America
    the two hundred and sixth.

    PROC. NO. 7750. TO SUSPEND ENTRY AS IMMIGRANTS OR NONIMMIGRANTS OF
             PERSONS ENGAGED IN OR BENEFITING FROM CORRUPTION
      Proc. No. 7750, Jan. 12, 2004, 69 F.R. 2287, provided:
      In light of the importance of legitimate and transparent public
    institutions to world stability, peace, and development, and the
    serious negative effects that corruption of public institutions has
    on the United States efforts to promote security and to strengthen
    democratic institutions and free market systems, and in light of
    the importance to the United States and the international community
    of fighting corruption, as evidenced by the Third Global Forum on
    Fighting Corruption and Safeguarding Integrity and other
    intergovernmental efforts, I have determined that it is in the
    interests of the United States to take action to restrict the
    international travel and to suspend the entry into the United
    States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of certain persons who have
    committed, participated in, or are beneficiaries of corruption in
    the performance of public functions where that corruption has
    serious adverse effects on international activity of U.S.
    businesses, U.S. foreign assistance goals, the security of the
    United States against transnational crime and terrorism, or the
    stability of democratic institutions and nations.
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States
    of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
    the laws of the United States, including section 212(f) of the
    Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), and
    section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that the
    unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United
    States of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation
    would, except as provided in sections 2 and 3 of this proclamation,
    be detrimental to the interests of the United States.

      Sec. 3. Persons covered by sections 1 and 2 of this proclamation

    employees, or any other person.
      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day
    of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the
    Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
    twenty-eighth.

    PROC. NO. 8342. TO SUSPEND ENTRY AS IMMIGRANTS AND NONIMMIGRANTS OF
      FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR FAILING TO COMBAT
                          TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS
      Proc. No. 8342, Jan. 16, 2009, 74 F.R. 4093, provided:
      In order to foster greater resolve to address trafficking in
    persons (TIP), specifically in punishing acts of trafficking and
    providing protections to the victims of these crimes, consistent
    with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, as amended
    (the "Act") (22 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.), it is in the interests of the
    United States to restrict the international travel and to suspend
    entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of
    certain senior government officials responsible for domestic law
    enforcement, justice, or labor affairs who have impeded their
    governments' antitrafficking efforts, have failed to implement
    their governments' antitrafficking laws and policies, or who
    otherwise bear responsibility for their governments' failures to
    take steps recognized internationally as appropriate to combat
    trafficking in persons, and whose governments have been ranked more
    than once as Tier 3 countries, which represent the worst anti-TIP
    performers, in the Department of State's annual Trafficking in
    Persons Report, and for which I have made a determination pursuant
    to section 110(d)(1)-(2) or (4) of the Act. The Act reflects
    international antitrafficking standards that guide efforts to
    eradicate this modern-day form of slavery around the world.
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States
    of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
    Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section
    212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C.
    1182(f), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby
    find that the unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into
    the United States of persons described in section 1 of this
    proclamation would, except as provided for in sections 2 and 3 of
    this proclamation, be detrimental to the interests of the United
    States.
      I therefore hereby proclaim that:
      Section 1. The entry into the United States, as immigrants or
    nonimmigrants, of the following aliens is hereby suspended:
      (a) Senior government officials - defined as the heads of
    ministries or agencies and officials occupying positions within the
    two bureaucratic levels below those top positions - responsible for
    domestic law enforcement, justice, or labor affairs who have
    impeded their governments' antitrafficking efforts, have failed to
    implement their governments' antitrafficking laws and policies, or
    who otherwise bear responsibility for their governments' failures
    to take steps recognized internationally as appropriate to combat
    trafficking in persons, and who are members of governments for
    which I have made a determination pursuant to section 110(d)(1)-(2)
    or (4) of the Act, in the current year and at least once in the
    preceding 3 years;
      (b) The spouses of persons described in subsection (a) of this
    section.
      Sec. 2. Section 1 of this proclamation shall not apply with
    respect to any person otherwise covered by section 1 where entry of
    such person would not be contrary to the interest of the United
    States.
      Sec. 3. Persons covered by sections 1 or 2 of this proclamation
    shall be identified by the Secretary of State or the Secretary's
    designee, in his or her sole discretion, pursuant to such
    procedures as the Secretary may establish under section 5 of this
    proclamation.
      Sec. 4. Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to
    derogate from United States Government obligations under applicable
    international agreements.
      Sec. 5. The Secretary of State shall implement this proclamation
    pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary, in consultation with
    the Secretary of Homeland Security, may establish.
      Sec. 6. This proclamation is effective immediately. It shall
    remain in effect until such time as the Secretary of State
    determines that it is no longer necessary and should be terminated,
    either in whole or in part. Any such determination by the Secretary
    of State shall be published in the Federal Register.
      Sec. 7. This proclamation is not intended to, and does not,
    create any right, benefit, or privilege, substantive or procedural,
    enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United
    States, its departments, agencies, instrumentalities, or entities,
    its officers or employees, or any other person.
      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth
    day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of
    the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
    and thirty-third.
                                                         George W. Bush.

      PROC. NO. 8693. SUSPENSION OF ENTRY OF ALIENS SUBJECT TO UNITED
     NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL TRAVEL BANS AND INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY
                       ECONOMIC POWERS ACT SANCTIONS
      Proc. No. 8693, July 24, 2011, 76 F.R. 44751, provided:
      In light of the firm commitment of the United States to the
    preservation of international peace and security and our
    obligations under the United Nations Charter to carry out the
    decisions of the United Nations Security Council imposed under
    Chapter VII, I have determined that it is in the interests of the
    United States to suspend the entry into the United States, as
    immigrants or nonimmigrants, of aliens who are subject to United
    Nations Security Council travel bans as of the date of this
    proclamation. I have further determined that the interests of the
    United States are served by suspending the entry into the United
    States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of aliens whose property
    and interests in property have been blocked by an Executive Order
    issued in whole or in part pursuant to the President's authority
    under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.
    1701 et seq.).
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, by the authority vested in me as
    President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of
    America, including section 212(f) of the Immigration and
    Nationality Act of 1952, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section
    301 of title 3, United States Code[,] hereby find that the
    unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United
    States of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation would
    be detrimental to the interests of the United States. I therefore
    hereby proclaim that:
      Section 1. The entry into the United States, as immigrants or
    nonimmigrants, of the following persons is hereby suspended:
      (a) Any alien who meets one or more of the specific criteria for
    the imposition of a travel ban provided for in a United Nations
    Security Council resolution referenced in Annex A to this
    proclamation.
      (b) Any alien who meets one or more of the specific criteria
    contained in an Executive Order referenced in Annex B to this
    proclamation.
      Sec. 2. Persons covered by section 1 of this proclamation shall
    be identified by the Secretary of State or the Secretary's
    designee, in his or her sole discretion, pursuant to such standards
    and procedures as the Secretary may establish.
      Sec. 3. The Secretary of State shall have responsibility for
    implementing this proclamation pursuant to such procedures as the
    Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and
    Secretary of Homeland Security, may establish.
      Sec. 4. Section 1 of this proclamation shall not apply with
    respect to any person otherwise covered by section 1 where entry of
    the person into the United States would not be contrary to the
    interests of the United States, as determined by the Secretary of
    State. In exercising the functions and authorities in the previous
    sentence, the Secretary of State shall consult the Secretary of
    Homeland Security on matters related to admissibility or
    inadmissibility within the authority of the Secretary of Homeland
    Security.
      Sec. 5. Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to
    require actions that would be inconsistent with the United States
    [sic] obligations under applicable international agreements.
      Sec. 6. This proclamation is not intended to, and does not,
    create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable
    at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its
    departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or
    agents, or any other person.
      Sec. 7. This proclamation is effective immediately and shall
    remain in effect until such time as the Secretary of State
    determines that it is no longer necessary and should be terminated,
    either in whole or in part. Any such termination shall become
    effective upon publication in the Federal Register.
      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
    fourth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven,
    and of the Independence of the United States of America the two
    hundred and thirty-sixth.
                                                           Barack Obama.

    PROC. NO. 8697. SUSPENSION OF ENTRY AS IMMIGRANTS AND NONIMMIGRANTS
    OF PERSONS WHO PARTICIPATE IN SERIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMANITARIAN
                      LAW VIOLATIONS AND OTHER ABUSES
      Proc. No. 8697, Aug. 4, 2011, 76 F.R. 49277, provided:
      The United States [sic] enduring commitment to respect for human
    rights and humanitarian law requires that its Government be able to
    ensure that the United States does not become a safe haven for
    serious violators of human rights and humanitarian law and those
    who engage in other related abuses. Universal respect for human
    rights and humanitarian law and the prevention of atrocities
    internationally promotes U.S. values and fundamental U.S. interests
    in helping secure peace, deter aggression, promote the rule of law,
    combat crime and corruption, strengthen democracies, and prevent
    humanitarian crises around the globe. I therefore have determined
    that it is in the interests of the United States to take action to
    restrict the international travel and to suspend the entry into the
    United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of certain persons
    who have engaged in the acts outlined in section 1 of this
    proclamation.
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, by the authority vested in me as
    President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of
    America, including section 212(f) of the Immigration and
    Nationality Act of 1952, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section
    301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that the
    unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United
    States of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation would
    be detrimental to the interests of the United States. I therefore
    hereby proclaim that:
      Section 1. The entry into the United States, as immigrants or
    nonimmigrants, of the following persons is hereby suspended:
      (a) Any alien who planned, ordered, assisted, aided and abetted,
    committed or otherwise participated in, including through command
    responsibility, widespread or systematic violence against any
    civilian population based in whole or in part on race; color;
    descent; sex; disability; membership in an indigenous group;
    language; religion; political opinion; national origin; ethnicity;
    membership in a particular social group; birth; or sexual
    orientation or gender identity, or who attempted or conspired to do
    so.
      (b) Any alien who planned, ordered, assisted, aided and abetted,
    committed or otherwise participated in, including through command
    responsibility, war crimes, crimes against humanity or other
    serious violations of human rights, or who attempted or conspired
    to do so.
      Sec. 2. Section 1 of this proclamation shall not apply with
    respect to any person otherwise covered by section 1 where the
    entry of such person would not harm the foreign relations interests
    of the United States.
      Sec. 3. The Secretary of State, or the Secretary's designee, in
    his or her sole discretion, shall identify persons covered by
    section 1 of this proclamation, pursuant to such standards and
    procedures as the Secretary may establish.
      Sec. 4. The Secretary of State shall have responsibility for
    implementing this proclamation pursuant to such procedures as the
    Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security,
    may establish.
      Sec. 5. For any person whose entry is otherwise suspended under
    this proclamation entry will be denied, unless the Secretary of
    State determines that the particular entry of such person would be
    in the interests of the United States. In exercising such
    authority, the Secretary of State shall consult the Secretary of
    Homeland Security on matters related to admissibility or
    inadmissibility within the authority of the Secretary of Homeland
    Security.
      Sec. 6. Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to
    derogate from United States Government obligations under applicable
    international agreements, or to suspend entry based solely on an
    alien's ideology, opinions, or beliefs, or based solely on
    expression that would be considered protected under U.S.
    interpretations of international agreements to which the United
    States is a party. Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed
    to limit the authority of the United States to admit or to suspend
    entry of particular individuals into the United States under the
    Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) or under
    any other provision of U.S. law.
      Sec. 7. This proclamation is not intended to, and does not,
    create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable
    at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its
    departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or
    agents, or any other person.
      Sec. 8. This proclamation is effective immediately and shall
    remain in effect until such time as the Secretary of State
    determines that it is no longer necessary and should be terminated,
    either in whole or in part. Any such termination shall become
    effective upon publication in the Federal Register.
      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day
    of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the
    Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
    thirty-sixth.

    and the laws of the United States of America, including sections
    212(f) and 215(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as
    amended (8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a)(1)), and whereas:
      (1) The President has authority to suspend the entry of aliens
    coming by sea to the United States without necessary documentation,

    order as follows:
      Section 1. The Secretary of State shall undertake to enter into,
    on behalf of the United States, cooperative arrangements with

    Guard is operating, in consultation, where appropriate, with the
    Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of
    State, shall issue appropriate instructions to the Coast Guard in
    order to enforce the suspension of the entry of undocumented aliens
    by sea and the interdiction of any defined vessel carrying such
    aliens.
      (b) Those instructions shall apply to any of the following
    defined vessels:
      (1) Vessels of the United States, meaning any vessel documented
    or numbered pursuant to the laws of the United States, or owned in
    whole or in part by the United States, a citizen of the United
    States, or a corporation incorporated under the laws of the United
    States or any State, Territory, District, Commonwealth, or
    possession thereof, unless the vessel has been granted nationality
    by a foreign nation in accord with Article 5 of the Convention on
    the High Seas of 1958 (U.S. T.I.A.S. 5200; 13 U.S.T. 2312).
      (2) Vessels without nationality or vessels assimilated to vessels

      (3) Vessels of foreign nations with whom we have arrangements
    authorizing the United States to stop and board such vessels.
      (c) Those instructions to the Coast Guard shall include
    appropriate directives providing for the Coast Guard:
      (1) To stop and board defined vessels, when there is reason to
    believe that such vessels are engaged in the irregular
    transportation of persons or violations of United States law or the
    law of a country with which the United States has an arrangement
    authorizing such action.
      (2) To make inquiries of those on board, examine documents and
    take such actions as are necessary to carry out this order.
      (3) To return the vessel and its passengers to the country from

    with which we have an arrangement to assist; provided, however,
    that the Secretary of Homeland Security, in his unreviewable
    discretion, may decide that a person who is a refugee will not be

    operate a facility, or facilities, to house and provide for the
    needs of any such aliens. Such a facility may be located at
    Guantanamo Bay Naval Base or any other appropriate location.
      (ii) The Secretary of Homeland Security may conduct any screening
    of such aliens that he deems appropriate, including screening to
    determine whether such aliens should be returned to their country
    of origin or transit, or whether they are persons in need of
    protection who should not be returned without their consent. If the
    Secretary of Homeland Security institutes such screening, then
    until a determination is made, the Secretary of Homeland Security
    shall provide for the custody, care, safety, transportation, and
    other needs of the aliens. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall
    continue to provide for the custody, care, safety, transportation,
    and other needs of aliens who are determined not to be persons in
    need of protection until such time as they are returned to their
    country of origin or transit.
      (b) The Secretary of State shall provide for the custody, care,
    safety, transportation, and other needs of undocumented aliens
    interdicted or intercepted in the Caribbean region whom the
    Secretary of Homeland Security has identified as persons in need of
    protection. The Secretary of State shall provide for and execute a
    process for resettling such persons in need of protection, as
    appropriate, in countries other than their country of origin, and
    shall also undertake such diplomatic efforts as may be necessary to
    address the problem of illegal migration of aliens in the Caribbean
    region and to facilitate the return of those aliens who are
    determined not to be persons in need of protection.
      (c)(i) The Secretary of Defense shall make available to the
    Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State, for the
    housing and care of any undocumented aliens interdicted or
    intercepted in the Caribbean region and taken into their custody,
    any facilities at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base that are excess to
    current military needs and the provision of which does not
    interfere with the operation and security of the base. The
    Secretary of Defense shall be responsible for providing access to
    such facilities and perimeter security. The Secretary of Homeland
    Security and the Secretary of State, respectively, shall be
    responsible for reimbursement for necessary supporting utilities.
      (ii) In the event of a mass migration in the Caribbean region,
    the Secretary of Defense shall provide support to the Secretary of
    Homeland Security and the Secretary of State in carrying out the
    duties described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section
    regarding the custody, care, safety, transportation, and other
    needs of the aliens, and shall assume primary responsibility for
    these duties on a nonreimbursable basis as necessary to contain the
    threat to national security posed by the migration. The Secretary
    of Defense shall also provide support to the Coast Guard in
    carrying out the duties described in Executive Order 12807 of May
    24, 1992 [set out above], regarding interdiction of migrants.
      Sec. 2. Definitions. For purposes of this order, the term "mass
    migration" means a migration of undocumented aliens that is of such
    magnitude and duration that it poses a threat to the national
    security of the United States, as determined by the President.
      Sec. 3. Scope.
      (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or
    otherwise affect the authorities and responsibilities set forth in
    Executive Order 12807 of May 24, 1992 [set out above].
      (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to make reviewable
    in any judicial or administrative proceeding, or otherwise, any
    action, omission, or matter that otherwise would not be reviewable.
      (c) This order is intended only to improve the management of the
    executive branch. This order is not intended to, and does not,
    create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable
    at law or equity or otherwise against the United States, its
    departments, agencies, entities, instrumentalities, officers,
    employees, or any other person.
      (d) Any agency assigned any duties by this order may use the
    provisions of the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. 1535 and 1536, to carry
    out such duties, to the extent permitted by such Act.
      (e) This order shall not be construed to require any procedure to
    determine whether a person is a refugee or otherwise in need of
    protection.

    delegate to the Attorney General the authority to:
        (a) Maintain custody, at any location she deems appropriate,

      unreviewable discretion, of any undocumented person she has
      reason to believe is seeking to enter the United States and who
      is encountered in a vessel interdicted on the high seas through
      December 31, 2000; and
        (b) Undertake any other appropriate actions with respect to
      such aliens permitted by law.
      With respect to the functions delegated by this order, all
    actions taken after April 16, 1999, for or on behalf of the
    President that would have been valid if taken pursuant to this
    memorandum are ratified.

    construed to create, any right or benefit, substantive or
    procedural, legally enforceable by any party against the United

    any other person, or to require any procedures to determine whether
    a person is a refugee.
      You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the
    Federal Register.
                                                     William J. Clinton.

      or by any consular officer to establish that an alien is not
      excludable as a public charge under section 1182(a)(4) of this
      title unless such affidavit is executed by a sponsor of the alien
      as a contract -

        maintain the sponsored alien at an annual income that is not
        less than 125 percent of the Federal poverty line during the
        period in which the affidavit is enforceable;
          (B) that is legally enforceable against the sponsor by the

      (2) Period of enforceability
        An affidavit of support shall be enforceable with respect to

        401 et seq.] or can be credited with such qualifying quarters
        as provided under subparagraph (B), and (ii) in the case of any

          under title II of the Social Security Act worked by a parent
          of such alien while the alien was under age 18, and
            (ii) all of the qualifying quarters worked by a spouse of
          such alien during their marriage and the alien remains
          married to such spouse or such spouse is deceased.

        No such qualifying quarter of coverage that is creditable under
        title II of the Social Security Act for any period beginning
        after December 31, 1996, may be credited to an alien under
        clause (i) or (ii) if the parent or spouse (as the case may be)
        of such alien received any Federal means-tested public benefit
        (as provided under section 1613 of this title) during the

    final evaluation of the program not later than 1 year after
    termination.

    terminate after 3 years of operation.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1184. Admission of nonimmigrants

-STATUTE-
    (a) Regulations
      (1) The admission to the United States of any alien as a
    nonimmigrant shall be for such time and under such conditions as
    the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe, including when
    he deems necessary the giving of a bond with sufficient surety in
    such sum and containing such conditions as the Attorney General
    shall prescribe, to insure that at the expiration of such time or
    upon failure to maintain the status under which he was admitted, or
    to maintain any status subsequently acquired under section 1258 of
    this title, such alien will depart from the United States. No alien
    admitted to Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
    Islands without a visa pursuant to section 1182(l) of this title
    may be authorized to enter or stay in the United States other than
    in Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or to
    remain in Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands
    for a period exceeding 45 days from date of admission to Guam or
    the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. No alien admitted
    to the United States without a visa pursuant to section 1187 of
    this title may be authorized to remain in the United States as a
    nonimmigrant visitor for a period exceeding 90 days from the date
    of admission.
      (2)(A) The period of authorized status as a nonimmigrant
    described in section 1101(a)(15)(O) of this title shall be for such
    period as the Attorney General may specify in order to provide for
    the event (or events) for which the nonimmigrant is admitted.
      (B) The period of authorized status as a nonimmigrant described
    in section 1101(a)(15)(P) of this title shall be for such period as
    the Attorney General may specify in order to provide for the
    competition, event, or performance for which the nonimmigrant is
    admitted. In the case of nonimmigrants admitted as individual
    athletes under section 1101(a)(15)(P) of this title, the period of
    authorized status may be for an initial period (not to exceed 5
    years) during which the nonimmigrant will perform as an athlete and
    such period may be extended by the Attorney General for an
    additional period of up to 5 years.
    (b) Presumption of status; written waiver
      Every alien (other than a nonimmigrant described in subparagraph
    (L) or (V) of section 1101(a)(15) of this title, and other than a
    nonimmigrant described in any provision of section
    1101(a)(15)(H)(i) of this title except subclause (b1) of such
    section) shall be presumed to be an immigrant until he establishes
    to the satisfaction of the consular officer, at the time of
    application for a visa, and the immigration officers, at the time
    of application for admission, that he is entitled to a nonimmigrant
    status under section 1101(a)(15) of this title. An alien who is an
    officer or employee of any foreign government or of any
    international organization entitled to enjoy privileges,
    exemptions, and immunities under the International Organizations
    Immunities Act [22 U.S.C. 288 et seq.], or an alien who is the
    attendant, servant, employee, or member of the immediate family of
    any such alien shall not be entitled to apply for or receive an
    immigrant visa, or to enter the United States as an immigrant
    unless he executes a written waiver in the same form and substance
    as is prescribed by section 1257(b) of this title.
    (c) Petition of importing employer
      (1) The question of importing any alien as a nonimmigrant under
    subparagraph (H), (L), (O), or (P)(i) of section 1101(a)(15) of
    this title (excluding nonimmigrants under section
    1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title) in any specific case or
    specific cases shall be determined by the Attorney General, after
    consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government, upon
    petition of the importing employer. Such petition, shall be made
    and approved before the visa is granted. The petition shall be in
    such form and contain such information as the Attorney General
    shall prescribe. The approval of such a petition shall not, of
    itself, be construed as establishing that the alien is a
    nonimmigrant. For purposes of this subsection with respect to
    nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of this
    title, the term "appropriate agencies of Government" means the
    Department of Labor and includes the Department of Agriculture. The
    provisions of section 1188 of this title shall apply to the
    question of importing any alien as a nonimmigrant under section
    1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of this title.
      (2)(A) The Attorney General shall provide for a procedure under
    which an importing employer which meets requirements established by
    the Attorney General may file a blanket petition to import aliens
    as nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title
    instead of filing individual petitions under paragraph (1) to
    import such aliens. Such procedure shall permit the expedited
    processing of visas for admission of aliens covered under such a
    petition.
      (B) For purposes of section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title, an
    alien is considered to be serving in a capacity involving
    specialized knowledge with respect to a company if the alien has a
    special knowledge of the company product and its application in
    international markets or has an advanced level of knowledge of
    processes and procedures of the company.
      (C) The Attorney General shall provide a process for reviewing
    and acting upon petitions under this subsection with respect to
    nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title
    within 30 days after the date a completed petition has been filed.
      (D) The period of authorized admission for - 
        (i) a nonimmigrant admitted to render services in a managerial
      or executive capacity under section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title
      shall not exceed 7 years, or
        (ii) a nonimmigrant admitted to render services in a capacity
      that involves specialized knowledge under section 1101(a)(15)(L)
      of this title shall not exceed 5 years.

      (E) In the case of an alien spouse admitted under section
    1101(a)(15)(L) of this title, who is accompanying or following to
    join a principal alien admitted under such section, the Attorney
    General shall authorize the alien spouse to engage in employment in
    the United States and provide the spouse with an "employment
    authorized" endorsement or other appropriate work permit.
      (F) An alien who will serve in a capacity involving specialized
    knowledge with respect to an employer for purposes of section
    1101(a)(15)(L) of this title and will be stationed primarily at the
    worksite of an employer other than the petitioning employer or its
    affiliate, subsidiary, or parent shall not be eligible for
    classification under section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title if - 
        (i) the alien will be controlled and supervised principally by
      such unaffiliated employer; or
        (ii) the placement of the alien at the worksite of the
      unaffiliated employer is essentially an arrangement to provide
      labor for hire for the unaffiliated employer, rather than a
      placement in connection with the provision of a product or
      service for which specialized knowledge specific to the
      petitioning employer is necessary.

      (3) The Attorney General shall approve a petition - 
        (A) with respect to a nonimmigrant described in section
      1101(a)(15)(O)(i) of this title only after consultation in
      accordance with paragraph (6) or, with respect to aliens seeking
      entry for a motion picture or television production, after
      consultation with the appropriate union representing the alien's
      occupational peers and a management organization in the area of
      the alien's ability, or
        (B) with respect to a nonimmigrant described in section
      1101(a)(15)(O)(ii) of this title after consultation in accordance
      with paragraph (6) or, in the case of such an alien seeking entry
      for a motion picture or television production, after consultation
      with such a labor organization and a management organization in
      the area of the alien's ability.

    In the case of an alien seeking entry for a motion picture or
    television production, (i) any opinion under the previous sentence
    shall only be advisory, (ii) any such opinion that recommends
    denial must be in writing, (iii) in making the decision the
    Attorney General shall consider the exigencies and scheduling of
    the production, and (iv) the Attorney General shall append to the
    decision any such opinion. The Attorney General shall provide by
    regulation for the waiver of the consultation requirement under
    subparagraph (A) in the case of aliens who have been admitted as
    nonimmigrants under section 1101(a)(15)(O)(i) of this title because
    of extraordinary ability in the arts and who seek readmission to
    perform similar services within 2 years after the date of a
    consultation under such subparagraph. Not later than 5 days after
    the date such a waiver is provided, the Attorney General shall
    forward a copy of the petition and all supporting documentation to
    the national office of an appropriate labor organization.
      (4)(A) For purposes of section 1101(a)(15)(P)(i)(a) of this
    title, an alien is described in this subparagraph if the alien - 
        (i)(I) performs as an athlete, individually or as part of a
      group or team, at an internationally recognized level of
      performance;
        (II) is a professional athlete, as defined in section
      1154(i)(2) of this title;
        (III) performs as an athlete, or as a coach, as part of a team
      or franchise that is located in the United States and a member of
      a foreign league or association of 15 or more amateur sports
      teams, if - 
          (aa) the foreign league or association is the highest level
        of amateur performance of that sport in the relevant foreign
        country;
          (bb) participation in such league or association renders
        players ineligible, whether on a temporary or permanent basis,
        to earn a scholarship in, or participate in, that sport at a
        college or university in the United States under the rules of
        the National Collegiate Athletic Association; and
          (cc) a significant number of the individuals who play in such
        league or association are drafted by a major sports league or a
        minor league affiliate of such a sports league; or

        (IV) is a professional athlete or amateur athlete who performs
      individually or as part of a group in a theatrical ice skating
      production; and
        (ii) seeks to enter the United States temporarily and solely
      for the purpose of performing - 
          (I) as such an athlete with respect to a specific athletic
        competition; or
          (II) in the case of an individual described in clause
        (i)(IV), in a specific theatrical ice skating production or
        tour.

      (B)(i) For purposes of section 1101(a)(15)(P)(i)(b) of this
    title, an alien is described in this subparagraph if the alien - 
        (I) performs with or is an integral and essential part of the
      performance of an entertainment group that has (except as
      provided in clause (ii)) been recognized internationally as being
      outstanding in the discipline for a sustained and substantial
      period of time,
        (II) in the case of a performer or entertainer, except as
      provided in clause (iii), has had a sustained and substantial
      relationship with that group (ordinarily for at least one year)
      and provides functions integral to the performance of the group,
      and
        (III) seeks to enter the United States temporarily and solely
      for the purpose of performing as such a performer or entertainer
      or as an integral and essential part of a performance.

      (ii) In the case of an entertainment group that is recognized
    nationally as being outstanding in its discipline for a sustained
    and substantial period of time, the Attorney General may, in
    consideration of special circumstances, waive the international
    recognition requirement of clause (i)(I).
      (iii)(I) The one-year relationship requirement of clause (i)(II)
    shall not apply to 25 percent of the performers and entertainers in
    a group.
      (II) The Attorney General may waive such one-year relationship
    requirement for an alien who because of illness or unanticipated
    and exigent circumstances replaces an essential member of the group
    and for an alien who augments the group by performing a critical
    role.
      (iv) The requirements of subclauses (I) and (II) of clause (i)
    shall not apply to alien circus personnel who perform as part of a
    circus or circus group or who constitute an integral and essential
    part of the performance of such circus or circus group, but only if
    such personnel are entering the United States to join a circus that
    has been recognized nationally as outstanding for a sustained and
    substantial period of time or as part of such a circus.
      (C) A person may petition the Attorney General for classification
    of an alien as a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(P) of this
    title.
      (D) The Attorney General shall approve petitions under this
    subsection with respect to nonimmigrants described in clause (i) or

    consultation in accordance with paragraph (6).
      (E) The Attorney General shall approve petitions under this
    subsection for nonimmigrants described in section
    1101(a)(15)(P)(ii) of this title only after consultation with labor
    organizations representing artists and entertainers in the United
    States.
      (F)(i) No nonimmigrant visa under section 1101(a)(15)(P)(i)(a) of
    this title shall be issued to any alien who is a national of a
    country that is a state sponsor of international terrorism unless
    the Secretary of State determines, in consultation with the
    Secretary of Homeland Security and the heads of other appropriate
    United States agencies, that such alien does not pose a threat to
    the safety, national security, or national interest of the United
    States. In making a determination under this subparagraph, the
    Secretary of State shall apply standards developed by the Secretary
    of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security
    and the heads of other appropriate United States agencies, that are
    applicable to the nationals of such states.
      (ii) In this subparagraph, the term "state sponsor of
    international terrorism" means any country the government of which
    has been determined by the Secretary of State under any of the laws
    specified in clause (iii) to have repeatedly provided support for
    acts of international terrorism.

      (H) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall permit an athlete,
    or the employer of an athlete, to seek admission to the United
    States for such athlete under a provision of this chapter other
    than section 1101(a)(15)(P)(i) of this title if the athlete is
    eligible under such other provision.
      (5)(A) In the case of an alien who is provided nonimmigrant
    status under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) or 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b)
    of this title and who is dismissed from employment by the employer
    before the end of the period of authorized admission, the employer
    shall be liable for the reasonable costs of return transportation
    of the alien abroad.
      (B) In the case of an alien who is admitted to the United States
    in nonimmigrant status under section 1101(a)(15)(O) or
    1101(a)(15)(P) of this title and whose employment terminates for
    reasons other than voluntary resignation, the employer whose offer
    of employment formed the basis of such nonimmigrant status and the
    petitioner are jointly and severally liable for the reasonable cost

    provide assurance satisfactory to the Attorney General that the
    reasonable cost of that transportation will be provided.
      (6)(A)(i) To meet the consultation requirement of paragraph
    (3)(A) in the case of a petition for a nonimmigrant described in
    section 1101(a)(15)(O)(i) of this title (other than with respect to

    production), the petitioner shall submit with the petition an
    advisory opinion from a peer group (or other person or persons of
    its choosing, which may include a labor organization) with
    expertise in the specific field involved.
      (ii) To meet the consultation requirement of paragraph (3)(B) in
    the case of a petition for a nonimmigrant described in section
    1101(a)(15)(O)(ii) of this title (other than with respect to aliens
    seeking entry for a motion picture or television production), the
    petitioner shall submit with the petition an advisory opinion from
    a labor organization with expertise in the skill area involved.
      (iii) To meet the consultation requirement of paragraph (4)(D) in
    the case of a petition for a nonimmigrant described in section
    1101(a)(15)(P)(i) or 1101(a)(15)(P)(iii) of this title, the
    petitioner shall submit with the petition an advisory opinion from
    a labor organization with expertise in the specific field of
    athletics or entertainment involved.
      (B) To meet the consultation requirements of subparagraph (A),
    unless the petitioner submits with the petition an advisory opinion
    from an appropriate labor organization, the Attorney General shall
    forward a copy of the petition and all supporting documentation to
    the national office of an appropriate labor organization within 5
    days of the date of receipt of the petition. If there is a
    collective bargaining representative of an employer's employees in
    the occupational classification for which the alien is being
    sought, that representative shall be the appropriate labor
    organization.
      (C) In those cases in which a petitioner described in
    subparagraph (A) establishes that an appropriate peer group
    (including a labor organization) does not exist, the Attorney
    General shall adjudicate the petition without requiring an advisory
    opinion.
      (D) Any person or organization receiving a copy of a petition
    described in subparagraph (A) and supporting documents shall have
    no more than 15 days following the date of receipt of such
    documents within which to submit a written advisory opinion or
    comment or to provide a letter of no objection. Once the 15-day
    period has expired and the petitioner has had an opportunity, where
    appropriate, to supply rebuttal evidence, the Attorney General
    shall adjudicate such petition in no more than 14 days. The
    Attorney General may shorten any specified time period for
    emergency reasons if no unreasonable burden would be thus imposed
    on any participant in the process.
      (E)(i) The Attorney General shall establish by regulation
    expedited consultation procedures in the case of nonimmigrant
    artists or entertainers described in section 1101(a)(15)(O) or

    title in the case of emergency circumstances (including trades
    during a season).
      (F) No consultation required under this subsection by the
    Attorney General with a nongovernmental entity shall be construed
    as permitting the Attorney General to delegate any authority under
    this subsection to such an entity. The Attorney General shall give
    such weight to advisory opinions provided under this section as the
    Attorney General determines, in his sole discretion, to be
    appropriate.
      (7) If a petition is filed and denied under this subsection, the
    Attorney General shall notify the petitioner of the determination
    and the reasons for the denial and of the process by which the
    petitioner may appeal the determination.
      (8) The Attorney General shall submit annually to the Committees
    on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate
    a report describing, with respect to petitions under each
    subcategory of subparagraphs (H), (O), (P), and (Q) of section
    1101(a)(15) of this title the following:

      number of workers (by occupation) requested in such denied
      petitions.
        (D) The number of such petitions which have been withdrawn.
        (E) The number of such petitions which are awaiting final
      action.

      alien); or
        (iii) to obtain authorization for an alien having such status
      to change employers.

      (B) The amount of the fee shall be $1,500 for each such petition
    except that the fee shall be half the amount for each such petition

    petitioning employer is involved in a corporate restructuring,
    including but not limited to a merger, acquisition, or
    consolidation, where a new corporate entity succeeds to the

        (i) in order that an alien may be initially granted
      nonimmigrant status described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of
      this title; or
        (ii) in order to satisfy the requirement of the second sentence

      status to obtain certain extensions of stay.

      (B) The amount of the fee shall be the same as the amount imposed

      (C) Fees collected under this paragraph shall be deposited in the
    Treasury in accordance with section 1356(s) of this title.
      (12)(A) In addition to any other fees authorized by law, the

    of the conditions of the petition to admit or otherwise provide
    status to a nonimmigrant worker under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b)
    of this title or a willful misrepresentation of a material fact in
    such petition - 
        (i) the Secretary of Homeland Security may, in addition to any
      other remedy authorized by law, impose such administrative

    Secretary of Homeland Security. The petition shall be in such form
    and contain such information as the Secretary of Homeland Security
    shall, by regulation, prescribe. Such information shall include

      petitioned under paragraph (1) with respect to two or more
      applying aliens; and

    not be granted if the petitioner has a record of violent criminal
    offenses against a person or persons.
      (C)(i) The Secretary of Homeland Security is not limited by the
    criminal court record and shall grant a waiver of the condition
    described in the second sentence of subparagraph (B) in the case of

        (I) the petitioner was acting in self-defense;
        (II) the petitioner was found to have violated a protection
      order intended to protect the petitioner; or
        (III) the petitioner committed, was arrested for, was convicted
      of, or pled guilty to committing a crime that did not result in
      serious bodily injury and where there was a connection between
      the crime and the petitioner's having been battered or subjected
      to extreme cruelty.

      (iii) In acting on applications under this subparagraph, the
    Secretary of Homeland Security shall consider any credible evidence
    relevant to the application. The determination of what evidence is
    credible and the weight to be given that evidence shall be within
    the sole discretion of the Secretary.

        (A) The terms "domestic violence", "sexual assault", "child
      abuse and neglect", "dating violence", "elder abuse", and

    of Annex 1603 of NAFTA shall be subject to the attestation
    requirement of section 1182(m) of this title, in the case of a
    registered nurse, or the application requirement of section 1182(n)
    of this title, in the case of all other professions set out in
    Appendix 1603.D.1 of Annex 1603 of NAFTA, and the petition
    requirement of subsection (c) of this section, to the extent and in
    the manner prescribed in regulations promulgated by the Secretary
    of Labor, with respect to sections 1182(m) and 1182(n) of this
    title, and the Attorney General, with respect to subsection (c) of

    of this title if the alien intends to land for the purpose of
    performing service on board a vessel of the United States (as
    defined in section 116 of title 46) or on an aircraft of an air
    carrier (as defined in section 40102(a)(2) of title 49) during a

      (2) An alien described in paragraph (1) - 
        (A) may not be paroled into the United States pursuant to
      section 1182(d)(5) of this title unless the Attorney General

      the national security of the United States; and
        (B) shall be considered not to be a bona fide crewman for
      purposes of section 1282(b) of this title.

      (3) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien if the air carrier
    or owner or operator of such vessel that employs the alien provides
    documentation that satisfies the Attorney General that the alien - 
        (A) has been an employee of such employer for a period of not
      less than 1 year preceding the date that a strike or lawful
      lockout commenced;
        (B) has served as a qualified crewman for such employer at
      least once in each of 3 months during the 12-month period

          (vii) 65,000 in each succeeding fiscal year; or

        (B) under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) of this title may not
      exceed 66,000.

      (2) The numerical limitations of paragraph (1) shall only apply
    to principal aliens and not to the spouses or children of such
    aliens.
      (3) Aliens who are subject to the numerical limitations of
    paragraph (1) shall be issued visas (or otherwise provided
    nonimmigrant status) in the order in which petitions are filed for
    such visas or status. If an alien who was issued a visa or
    otherwise provided nonimmigrant status and counted against the
    numerical limitations of paragraph (1) is found to have been issued
    such visa or otherwise provided such status by fraud or willfully
    misrepresenting a material fact and such visa or nonimmigrant
    status is revoked, then one number shall be restored to the total
    number of aliens who may be issued visas or otherwise provided such
    status under the numerical limitations of paragraph (1) in the
    fiscal year in which the petition is revoked, regardless of the
    fiscal year in which the petition was approved.
      (4) In the case of a nonimmigrant described in section
    1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this title, the period of authorized
    admission as such a nonimmigrant may not exceed 6 years.

    not apply to any nonimmigrant alien issued a visa or otherwise
    provided status under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this title
    who - 
        (A) is employed (or has received an offer of employment) at an
      institution of higher education (as defined in section 1001(a) of
      title 20), or a related or affiliated nonprofit entity;
        (B) is employed (or has received an offer of employment) at a
      nonprofit research organization or a governmental research
      organization; or
        (C) has earned a master's or higher degree from a United States
      institution of higher education (as defined in section 1001(a) of
      title 20), until the number of aliens who are exempted from such
      numerical limitation during such year exceeds 20,000.

      (6) Any alien who ceases to be employed by an employer described
    in paragraph (5)(A) shall, if employed as a nonimmigrant alien
    described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this title, who has
    not previously been counted toward the numerical limitations
    contained in paragraph (1)(A), be counted toward those limitations
    the first time the alien is employed by an employer other than one
    described in paragraph (5).
      (7) Any alien who has already been counted, within the 6 years
    prior to the approval of a petition described in subsection (c) of
    this section, toward the numerical limitations of paragraph (1)(A)
    shall not again be counted toward those limitations unless the
    alien would be eligible for a full 6 years of authorized admission
    at the time the petition is filed. Where multiple petitions are

    shall only apply to principal aliens and not to the spouses or
    children of such aliens.
      (iv) The annual numerical limitation described in paragraph
    (1)(A) is reduced by the amount of the annual numerical limitations
    established under clause (i). However, if a numerical limitation
    established under clause (i) has not been exhausted at the end of a
    given fiscal year, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall adjust
    upwards the numerical limitation in paragraph (1)(A) for that
    fiscal year by the amount remaining in the numerical limitation
    under clause (i). Visas under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this

    extension, the next following extension shall not be granted unless
    the Secretary of Labor had determined and certified to the
    Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State that the
    intending employer has filed with the Secretary of Labor an
    attestation under section 1182(t)(1) of this title for the purpose
    of permitting the nonimmigrant to obtain such extension.
      (D) The numerical limitation described in paragraph (1)(A) for a
    fiscal year shall be reduced by one for each alien granted an
    extension under subparagraph (C) during such year who has obtained
    5 or more consecutive prior extensions.
      (9)(A) Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), an alien who has
    already been counted toward the numerical limitation of paragraph
    (1)(B) during fiscal year 2004, 2005, or 2006 shall not again be
    counted toward such limitation during fiscal year 2007. Such an
    alien shall be considered a returning worker.

    a returning worker - 
        (i) all information and evidence that the Secretary of Homeland
      Security determines is required to support a petition for status
      under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) of this title;

      that the alien is a returning worker.

      (C) An H-2B visa or grant of nonimmigrant status for a returning
    worker shall be approved only if the alien is confirmed to be a
    returning worker by - 
        (i) the Department of State; or
        (ii) if the alien is visa exempt or seeking to change to status
      under section 1101 (a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) of this title, the
      Department of Homeland Security.

      (10) The numerical limitations of paragraph (1)(B) shall be
    allocated for a fiscal year so that the total number of aliens
    subject to such numerical limits who enter the United States
    pursuant to a visa or are accorded nonimmigrant status under
    section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) of this title during the first 6
    months of such fiscal year is not more than 33,000.
      (11)(A) The Secretary of State may not approve a number of
    initial applications submitted for aliens described in section
    1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title that is more than the applicable
    numerical limitation set out in this paragraph.
      (B) The applicable numerical limitation referred to in
    subparagraph (A) is 10,500 for each fiscal year.
      (C) The applicable numerical limitation referred to in
    subparagraph (A) shall only apply to principal aliens and not to
    the spouses or children of such aliens.
    (h) Intention to abandon foreign residence
      The fact that an alien is the beneficiary of an application for a
    preference status filed under section 1154 of this title or has
    otherwise sought permanent residence in the United States shall not
    constitute evidence of an intention to abandon a foreign residence
    for purposes of obtaining a visa as a nonimmigrant described in
    subparagraph (H)(i)(b) or (c), (L), or (V) of section 1101(a)(15)
    of this title or otherwise obtaining or maintaining the status of a
    nonimmigrant described in such subparagraph, if the alien had
    obtained a change of status under section 1258 of this title to a
    classification as such a nonimmigrant before the alien's most
    recent departure from the United States.

    who is a citizen of Canada or Mexico who seeks to enter the United
    States under and pursuant to the provisions of Section B, Section
    C, or Section D of Annex 1603 of the North American Free Trade
    Agreement, shall not be classified as a nonimmigrant under such
    provisions if there is in progress a strike or lockout in the
    course of a labor dispute in the occupational classification at the
    place or intended place of employment, unless such alien
    establishes, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Attorney
    General, that the alien's entry will not affect adversely the
    settlement of the strike or lockout or the employment of any person
    who is involved in the strike or lockout. Notice of a determination
    under this paragraph shall be given as may be required by paragraph
    3 of article 1603 of such Agreement. For purposes of this
    paragraph, the term "citizen of Mexico" means "citizen" as defined

    provided a visa as nonimmigrants under section 1101(a)(15)(S)(ii)
    of this title in any fiscal year may not exceed 50.
      (2) The period of admission of an alien as such a nonimmigrant
    may not exceed 3 years. Such period may not be extended by the
    Attorney General.
      (3) As a condition for the admission, and continued stay in
    lawful status, of such a nonimmigrant, the nonimmigrant - 
        (A) shall report not less often than quarterly to the Attorney
      General such information concerning the alien's whereabouts and
      activities as the Attorney General may require;
        (B) may not be convicted of any criminal offense punishable by
      a term of imprisonment of 1 year or more after the date of such
      admission;
        (C) must have executed a form that waives the nonimmigrant's
      right to contest, other than on the basis of an application for
      withholding of removal, any action for removal of the alien
      instituted before the alien obtains lawful permanent resident
      status; and
        (D) shall abide by any other condition, limitation, or
      restriction imposed by the Attorney General.

        (E) the number of such nonimmigrants who have failed to report
      quarterly (as required under paragraph (3)) or who have been
      convicted of crimes in the United States after the date of their
      admission as such a nonimmigrant.
    (l) Restrictions on waiver
      (1) In the case of a request by an interested State agency, or by
    an interested Federal agency, for a waiver of the 2-year foreign
    residence requirement under section 1182(e) of this title on behalf
    of an alien described in clause (iii) of such section, the Attorney
    General shall not grant such waiver unless - 
        (A) in the case of an alien who is otherwise contractually
      obligated to return to a foreign country, the government of such
      country furnishes the Director of the United States Information
      Agency with a statement in writing that it has no objection to
      such waiver;
        (B) in the case of a request by an interested State agency, the
      grant of such waiver would not cause the number of waivers
      allotted for that State for that fiscal year to exceed 30;
        (C) in the case of a request by an interested Federal agency or
      by an interested State agency - 
          (i) the alien demonstrates a bona fide offer of full-time
        employment at a health facility or health care organization,
        which employment has been determined by the Attorney General to
        be in the public interest; and
          (ii) the alien agrees to begin employment with the health
        facility or health care organization within 90 days of
        receiving such waiver, and agrees to continue to work for a
        total of not less than 3 years (unless the Attorney General
        determines that extenuating circumstances exist, such as
        closure of the facility or hardship to the alien, which would
        justify a lesser period of employment at such health facility
        or health care organization, in which case the alien must
        demonstrate another bona fide offer of employment at a health
        facility or health care organization for the remainder of such
        3-year period); and

        (D) in the case of a request by an interested Federal agency
      (other than a request by an interested Federal agency to employ
      the alien full-time in medical research or training) or by an
      interested State agency, the alien agrees to practice primary
      care or specialty medicine in accordance with paragraph (2) for a
      total of not less than 3 years only in the geographic area or
      areas which are designated by the Secretary of Health and Human
      Services as having a shortage of health care professionals,
      except that - 
          (i) in the case of a request by the Department of Veterans
        Affairs, the alien shall not be required to practice medicine
        in a geographic area designated by the Secretary;
          (ii) in the case of a request by an interested State agency,
        the head of such State agency determines that the alien is to
        practice medicine under such agreement in a facility that
        serves patients who reside in one or more geographic areas so
        designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services
        (without regard to whether such facility is located within such
        a designated geographic area), and the grant of such waiver
        would not cause the number of the waivers granted on behalf of
        aliens for such State for a fiscal year (within the limitation
        in subparagraph (B)) in accordance with the conditions of this
        clause to exceed 10; and
          (iii) in the case of a request by an interested Federal
        agency or by an interested State agency for a waiver for an
        alien who agrees to practice specialty medicine in a facility
        located in a geographic area so designated by the Secretary of
        Health and Human Services, the request shall demonstrate, based
        on criteria established by such agency, that there is a
        shortage of health care professionals able to provide services
        in the appropriate medical specialty to the patients who will
        be served by the alien.

      (2)(A) Notwithstanding section 1258(a)(2) of this title, the
    Attorney General may change the status of an alien who qualifies
    under this subsection and section 1182(e) of this title to that of
    an alien described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this title.
    The numerical limitations contained in subsection (g)(1)(A) of this
    section shall not apply to any alien whose status is changed under
    the preceding sentence, if the alien obtained a waiver of the 2-
    year foreign residence requirement upon a request by an interested
    Federal agency or an interested State agency.
      (B) No person who has obtained a change of status under
    subparagraph (A) and who has failed to fulfill the terms of the
    contract with the health facility or health care organization named
    in the waiver application shall be eligible to apply for an
    immigrant visa, for permanent residence, or for any other change of
    nonimmigrant status, until it is established that such person has
    resided and been physically present in the country of his
    nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least 2
    years following departure from the United States.
      (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the 2-
    year foreign residence requirement under section 1182(e) of this
    title shall apply with respect to an alien described in clause
    (iii) of such section, who has not otherwise been accorded status
    under section 1101(a)(27)(H) of this title, if - 
        (A) at any time the alien ceases to comply with any agreement
      entered into under subparagraph (C) or (D) of paragraph (1); or
        (B) the alien's employment ceases to benefit the public
      interest at any time during the 3-year period described in
      paragraph (1)(C).
    (m) Nonimmigrant elementary and secondary school students
      (1) An alien may not be accorded status as a nonimmigrant under
    clause (i) or (iii) of section 1101(a)(15)(F) of this title in
    order to pursue a course of study - 
        (A) at a public elementary school or in a publicly funded adult
      education program; or
        (B) at a public secondary school unless - 
          (i) the aggregate period of such status at such a school does
        not exceed 12 months with respect to any alien, and (ii) the
        alien demonstrates that the alien has reimbursed the local
        educational agency that administers the school for the full,
        unsubsidized per capita cost of providing education at such
        school for the period of the alien's attendance.

        (2) An alien who obtains the status of a nonimmigrant under
      clause (i) or (iii) of section 1101(a)(15)(F) of this title in
      order to pursue a course of study at a private elementary or
      secondary school or in a language training program that is not
      publicly funded shall be considered to have violated such status,
      and the alien's visa under section 1101(a)(15)(F) of this title
      shall be void, if the alien terminates or abandons such course of
      study at such a school and undertakes a course of study at a
      public elementary school, in a publicly funded adult education
      program, in a publicly funded adult education language training
      program, or at a public secondary school (unless the requirements
      of paragraph (1)(B) are met).
    (n) Increased portability of H-1B status
      (1) A nonimmigrant alien described in paragraph (2) who was
    previously issued a visa or otherwise provided nonimmigrant status
    under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this title is authorized to
    accept new employment upon the filing by the prospective employer
    of a new petition on behalf of such nonimmigrant as provided under
    subsection (a) of this section. Employment authorization shall
    continue for such alien until the new petition is adjudicated. If
    the new petition is denied, such authorization shall cease.
      (2) A nonimmigrant alien described in this paragraph is a
    nonimmigrant alien - 
        (A) who has been lawfully admitted into the United States;
        (B) on whose behalf an employer has filed a nonfrivolous
      petition for new employment before the date of expiration of the
      period of stay authorized by the Attorney General; and
        (C) who, subsequent to such lawful admission, has not been
      employed without authorization in the United States before the
      filing of such petition.
    (o) Nonimmigrants guilty of trafficking in persons
      (1) No alien shall be eligible for admission to the United States
    under section 1101(a)(15)(T) of this title if there is substantial
    reason to believe that the alien has committed an act of a severe
    form of trafficking in persons (as defined in section 7102 of title
    22).
      (2) The total number of aliens who may be issued visas or
    otherwise provided nonimmigrant status during any fiscal year under
    section 1101(a)(15)(T) of this title may not exceed 5,000.
      (3) The numerical limitation of paragraph (2) shall only apply to
    principal aliens and not to the spouses, sons, daughters, siblings,
    or parents of such aliens.
      (4) An unmarried alien who seeks to accompany, or follow to join,
    a parent granted status under section 1101(a)(15)(T)(i) of this
    title, and who was under 21 years of age on the date on which such
    parent applied for such status, shall continue to be classified as
    a child for purposes of section 1101(a)(15)(T)(ii) of this title,
    if the alien attains 21 years of age after such parent's
    application was filed but while it was pending.
      (5) An alien described in clause (i) of section 1101(a)(15)(T) of
    this title shall continue to be treated as an alien described in
    clause (ii)(I) of such section if the alien attains 21 years of age
    after the alien's application for status under such clause (i) is
    filed but while it is pending.
      (6) In making a determination under section
    1101(a)(15)(T)(i)(III)(aa) with respect to an alien, statements
    from State and local law enforcement officials that the alien has
    complied with any reasonable request for assistance in the
    investigation or prosecution of crimes such as kidnapping, rape,
    slavery, or other forced labor offenses, where severe forms of
    trafficking in persons (as defined in section 7102 of title 22)
    appear to have been involved, shall be considered.
      (7)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), an alien who is
    issued a visa or otherwise provided nonimmigrant status under
    section 1101(a)(15)(T) of this title may be granted such status for
    a period of not more than 4 years.
      (B) An alien who is issued a visa or otherwise provided
    nonimmigrant status under section 1101(a)(15)(T) of this title may
    extend the period of such status beyond the period described in
    subparagraph (A) if - 
        (i) a Federal, State, or local law enforcement official,
      prosecutor, judge, or other authority investigating or
      prosecuting activity relating to human trafficking or certifies
      that the presence of the alien in the United States is necessary
      to assist in the investigation or prosecution of such activity;
        (ii) the alien is eligible for relief under section 1255(l) of
      this title and is unable to obtain such relief because
      regulations have not been issued to implement such section; or
        (iii) the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that an
      extension of the period of such nonimmigrant status is warranted
      due to exceptional circumstances.

      (C) Nonimmigrant status under section 1101(a)(15)(T) of this
    title shall be extended during the pendency of an application for
    adjustment of status under section 1255(l) of this title.

      (1) Petitioning procedures for section 1101(a)(15)(U) visas
        The petition filed by an alien under section 1101(a)(15)(U)(i)

      other Federal, State, or local authority investigating criminal
      activity described in section 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii) of this title.
      This certification may also be provided by an official of the
      Service whose ability to provide such certification is not
      limited to information concerning immigration violations. This
      certification shall state that the alien "has been helpful, is
      being helpful, or is likely to be helpful" in the investigation
      or prosecution of criminal activity described in section
      1101(a)(15)(U)(iii) of this title.

      this title in any fiscal year shall not exceed 10,000.
        (B) The numerical limitations in subparagraph (A) shall only
      apply to principal aliens described in section 1101(a)(15)(U)(i)
      of this title, and not to spouses, children, or, in the case of
      alien children, the alien parents of such children.
      (3) Duties of the Attorney General with respect to "U" visa
        nonimmigrants
        With respect to nonimmigrant aliens described in subsection
      (a)(15)(U) of section 1101 of this title - 
          (A) the Attorney General and other government officials,
        where appropriate, shall provide those aliens with referrals to
        nongovernmental organizations to advise the aliens regarding
        their options while in the United States and the resources
        available to them; and
          (B) the Attorney General shall, during the period those
        aliens are in lawful temporary resident status under that
        subsection, provide the aliens with employment authorization.
      (4) Credible evidence considered
        In acting on any petition filed under this subsection, the
      consular officer or the Attorney General, as appropriate, shall
      consider any credible evidence relevant to the petition.
      (5) Nonexclusive relief
        Nothing in this subsection limits the ability of aliens who
      qualify for status under section 1101(a)(15)(U) of this title to
      seek any other immigration benefit or status for which the alien
      may be eligible.
      (6) Duration of status
        The authorized period of status of an alien as a nonimmigrant
      under section 1101(a)(15)(U) of this title shall be for a period
      of not more than 4 years, but shall be extended upon
      certification from a Federal, State, or local law enforcement
      official, prosecutor, judge, or other Federal, State, or local
      authority investigating or prosecuting criminal activity
      described in section 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii) of this title that the
      alien's presence in the United States is required to assist in
      the investigation or prosecution of such criminal activity. The
      Secretary of Homeland Security may extend, beyond the 4-year
      period authorized under this section, the authorized period of
      status of an alien as a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(U)
      of this title if the Secretary determines that an extension of
      such period is warranted due to exceptional circumstances. Such
      alien's nonimmigrant status shall be extended beyond the 4-year
      period authorized under this section if the alien is eligible for
      relief under section 1255(m) of this title and is unable to
      obtain such relief because regulations have not been issued to
      implement such section and shall be extended during the pendency
      of an application for adjustment of status under section 1255(m)
      of this title. The Secretary may grant work authorization to any
      alien who has a pending, bona fide application for nonimmigrant
      status under section 1101(a)(15)(U) of this title.

    1101(a)(15)(V) of this title - 
        (A) the Attorney General shall authorize the alien to engage in
      employment in the United States during the period of authorized
      admission and shall provide the alien with an "employment
      authorized" endorsement or other appropriate document signifying
      authorization of employment; and
        (B) the period of authorized admission as such a nonimmigrant
      shall terminate 30 days after the date on which any of the
      following is denied:
          (i) The petition filed under section 1154 of this title to
        accord the alien a status under section 1153(a)(2)(A) of this
        title (or, in the case of a child granted nonimmigrant status
        based on eligibility to receive a visa under section 1153(d) of
        this title, the petition filed to accord the child's parent a
        status under section 1153(a)(2)(A) of this title).

        to the approval of such petition.
          (iii) The alien's application for adjustment of status under

      (2) In determining whether an alien is eligible to be admitted to
    the United States as a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(V) of
    this title, the grounds for inadmissibility specified in section
    1182(a)(9)(B) of this title shall not apply.
      (3) The status of an alien physically present in the United
    States may be adjusted by the Attorney General, in the discretion
    of the Attorney General and under such regulations as the Attorney
    General may prescribe, to that of a nonimmigrant under section
    1101(a)(15)(V) of this title, if the alien - 
        (A) applies for such adjustment;
        (B) satisfies the requirements of such section; and
        (C) is eligible to be admitted to the United States, except in
      determining such admissibility, the grounds for inadmissibility
      specified in paragraphs (6)(A), (7), and (9)(B) of section
      1182(a) of this title shall not apply.
    (r) Visas of nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(K)(ii)

    applying alien and approved by the Attorney General. The petition
    shall be in such form and contain such information as the Attorney
    General shall, by regulation, prescribe. Such information shall
    include information on any criminal convictions of the petitioner
    for any specified crime.
      (2) In the case of an alien seeking admission under section
    1101(a)(15)(K)(ii) of this title who concluded a marriage with a
    citizen of the United States outside the United States, the alien
    shall be considered inadmissible under section 1182(a)(7)(B) of
    this title if the alien is not at the time of application for
    admission in possession of a valid nonimmigrant visa issued by a
    consular officer in the foreign state in which the marriage was
    concluded.
      (3) In the case of a nonimmigrant described in section
    1101(a)(15)(K)(ii) of this title, and any child of such a
    nonimmigrant who was admitted as accompanying, or following to
    join, such a nonimmigrant, the period of authorized admission shall
    terminate 30 days after the date on which any of the following is
    denied:
        (A) The petition filed under section 1154 of this title to
      accord the principal alien status under section 1151(b)(2)(A)(i)

    for the purpose of tracking multiple visa petitions filed for
    fiance&#233;(e)s and spouses under clauses (i) and (ii) of section
    1101(a)(15)(K) of this title. Upon approval of a second visa
    petition under section 1101(a)(15)(K) of this title for a
    fiance&#233;(e) or spouse filed by the same United States citizen
    petitioner, the petitioner shall be notified by the Secretary that
    information concerning the petitioner has been entered into the
    multiple visa petition tracking database. All subsequent
    fiance&#233;(e) or spouse nonimmigrant visa petitions filed by that
    petitioner under such section shall be entered in the database.
      (B)(i) Once a petitioner has had two fiance&#233;(e) or spousal
    petitions approved under clause (i) or (ii) of section
    1101(a)(15)(K) of this title, if a subsequent petition is filed
    under such section less than 10 years after the date the first visa
    petition was filed under such section, the Secretary of Homeland
    Security shall notify both the petitioner and beneficiary of any
    such subsequent petition about the number of previously approved
    fiance&#233;(e) or spousal petitions listed in the database.
      (ii) A copy of the information and resources pamphlet on domestic

        (5) for any person knowingly to use or attempt to use any
      permit or evidence of permission to depart or enter not issued

          International Organization for Standardization (ISO) security

          efficient cross-border travel, the Departments of Homeland
          Security and State shall, to the maximum extent possible,
          develop an architecture that is compatible with information
          technology systems and infrastructure used by United States
          Customs and Border Protection;

          Postal Service on the fee to be charged individuals for the
          passport card, and a detailed justification has been
          submitted to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate

          groups of children traveling across an international border
          under adult supervision with parental consent;

          the passport cards has been installed, and all employees at
          ports of entry have been properly trained in the use of the
          new technology;
            "(vi) the passport card has been made available for the
          purpose of international travel by United States citizens

          and Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Bermuda;

          borders has been established; and
            "(viii) the signing of a memorandum of agreement to
          initiate a pilot program with not less than one State to

          "(B) pursuant to such approval, obtained the status of an
        alien entrepreneur with permanent resident status on a
        conditional basis described in section 216A of such Act (8
        U.S.C. 1186b); and

        "(2) Reopening petitions previously denied. - 
          "(A) In general. - In the case of a petition described in
        paragraph (1)(C) that was denied under section 216A(c)(3)(C) of
        the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1186b(c)(3)(C))
        before the date of the enactment of this Act, upon a motion to

        60 days after such date, the Attorney General shall make
        determinations on such petition pursuant to subsection (c).
          "(B) Petitioners abroad. - In the case of such an eligible
        alien who is no longer physically present in the United States,
        the Attorney General shall establish a process under which the
        alien may be paroled into the United States if necessary in
        order to obtain the determinations under subsection (c), unless

        in paragraph (1)(C), a motion to reopen filed under

        on motions to reopen such proceedings, except that the scope of

        for permanent residence (unconditionally or on a conditional
        basis), by reason of the determinations made under subsection
        (c). An alien who is inadmissible or deportable on any ground
        shall not be granted such status, except that this prohibition
        shall not apply to an alien who has been paroled into the
        United States under subparagraph (B).

          limited partnership and regardless of whether the alien
          entered the enterprise after its formation);
            "(ii) subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), such enterprise
          created full-time jobs for not fewer than 10 United States
          citizens or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence
          or other immigrants lawfully authorized to be employed in the
          United States (other than the eligible alien and the alien's
          spouse, sons, or daughters), and those jobs exist or existed
          on any of the dates described in subparagraph (D); and

        effect on the date of the enactment of this Act [Nov. 2, 2002],
        shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of such
        subparagraph.
          "(C) Exception for troubled businesses. - In the case of an
        eligible alien who has made a capital investment in a troubled
        business (as defined in 8 CFR 204.6(e), as in effect on the
        date of the enactment of this Act), in lieu of the
        determination under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Attorney General
        shall determine whether the number of employees of the

        - If the Attorney General renders an affirmative determination
        with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A), and
        if the Attorney General renders a negative determination with
        respect to clause (i) of such subparagraph, the Attorney
        General shall so notify the alien involved and shall remove the
        conditional basis of the alien's status (and that of the
        alien's spouse and children if it was obtained under section
        216A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1186b))
        effective as of the second anniversary of the alien's lawful
        admission for permanent residence.
          "(F) Requirements relating to adverse determinations. -

          determination with respect to clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of
          subparagraph (A), the Attorney General shall so notify the
          alien involved. The notice shall be in writing and shall
          state the factual basis for any adverse determination. The
          Attorney General shall provide the alien with an opportunity
          to submit evidence to rebut any adverse determination. If the
          Attorney General reverses all adverse determinations pursuant
          to such rebuttal, the Attorney General shall so notify the
          alien involved and shall remove the conditional basis of the
          alien's status (and that of the alien's spouse and children
          if it was obtained under section 216A of the Immigration and
          Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1186b)) effective as of the second
          anniversary of the alien's lawful admission for permanent
          residence.
            "(ii) Continuation of conditional basis if certain adverse
          determinations. - If the Attorney General renders an adverse
          determination with respect to clause (ii) or (iii) of
          subparagraph (A), and the eligible alien's rebuttal does not
          cause the Attorney General to reverse such determination, the
          Attorney General shall continue the conditional basis of the
          alien's permanent resident status (and that of the alien's
          spouse and children if it was obtained under section 216A of
          the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1186b)) for a 2-
          year period.
            "(iii) Termination if adverse determination. - If the
          Attorney General renders an adverse determination with
          respect to subparagraph (A)(i), and the eligible alien's
          rebuttal does not cause the Attorney General to reverse such
          determination, the Attorney General shall so notify the alien
          involved and, subject to subsection (d), shall terminate the
          permanent resident status of the alien (and that of the
          alien's spouse and children if it was obtained on a
          conditional basis under section 216A of the Immigration and
          Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1186b)).
            "(iv) Administrative and judicial review. - An alien may
          seek administrative review of an adverse determination made
          under subparagraph (A) by filing a petition for such review
          with the Board of Immigration Appeals. If the Board of
          Immigration Appeals denies the petition, the alien may seek
          judicial review. The procedures for judicial review under
          this clause shall be the same as the procedures for judicial
          review of a final order of removal under section 242(a)(1) of
          the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(1)).
          During the period in which an administrative or judicial
          appeal under this clause is pending, the Attorney General
          shall continue the conditional basis of the alien's permanent
          resident status (and that of the alien's spouse and children
          if it was obtained under section 216A of the Immigration and
          Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1186b)).
        "(2) Second determination. - 
          "(A) Authorization to consider investments in other
        commercial enterprises. - In determining under this paragraph
        whether to remove a conditional basis continued under paragraph
        (1)(F)(ii) with respect to an alien, the Attorney General shall
        consider any capital investment made by the alien in a
        commercial enterprise (regardless of whether such enterprise is
        a limited partnership and regardless of whether the alien
        entered the enterprise after its formation), in the United
        States, regardless of whether that investment was made before
        or after the determinations under paragraph (1) and regardless
        of whether the commercial enterprise is the same as that
        considered in the determinations under such paragraph, if facts
        and information with respect to the investment and the
        enterprise are included in the petition submitted under
        subparagraph (B).
          "(B) Petition. - In order for a conditional basis continued
        under paragraph (1)(F)(ii) for an eligible alien (and the
        alien's spouse and children) to be removed, the alien must
        submit to the Attorney General, during the period described in
        subparagraph (C), a petition which requests the removal of such
        conditional basis and which states, under penalty of perjury,
        the facts and information described in subparagraphs (A) and
        (B) of section 216A(d)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality
        Act (8 U.S.C. 1186b(d)(1)) with respect to any commercial
        enterprise (regardless of whether such enterprise is a limited
        partnership and regardless of whether the alien entered the
        enterprise after its formation) which the alien desires to have
        considered under this paragraph, regardless of whether such
        enterprise was created before or after the determinations made
        under paragraph (1).
          "(C) Period for filing petition. - 
            "(i) 90-day period before second anniversary. - Except as
          provided in clause (ii), the petition under subparagraph (B)
          must be filed during the 90-day period before the second
          anniversary of the continuation, under paragraph (1)(F)(ii),
          of the conditional basis of the alien's lawful admission for
          permanent residence.
            "(ii) Date petitions for good cause. - Such a petition may
          be considered if filed after such date, but only if the alien
          establishes to the satisfaction of the Attorney General good
          cause and extenuating circumstances for failure to file the
          petition during the period described in clause (i).
          "(D) Termination of permanent resident status for failure to
        file petition. - 
            "(i) In general. - In the case of an alien with permanent
          resident status on a conditional basis under paragraph
          (1)(F)(ii), if no petition is filed with respect to the alien
          in accordance with subparagraph (B), the Attorney General
          shall terminate the permanent resident status of the alien
          (and the alien's spouse and children if it was obtained on a
          conditional basis under section 216A of the Immigration and
          Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1186b)) as of the second
          anniversary of the continuation, under paragraph (1)(F)(ii),
          of the conditional basis of the alien's lawful admission for
          permanent residence.
            "(ii) Hearing in removal proceeding. - In any removal
          proceeding with respect to an alien whose permanent resident
          status is terminated under clause (i), the burden of proof
          shall be on the alien to establish compliance with
          subparagraph (B).
          "(E) Determinations after petition. - If a petition is filed
        by an eligible alien in accordance with subparagraph (B), the
        Attorney General shall make a determination, within 90 days of
        the date of such filing, whether - 
            "(i) the petition contains any material misrepresentation
          in the facts and information alleged in the petition with
          respect to the commercial enterprises included in such
          petition;
            "(ii) all such enterprises, considered together, created
          full-time jobs for not fewer than 10 United States citizens

          under paragraph (1)(A)(ii);
         "(II) the provisions of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph
          (1) shall apply to a determination under this clause in the
          same manner as they apply to a determination under paragraph
          (1)(A)(ii); and
         "(III) if the Attorney General determined under paragraph
          (1)(A)(ii) that any jobs satisfying the requirement of such
          paragraph were created, the number of those jobs shall be
          subtracted from the number of jobs otherwise needed to
          satisfy the requirement of this clause; and
            "(iii) considering all such enterprises together, on the
          date on which the determination is made, the eligible alien
          is in substantial compliance with the capital investment
          requirement described in section 216A(d)(1)(B) of the
          Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1186b(d)(1)(B)),

          an adverse determination with respect to the eligible alien
          under paragraph (1)(A)(iii); and
         "(II) if the Attorney General determined under paragraph
          (1)(A)(iii) that any capital amount was invested that could
          be credited towards compliance with the capital investment
          requirement described in section 216A(d)(1)(B) of the
          Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1186b(d)(1)(B)),
          such amount shall be subtracted from the amount of capital
          otherwise needed to satisfy the requirement of this clause.
          "(F) Removal of conditional basis if favorable determination.
        - If the Attorney General renders an affirmative determination
        with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (E), and
        if the Attorney General renders a negative determination with
        respect to clause (i) of such subparagraph, the Attorney
        General shall so notify the alien involved and shall remove the
        conditional basis of the alien's status (and that of the
        alien's spouse and children if it was obtained under section
        216A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1186b))

          determination under subparagraph (E), the Attorney General
          shall so notify the alien involved. The notice shall be in
          writing and shall state the factual basis for any adverse
          determination. The Attorney General shall provide the alien
          with an opportunity to submit evidence to rebut any adverse
          determination. If the Attorney General reverses all adverse
          determinations pursuant to such rebuttal, the Attorney
          General shall so notify the alien involved and shall remove
          the conditional basis of the alien's status (and that of the
          alien's spouse and children if it was obtained under section
          216A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1186b))
          effective as of the second anniversary of the continuation,
          under paragraph (1)(F)(ii), of the conditional basis of the
          alien's lawful admission for permanent residence.
            "(ii) Termination if adverse determination. - If the
          eligible alien's rebuttal does not cause the Attorney General
          to reverse each adverse determination under subparagraph (E),

          subject to subsection (d), shall terminate the permanent
          resident status of the alien (and that of the alien's spouse
          and children if it was obtained on a conditional basis under
          section 216A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.
          1186b)).

    resident status is terminated under paragraph (1)(F)(iii) or

    determination in a proceeding to remove the alien. In such
    proceeding, the burden of proof shall be on the Attorney General.
      "(e) Clarification With Respect to Children. - In the case of an
    alien who obtained the status of an alien lawfully admitted for
    permanent residence on a conditional basis before the date of the
    enactment of this Act [Nov. 2, 2002] by virtue of being the child
    of an eligible alien described in subsection (b)(1), the alien

      Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1154(a)(1)(H)) (or any predecessor
      provision), a petition to accord the alien a status under section
      203(b)(5) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(5)) that was approved by

      General revoked the approval of a petition described in
      subsection (b)(1), such revocation shall be disregarded for
      purposes of this section if it was based on a determination that
      the alien failed to satisfy section 203(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the
      Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(5)(A)(ii)).

        that the alien - 
            "(i) failed to satisfy section 203(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the
          Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(5)(A)(ii));

        States if necessary in order to obtain adjustment of status
        under this section.
      "(d) Recordation of Date; Reduction of Numbers. - Upon the
    approval of an application under subsection (a), the Attorney
    General shall record the alien's lawful admission for permanent

      limited partnership and regardless of whether the alien entered
      the enterprise after its formation) in the United States in which
      the alien has made a capital investment at any time.
        "(2) Determination. - In carrying out section 216A(c)(3) of the

    Sec. 1187. Visa waiver program for certain visitors

-STATUTE-
    (a) Establishment of program
      The Attorney General and the Secretary of State are authorized to
    establish a program (hereinafter in this section referred to as the
    "program") under which the requirement of paragraph (7)(B)(i)(II)
    of section 1182(a) of this title may be waived by the Attorney
    General, in consultation with the Secretary of State and in
    accordance with this section, in the case of an alien who meets the
    following requirements:
      (1) Seeking entry as tourist for 90 days or less
        The alien is applying for admission during the program as a
      nonimmigrant visitor (described in section 1101(a)(15)(B) of this
      title) for a period not exceeding 90 days.
      (2) National of program country
        The alien is a national of, and presents a passport issued by,
      a country which - 
          (A) extends (or agrees to extend), either on its own or in
        conjunction with one or more other countries that are described
        in subparagraph (B) and that have established with it a common
        area for immigration admissions, reciprocal privileges to
        citizens and nationals of the United States, and
          (B) is designated as a pilot program country under subsection
        (c) of this section.
      (3) Machine readable passport
        (A) In general
          Except as provided in subparagraph (B), on or after October
        1, 2003, the alien at the time of application for admission is
        in possession of a valid unexpired machine-readable passport
        that satisfies the internationally accepted standard for
        machine readability.
        (B) Limited waiver authority
          For the period beginning October 1, 2003, and ending
        September 30, 2007, the Secretary of State may waive the
        requirement of subparagraph (A) with respect to nationals of a
        program country (as designated under subsection (c) of this
        section), if the Secretary of State finds that the program
        country - 
            (i) is making progress toward ensuring that passports
          meeting the requirement of subparagraph (A) are generally
          available to its nationals; and
            (ii) has taken appropriate measures to protect against
          misuse of passports the country has issued that do not meet
          the requirement of subparagraph (A).

        The alien before the time of such admission completes such
      immigration form as the Attorney General shall establish.
      (5) Entry into the United States
        If arriving by sea or air, the alien arrives at the port of
      entry into the United States on a carrier, including any carrier
      conducting operations under part 135 of title 14, Code of Federal
      Regulations, or a noncommercial aircraft that is owned or
      operated by a domestic corporation conducting operations under
      part 91 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (!1) which has
      entered into an agreement with the Attorney General pursuant to
      subsection (e) of this section. The Attorney General is
      authorized to require a carrier conducting operations under part
      135 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, or a domestic
      corporation conducting operations under part 91 of that title, to
      give suitable and proper bond, in such reasonable amount and
      containing such conditions as the Attorney General may deem
      sufficient to ensure compliance with the indemnification
      requirements of this section, as a term of such an agreement.

      (6) Not a safety threat
        The alien has been determined not to represent a threat to the
      welfare, health, safety, or security of the United States.
      (7) No previous violation
        If the alien previously was admitted without a visa under this
      section, the alien must not have failed to comply with the
      conditions of any previous admission as such a nonimmigrant.
      (8) Round-trip ticket
        The alien is in possession of a round-trip transportation
      ticket (unless this requirement is waived by the Attorney General

      Federal Regulations, or a noncommercial aircraft that is owned or
      operated by a domestic corporation conducting operations under
      part 91 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations).
      (9) Automated system check
        The identity of the alien has been checked using an automated
      electronic database containing information about the
      inadmissibility of aliens to uncover any grounds on which the
      alien may be inadmissible to the United States, and no such
      ground has been found.
      (10) Electronic transmission of identification information
        Operators of aircraft under part 135 of title 14, Code of
      Federal Regulations, or operators of noncommercial aircraft that
      are owned or operated by a domestic corporation conducting
      operations under part 91 of title 14, Code of Federal
      Regulations, carrying any alien passenger who will apply for
      admission under this section shall furnish such information as
      the Attorney General by regulation shall prescribe as necessary
      for the identification of any alien passenger being transported
      and for the enforcement of the immigration laws. Such information
      shall be electronically transmitted not less than one hour prior
      to arrival at the port of entry for purposes of checking for
      inadmissibility using the automated electronic database.
      (11) Eligibility determination under the electronic travel
        authorization system
        Beginning on the date on which the electronic travel
      authorization system developed under subsection (h)(3) is fully
      operational, each alien traveling under the program shall, before
      applying for admission to the United States, electronically
      provide to the system biographical information and such other
      information as the Secretary of Homeland Security shall determine
      necessary to determine the eligibility of, and whether there
      exists a law enforcement or security risk in permitting, the
      alien to travel to the United States. Upon review of such
      biographical information, the Secretary of Homeland Security
      shall determine whether the alien is eligible to travel to the
      United States under the program.
    (b) Waiver of rights
      An alien may not be provided a waiver under the program unless
    the alien has waived any right - 
        (1) to review or appeal under this chapter of an immigration
      officer's determination as to the admissibility of the alien at
      the port of entry into the United States, or
        (2) to contest, other than on the basis of an application for
      asylum, any action for removal of the alien.
    (c) Designation of program countries
      (1) In general
        The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of
      State, may designate any country as a program country if it meets
      the requirements of paragraph (2).
      (2) Qualifications
        Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, a country
      may not be designated as a program country unless the following
      requirements are met:
        (A) Low nonimmigrant visa refusal rate
          Either - 
            (i) the average number of refusals of nonimmigrant visitor
          visas for nationals of that country during - 
              (I) the two previous full fiscal years was less than 2.0
            percent of the total number of nonimmigrant visitor visas
            for nationals of that country which were granted or refused
            during those years; and
              (II) either of such two previous full fiscal years was
            less than 2.5 percent of the total number of nonimmigrant
            visitor visas for nationals of that country which were
            granted or refused during that year; or

            (ii) such refusal rate for nationals of that country during
          the previous full fiscal year was less than 3.0 percent.
        (B) Machine readable passport program
          (i) In general
            Subject to clause (ii), the government of the country

          passports that satisfy the internationally accepted standard
          for machine readability.
          (ii) Deadline for compliance for certain countries
            In the case of a country designated as a program country
          under this subsection prior to May 1, 2000, as a condition on
          the continuation of that designation, the country -

            it has a program to issue machine-readable passports to its
            citizens not later than October 1, 2003; and
              (II) shall satisfy the requirement of clause (i) not
            later than October 1, 2003.
        (C) Law enforcement and security interests
          The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of
        State - 
            (i) evaluates the effect that the country's designation
          would have on the law enforcement and security interests of
          the United States (including the interest in enforcement of
          the immigration laws of the United States and the existence
          and effectiveness of its agreements and procedures for
          extraditing to the United States individuals, including its
          own nationals, who commit crimes that violate United States
          law);

          compromised by the designation of the country; and
            (iii) submits a written report to the Committee on the
          Judiciary and the Committee on International Relations of the
          House of Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary

          includes an explanation of such determination.
        (D) Reporting lost and stolen passports
          The government of the country enters into an agreement with
        the United States to report, or make available through Interpol
        or other means as designated by the Secretary of Homeland
        Security, to the United States Government information about the
        theft or loss of passports within a strict time limit and in a
        manner specified in the agreement.

        whom a final executable order of removal is issued not later
        than three weeks after the issuance of the final order of
        removal. Nothing in this subparagraph creates any duty for the
        United States or any right for any alien with respect to
        removal or release. Nothing in this subparagraph gives rise to
        any cause of action or claim under this paragraph or any other
        law against any official of the United States or of any State
        to compel the release, removal, or consideration for release or
        removal of any alien.
        (F) Passenger information exchange
          The government of the country enters into an agreement with
        the United States to share information regarding whether
        citizens and nationals of that country traveling to the United
        States represent a threat to the security or welfare of the
        United States or its citizens.
      (3) Continuing and subsequent qualifications
        For each fiscal year after the initial period - 
        (A) Continuing qualification
          In the case of a country which was a program country in the
        previous fiscal year, a country may not be designated as a
        program country unless the sum of - 
            (i) the total of the number of nationals of that country
          who were denied admission at the time of arrival or withdrew
          their application for admission during such previous fiscal
          year as a nonimmigrant visitor, and
            (ii) the total number of nationals of that country who were
          admitted as nonimmigrant visitors during such previous fiscal
          year and who violated the terms of such admission,

        was less than 2 percent of the total number of nationals of
        that country who applied for admission as nonimmigrant visitors
        during such previous fiscal year.
        (B) New countries
          In the case of another country, the country may not be
        designated as a program country unless the following
        requirements are met:
          (i) Low nonimmigrant visa refusal rate in previous 2-year
            period
            The average number of refusals of nonimmigrant visitor
          visas for nationals of that country during the two previous
          full fiscal years was less than 2 percent of the total number
          of nonimmigrant visitor visas for nationals of that country
          which were granted or refused during those years.
          (ii) Low nonimmigrant visa refusal rate in each of the 2
            previous years
            The average number of refusals of nonimmigrant visitor
          visas for nationals of that country during either of such two
          previous full fiscal years was less than 2.5 percent of the
          total number of nonimmigrant visitor visas for nationals of
          that country which were granted or refused during that year.
      (4) Initial period
        For purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3), the term "initial
      period" means the period beginning at the end of the 30-day
      period described in subsection (b)(1) of this section and ending
      on the last day of the first fiscal year which begins after such
      30-day period.

              (I) shall evaluate the effect of each program country's
            continued designation on the law enforcement and security
            interests of the United States (including the interest in
            enforcement of the immigration laws of the United States
            and the existence and effectiveness of its agreements and
            procedures for extraditing to the United States
            individuals, including its own nationals, who commit crimes
            that violate United States law);
              (II) shall determine, based upon the evaluation in
            subclause (I), whether any such designation ought to be
            continued or terminated under subsection (d) of this
            section;
              (III) shall submit a written report to the Committee on

            Committee on Homeland Security, of the House of
            Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary, the
            Committee on Foreign Relations, and the Committee on
            Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate
            regarding the continuation or termination of the country's
            designation that includes an explanation of such

            (8).
          (ii) Effective date
            A termination of the designation of a country under this
          subparagraph shall take effect on the date determined by the
          Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the
          Secretary of State.
          (iii) Redesignation
            In the case of a termination under this subparagraph, the
          Secretary of Homeland Security shall redesignate the country
          as a program country, without regard to subsection (f) of
          this section or paragraph (2) or (3), when the Secretary of
          Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of
          State, determines that all causes of the termination have
          been eliminated.
        (B) Emergency termination
          (i) In general
            In the case of a program country in which an emergency
          occurs that the Secretary of Homeland Security, in
          consultation with the Secretary of State, determines
          threatens the law enforcement or security interests of the
          United States (including the interest in enforcement of the
          immigration laws of the United States), the Secretary of
          Homeland Security shall immediately terminate the designation
          of the country as a program country.
          (ii) Definition
            For purposes of clause (i), the term "emergency" means - 
              (I) the overthrow of a democratically elected government;
              (II) war (including undeclared war, civil war, or other

            significant portion of the program country's territory;
              (IV) a severe economic collapse in the program country;
            or
              (V) any other extraordinary event in the program country
            that threatens the law enforcement or security interests of
            the United States (including the interest in enforcement of
            the immigration laws of the United States) and where the
            country's participation in the program could contribute to
            that threat.
          (iii) Redesignation
            The Secretary of Homeland Security may redesignate the
          country as a program country, without regard to subsection
          (f) of this section or paragraph (2) or (3), when the
          Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the
          Secretary of State, determines that - 
              (I) at least 6 months have elapsed since the effective
            date of the termination;
              (II) the emergency that caused the termination has ended;
            and
              (III) the average number of refusals of nonimmigrant
            visitor visas for nationals of that country during the
            period of termination under this subparagraph was less than
            3.0 percent of the total number of nonimmigrant visitor
            visas for nationals of that country which were granted or
            refused during such period.
          (iv) Program suspension authority
            The Director of National Intelligence shall immediately
          inform the Secretary of Homeland Security of any current and
          credible threat which poses an imminent danger to the United
          States or its citizens and originates from a country
          participating in the visa waiver program. Upon receiving such
          notification, the Secretary, in consultation with the
          Secretary of State - 
              (I) may suspend a country from the visa waiver program
            without prior notice;
              (II) shall notify any country suspended under subclause
            (I) and, to the extent practicable without disclosing
            sensitive intelligence sources and methods, provide
            justification for the suspension; and
              (III) shall restore the suspended country's participation
            in the visa waiver program upon a determination that the
            threat no longer poses an imminent danger to the United
            States or its citizens.
        (C) Treatment of nationals after termination
          For purposes of this paragraph - 
            (i) nationals of a country whose designation is terminated
          under subparagraph (A) or (B) shall remain eligible for a
          waiver under subsection (a) of this section until the
          effective date of such termination; and
            (ii) a waiver under this section that is provided to such a
          national for a period described in subsection (a)(1) of this
          section shall not, by such termination, be deemed to have
          been rescinded or otherwise rendered invalid, if the waiver
          is granted prior to such termination.
      (6) Computation of visa refusal rates
        For purposes of determining the eligibility of a country to be
      designated as a program country, the calculation of visa refusal
      rates shall not include any visa refusals which incorporate any
      procedures based on, or are otherwise based on, race, sex, or
      disability, unless otherwise specifically authorized by law or
      regulation. No court shall have jurisdiction under this paragraph
      to review any visa refusal, the denial of admission to the United
      States of any alien by the Attorney General, the Secretary's
      computation of the visa refusal rate, or the designation or
      nondesignation of any country.

          In refusing the application of nationals of a program country
        for United States visas, or the applications of nationals of a
        country seeking entry into the visa waiver program, a consular
        officer shall not knowingly or intentionally classify the
        refusal of the visa under a category that is not included in
        the calculation of the visa refusal rate only so that the
        percentage of that country's visa refusals is less than the
        percentage limitation applicable to qualification for
        participation in the visa waiver program.

          Not later than May 1 of each year, the United States chief of
        mission, acting or permanent, to each country under
        consideration for inclusion in the visa waiver program shall

        the Secretary of State shall provide all of the information
        described in subparagraph (B) to the Attorney General.

          foreign nationals who exit through airports of the United
          States and the electronic travel authorization system
          required under subsection (h)(3) is fully operational, the

          After certification by the Secretary under subparagraph (A),
        the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, may

          United States;
            (iii) there has been a sustained reduction in the rate of

          United States on counterterrorism initiatives, information
          sharing, and preventing terrorist travel before the date of
          its designation as a program country, and the Secretary of
          Homeland Security and the Secretary of State determine that

          previous full fiscal year does not exceed the maximum visa
          overstay rate, once such rate is established under

            The Secretary of Homeland Security shall on the same date
          submit to Congress and publish in the Federal Register
          information relating to the maximum visa overstay rate

        cooperation with the United States' initiatives toward
        combating terrorism and the country's cooperation with the
        United States intelligence community in sharing information
        regarding terrorist threats.
      (10) Technical assistance
        The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the
      Secretary of State, shall provide technical assistance to program
      countries to assist those countries in meeting the requirements
      under this section. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall
      ensure that the program office within the Department of Homeland
      Security is adequately staffed and has resources to be able to
      provide such technical assistance, in addition to its duties to
      effectively monitor compliance of the countries participating in

        shall place the program country in probationary status for a
        period not to exceed 2 full fiscal years following the year in
        which the determination under subparagraph (A) is made.

        program as required by section (!3) (c)(2)(C) of this section,
        or has a disqualification rate of 2 percent or more, the
        Attorney General shall terminate the designation of the country
        as a program country. If the Attorney General determines that
        the program country has developed a machine-readable passport
        program and has a disqualification rate of less than 2 percent,
        the Attorney General shall redesignate the country as a program

          (A) the total number of nationals of the program country who
        were - 
            (i) denied admission at the time of arrival or withdrew

          year and who violated the terms of such admission; bears to

          (B) the total number of nationals of such country who applied
        for admission as nonimmigrant visitors during such fiscal year.
      (5) Failure to report passport thefts
        If the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of
      State jointly determine that the program country is not reporting
      the theft or loss of passports, as required by subsection

      shall terminate the designation of the country as a program
      country.
    (g) Visa application sole method to dispute denial of waiver based
      on a ground of inadmissibility
      In the case of an alien denied a waiver under the program by
    reason of a ground of inadmissibility described in section 1182(a)
    of this title that is discovered at the time of the alien's
    application for the waiver or through the use of an automated
    electronic database required under subsection (a)(9) of this
    section, the alien may apply for a visa at an appropriate consular
    office outside the United States. There shall be no other means of
    administrative or judicial review of such a denial, and no court or
    person otherwise shall have jurisdiction to consider any claim
    attacking the validity of such a denial.
    (h) Use of information technology systems
      (1) Automated entry-exit control system
        (A) System

        develop and implement a fully automated entry and exit control
        system that will collect a record of arrival and departure for
        every alien who arrives and departs by sea or air at a port of
        entry into the United States and is provided a waiver under the
        program.
        (B) Requirements

          departure described in subparagraph (A) shall be based, to
          the maximum extent practicable, on passenger data collected
          and electronically transmitted to the automated entry and
          exit control system by each carrier that has an agreement
          under subsection (a)(4) of this section.
          (ii) Data provision by carriers

          under this section to an alien arriving by sea or air at a
          port of entry into the United States on a carrier unless the
          carrier is electronically transmitting to the automated entry
          and exit control system passenger data determined by the
          Attorney General to be sufficient to permit the Attorney
          General to carry out this paragraph.
          (iii) Calculation
            The system shall contain sufficient data to permit the
          Attorney General to calculate, for each program country and

          who are described in subparagraph (A) and for whom no record
          of departure exists, expressed as a percentage of the total
          number of such nationals who are so described.

          include a section containing the calculation described in
          subparagraph (B)(iii) for each program country for the
          previous fiscal year, together with an analysis of that
          information.

        automated electronic travel authorization system (referred to
        in this paragraph as the "System") to collect such biographical
        and other information as the Secretary of Homeland Security
        determines necessary to determine, in advance of travel, the
        eligibility of, and whether there exists a law enforcement or
        security risk in permitting, the (!4) alien to travel to the
        United States.

          an alien who applied for authorization to travel to the
          United States through the System is not eligible to travel
          under the program is not a determination of eligibility for a

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1188. Admission of temporary H-2A workers

-STATUTE-
    (a) Conditions for approval of H-2A petitions
      (1) A petition to import an alien as an H-2A worker (as defined
    in subsection (i)(2) of this section) may not be approved by the
    Attorney General unless the petitioner has applied to the Secretary
    of Labor for a certification that - 
        (A) there are not sufficient workers who are able, willing, and
      qualified, and who will be available at the time and place
      needed, to perform the labor or services involved in the
      petition, and
        (B) the employment of the alien in such labor or services will
      not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers
      in the United States similarly employed.

      (2) The Secretary of Labor may require by regulation, as a
    condition of issuing the certification, the payment of a fee to
    recover the reasonable costs of processing applications for
    certification.
    (b) Conditions for denial of labor certification
      The Secretary of Labor may not issue a certification under
    subsection (a) of this section with respect to an employer if the
    conditions described in that subsection are not met or if any of
    the following conditions are met:
        (1) There is a strike or lockout in the course of a labor
      dispute which, under the regulations, precludes such
      certification.
        (2)(A) The employer during the previous two-year period
      employed H-2A workers and the Secretary of Labor has determined,
      after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that the employer at
      any time during that period substantially violated a material
      term or condition of the labor certification with respect to the
      employment of domestic or nonimmigrant workers.
        (B) No employer may be denied certification under subparagraph
      (A) for more than three years for any violation described in such
      subparagraph.
        (3) The employer has not provided the Secretary with
      satisfactory assurances that if the employment for which the
      certification is sought is not covered by State workers'
      compensation law, the employer will provide, at no cost to the
      worker, insurance covering injury and disease arising out of and
      in the course of the worker's employment which will provide
      benefits at least equal to those provided under the State
      workers' compensation law for comparable employment.
        (4) The Secretary determines that the employer has not made
      positive recruitment efforts within a multi-state region of
      traditional or expected labor supply where the Secretary finds
      that there are a significant number of qualified United States
      workers who, if recruited, would be willing to make themselves
      available for work at the time and place needed. Positive
      recruitment under this paragraph is in addition to, and shall be
      conducted within the same time period as, the circulation through
      the interstate employment service system of the employer's job
      offer. The obligation to engage in positive recruitment under
      this paragraph shall terminate on the date the H-2A workers
      depart for the employer's place of employment.
    (c) Special rules for consideration of applications
      The following rules shall apply in the case of the filing and
    consideration of an application for a labor certification under
    this section:
      (1) Deadline for filing applications
        The Secretary of Labor may not require that the application be
      filed more than 45 days before the first date the employer
      requires the labor or services of the H-2A worker.
      (2) Notice within seven days of deficiencies
        (A) The employer shall be notified in writing within seven days
      of the date of filing if the application does not meet the
      standards (other than that described in subsection (a)(1)(A) of
      this section) for approval.
        (B) If the application does not meet such standards, the notice
      shall include the reasons therefor and the Secretary shall
      provide an opportunity for the prompt resubmission of a modified
      application.
      (3) Issuance of certification
        (A) The Secretary of Labor shall make, not later than 30 days
      before the date such labor or services are first required to be
      performed, the certification described in subsection (a)(1) of
      this section if - 
          (i) the employer has complied with the criteria for
        certification (including criteria for the recruitment of
        eligible individuals as prescribed by the Secretary), and
          (ii) the employer does not actually have, or has not been
        provided with referrals of, qualified eligible individuals who
        have indicated their availability to perform such labor or
        services on the terms and conditions of a job offer which meets
        the requirements of the Secretary.

      In considering the question of whether a specific qualification
      is appropriate in a job offer, the Secretary shall apply the
      normal and accepted qualifications required by non-H-2A-employers
      in the same or comparable occupations and crops.
        (B)(i) For a period of 3 years subsequent to the effective date
      of this section, labor certifications shall remain effective only
      if, from the time the foreign worker departs for the employer's
      place of employment, the employer will provide employment to any
      qualified United States worker who applies to the employer until
      50 percent of the period of the work contract, under which the
      foreign worker who is in the job was hired, has elapsed. In
      addition, the employer will offer to provide benefits, wages and
      working conditions required pursuant to this section and
      regulations.
        (ii) The requirement of clause (i) shall not apply to any
      employer who - 
          (I) did not, during any calendar quarter during the preceding
        calendar year, use more than 500 man-days of agricultural
        labor, as defined in section 203(u) of title 29,
          (II) is not a member of an association which has petitioned
        for certification under this section for its members, and
          (III) has not otherwise associated with other employers who
        are petitioning for temporary foreign workers under this
        section.

        (iii) Six months before the end of the 3-year period described
      in clause (i), the Secretary of Labor shall consider the findings
      of the report mandated by section 403(a)(4)(D) of the Immigration
      Reform and Control Act of 1986 as well as other relevant
      materials, including evidence of benefits to United States
      workers and costs to employers, addressing the advisability of
      continuing a policy which requires an employer, as a condition
      for certification under this section, to continue to accept
      qualified, eligible United States workers for employment after
      the date the H-2A workers depart for work with the employer. The
      Secretary's review of such findings and materials shall lead to
      the issuance of findings in furtherance of the Congressional
      policy that aliens not be admitted under this section unless
      there are not sufficient workers in the United States who are
      able, willing, and qualified to perform the labor or service
      needed and that the employment of the aliens in such labor or
      services will not adversely affect the wages and working
      conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed. In
      the absence of the enactment of Federal legislation prior to
      three months before the end of the 3-year period described in
      clause (i) which addresses the subject matter of this
      subparagraph, the Secretary shall immediately publish the
      findings required by this clause, and shall promulgate, on an
      interim or final basis, regulations based on his findings which
      shall be effective no later than three years from the effective
      date of this section.
        (iv) In complying with clause (i) of this subparagraph, an
      association shall be allowed to refer or transfer workers among
      its members: Provided, That for purposes of this section an
      association acting as an agent for its members shall not be
      considered a joint employer merely because of such referral or
      transfer.
        (v) United States workers referred or transferred pursuant to
      clause (iv) of this subparagraph shall not be treated
      disparately.
        (vi) An employer shall not be liable for payments under section
      655.202(b)(6) of title 20, Code of Federal Regulations (or any
      successor regulation) with respect to an H-2A worker who is
      displaced due to compliance with the requirement of this
      subparagraph, if the Secretary of Labor certifies that the H-2A
      worker was displaced because of the employer's compliance with
      clause (i) of this subparagraph.
        (vii)(I) No person or entity shall willfully and knowingly
      withhold domestic workers prior to the arrival of H-2A workers in
      order to force the hiring of domestic workers under clause (i).
        (II) Upon the receipt of a complaint by an employer that a
      violation of subclause (I) has occurred the Secretary shall
      immediately investigate. He shall within 36 hours of the receipt
      of the complaint issue findings concerning the alleged violation.
      Where the Secretary finds that a violation has occurred, he shall
      immediately suspend the application of clause (i) of this
      subparagraph with respect to that certification for that date of
      need.
      (4) Housing
        Employers shall furnish housing in accordance with regulations.
      The employer shall be permitted at the employer's option to
      provide housing meeting applicable Federal standards for
      temporary labor camps or to secure housing which meets the local
      standards for rental and/or public accommodations or other
      substantially similar class of habitation: Provided, That in the
      absence of applicable local standards, State standards for rental
      and/or public accommodations or other substantially similar class
      of habitation shall be met: Provided further, That in the absence
      of applicable local or State standards, Federal temporary labor
      camp standards shall apply: Provided further, That the Secretary
      of Labor shall issue regulations which address the specific
      requirements of housing for employees principally engaged in the
      range production of livestock: Provided further, That when it is
      the prevailing practice in the area and occupation of intended
      employment to provide family housing, family housing shall be
      provided to workers with families who request it: And provided
      further, That nothing in this paragraph shall require an employer
      to provide or secure housing for workers who are not entitled to
      it under the temporary labor certification regulations in effect
      on June 1, 1986. The determination as to whether the housing
      furnished by an employer for an H-2A worker meets the
      requirements imposed by this paragraph must be made prior to the
      date specified in paragraph (3)(A) by which the Secretary of
      Labor is required to make a certification described in subsection
      (a)(1) of this section with respect to a petition for the
      importation of such worker.
    (d) Roles of agricultural associations
      (1) Permitting filing by agricultural associations
        A petition to import an alien as a temporary agricultural
      worker, and an application for a labor certification with respect
      to such a worker, may be filed by an association of agricultural
      producers which use agricultural services.
      (2) Treatment of associations acting as employers
        If an association is a joint or sole employer of temporary
      agricultural workers, the certifications granted under this
      section to the association may be used for the certified job
      opportunities of any of its producer members and such workers may
      be transferred among its producer members to perform agricultural
      services of a temporary or seasonal nature for which the
      certifications were granted.
      (3) Treatment of violations
        (A) Member's violation does not necessarily disqualify
          association or other members
          If an individual producer member of a joint employer
        association is determined to have committed an act that under
        subsection (b)(2) of this section results in the denial of
        certification with respect to the member, the denial shall
        apply only to that member of the association unless the
        Secretary determines that the association or other member
        participated in, had knowledge of, or reason to know of, the
        violation.
        (B) Association's violation does not necessarily disqualify
          members
          (i) If an association representing agricultural producers as
        a joint employer is determined to have committed an act that
        under subsection (b)(2) of this section results in the denial
        of certification with respect to the association, the denial
        shall apply only to the association and does not apply to any
        individual producer member of the association unless the
        Secretary determines that the member participated in, had
        knowledge of, or reason to know of, the violation.
          (ii) If an association of agricultural producers certified as
        a sole employer is determined to have committed an act that
        under subsection (b)(2) of this section results in the denial
        of certification with respect to the association, no individual
        producer member of such association may be the beneficiary of
        the services of temporary alien agricultural workers admitted
        under this section in the commodity and occupation in which
        such aliens were employed by the association which was denied
        certification during the period such denial is in force, unless
        such producer member employs such aliens in the commodity and
        occupation in question directly or through an association which
        is a joint employer of such workers with the producer member.
    (e) Expedited administrative appeals of certain determinations
      (1) Regulations shall provide for an expedited procedure for the
    review of a denial of certification under subsection (a)(1) of this
    section or a revocation of such a certification or, at the
    applicant's request, for a de novo administrative hearing
    respecting the denial or revocation.
      (2) The Secretary of Labor shall expeditiously, but in no case
    later than 72 hours after the time a new determination is
    requested, make a new determination on the request for
    certification in the case of an H-2A worker if able, willing, and
    qualified eligible individuals are not actually available at the
    time such labor or services are required and a certification was
    denied in whole or in part because of the availability of qualified
    workers. If the employer asserts that any eligible individual who
    has been referred is not able, willing, or qualified, the burden of
    proof is on the employer to establish that the individual referred
    is not able, willing, or qualified because of employment-related
    reasons.
    (f) Violators disqualified for 5 years
      An alien may not be admitted to the United States as a temporary
    agricultural worker if the alien was admitted to the United States
    as such a worker within the previous five-year period and the alien
    during that period violated a term or condition of such previous
    admission.
    (g) Authorization of appropriations
      (1) There are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year,
    beginning with fiscal year 1987, $10,000,000 for the purposes -

      services which might otherwise be performed by nonimmigrants
      described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of this title, and
        (B) of monitoring terms and conditions under which such
      nonimmigrants (and domestic workers employed by the same
      employers) are employed in the United States.

      (2) The Secretary of Labor is authorized to take such actions,
    including imposing appropriate penalties and seeking appropriate
    injunctive relief and specific performance of contractual
    obligations, as may be necessary to assure employer compliance with
    terms and conditions of employment under this section.
      (3) There are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year,
    beginning with fiscal year 1987, such sums as may be necessary for
    the purpose of enabling the Secretary of Labor to make
    determinations and certifications under this section and under
    section 1182(a)(5)(A)(i) of this title.
      (4) There are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year,
    beginning with fiscal year 1987, such sums as may be necessary for
    the purposes of enabling the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out
    the Secretary's duties and responsibilities under this section.
    (h) Miscellaneous provisions
      (1) The Attorney General shall provide for such endorsement of
    entry and exit documents of nonimmigrants described in section
    1101(a)(15)(H)(ii) of this title as may be necessary to carry out
    this section and to provide notice for purposes of section 1324a of
    this title.
      (2) The provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of section 1184 of
    this title and the provisions of this section preempt any State or
    local law regulating admissibility of nonimmigrant workers.
    (i) Definitions

      employment, an individual who is not an unauthorized alien (as
      defined in section 1324a(h)(3) of this title) with respect to
      that employment.

            (i) the circumstances that were the basis for the
          designation have changed in such a manner as to warrant
          revocation; or
            (ii) the national security of the United States warrants a
          revocation.
        (B) Procedure
          The procedural requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) shall
        apply to a revocation under this paragraph. Any revocation
        shall take effect on the date specified in the revocation or
        upon publication in the Federal Register if no effective date
        is specified.
      (7) Effect of revocation

      shall not affect any action or proceeding based on conduct
      committed prior to the effective date of such revocation.
      (8) Use of designation in trial or hearing
        If a designation under this subsection has become effective
      under paragraph (2)(B) a defendant in a criminal action or an
      alien in a removal proceeding shall not be permitted to raise any
      question concerning the validity of the issuance of such
      designation as a defense or an objection at any trial or hearing.
    (b) Amendments to a designation
      (1) In general
        The Secretary may amend a designation under this subsection if
      the Secretary finds that the organization has changed its name,
      adopted a new alias, dissolved and then reconstituted itself
      under a different name or names, or merged with another
      organization.
      (2) Procedure
        Amendments made to a designation in accordance with paragraph
      (1) shall be effective upon publication in the Federal Register.
      Subparagraphs (B) and (C) of subsection (a)(2) of this section
      shall apply to an amended designation upon such publication.
      Paragraphs (2)(A)(i), (4), (5), (6), (7), and (8) of subsection
      (a) of this section shall also apply to an amended designation.
      (3) Administrative record
        The administrative record shall be corrected to include the
      amendments as well as any additional relevant information that
      supports those amendments.
      (4) Classified information
        The Secretary may consider classified information in amending a
      designation in accordance with this subsection. Classified
      information shall not be subject to disclosure for such time as
      it remains classified, except that such information may be
      disclosed to a court ex parte and in camera for purposes of
      judicial review under subsection (c) of this section.
    (c) Judicial review of designation
      (1) In general
        Not later than 30 days after publication in the Federal
      Register of a designation, an amended designation, or a
      determination in response to a petition for revocation, the
      designated organization may seek judicial review in the United
      States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
      (2) Basis of review
        Review under this subsection shall be based solely upon the
      administrative record, except that the Government may submit, for
      ex parte and in camera review, classified information used in
      making the designation, amended designation, or determination in
      response to a petition for revocation.
      (3) Scope of review
        The Court shall hold unlawful and set aside a designation,
      amended designation, or determination in response to a petition
      for revocation the court finds to be - 
          (A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or
        otherwise not in accordance with law;
          (B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or
        immunity;
          (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or
        limitation, or short of statutory right;
          (D) lacking substantial support in the administrative record
        taken as a whole or in classified information submitted to the
        court under paragraph (2),(!2) or

          (E) not in accord with the procedures required by law.
      (4) Judicial review invoked
        The pendency of an action for judicial review of a designation,
      amended designation, or determination in response to a petition
      for revocation shall not affect the application of this section,
      unless the court issues a final order setting aside the
      designation, amended designation, or determination in response to
      a petition for revocation.

    Sec. 1201. Issuance of visas

-STATUTE-
    (a) Immigrants; nonimmigrants
      (1) Under the conditions hereinafter prescribed and subject to
    the limitations prescribed in this chapter or regulations issued
    thereunder, a consular officer may issue
        (A) to an immigrant who has made proper application therefor,
      an immigrant visa which shall consist of the application provided
      for in section 1202 of this title, visaed by such consular
      officer, and shall specify the foreign state, if any, to which
      the immigrant is charged, the immigrant's particular status under
      such foreign state, the preference, immediate relative, or
      special immigrant classification to which the alien is charged,
      the date on which the validity of the visa shall expire, and such
      additional information as may be required; and
        (B) to a nonimmigrant who has made proper application therefor,
      a nonimmigrant visa, which shall specify the classification under
      section 1101(a)(15) of this title of the nonimmigrant, the period
      during which the nonimmigrant visa shall be valid, and such
      additional information as may be required.

      (2) The Secretary of State shall provide to the Service an
    electronic version of the visa file of each alien who has been
    issued a visa to ensure that the data in that visa file is
    available to immigration inspectors at the United States ports of
    entry before the arrival of the alien at such a port of entry.
    (b) Registration; photographs; waiver of requirement
      Each alien who applies for a visa shall be registered in
    connection with his application, and shall furnish copies of his
    photograph signed by him for such use as may be by regulations
    required. The requirements of this subsection may be waived in the
    discretion of the Secretary of State in the case of any alien who
    is within that class of nonimmigrants enumerated in sections
    1101(a)(15)(A), and 1101(a)(15)(G) of this title, or in the case of
    any alien who is granted a diplomatic visa on a diplomatic passport
    or on the equivalent thereof.
    (c) Period of validity; requirement of visa
      An immigrant visa shall be valid for such period, not exceeding
    six months, as shall be by regulations prescribed, except that any
    visa issued to a child lawfully adopted by a United States citizen
    and spouse while such citizen is serving abroad in the United
    States Armed Forces, or is employed abroad by the United States
    Government, or is temporarily abroad on business, shall be valid
    until such time, for a period not to exceed three years, as the
    adoptive citizen parent returns to the United States in due course
    of his service, employment, or business. A nonimmigrant visa shall
    be valid for such periods as shall be by regulations prescribed. In
    prescribing the period of validity of a nonimmigrant visa in the
    case of nationals of any foreign country who are eligible for such
    visas, the Secretary of State shall, insofar as practicable, accord
    to such nationals the same treatment upon a reciprocal basis as
    such foreign country accords to nationals of the United States who
    are within a similar class; except that in the case of aliens who
    are nationals of a foreign country and who either are granted
    refugee status and firmly resettled in another foreign country or
    are granted permanent residence and residing in another foreign
    country, the Secretary of State may prescribe the period of
    validity of such a visa based upon the treatment granted by that
    other foreign country to alien refugees and permanent residents,
    respectively, in the United States. An immigrant visa may be
    replaced under the original number during the fiscal year in which
    the original visa was issued for an immigrant who establishes to
    the satisfaction of the consular officer that he was unable to use
    the original immigrant visa during the period of its validity
    because of reasons beyond his control and for which he was not
    responsible: Provided, That the immigrant is found by the consular
    officer to be eligible for an immigrant visa and the immigrant pays
    again the statutory fees for an application and an immigrant visa.
    (d) Physical examination
      Prior to the issuance of an immigrant visa to any alien, the
    consular officer shall require such alien to submit to a physical
    and mental examination in accordance with such regulations as may
    be prescribed. Prior to the issuance of a nonimmigrant visa to any
    alien, the consular officer may require such alien to submit to a
    physical or mental examination, or both, if in his opinion such
    examination is necessary to ascertain whether such alien is
    eligible to receive a visa.
    (e) Surrender of visa
      Each immigrant shall surrender his immigrant visa to the
    immigration officer at the port of entry, who shall endorse on the
    visa the date and the port of arrival, the identity of the vessel
    or other means of transportation by which the immigrant arrived,
    and such other endorsements as may be by regulations required.
    (f) Surrender of documents
      Each nonimmigrant shall present or surrender to the immigration
    officer at the port of entry such documents as may be by regulation
    required. In the case of an alien crewman not in possession of any
    individual documents other than a passport and until such time as
    it becomes practicable to issue individual documents, such alien
    crewman may be admitted, subject to the provisions of this part, if
    his name appears in the crew list of the vessel or aircraft on
    which he arrives and the crew list is visaed by a consular officer,
    but the consular officer shall have the right to deny admission to
    any alien crewman from the crew list visa.
    (g) Nonissuance of visas or other documents
      No visa or other documentation shall be issued to an alien if (1)
    it appears to the consular officer, from statements in the
    application, or in the papers submitted therewith, that such alien
    is ineligible to receive a visa or such other documentation under
    section 1182 of this title, or any other provision of law, (2) the
    application fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter, or
    the regulations issued thereunder, or (3) the consular officer
    knows or has reason to believe that such alien is ineligible to
    receive a visa or such other documentation under section 1182 of
    this title, or any other provision of law: Provided, That a visa or
    other documentation may be issued to an alien who is within the
    purview of section 1182(a)(4) of this title, if such alien is
    otherwise entitled to receive a visa or other documentation, upon
    receipt of notice by the consular officer from the Attorney General
    of the giving of a bond or undertaking providing indemnity as in
    the case of aliens admitted under section 1183 of this title:
    Provided further, That a visa may be issued to an alien defined in
    section 1101(a)(15)(B) or (F) of this title, if such alien is
    otherwise entitled to receive a visa, upon receipt of a notice by
    the consular officer from the Attorney General of the giving of a
    bond with sufficient surety in such sum and containing such
    conditions as the consular officer shall prescribe, to insure that
    at the expiration of the time for which such alien has been
    admitted by the Attorney General, as provided in section 1184(a) of
    this title, or upon failure to maintain the status under which he
    was admitted, or to maintain any status subsequently acquired under
    section 1258 of this title, such alien will depart from the United
    States.
    (h) Nonadmission upon arrival
      Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to entitle any alien,
    to whom a visa or other documentation has been issued, to be
    admitted (!1) the United States, if, upon arrival at a port of
    entry in the United States, he is found to be inadmissible under
    this chapter, or any other provision of law. The substance of this
    subsection shall appear upon every visa application.

    (i) Revocation of visas or documents
      After the issuance of a visa or other documentation to any alien,
    the consular officer or the Secretary of State may at any time, in
    his discretion, revoke such visa or other documentation. Notice of
    such revocation shall be communicated to the Attorney General, and
    such revocation shall invalidate the visa or other documentation
    from the date of issuance: Provided, That carriers or
    transportation companies, and masters, commanding officers, agents,
    owners, charterers, or consignees, shall not be penalized under
    section 1323(b) of this title for action taken in reliance on such
    visas or other documentation, unless they received due notice of
    such revocation prior to the alien's embarkation. There shall be no
    means of judicial review (including review pursuant to section 2241
    of title 28 or any other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361
    and 1651 of such title) of a revocation under this subsection,
    except in the context of a removal proceeding if such revocation
    provides the sole ground for removal under section 1227(a)(1)(B) of
    this title.

    Sec. 1202. Application for visas

-STATUTE-
    (a) Immigrant visas
      Every alien applying for an immigrant visa and for alien
    registration shall make application therefor in such form and
    manner and at such place as shall be by regulations prescribed. In
    the application the alien shall state his full and true name, and
    any other name which he has used or by which he has been known; age
    and sex; the date and place of his birth; and such additional
    information necessary to the identification of the applicant and
    the enforcement of the immigration and nationality laws as may be
    by regulations prescribed.
    (b) Other documentary evidence for immigrant visa
      Every alien applying for an immigrant visa shall present a valid
    unexpired passport or other suitable travel document, or document
    of identity and nationality, if such document is required under the
    regulations issued by the Secretary of State. The immigrant shall
    furnish to the consular officer with his application a copy of a
    certification by the appropriate police authorities stating what
    their records show concerning the immigrant; a certified copy of
    any existing prison record, military record, and record of his
    birth; and a certified copy of all other records or documents
    concerning him or his case which may be required by the consular
    officer. The copy of each document so furnished shall be
    permanently attached to the application and become a part thereof.
    In the event that the immigrant establishes to the satisfaction of
    the consular officer that any document or record required by this
    subsection is unobtainable, the consular officer may permit the
    immigrant to submit in lieu of such document or record other
    satisfactory evidence of the fact to which such document or record
    would, if obtainable, pertain. All immigrant visa applications
    shall be reviewed and adjudicated by a consular officer.
    (c) Nonimmigrant visas; nonimmigrant registration; form, manner and
      contents of application
      Every alien applying for a nonimmigrant visa and for alien
    registration shall make application therefor in such form and
    manner as shall be by regulations prescribed. In the application
    the alien shall state his full and true name, the date and place of
    birth, his nationality, the purpose and length of his intended stay
    in the United States; his marital status; and such additional
    information necessary to the identification of the applicant, the
    determination of his eligibility for a nonimmigrant visa, and the
    enforcement of the immigration and nationality laws as may be by
    regulations prescribed. The alien shall provide complete and
    accurate information in response to any request for information
    contained in the application. At the discretion of the Secretary of
    State, application forms for the various classes of nonimmigrant
    admissions described in section 1101(a)(15) of this title may vary
    according to the class of visa being requested.
    (d) Other documentary evidence for nonimmigrant visa
      Every alien applying for a nonimmigrant visa and alien
    registration shall furnish to the consular officer, with his
    application, a certified copy of such documents pertaining to him
    as may be by regulations required. All nonimmigrant visa
    applications shall be reviewed and adjudicated by a consular
    officer.
    (e) Signing and verification of application
      Except as may be otherwise prescribed by regulations, each
    application for an immigrant visa shall be signed by the applicant
    in the presence of the consular officer, and verified by the oath
    of the applicant administered by the consular officer. The
    application for an immigrant visa, when visaed by the consular
    officer, shall become the immigrant visa. The application for a
    nonimmigrant visa or other documentation as a nonimmigrant shall be
    disposed of as may be by regulations prescribed. The issuance of a
    nonimmigrant visa shall, except as may be otherwise by regulations
    prescribed, be evidenced by a stamp, or other (!1) placed in the
    alien's passport.

    (f) Confidential nature of records
      The records of the Department of State and of diplomatic and
    consular offices of the United States pertaining to the issuance or
    refusal of visas or permits to enter the United States shall be
    considered confidential and shall be used only for the formulation,
    amendment, administration, or enforcement of the immigration,
    nationality, and other laws of the United States, except that - 
        (1) in the discretion of the Secretary of State certified
      copies of such records may be made available to a court which
      certifies that the information contained in such records is
      needed by the court in the interest of the ends of justice in a
      case pending before the court.(!2)

        (2) the Secretary of State, in the Secretary's discretion and
      on the basis of reciprocity, may provide to a foreign government
      information in the Department of State's computerized visa
      lookout database and, when necessary and appropriate, other
      records covered by this section related to information in the
      database - 
          (A) with regard to individual aliens, at any time on a case-
        by-case basis for the purpose of preventing, investigating, or
        punishing acts that would constitute a crime in the United
        States, including, but not limited to, terrorism or trafficking
        in controlled substances, persons, or illicit weapons; or
          (B) with regard to any or all aliens in the database,
        pursuant to such conditions as the Secretary of State shall
        establish in an agreement with the foreign government in which
        that government agrees to use such information and records for
        the purposes described in subparagraph (A) or to deny visas to
        persons who would be inadmissible to the United States.
    (g) Nonimmigrant visa void at conclusion of authorized period of
      stay
      (1) In the case of an alien who has been admitted on the basis of
    a nonimmigrant visa and remained in the United States beyond the
    period of stay authorized by the Attorney General, such visa shall
    be void beginning after the conclusion of such period of stay.
      (2) An alien described in paragraph (1) shall be ineligible to be
    readmitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant, except - 
        (A) on the basis of a visa (other than the visa described in
      paragraph (1)) issued in a consular office located in the country
      of the alien's nationality (or, if there is no office in such
      country, in such other consular office as the Secretary of State
      shall specify); or
        (B) where extraordinary circumstances are found by the
      Secretary of State to exist.
    (h) In person interview with consular officer
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the
    Secretary of State shall require every alien applying for a
    nonimmigrant visa - 
        (1) who is at least 14 years of age and not more than 79 years
      of age to submit to an in person interview with a consular
      officer unless the requirement for such interview is waived - 
          (A) by a consular official and such alien is - 
            (i) within that class of nonimmigrants enumerated in
          subparagraph (A) or (G) of section 1101(a)(15) of this title;

            (iii) within that class of nonimmigrants enumerated in
          section 1101(a)(15)(C)(iii) (!3) of this title (referred to
          as the "C-3 visa" category); or

            (iv) granted a diplomatic or official visa on a diplomatic
          or official passport or on the equivalent thereof;

          (B) by a consular official and such alien is applying for a

            (iv) the consular officer has no indication that such alien
          has not complied with the immigration laws and regulations of
          the United States; or

          (C) by the Secretary of State if the Secretary determines
        that such waiver is - 
            (i) in the national interest of the United States; or
            (ii) necessary as a result of unusual or emergent
          circumstances; and

        (2) notwithstanding paragraph (1), to submit to an in person
      interview with a consular officer if such alien - 
          (A) is not a national or resident of the country in which

    6 of section 3 of the Immigration Act of 1924, between July 1,
    1924, and July 5, 1932, both dates inclusive, who intends to depart
    temporarily from the United States may make application to the
    Attorney General for a permit to reenter the United States, stating
    the length of his intended absence or absences, and the reasons
    therefor. Such applications shall be made under oath, and shall be
    in such form, contain such information, and be accompanied by such
    photographs of the applicant as may be by regulations prescribed.
    (b) Issuance of permit; nonrenewability
      If the Attorney General finds (1) that the applicant under
    subsection (a)(1) of this section has been lawfully admitted to the
    United States for permanent residence, or that the applicant under
    subsection (a)(2) of this section has since admission maintained
    the status required of him at the time of his admission and such
    applicant desires to visit abroad and to return to the United
    States to resume the status existing at the time of his departure
    for such visit, (2) that the application is made in good faith, and
    (3) that the alien's proposed departure from the United States
    would not be contrary to the interests of the United States, the
    Attorney General may, in his discretion, issue the permit, which
    shall be valid for not more than two years from the date of
    issuance and shall not be renewable. The permit shall be in such
    form as shall be by regulations prescribed for the complete
    identification of the alien.
    (c) Multiple reentries
      During the period of validity, such permit may be used by the
    alien in making one or more applications for reentry into the
    United States.

      Upon the return of the alien to the United States the permit
    shall be presented to the immigration officer at the port of entry,
    and upon the expiration of its validity, the permit shall be
    surrendered to the Service.

      A permit issued under this section in the possession of the
    person to whom issued, shall be accepted in lieu of any visa which
    otherwise would be required from such person under this chapter.
    Otherwise a permit issued under this section shall have no effect
    under the immigration laws except to show that the alien to whom it
    was issued is returning from a temporary visit abroad; but nothing
    in this section shall be construed as making such permit the
    exclusive means of establishing that the alien is so returning.

    Sec. 1222. Detention of aliens for physical and mental examination

-STATUTE-
    (a) Detention of aliens
      For the purpose of determining whether aliens (including alien
    crewmen) arriving at ports of the United States belong to any of
    the classes inadmissible under this chapter, by reason of being
    afflicted with any of the diseases or mental or physical defects or
    disabilities set forth in section 1182(a) of this title, or
    whenever the Attorney General has received information showing that
    any aliens are coming from a country or have embarked at a place
    where any of such diseases are prevalent or epidemic, such aliens
    shall be detained by the Attorney General for a sufficient time to
    enable the immigration officers and medical officers to subject
    such aliens to observation and an examination sufficient to
    determine whether or not they belong to inadmissible classes.
    (b) Physical and mental examination
      The physical and mental examination of arriving aliens (including
    alien crewmen) shall be made by medical officers of the United
    States Public Health Service, who shall conduct all medical
    examinations and shall certify, for the information of the
    immigration officers and the immigration judges, any physical and
    mental defect or disease observed by such medical officers in any
    such alien. If medical officers of the United States Public Health
    Service are not available, civil surgeons of not less than four
    years' professional experience may be employed for such service
    upon such terms as may be prescribed by the Attorney General.
    Aliens (including alien crewmen) arriving at ports of the United
    States shall be examined by at least one such medical officer or
    civil surgeon under such administrative regulations as the Attorney
    General may prescribe, and under medical regulations prepared by
    the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Medical officers of the
    United States Public Health Service who have had special training
    in the diagnosis of insanity and mental defects shall be detailed
    for duty or employed at such ports of entry as the Attorney General
    may designate, and such medical officers shall be provided with
    suitable facilities for the detention and examination of all
    arriving aliens who it is suspected may be inadmissible under
    paragraph (1) of section 1182(a) of this title, and the services of
    interpreters shall be provided for such examination. Any alien
    certified under paragraph (1) of section 1182(a) of this title, may
    appeal to a board of medical officers of the United States Public
    Health Service, which shall be convened by the Secretary of Health
    and Human Services, and any such alien may introduce before such
    board one expert medical witness at his own cost and expense.
    (c) Certification of certain helpless aliens
      If an examining medical officer determines that an alien arriving
    in the United States is inadmissible, is helpless from sickness,
    mental or physical disability, or infancy, and is accompanied by
    another alien whose protection or guardianship may be required, the
    officer may certify such fact for purposes of applying section
    1182(a)(10)(B) of this title with respect to the other alien.

    Sec. 1224. Designation of ports of entry for aliens arriving by
      aircraft

-STATUTE-
      The Attorney General is authorized (1) by regulation to designate
    as ports of entry for aliens arriving by aircraft any of the ports
    of entry for civil aircraft designated as such in accordance with
    law; (2) by regulation to provide such reasonable requirements for
    aircraft in civil air navigation with respect to giving notice of
    intention to land in advance of landing, or notice of landing, as
    shall be deemed necessary for purposes of administration and
    enforcement of this chapter; and (3) by regulation to provide for
    the application to civil air navigation of the provisions of this
    chapter where not expressly so provided in this chapter to such
    extent and upon such conditions as he deems necessary. Any person
    who violates any regulation made under this section shall be
    subject to a civil penalty of $2,000 which may be remitted or
    mitigated by the Attorney General in accordance with such
    proceedings as the Attorney General shall by regulation prescribe.
    In case the violation is by the owner or person in command of the
    aircraft, the penalty shall be a lien upon the aircraft, and such
    aircraft may be libeled therefore in the appropriate United States
    court. The determination by the Attorney General and remission or
    mitigation of the civil penalty shall be final. In case the
    violation is by the owner or person in command of the aircraft, the
    penalty shall be a lien upon the aircraft and may be collected by
    proceedings in rem which shall conform as nearly as may be to civil
    suits in admiralty. The Supreme Court of the United States, and
    under its direction other courts of the United States, are
    authorized to prescribe rules regulating such proceedings against
    aircraft in any particular not otherwise provided by law. Any
    aircraft made subject to a lien by this section may be summarily
    seized by, and placed in the custody of such persons as the
    Attorney General may by regulation prescribe. The aircraft may be
    released from such custody upon deposit of such amount not
    exceeding $2,000 as the Attorney General may prescribe, or of a
    bond in such sum and with such sureties as the Attorney General may
    prescribe, conditioned upon the payment of the penalty which may be
    finally determined by the Attorney General.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1225. Inspection by immigration officers; expedited removal of
      inadmissible arriving aliens; referral for hearing

-STATUTE-
    (a) Inspection
      (1) Aliens treated as applicants for admission
        An alien present in the United States who has not been admitted
      or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a
      designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought
      to the United States after having been interdicted in
      international or United States waters) shall be deemed for
      purposes of this chapter an applicant for admission.
      (2) Stowaways
        An arriving alien who is a stowaway is not eligible to apply
      for admission or to be admitted and shall be ordered removed upon
      inspection by an immigration officer. Upon such inspection if the
      alien indicates an intention to apply for asylum under section
      1158 of this title or a fear of persecution, the officer shall
      refer the alien for an interview under subsection (b)(1)(B) of
      this section. A stowaway may apply for asylum only if the
      stowaway is found to have a credible fear of persecution under
      subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section. In no case may a stowaway
      be considered an applicant for admission or eligible for a
      hearing under section 1229a of this title.
      (3) Inspection
        All aliens (including alien crewmen) who are applicants for
      admission or otherwise seeking admission or readmission to or
      transit through the United States shall be inspected by
      immigration officers.
      (4) Withdrawal of application for admission
        An alien applying for admission may, in the discretion of the
      Attorney General and at any time, be permitted to withdraw the
      application for admission and depart immediately from the United
      States.
      (5) Statements
        An applicant for admission may be required to state under oath
      any information sought by an immigration officer regarding the
      purposes and intentions of the applicant in seeking admission to
      the United States, including the applicant's intended length of
      stay and whether the applicant intends to remain permanently or
      become a United States citizen, and whether the applicant is
      inadmissible.
    (b) Inspection of applicants for admission
      (1) Inspection of aliens arriving in the United States and
        certain other aliens who have not been admitted or paroled
        (A) Screening
          (i) In general
            If an immigration officer determines that an alien (other
          than an alien described in subparagraph (F)) who is arriving
          in the United States or is described in clause (iii) is
          inadmissible under section 1182(a)(6)(C) or 1182(a)(7) of
          this title, the officer shall order the alien removed from
          the United States without further hearing or review unless
          the alien indicates either an intention to apply for asylum
          under section 1158 of this title or a fear of persecution.
          (ii) Claims for asylum
            If an immigration officer determines that an alien (other
          than an alien described in subparagraph (F)) who is arriving
          in the United States or is described in clause (iii) is
          inadmissible under section 1182(a)(6)(C) or 1182(a)(7) of
          this title and the alien indicates either an intention to
          apply for asylum under section 1158 of this title or a fear
          of persecution, the officer shall refer the alien for an
          interview by an asylum officer under subparagraph (B).
          (iii) Application to certain other aliens
            (I) In general
              The Attorney General may apply clauses (i) and (ii) of
            this subparagraph to any or all aliens described in
            subclause (II) as designated by the Attorney General. Such
            designation shall be in the sole and unreviewable
            discretion of the Attorney General and may be modified at
            any time.
            (II) Aliens described
              An alien described in this clause is an alien who is not
            described in subparagraph (F), who has not been admitted or
            paroled into the United States, and who has not
            affirmatively shown, to the satisfaction of an immigration
            officer, that the alien has been physically present in the
            United States continuously for the 2-year period
            immediately prior to the date of the determination of
            inadmissibility under this subparagraph.
        (B) Asylum interviews
          (i) Conduct by asylum officers
            An asylum officer shall conduct interviews of aliens
          referred under subparagraph (A)(ii), either at a port of
          entry or at such other place designated by the Attorney
          General.
          (ii) Referral of certain aliens
            If the officer determines at the time of the interview that
          an alien has a credible fear of persecution (within the
          meaning of clause (v)), the alien shall be detained for
          further consideration of the application for asylum.
          (iii) Removal without further review if no credible fear of
            persecution
            (I) In general
              Subject to subclause (III), if the officer determines
            that an alien does not have a credible fear of persecution,
            the officer shall order the alien removed from the United
            States without further hearing or review.
            (II) Record of determination
              The officer shall prepare a written record of a
            determination under subclause (I). Such record shall
            include a summary of the material facts as stated by the
            applicant, such additional facts (if any) relied upon by
            the officer, and the officer's analysis of why, in the
            light of such facts, the alien has not established a
            credible fear of persecution. A copy of the officer's
            interview notes shall be attached to the written summary.
            (III) Review of determination
              The Attorney General shall provide by regulation and upon
            the alien's request for prompt review by an immigration
            judge of a determination under subclause (I) that the alien
            does not have a credible fear of persecution. Such review
            shall include an opportunity for the alien to be heard and
            questioned by the immigration judge, either in person or by
            telephonic or video connection. Review shall be concluded
            as expeditiously as possible, to the maximum extent
            practicable within 24 hours, but in no case later than 7
            days after the date of the determination under subclause
            (I).
            (IV) Mandatory detention
              Any alien subject to the procedures under this clause
            shall be detained pending a final determination of credible
            fear of persecution and, if found not to have such a fear,
            until removed.
          (iv) Information about interviews
            The Attorney General shall provide information concerning
          the asylum interview described in this subparagraph to aliens
          who may be eligible. An alien who is eligible for such
          interview may consult with a person or persons of the alien's
          choosing prior to the interview or any review thereof,
          according to regulations prescribed by the Attorney General.
          Such consultation shall be at no expense to the Government
          and shall not unreasonably delay the process.
          (v) "Credible fear of persecution" defined
            For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "credible fear
          of persecution" means that there is a significant
          possibility, taking into account the credibility of the
          statements made by the alien in support of the alien's claim
          and such other facts as are known to the officer, that the
          alien could establish eligibility for asylum under section
          1158 of this title.
        (C) Limitation on administrative review
          Except as provided in subparagraph (B)(iii)(III), a removal
        order entered in accordance with subparagraph (A)(i) or
        (B)(iii)(I) is not subject to administrative appeal, except
        that the Attorney General shall provide by regulation for
        prompt review of such an order under subparagraph (A)(i)
        against an alien who claims under oath, or as permitted under
        penalty of perjury under section 1746 of title 28, after having
        been warned of the penalties for falsely making such claim
        under such conditions, to have been lawfully admitted for
        permanent residence, to have been admitted as a refugee under
        section 1157 of this title, or to have been granted asylum
        under section 1158 of this title.
        (D) Limit on collateral attacks
          In any action brought against an alien under section 1325(a)
        of this title or section 1326 of this title, the court shall
        not have jurisdiction to hear any claim attacking the validity
        of an order of removal entered under subparagraph (A)(i) or
        (B)(iii).
        (E) "Asylum officer" defined
          As used in this paragraph, the term "asylum officer" means an
        immigration officer who - 
            (i) has had professional training in country conditions,
          asylum law, and interview techniques comparable to that
          provided to full-time adjudicators of applications under
          section 1158 of this title, and
            (ii) is supervised by an officer who meets the condition
          described in clause (i) and has had substantial experience
          adjudicating asylum applications.
        (F) Exception
          Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an alien who is a native
        or citizen of a country in the Western Hemisphere with whose
        government the United States does not have full diplomatic
        relations and who arrives by aircraft at a port of entry.
        (G) Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands
          Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize or
        require any person described in section 1158(e) of this title
        to be permitted to apply for asylum under section 1158 of this
        title at any time before January 1, 2014.
      (2) Inspection of other aliens
        (A) In general
          Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), in the case of an alien
        who is an applicant for admission, if the examining immigration
        officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not
        clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien
        shall be detained for a proceeding under section 1229a of this
        title.
        (B) Exception
          Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an alien - 
            (i) who is a crewman,
            (ii) to whom paragraph (1) applies, or
            (iii) who is a stowaway.
        (C) Treatment of aliens arriving from contiguous territory
          In the case of an alien described in subparagraph (A) who is
        arriving on land (whether or not at a designated port of
        arrival) from a foreign territory contiguous to the United

        title, and
          (ii) after consulting with appropriate security agencies of
        the United States Government, concludes that disclosure of the

        safety, or security,

      the Attorney General may order the alien removed without further
      inquiry or hearing by an immigration judge.
        (C) If the Attorney General does not order the removal of the

    (a) Establishment of preinspection stations
      (1) New stations. - Subject to paragraph (5), not later than
    October 31, 1998, the Attorney General, in consultation with the
    Secretary of State, shall establish and maintain preinspection
    stations in at least 5 of the foreign airports that are among the
    10 foreign airports which the Attorney General identifies as
    serving as last points of departure for the greatest numbers of
    inadmissible alien passengers who arrive from abroad by air at
    ports of entry within the United States. Such preinspection
    stations shall be in addition to any preinspection stations
    established prior to September 30, 1996.
      (2) Report. - Not later than October 31, 1998, the Attorney
    General shall report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the
    House of Representatives and of the Senate on the implementation of
    paragraph (1).
      (3) Data collection. - Not later than November 1, 1997, and each
    subsequent November 1, the Attorney General shall compile data
    identifying - 
        (A) the foreign airports which served as last points of
      departure for aliens who arrived by air at United States ports of
      entry without valid documentation during the preceding fiscal
      years;
        (B) the number and nationality of such aliens arriving from
      each such foreign airport; and
        (C) the primary routes such aliens followed from their country
      of origin to the United States.

      (4) Subject to paragraph (5), not later than January 1, 2008, the
    Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary
    of State, shall establish preinspection stations in at least 25
    additional foreign airports, which the Secretary of Homeland
    Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, determines,
    based on the data compiled under paragraph (3) and such other
    information as may be available, would most effectively facilitate
    the travel of admissible aliens and reduce the number of
    inadmissible aliens, especially aliens who are potential
    terrorists, who arrive from abroad by air at points of entry within
    the United States. Such preinspection stations shall be in addition
    to those established before September 30, 1996, or pursuant to
    paragraph (1).
      (5) Conditions. - Prior to the establishment of a preinspection
    station, the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary
    of State, shall ensure that - 
        (A) employees of the United States stationed at the
      preinspection station and their accompanying family members will
      receive appropriate protection;
        (B) such employees and their families will not be subject to
      unreasonable risks to their welfare and safety; and
        (C) the country in which the preinspection station is to be
      established maintains practices and procedures with respect to
      asylum seekers and refugees in accordance with the Convention
      Relating to the Status of Refugees (done at Geneva, July 28,
      1951), or the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees (done
      at New York, January 31, 1967), or that an alien in the country
      otherwise has recourse to avenues of protection from return to
      persecution.
    (b) Establishment of carrier consultant program and immigration
      security initiative
      The Secretary of Homeland Security shall assign additional
    immigration officers to assist air carriers in the detection of
    fraudulent documents at foreign airports which, based on the
    records maintained pursuant to subsection (a)(3) of this section,
    served as a point of departure for a significant number of arrivals
    at United States ports of entry without valid documentation, but
    where no preinspection station exists. Beginning not later than
    December 31, 2006, the number of airports selected for an
    assignment under this subsection shall be at least 50.

    (a) Arrest, detention, and release
      On a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an alien may be
    arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is to
    be removed from the United States. Except as provided in subsection
    (c) of this section and pending such decision, the Attorney General
    - 
        (1) may continue to detain the arrested alien; and
        (2) may release the alien on - 
          (A) bond of at least $1,500 with security approved by, and
        containing conditions prescribed by, the Attorney General; or
          (B) conditional parole; but

        (3) may not provide the alien with work authorization
      (including an "employment authorized" endorsement or other
      appropriate work permit), unless the alien is lawfully admitted
      for permanent residence or otherwise would (without regard to
      removal proceedings) be provided such authorization.
    (b) Revocation of bond or parole
      The Attorney General at any time may revoke a bond or parole
    authorized under subsection (a) of this section, rearrest the alien
    under the original warrant, and detain the alien.
    (c) Detention of criminal aliens
      (1) Custody
        The Attorney General shall take into custody any alien who - 
          (A) is inadmissible by reason of having committed any offense
        covered in section 1182(a)(2) of this title,
          (B) is deportable by reason of having committed any offense
        covered in section 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), (A)(iii), (B), (C), or
        (D) of this title,
          (C) is deportable under section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) of this
        title on the basis of an offense for which the alien has been
        sentence (!1) to a term of imprisonment of at least 1 year, or

          (D) is inadmissible under section 1182(a)(3)(B) of this title
        or deportable under section 1227(a)(4)(B) of this title,

      when the alien is released, without regard to whether the alien
      is released on parole, supervised release, or probation, and
      without regard to whether the alien may be arrested or imprisoned
      again for the same offense.
      (2) Release
        The Attorney General may release an alien described in
      paragraph (1) only if the Attorney General decides pursuant to
      section 3521 of title 18 that release of the alien from custody
      is necessary to provide protection to a witness, a potential
      witness, a person cooperating with an investigation into major
      criminal activity, or an immediate family member or close
      associate of a witness, potential witness, or person cooperating
      with such an investigation, and the alien satisfies the Attorney
      General that the alien will not pose a danger to the safety of
      other persons or of property and is likely to appear for any
      scheduled proceeding. A decision relating to such release shall
      take place in accordance with a procedure that considers the
      severity of the offense committed by the alien.
    (d) Identification of criminal aliens
      (1) The Attorney General shall devise and implement a system - 
        (A) to make available, daily (on a 24-hour basis), to Federal,
      State, and local authorities the investigative resources of the
      Service to determine whether individuals arrested by such
      authorities for aggravated felonies are aliens;
        (B) to designate and train officers and employees of the
      Service to serve as a liaison to Federal, State, and local law
      enforcement and correctional agencies and courts with respect to
      the arrest, conviction, and release of any alien charged with an
      aggravated felony; and
        (C) which uses computer resources to maintain a current record
      of aliens who have been convicted of an aggravated felony, and
      indicates those who have been removed.

      (2) The record under paragraph (1)(C) shall be made available - 
        (A) to inspectors at ports of entry and to border patrol agents
      at sector headquarters for purposes of immediate identification
      of any alien who was previously ordered removed and is seeking to
      reenter the United States, and
        (B) to officials of the Department of State for use in its
      automated visa lookout system.

      (3) Upon the request of the governor or chief executive officer
    of any State, the Service shall provide assistance to State courts
    in the identification of aliens unlawfully present in the United
    States pending criminal prosecution.
    (e) Judicial review
      The Attorney General's discretionary judgment regarding the
    application of this section shall not be subject to review. No
    court may set aside any action or decision by the Attorney General
    under this section regarding the detention or release of any alien
    or the grant, revocation, or denial of bond or parole.

        The Attorney General shall take into custody any alien who is
      certified under paragraph (3).
      (2) Release
        Except as provided in paragraphs (5) and (6), the Attorney
      General shall maintain custody of such an alien until the alien
      is removed from the United States. Except as provided in
      paragraph (6), such custody shall be maintained irrespective of
      any relief from removal for which the alien may be eligible, or
      any relief from removal granted the alien, until the Attorney
      General determines that the alien is no longer an alien who may
      be certified under paragraph (3). If the alien is finally
      determined not to be removable, detention pursuant to this
      subsection shall terminate.
      (3) Certification
        The Attorney General may certify an alien under this paragraph
      if the Attorney General has reasonable grounds to believe that
      the alien - 
          (A) is described in section 1182(a)(3)(A)(i),
        1182(a)(3)(A)(iii), 1182(a)(3)(B), 1227(a)(4)(A)(i),

      Attorney General may not delegate such authority.
      (5) Commencement of proceedings
        The Attorney General shall place an alien detained under
      paragraph (1) in removal proceedings, or shall charge the alien
      with a criminal offense, not later than 7 days after the
      commencement of such detention. If the requirement of the
      preceding sentence is not satisfied, the Attorney General shall
      release the alien.
      (6) Limitation on indefinite detention
        An alien detained solely under paragraph (1) who has not been
      removed under section 1231(a)(1)(A) of this title, and whose
      removal is unlikely in the reasonably foreseeable future, may be

        The Attorney General shall review the certification made under
      paragraph (3) every 6 months. If the Attorney General determines,
      in the Attorney General's discretion, that the certification
      should be revoked, the alien may be released on such conditions
      as the Attorney General deems appropriate, unless such release is
      otherwise prohibited by law. The alien may request each 6 months
      in writing that the Attorney General reconsider the certification
      and may submit documents or other evidence in support of that
      request.
    (b) Habeas corpus and judicial review
      (1) In general
        Judicial review of any action or decision relating to this
      section (including judicial review of the merits of a
      determination made under subsection (a)(3) or (a)(6) of this
      section) is available exclusively in habeas corpus proceedings
      consistent with this subsection. Except as provided in the
      preceding sentence, no court shall have jurisdiction to review,
      by habeas corpus petition or otherwise, any such action or
      decision.
      (2) Application
        (A) In general
          Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including section
        2241(a) of title 28, habeas corpus proceedings described in

      no right of appeal in such proceedings to any other circuit court
      of appeals.
      (4) Rule of decision
        The law applied by the Supreme Court and the United States
      Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit shall be

          671(d)(1)(C), Sept. 30, 1996, 110 Stat. 3009-723
        (G) Marriage fraud
          An alien shall be considered to be deportable as having
        procured a visa or other documentation by fraud (within the
        meaning of section 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) of this title) and to be in
        the United States in violation of this chapter (within the
        meaning of subparagraph (B)) if - 
            (i) the alien obtains any admission into the United States
          with an immigrant visa or other documentation procured on the
          basis of a marriage entered into less than 2 years prior to
          such admission of the alien and which, within 2 years
          subsequent to any admission of the alien in the United
          States, shall be judicially annulled or terminated, unless
          the alien establishes to the satisfaction of the Attorney
          General that such marriage was not contracted for the purpose
          of evading any provisions of the immigration laws, or
            (ii) it appears to the satisfaction of the Attorney General
          that the alien has failed or refused to fulfill the alien's
          marital agreement which in the opinion of the Attorney
          General was made for the purpose of procuring the alien's
          admission as an immigrant.
        (H) Waiver authorized for certain misrepresentations
          The provisions of this paragraph relating to the removal of

        inadmissible at the time of admission as aliens described in
        section 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) of this title, whether willful or
        innocent, may, in the discretion of the Attorney General, be
        waived for any alien (other than an alien described in
        paragraph (4)(D)) who - 
            (i)(I) is the spouse, parent, son, or daughter of a citizen
          of the United States or of an alien lawfully admitted to the
          United States for permanent residence; and
            (II) was in possession of an immigrant visa or equivalent
          document and was otherwise admissible to the United States at
          the time of such admission except for those grounds of
          inadmissibility specified under paragraphs (5)(A) and (7)(A)
          of section 1182(a) of this title which were a direct result
          of that fraud or misrepresentation.
            (ii) is a VAWA self-petitioner.

        A waiver of removal for fraud or misrepresentation granted
        under this subparagraph shall also operate to waive removal
        based on the grounds of inadmissibility directly resulting from
        such fraud or misrepresentation.

        (A) General crimes

          (ii) Violators of protection orders
            Any alien who at any time after admission is enjoined under
          a protection order issued by a court and whom the court
          determines has engaged in conduct that violates the portion
          of a protection order that involves protection against
          credible threats of violence, repeated harassment, or bodily

        such failure was reasonably excusable or was not willful.
        (B) Failure to register or falsification of documents
          Any alien who at any time has been convicted - 
            (i) under section 1306(c) of this title or under section
          36(c) of the Alien Registration Act, 1940,
            (ii) of a violation of, or an attempt or a conspiracy to
          violate, any provision of the Foreign Agents Registration Act
          of 1938 (22 U.S.C. 611 et seq.), or
            (iii) of a violation of, or an attempt or a conspiracy to
          violate, section 1546 of title 18 (relating to fraud and

        is deportable.
        (C) Document fraud
          (i) In general
            An alien who is the subject of a final order for violation
          of section 1324c of this title is deportable.
          (ii) Waiver authorized
            The Attorney General may waive clause (i) in the case of an
          alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if no
          previous civil money penalty was imposed against the alien
          under section 1324c of this title and the offense was
          incurred solely to assist, aid, or support the alien's spouse
          or child (and no other individual). No court shall have
          jurisdiction to review a decision of the Attorney General to
          grant or deny a waiver under this clause.
        (D) Falsely claiming citizenship
          (i) In general
            Any alien who falsely represents, or has falsely
          represented, himself to be a citizen of the United States for
          any purpose or benefit under this chapter (including section
          1324a of this title) or any Federal or State law is
          deportable.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1228. Expedited removal of aliens convicted of committing
      aggravated felonies

-STATUTE-
    (a) Removal of criminal aliens
      (1) In general
        The Attorney General shall provide for the availability of
      special removal proceedings at certain Federal, State, and local
      correctional facilities for aliens convicted of any criminal
      offense covered in section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D)
      of this title, or any offense covered by section
      1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) of this title for which both predicate offenses
      are, without regard to the date of their commission, otherwise
      covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) of this title. Such
      proceedings shall be conducted in conformity with section 1229a
      of this title (except as otherwise provided in this section), and
      in a manner which eliminates the need for additional detention at
      any processing center of the Service and in a manner which
      assures expeditious removal following the end of the alien's
      incarceration for the underlying sentence. Nothing in this
      section shall be construed to create any substantive or
      procedural right or benefit that is legally enforceable by any
      party against the United States or its agencies or officers or
      any other person.
      (2) Implementation
        With respect to an alien convicted of an aggravated felony who
      is taken into custody by the Attorney General pursuant to section
      1226(c) of this title, the Attorney General shall, to the maximum
      extent practicable, detain any such felon at a facility at which
      other such aliens are detained. In the selection of such
      facility, the Attorney General shall make reasonable efforts to
      ensure that the alien's access to counsel and right to counsel
      under section 1362 of this title are not impaired.
      (3) Expedited proceedings
        (A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Attorney
      General shall provide for the initiation and, to the extent
      possible, the completion of removal proceedings, and any
      administrative appeals thereof, in the case of any alien
      convicted of an aggravated felony before the alien's release from
      incarceration for the underlying aggravated felony.
        (B) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the
      Attorney General to effect the removal of any alien sentenced to
      actual incarceration, before release from the penitentiary or
      correctional institution where such alien is confined.
      (4) Review
        (A) The Attorney General shall review and evaluate removal
      proceedings conducted under this section.
        (B) The Comptroller General shall monitor, review, and evaluate
      removal proceedings conducted under this section. Within 18
      months after the effective date of this section, the Comptroller
      General shall submit a report to such Committees concerning the
      extent to which removal proceedings conducted under this section
      may adversely affect the ability of such aliens to contest
      removal effectively.
    (b) Removal of aliens who are not permanent residents
      (1) The Attorney General may, in the case of an alien described
    in paragraph (2), determine the deportability of such alien under
    section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) of this title (relating to conviction of
    an aggravated felony) and issue an order of removal pursuant to the
    procedures set forth in this subsection or section 1229a of this
    title.
      (2) An alien is described in this paragraph if the alien - 
        (A) was not lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the
      time at which proceedings under this section commenced; or
        (B) had permanent resident status on a conditional basis (as
      described in section 1186a of this title) at the time that
      proceedings under this section commenced.

      (3) The Attorney General may not execute any order described in
    paragraph (1) until 14 calendar days have passed from the date that
    such order was issued, unless waived by the alien, in order that
    the alien has an opportunity to apply for judicial review under
    section 1252 of this title.
      (4) Proceedings before the Attorney General under this subsection
    shall be in accordance with such regulations as the Attorney
    General shall prescribe. The Attorney General shall provide that - 
        (A) the alien is given reasonable notice of the charges and of
      the opportunity described in subparagraph (C);
        (B) the alien shall have the privilege of being represented (at
      no expense to the government) by such counsel, authorized to
      practice in such proceedings, as the alien shall choose;
        (C) the alien has a reasonable opportunity to inspect the
      evidence and rebut the charges;
        (D) a determination is made for the record that the individual
      upon whom the notice for the proceeding under this section is
      served (either in person or by mail) is, in fact, the alien named
      in such notice;
        (E) a record is maintained for judicial review; and
        (F) the final order of removal is not adjudicated by the same
      person who issues the charges.

      (5) No alien described in this section shall be eligible for any
    relief from removal that the Attorney General may grant in the
    Attorney General's discretion.
    (c) (!1) Presumption of deportability

      An alien convicted of an aggravated felony shall be conclusively
    presumed to be deportable from the United States.
    (c) (!1) Judicial removal
      (1) Authority
        Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a United
      States district court shall have jurisdiction to enter a judicial
      order of removal at the time of sentencing against an alien who
      is deportable, if such an order has been requested by the United
      States Attorney with the concurrence of the Commissioner and if
      the court chooses to exercise such jurisdiction.
      (2) Procedure
        (A) The United States Attorney shall file with the United
      States district court, and serve upon the defendant and the
      Service, prior to commencement of the trial or entry of a guilty
      plea a notice of intent to request judicial removal.
        (B) Notwithstanding section 1252b (!2) of this title, the
      United States Attorney, with the concurrence of the Commissioner,
      shall file at least 30 days prior to the date set for sentencing
      a charge containing factual allegations regarding the alienage of
      the defendant and identifying the crime or crimes which make the
      defendant deportable under section 1227(a)(2)(A) of this title.

        (C) If the court determines that the defendant has presented
      substantial evidence to establish prima facie eligibility for
      relief from removal under this chapter, the Commissioner shall
      provide the court with a recommendation and report regarding the
      alien's eligibility for relief. The court shall either grant or
      deny the relief sought.
        (D)(i) The alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine
      the evidence against him or her, to present evidence on his or
      her own behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the
      Government.
        (ii) The court, for the purposes of determining whether to
      enter an order described in paragraph (1), shall only consider
      evidence that would be admissible in proceedings conducted
      pursuant to section 1229a of this title.
        (iii) Nothing in this subsection shall limit the information a
      court of the United States may receive or consider for the
      purposes of imposing an appropriate sentence.
        (iv) The court may order the alien removed if the Attorney
      General demonstrates that the alien is deportable under this
      chapter.
      (3) Notice, appeal, and execution of judicial order of removal
        (A)(i) A judicial order of removal or denial of such order may
      be appealed by either party to the court of appeals for the
      circuit in which the district court is located.
        (ii) Except as provided in clause (iii), such appeal shall be
      considered consistent with the requirements described in section
      1252 of this title.
        (iii) Upon execution by the defendant of a valid waiver of the
      right to appeal the conviction on which the order of removal is
      based, the expiration of the period described in section
      1252(b)(1) of this title, or the final dismissal of an appeal
      from such conviction, the order of removal shall become final and
      shall be executed at the end of the prison term in accordance
      with the terms of the order. If the conviction is reversed on
      direct appeal, the order entered pursuant to this section shall

        The United States Attorney, with the concurrence of the
      Commissioner, may, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure
      11, enter into a plea agreement which calls for the alien, who is
      deportable under this chapter, to waive the right to notice and a
      hearing under this section, and stipulate to the entry of a
      judicial order of removal from the United States as a condition
      of the plea agreement or as a condition of probation or
      supervised release, or both. The United States district court, in
      both felony and misdemeanor cases, and a United States magistrate
      judge in misdemeanor cases, may accept such a stipulation and
      shall have jurisdiction to enter a judicial order of removal

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1229a. Removal proceedings

-STATUTE-
    (a) Proceeding
      (1) In general
        An immigration judge shall conduct proceedings for deciding the
      inadmissibility or deportability of an alien.
      (2) Charges
        An alien placed in proceedings under this section may be
      charged with any applicable ground of inadmissibility under
      section 1182(a) of this title or any applicable ground of
      deportability under section 1227(a) of this title.
      (3) Exclusive procedures
        Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, a proceeding under
      this section shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for
      determining whether an alien may be admitted to the United States
      or, if the alien has been so admitted, removed from the United
      States. Nothing in this section shall affect proceedings
      conducted pursuant to section 1228 of this title.
    (b) Conduct of proceeding
      (1) Authority of immigration judge
        The immigration judge shall administer oaths, receive evidence,
      and interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien and any
      witnesses. The immigration judge may issue subpoenas for the
      attendance of witnesses and presentation of evidence. The
      immigration judge shall have authority (under regulations
      prescribed by the Attorney General) to sanction by civil money
      penalty any action (or inaction) in contempt of the judge's
      proper exercise of authority under this chapter.
      (2) Form of proceeding
        (A) In general
          The proceeding may take place - 
            (i) in person,
            (ii) where agreed to by the parties, in the absence of the
          alien,
            (iii) through video conference, or
            (iv) subject to subparagraph (B), through telephone
          conference.
        (B) Consent required in certain cases
          An evidentiary hearing on the merits may only be conducted
        through a telephone conference with the consent of the alien
        involved after the alien has been advised of the right to
        proceed in person or through video conference.
      (3) Presence of alien
        If it is impracticable by reason of an alien's mental
      incompetency for the alien to be present at the proceeding, the
      Attorney General shall prescribe safeguards to protect the rights
      and privileges of the alien.
      (4) Alien's rights in proceeding
        In proceedings under this section, under regulations of the
      Attorney General - 
          (A) the alien shall have the privilege of being represented,
        at no expense to the Government, by counsel of the alien's
        choosing who is authorized to practice in such proceedings,
          (B) the alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine
        the evidence against the alien, to present evidence on the
        alien's own behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses presented by
        the Government but these rights shall not entitle the alien to
        examine such national security information as the Government
        may proffer in opposition to the alien's admission to the
        United States or to an application by the alien for
        discretionary relief under this chapter, and
          (C) a complete record shall be kept of all testimony and
        evidence produced at the proceeding.
      (5) Consequences of failure to appear
        (A) In general
          Any alien who, after written notice required under paragraph
        (1) or (2) of section 1229(a) of this title has been provided
        to the alien or the alien's counsel of record, does not attend
        a proceeding under this section, shall be ordered removed in
        absentia if the Service establishes by clear, unequivocal, and
        convincing evidence that the written notice was so provided and
        that the alien is removable (as defined in subsection (e)(2) of
        this section). The written notice by the Attorney General shall
        be considered sufficient for purposes of this subparagraph if
        provided at the most recent address provided under section
        1229(a)(1)(F) of this title.
        (B) No notice if failure to provide address information
          No written notice shall be required under subparagraph (A) if
        the alien has failed to provide the address required under
        section 1229(a)(1)(F) of this title.
        (C) Rescission of order
          Such an order may be rescinded only - 
            (i) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the
          date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that
          the failure to appear was because of exceptional
          circumstances (as defined in subsection (e)(1) of this
          section), or
            (ii) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien
          demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in
          accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a) of
          this title or the alien demonstrates that the alien was in
          Federal or State custody and the failure to appear was
          through no fault of the alien.

        The filing of the motion to reopen described in clause (i) or
        (ii) shall stay the removal of the alien pending disposition of
        the motion by the immigration judge.
        (D) Effect on judicial review
          Any petition for review under section 1252 of this title of
        an order entered in absentia under this paragraph shall (except
        in cases described in section 1252(b)(5) of this title) be
        confined to (i) the validity of the notice provided to the
        alien, (ii) the reasons for the alien's not attending the
        proceeding, and (iii) whether or not the alien is removable.
        (E) Additional application to certain aliens in contiguous
          territory
          The preceding provisions of this paragraph shall apply to all
        aliens placed in proceedings under this section, including any
        alien who remains in a contiguous foreign territory pursuant to
        section 1225(b)(2)(C) of this title.
      (6) Treatment of frivolous behavior
        The Attorney General shall, by regulation - 
          (A) define in a proceeding before an immigration judge or
        before an appellate administrative body under this subchapter,
        frivolous behavior for which attorneys may be sanctioned,
          (B) specify the circumstances under which an administrative
        appeal of a decision or ruling will be considered frivolous and
        will be summarily dismissed, and
          (C) impose appropriate sanctions (which may include
        suspension and disbarment) in the case of frivolous behavior.

        Any alien against whom a final order of removal is entered in
      absentia under this subsection and who, at the time of the notice
      described in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a) of this
      title, was provided oral notice, either in the alien's native
      language or in another language the alien understands, of the
      time and place of the proceedings and of the consequences under
      this paragraph of failing, other than because of exceptional
      circumstances (as defined in subsection (e)(1) of this section)
      to attend a proceeding under this section, shall not be eligible
      for relief under section 1229b, 1229c, 1255, 1258, or 1259 of
      this title for a period of 10 years after the date of the entry
      of the final order of removal.
    (c) Decision and burden of proof
      (1) Decision
        (A) In general
          At the conclusion of the proceeding the immigration judge
        shall decide whether an alien is removable from the United
        States. The determination of the immigration judge shall be
        based only on the evidence produced at the hearing.
        (B) Certain medical decisions
          If a medical officer or civil surgeon or board of medical
        officers has certified under section 1222(b) of this title that
        an alien has a disease, illness, or addiction which would make
        the alien inadmissible under paragraph (1) of section 1182(a)
        of this title, the decision of the immigration judge shall be
        based solely upon such certification.
      (2) Burden on alien
        In the proceeding the alien has the burden of establishing - 
          (A) if the alien is an applicant for admission, that the
        alien is clearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted and
        is not inadmissible under section 1182 of this title; or
          (B) by clear and convincing evidence, that the alien is
        lawfully present in the United States pursuant to a prior
        admission.

      In meeting the burden of proof under subparagraph (B), the alien
      shall have access to the alien's visa or other entry document, if
      any, and any other records and documents, not considered by the
      Attorney General to be confidential, pertaining to the alien's
      admission or presence in the United States.
      (3) Burden on service in cases of deportable aliens
        (A) In general
          In the proceeding the Service has the burden of establishing
        by clear and convincing evidence that, in the case of an alien
        who has been admitted to the United States, the alien is
        deportable. No decision on deportability shall be valid unless
        it is based upon reasonable, substantial, and probative
        evidence.
        (B) Proof of convictions
          In any proceeding under this chapter, any of the following
        documents or records (or a certified copy of such an official
        document or record) shall constitute proof of a criminal
        conviction:
            (i) An official record of judgment and conviction.
            (ii) An official record of plea, verdict, and sentence.
            (iii) A docket entry from court records that indicates the
          existence of the conviction.
            (iv) Official minutes of a court proceeding or a transcript
          of a court hearing in which the court takes notice of the
          existence of the conviction.
            (v) An abstract of a record of conviction prepared by the
          court in which the conviction was entered, or by a State
          official associated with the State's repository of criminal
          justice records, that indicates the charge or section of law
          violated, the disposition of the case, the existence and date
          of conviction, and the sentence.
            (vi) Any document or record prepared by, or under the
          direction of, the court in which the conviction was entered
          that indicates the existence of a conviction.
            (vii) Any document or record attesting to the conviction
          that is maintained by an official of a State or Federal penal
          institution, which is the basis for that institution's
          authority to assume custody of the individual named in the
          record.
        (C) Electronic records
          In any proceeding under this chapter, any record of
        conviction or abstract that has been submitted by electronic
        means to the Service from a State or court shall be admissible
        as evidence to prove a criminal conviction if it is - 
            (i) certified by a State official associated with the
          State's repository of criminal justice records as an official
          record from its repository or by a court official from the
          court in which the conviction was entered as an official
          record from its repository, and
            (ii) certified in writing by a Service official as having
          been received electronically from the State's record
          repository or the court's record repository.

        A certification under clause (i) may be by means of a computer-
        generated signature and statement of authenticity.
      (4) Applications for relief from removal
        (A) In general
          An alien applying for relief or protection from removal has
        the burden of proof to establish that the alien - 
            (i) satisfies the applicable eligibility requirements; and
            (ii) with respect to any form of relief that is granted in
          the exercise of discretion, that the alien merits a favorable
          exercise of discretion.
        (B) Sustaining burden
          The applicant must comply with the applicable requirements to
        submit information or documentation in support of the
        applicant's application for relief or protection as provided by
        law or by regulation or in the instructions for the application
        form. In evaluating the testimony of the applicant or other
        witness in support of the application, the immigration judge
        will determine whether or not the testimony is credible, is
        persuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to
        demonstrate that the applicant has satisfied the applicant's
        burden of proof. In determining whether the applicant has met
        such burden, the immigration judge shall weigh the credible
        testimony along with other evidence of record. Where the
        immigration judge determines that the applicant should provide
        evidence which corroborates otherwise credible testimony, such
        evidence must be provided unless the applicant demonstrates
        that the applicant does not have the evidence and cannot
        reasonably obtain the evidence.
        (C) Credibility determination
          Considering the totality of the circumstances, and all
        relevant factors, the immigration judge may base a credibility
        determination on the demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the
        applicant or witness, the inherent plausibility of the
        applicant's or witness's account, the consistency between the
        applicant's or witness's written and oral statements (whenever
        made and whether or not under oath, and considering the
        circumstances under which the statements were made), the
        internal consistency of each such statement, the consistency of
        such statements with other evidence of record (including the
        reports of the Department of State on country conditions), and
        any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without
        regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood
        goes to the heart of the applicant's claim, or any other
        relevant factor. There is no presumption of credibility,
        however, if no adverse credibility determination is explicitly
        made, the applicant or witness shall have a rebuttable
        presumption of credibility on appeal.
      (5) Notice
        If the immigration judge decides that the alien is removable
      and orders the alien to be removed, the judge shall inform the
      alien of the right to appeal that decision and of the
      consequences for failure to depart under the order of removal,
      including civil and criminal penalties.
      (6) Motions to reconsider
        (A) In general
          The alien may file one motion to reconsider a decision that
        the alien is removable from the United States.
        (B) Deadline
          The motion must be filed within 30 days of the date of entry
        of a final administrative order of removal.
        (C) Contents
          The motion shall specify the errors of law or fact in the
        previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority.
      (7) Motions to reopen
        (A) In general
          An alien may file one motion to reopen proceedings under this
        section, except that this limitation shall not apply so as to
        prevent the filing of one motion to reopen described in
        subparagraph (C)(iv).
        (B) Contents
          The motion to reopen shall state the new facts that will be
        proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and
        shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.
        (C) Deadline
          (i) In general
            Except as provided in this subparagraph, the motion to
          reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of
          a final administrative order of removal.
          (ii) Asylum
            There is no time limit on the filing of a motion to reopen
          if the basis of the motion is to apply for relief under
          sections (!1) 1158 or 1231(b)(3) of this title and is based
          on changed country conditions arising in the country of
          nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered,
          if such evidence is material and was not available and would
          not have been discovered or presented at the previous
          proceeding.

          (iii) Failure to appear
            The filing of a motion to reopen an order entered pursuant
          to subsection (b)(5) of this section is subject to the
          deadline specified in subparagraph (C) of such subsection.
          (iv) Special rule for battered spouses, children, and parents
            Any limitation under this section on the deadlines for
          filing such motions shall not apply - 
              (I) if the basis for the motion is to apply for relief
            under clause (iii) or (iv) of section 1154(a)(1)(A) of this
            title, clause (ii) or (iii) of section 1154(a)(1)(B) of
            this title,,(!1) section 1229b(b) of this title, or section
            1254(a)(3) of this title (as in effect on March 31, 1997);
              (II) if the motion is accompanied by a cancellation of
            removal application to be filed with the Attorney General
            or by a copy of the self-petition that has been or will be
            filed with the Immigration and Naturalization Service upon
            the granting of the motion to reopen;
              (III) if the motion to reopen is filed within 1 year of
            the entry of the final order of removal, except that the
            Attorney General may, in the Attorney General's discretion,
            waive this time limitation in the case of an alien who
            demonstrates extraordinary circumstances or extreme
            hardship to the alien's child; and
              (IV) if the alien is physically present in the United
            States at the time of filing the motion.

          The filing of a motion to reopen under this clause shall only
          stay the removal of a qualified alien (as defined in section
          1641(c)(1)(B) of this title (!2) pending the final
          disposition of the motion, including exhaustion of all
          appeals if the motion establishes that the alien is a
          qualified alien.

    (d) Stipulated removal
      The Attorney General shall provide by regulation for the entry by
    an immigration judge of an order of removal stipulated to by the
    alien (or the alien's representative) and the Service. A stipulated
    order shall constitute a conclusive determination of the alien's
    removability from the United States.

      (1) Exceptional circumstances

      circumstances (such as battery or extreme cruelty to the alien or
      any child or parent of the alien, serious illness of the alien,
      or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of
      the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances)

      240(c)(7)(C)(iv) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.
      1229a(c)(7)).
      "(ii) Prima facie case. - The filing of a motion to reopen under
    this subparagraph shall only stay the removal of a qualified alien
    (as defined in section 431(c)(1)(B) of the Personal Responsibility
    and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C.
    1641(c)(1)(B))[)] pending the final disposition of the motion,
    including exhaustion of all appeals if the motion establishes that
    the alien is a qualified alien.
      "(B) Applicability. - Subparagraph (A) shall apply to motions
    filed by aliens who are physically present in the United States and
    who - 
        "(i) are, or were, in deportation or exclusion proceedings

        "(ii) have become eligible to apply for relief described in
      subparagraph (A)(i) as a result of the amendments made by -

        Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (Public

    Sec. 1229b. Cancellation of removal; adjustment of status

-STATUTE-
    (a) Cancellation of removal for certain permanent residents
      The Attorney General may cancel removal in the case of an alien
    who is inadmissible or deportable from the United States if the
    alien - 
        (1) has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence
      for not less than 5 years,
        (2) has resided in the United States continuously for 7 years
      after having been admitted in any status, and
        (3) has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.
    (b) Cancellation of removal and adjustment of status for certain
      nonpermanent residents
      (1) In general
        The Attorney General may cancel removal of, and adjust to the
      status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, an
      alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the United States if
      the alien - 
          (A) has been physically present in the United States for a
        continuous period of not less than 10 years immediately
        preceding the date of such application;
          (B) has been a person of good moral character during such
        period;
          (C) has not been convicted of an offense under section
        1182(a)(2), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(3) of this title, subject to
        paragraph (5); and
          (D) establishes that removal would result in exceptional and
        extremely unusual hardship to the alien's spouse, parent, or
        child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien
        lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
      (2) Special rule for battered spouse or child
        (A) Authority
          The Attorney General may cancel removal of, and adjust to the
        status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,
        an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the United
        States if the alien demonstrates that - 
            (i)(I) the alien has been battered or subjected to extreme
          cruelty by a spouse or parent who is or was a United States
          citizen (or is the parent of a child of a United States
          citizen and the child has been battered or subjected to
          extreme cruelty by such citizen parent);
            (II) the alien has been battered or subjected to extreme
          cruelty by a spouse or parent who is or was a lawful
          permanent resident (or is the parent of a child of an alien
          who is or was a lawful permanent resident and the child has
          been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by such
          permanent resident parent); or
            (III) the alien has been battered or subjected to extreme
          cruelty by a United States citizen or lawful permanent
          resident whom the alien intended to marry, but whose marriage
          is not legitimate because of that United States citizen's or
          lawful permanent resident's bigamy;
            (ii) the alien has been physically present in the United
          States for a continuous period of not less than 3 years
          immediately preceding the date of such application, and the
          issuance of a charging document for removal proceedings shall
          not toll the 3-year period of continuous physical presence in
          the United States;
            (iii) the alien has been a person of good moral character
          during such period, subject to the provisions of subparagraph
          (C);
            (iv) the alien is not inadmissible under paragraph (2) or
          (3) of section 1182(a) of this title, is not deportable under
          paragraphs (1)(G) or (2) through (4) of section 1227(a) of
          this title, subject to paragraph (5), and has not been
          convicted of an aggravated felony; and
            (v) the removal would result in extreme hardship to the
          alien, the alien's child, or the alien's parent.
        (B) Physical presence
          Notwithstanding subsection (d)(2) of this section, for
        purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii) or for purposes of section
        1254(a)(3) of this title (as in effect before the title III-A
        effective date in section 309 of the Illegal Immigration Reform
        and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996), an alien shall not
        be considered to have failed to maintain continuous physical
        presence by reason of an absence if the alien demonstrates a
        connection between the absence and the battering or extreme
        cruelty perpetrated against the alien. No absence or portion of
        an absence connected to the battering or extreme cruelty shall
        count toward the 90-day or 180-day limits established in
        subsection (d)(2) of this section. If any absence or aggregate
        absences exceed 180 days, the absences or portions of the
        absences will not be considered to break the period of
        continuous presence. Any such period of time excluded from the
        180-day limit shall be excluded in computing the time during
        which the alien has been physically present for purposes of the
        3-year requirement set forth in this subparagraph, subparagraph
        (A)(ii), and section 1254(a)(3) of this title (as in effect
        before the title III-A effective date in section 309 of the
        Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of
        1996).
        (C) Good moral character
          Notwithstanding section 1101(f) of this title, an act or
        conviction that does not bar the Attorney General from granting
        relief under this paragraph by reason of subparagraph (A)(iv)
        shall not bar the Attorney General from finding the alien to be
        of good moral character under subparagraph (A)(iii) or section
        1254(a)(3) of this title (as in effect before the title III-A
        effective date in section 309 of the Illegal Immigration Reform
        and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996), if the Attorney
        General finds that the act or conviction was connected to the
        alien's having been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty
        and determines that a waiver is otherwise warranted.
        (D) Credible evidence considered
          In acting on applications under this paragraph, the Attorney
        General shall consider any credible evidence relevant to the
        application. The determination of what evidence is credible and
        the weight to be given that evidence shall be within the sole
        discretion of the Attorney General.
      (3) Recordation of date
        With respect to aliens who the Attorney General adjusts to the
      status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence
      under paragraph (1) or (2), the Attorney General shall record the
      alien's lawful admission for permanent residence as of the date
      of the Attorney General's cancellation of removal under paragraph
      (1) or (2).
      (4) Children of battered aliens and parents of battered alien
        children
        (A) In general
          The Attorney General shall grant parole under section
        1182(d)(5) of this title to any alien who is a - 
            (i) child of an alien granted relief under section
          1229b(b)(2) or 1254(a)(3) of this title (as in effect before
          the title III-A effective date in section 309 of the Illegal
          Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996);
          or
            (ii) parent of a child alien granted relief under section
          1229b(b)(2) or 1254(a)(3) of this title (as in effect before
          the title III-A effective date in section 309 of the Illegal
          Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996).
        (B) Duration of parole
          The grant of parole shall extend from the time of the grant
        of relief under subsection (b)(2) of this section or section
        1254(a)(3) of this title (as in effect before the title III-A
        effective date in section 309 of the Illegal Immigration Reform
        and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996) to the time the
        application for adjustment of status filed by aliens covered
        under this paragraph has been finally adjudicated. Applications
        for adjustment of status filed by aliens covered under this
        paragraph shall be treated as if the applicants were VAWA self-
        petitioners. Failure by the alien granted relief under
        subsection (b)(2) of this section or section 1254(a)(3) of this
        title (as in effect before the title III-A effective date in
        section 309 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant
        Responsibility Act of 1996) to exercise due diligence in filing
        a visa petition on behalf of an alien described in clause (i)
        or (ii) may result in revocation of parole.
      (5) Application of domestic violence waiver authority
        The authority provided under section 1227(a)(7) of this title
      may apply under paragraphs (1)(B), (1)(C), and (2)(A)(iv) in a
      cancellation of removal and adjustment of status proceeding.
      (6) Relatives of trafficking victims
        (A) In general
          Upon written request by a law enforcement official, the
        Secretary of Homeland Security may parole under section
        1182(d)(5) of this title any alien who is a relative of an
        alien granted continued presence under section 7105(c)(3)(A) of
        title 22, if the relative -

          such continued presence - 
              (I) in the case of an alien granted continued presence
            who is under 21 years of age, the spouse, child, parent, or
            unmarried sibling under 18 years of age, of the alien; or
              (II) in the case of an alien granted continued presence
            who is 21 years of age or older, the spouse or child of the
            alien; or

            (ii) is a parent or sibling of the alien who the requesting
          law enforcement official, in consultation with the Secretary
          of Homeland Security, as appropriate, determines to be in
          present danger of retaliation as a result of the alien's
          escape from the severe form of trafficking or cooperation
          with law enforcement, irrespective of age.
        (B) Duration of parole
          (i) In general
            The Secretary may extend the parole granted under
          subparagraph (A) until the final adjudication of the
          application filed by the principal alien under section
          1101(a)(15)(T)(ii) of this title.
          (ii) Other limits on duration
            If an application described in clause (i) is not filed, the
          parole granted under subparagraph (A) may extend until the
          later of - 
              (I) the date on which the principal alien's authority to
            remain in the United States under section 7105(c)(3)(A) of
            title 22 is terminated; or
              (II) the date on which a civil action filed by the
            principal alien under section 1595 of title 18 is
            concluded.
          (iii) Due diligence
            Failure by the principal alien to exercise due diligence in
          filing a visa petition on behalf of an alien described in
          clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A), or in pursuing the
          civil action described in clause (ii)(II) (as determined by

          complicit in the trafficking of an alien permitted to remain
          in the United States under section 7105(c)(3)(A) of title 22;

      subsequent to June 30, 1964.
        (2) An alien who was admitted to the United States as a

      exchange alien after admission, in order to receive graduate

    (d) Special rules relating to continuous residence or physical
      presence
      (1) Termination of continuous period
        For purposes of this section, any period of continuous
      residence or continuous physical presence in the United States
      shall be deemed to end (A) except in the case of an alien who
      applies for cancellation of removal under subsection (b)(2) of
      this section, when the alien is served a notice to appear under
      section 1229(a) of this title, or (B) when the alien has
      committed an offense referred to in section 1182(a)(2) of this
      title that renders the alien inadmissible to the United States
      under section 1182(a)(2) of this title or removable from the

        An alien shall be considered to have failed to maintain

      days or for any periods in the aggregate exceeding 180 days.
      (3) Continuity not required because of honorable service in Armed

          (A) has served for a minimum period of 24 months in an active-
        duty status in the Armed Forces of the United States and, if
        separated from such service, was separated under honorable
        conditions, and
          (B) at the time of the alien's enlistment or induction was in
        the United States.
    (e) Annual limitation
      (1) Aggregate limitation

      cancel the removal and adjust the status under this section, nor
      suspend the deportation and adjust the status under section
      1254(a) of this title (as in effect before September 30, 1996),
      of a total of more than 4,000 aliens in any fiscal year. The
      previous sentence shall apply regardless of when an alien applied
      for such cancellation and adjustment, or such suspension and
      adjustment, and whether such an alien had previously applied for
      suspension of deportation under such section 1254(a) of this
      title. The numerical limitation under this paragraph shall apply
      to the aggregate number of decisions in any fiscal year to cancel
      the removal (and adjust the status) of an alien, or suspend the
      deportation (and adjust the status) of an alien, under this
      section or such section 1254(a) of this title.
      (2) Fiscal year 1997

      decisions to cancel the removal of an alien, or suspend the
      deportation of an alien, made after April 1, 1997.
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Attorney General
      may cancel the removal or suspend the deportation, in addition to
      the normal allotment for fiscal year 1998, of a number of aliens
      equal to 4,000 less the number of such cancellations of removal
      and suspensions of deportation granted in fiscal year 1997 after
      April 1, 1997.
      (3) Exception for certain aliens
        Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the following:
          (A) Aliens described in section 309(c)(5)(C)(i) of the
        Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of
        1996 (as amended by the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central
        American Relief Act).
          (B) Aliens in deportation proceedings prior to April 1, 1997,

        1258, and 1259 of this title.
      (2) Application of VAWA protections
        The restrictions on relief under paragraph (1) shall not apply
      to relief under section 1229b or 1255 of this title on the basis

      filed under section 1229b(b)(2) of this title, or under section
      1254(a)(3) of this title (as in effect prior to March 31, 1997),

        The order permitting an alien to depart voluntarily shall
      inform the alien of the penalties under this subsection.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1231. Detention and removal of aliens ordered removed

-STATUTE-
    (a) Detention, release, and removal of aliens ordered removed
      (1) Removal period
        (A) In general
          Except as otherwise provided in this section, when an alien
        is ordered removed, the Attorney General shall remove the alien
        from the United States within a period of 90 days (in this
        section referred to as the "removal period").
        (B) Beginning of period
          The removal period begins on the latest of the following:
            (i) The date the order of removal becomes administratively
          final.
            (ii) If the removal order is judicially reviewed and if a
          court orders a stay of the removal of the alien, the date of
          the court's final order.
            (iii) If the alien is detained or confined (except under an
          immigration process), the date the alien is released from
          detention or confinement.
        (C) Suspension of period
          The removal period shall be extended beyond a period of 90
        days and the alien may remain in detention during such extended
        period if the alien fails or refuses to make timely application
        in good faith for travel or other documents necessary to the
        alien's departure or conspires or acts to prevent the alien's
        removal subject to an order of removal.
      (2) Detention
        During the removal period, the Attorney General shall detain
      the alien. Under no circumstance during the removal period shall
      the Attorney General release an alien who has been found
      inadmissible under section 1182(a)(2) or 1182(a)(3)(B) of this
      title or deportable under section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4)(B) of
      this title.
      (3) Supervision after 90-day period
        If the alien does not leave or is not removed within the
      removal period, the alien, pending removal, shall be subject to
      supervision under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General.
      The regulations shall include provisions requiring the alien - 
          (A) to appear before an immigration officer periodically for
        identification;
          (B) to submit, if necessary, to a medical and psychiatric
        examination at the expense of the United States Government;
          (C) to give information under oath about the alien's
        nationality, circumstances, habits, associations, and
        activities, and other information the Attorney General
        considers appropriate; and
          (D) to obey reasonable written restrictions on the alien's
        conduct or activities that the Attorney General prescribes for
        the alien.
      (4) Aliens imprisoned, arrested, or on parole, supervised
        release, or probation
        (A) In general
          Except as provided in section 259(a) (!1) of title 42 and
        paragraph (2),(!2) the Attorney General may not remove an alien
        who is sentenced to imprisonment until the alien is released
        from imprisonment. Parole, supervised release, probation, or
        possibility of arrest or further imprisonment is not a reason
        to defer removal.


        (B) Exception for removal of nonviolent offenders prior to
          completion of sentence of imprisonment
          The Attorney General is authorized to remove an alien in
        accordance with applicable procedures under this chapter before
        the alien has completed a sentence of imprisonment - 
            (i) in the case of an alien in the custody of the Attorney
          General, if the Attorney General determines that (I) the
          alien is confined pursuant to a final conviction for a
          nonviolent offense (other than an offense related to
          smuggling or harboring of aliens or an offense described in
          section 1101(a)(43)(B), (C), (E), (I), or (L) of this title
          (!3) and (II) the removal of the alien is appropriate and in
          the best interest of the United States; or

            (ii) in the case of an alien in the custody of a State (or
          a political subdivision of a State), if the chief State
          official exercising authority with respect to the
          incarceration of the alien determines that (I) the alien is
          confined pursuant to a final conviction for a nonviolent
          offense (other than an offense described in section
          1101(a)(43)(C) or (E) of this title), (II) the removal is
          appropriate and in the best interest of the State, and (III)
          submits a written request to the Attorney General that such
          alien be so removed.
        (C) Notice
          Any alien removed pursuant to this paragraph shall be
        notified of the penalties under the laws of the United States
        relating to the reentry of deported aliens, particularly the
        expanded penalties for aliens removed under subparagraph (B).
        (D) No private right
          No cause or claim may be asserted under this paragraph
        against any official of the United States or of any State to
        compel the release, removal, or consideration for release or
        removal of any alien.
      (5) Reinstatement of removal orders against aliens illegally
        reentering
        If the Attorney General finds that an alien has reentered the
      United States illegally after having been removed or having
      departed voluntarily, under an order of removal, the prior order
      of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not
      subject to being reopened or reviewed, the alien is not eligible
      and may not apply for any relief under this chapter, and the
      alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after
      the reentry.
      (6) Inadmissible or criminal aliens
        An alien ordered removed who is inadmissible under section 1182
      of this title, removable under section 1227(a)(1)(C), 1227(a)(2),
      or 1227(a)(4) of this title or who has been determined by the
      Attorney General to be a risk to the community or unlikely to
      comply with the order of removal, may be detained beyond the
      removal period and, if released, shall be subject to the terms of
      supervision in paragraph (3).
      (7) Employment authorization
        No alien ordered removed shall be eligible to receive
      authorization to be employed in the United States unless the
      Attorney General makes a specific finding that - 
          (A) the alien cannot be removed due to the refusal of all
        countries designated by the alien or under this section to
        receive the alien, or
          (B) the removal of the alien is otherwise impracticable or
        contrary to the public interest.
    (b) Countries to which aliens may be removed
      (1) Aliens arriving at the United States
        Subject to paragraph (3) - 
        (A) In general
          Except as provided by subparagraphs (B) and (C), an alien who
        arrives at the United States and with respect to whom
        proceedings under section 1229a of this title were initiated at
        the time of such alien's arrival shall be removed to the
        country in which the alien boarded the vessel or aircraft on
        which the alien arrived in the United States.
        (B) Travel from contiguous territory
          If the alien boarded the vessel or aircraft on which the
        alien arrived in the United States in a foreign territory
        contiguous to the United States, an island adjacent to the
        United States, or an island adjacent to a foreign territory
        contiguous to the United States, and the alien is not a native,
        citizen, subject, or national of, or does not reside in, the
        territory or island, removal shall be to the country in which
        the alien boarded the vessel that transported the alien to the
        territory or island.
        (C) Alternative countries
          If the government of the country designated in subparagraph
        (A) or (B) is unwilling to accept the alien into that country's
        territory, removal shall be to any of the following countries,
        as directed by the Attorney General:
            (i) The country of which the alien is a citizen, subject,
          or national.
            (ii) The country in which the alien was born.
            (iii) The country in which the alien has a residence.
            (iv) A country with a government that will accept the alien
          into the country's territory if removal to each country
          described in a previous clause of this subparagraph is
          impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible.
      (2) Other aliens
        Subject to paragraph (3) - 
        (A) Selection of country by alien
          Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph - 
            (i) any alien not described in paragraph (1) who has been
          ordered removed may designate one country to which the alien
          wants to be removed, and
            (ii) the Attorney General shall remove the alien to the
          country the alien so designates.
        (B) Limitation on designation
          An alien may designate under subparagraph (A)(i) a foreign
        territory contiguous to the United States, an adjacent island,
        or an island adjacent to a foreign territory contiguous to the
        United States as the place to which the alien is to be removed
        only if the alien is a native, citizen, subject, or national
        of, or has resided in, that designated territory or island.
        (C) Disregarding designation
          The Attorney General may disregard a designation under
        subparagraph (A)(i) if - 
            (i) the alien fails to designate a country promptly;
            (ii) the government of the country does not inform the
          Attorney General finally, within 30 days after the date the
          Attorney General first inquires, whether the government will
          accept the alien into the country;
            (iii) the government of the country is not willing to
          accept the alien into the country; or
            (iv) the Attorney General decides that removing the alien
          to the country is prejudicial to the United States.
        (D) Alternative country
          If an alien is not removed to a country designated under
        subparagraph (A)(i), the Attorney General shall remove the
        alien to a country of which the alien is a subject, national,
        or citizen unless the government of the country - 
            (i) does not inform the Attorney General or the alien
          finally, within 30 days after the date the Attorney General
          first inquires or within another period of time the Attorney
          General decides is reasonable, whether the government will
          accept the alien into the country; or
            (ii) is not willing to accept the alien into the country.
        (E) Additional removal countries
          If an alien is not removed to a country under the previous
        subparagraphs of this paragraph, the Attorney General shall
        remove the alien to any of the following countries:
            (i) The country from which the alien was admitted to the
          United States.
            (ii) The country in which is located the foreign port from
          which the alien left for the United States or for a foreign
          territory contiguous to the United States.
            (iii) A country in which the alien resided before the alien
          entered the country from which the alien entered the United
          States.
            (iv) The country in which the alien was born.
            (v) The country that had sovereignty over the alien's
          birthplace when the alien was born.
            (vi) The country in which the alien's birthplace is located
          when the alien is ordered removed.
            (vii) If impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible to
          remove the alien to each country described in a previous
          clause of this subparagraph, another country whose government
          will accept the alien into that country.
        (F) Removal country when United States is at war
          When the United States is at war and the Attorney General
        decides that it is impracticable, inadvisable, inconvenient, or
        impossible to remove an alien under this subsection because of
        the war, the Attorney General may remove the alien - 
            (i) to the country that is host to a government in exile of
          the country of which the alien is a citizen or subject if the
          government of the host country will permit the alien's entry;
          or
            (ii) if the recognized government of the country of which
          the alien is a citizen or subject is not in exile, to a
          country, or a political or territorial subdivision of a
          country, that is very near the country of which the alien is
          a citizen or subject, or, with the consent of the government
          of the country of which the alien is a citizen or subject, to
          another country.
      (3) Restriction on removal to a country where alien's life or
        freedom would be threatened
        (A) In general
          Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), the Attorney General
        may not remove an alien to a country if the Attorney General
        decides that the alien's life or freedom would be threatened in
        that country because of the alien's race, religion,
        nationality, membership in a particular social group, or
        political opinion.
        (B) Exception
          Subparagraph (A) does not apply to an alien deportable under
        section 1227(a)(4)(D) of this title or if the Attorney General
        decides that - 
            (i) the alien ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise
          participated in the persecution of an individual because of
          the individual's race, religion, nationality, membership in a
          particular social group, or political opinion;
            (ii) the alien, having been convicted by a final judgment
          of a particularly serious crime is a danger to the community
          of the United States;
            (iii) there are serious reasons to believe that the alien
          committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside the United
          States before the alien arrived in the United States; or
            (iv) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the alien
          is a danger to the security of the United States.

        For purposes of clause (ii), an alien who has been convicted of
        an aggravated felony (or felonies) for which the alien has been
        sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of at least 5
        years shall be considered to have committed a particularly
        serious crime. The previous sentence shall not preclude the
        Attorney General from determining that, notwithstanding the
        length of sentence imposed, an alien has been convicted of a
        particularly serious crime. For purposes of clause (iv), an
        alien who is described in section 1227(a)(4)(B) of this title
        shall be considered to be an alien with respect to whom there
        are reasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to the
        security of the United States.
        (C) Sustaining burden of proof; credibility determinations
          In determining whether an alien has demonstrated that the
        alien's life or freedom would be threatened for a reason
        described in subparagraph (A), the trier of fact shall
        determine whether the alien has sustained the alien's burden of
        proof, and shall make credibility determinations, in the manner
        described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of section 1158(b)(1)(B) of
        this title.
    (c) Removal of aliens arriving at port of entry
      (1) Vessels and aircraft
        An alien arriving at a port of entry of the United States who
      is ordered removed either without a hearing under section
      1225(b)(1) or 1225(c) of this title or pursuant to proceedings
      under section 1229a of this title initiated at the time of such
      alien's arrival shall be removed immediately on a vessel or

            including obtaining necessary travel documents, but not to
            extend beyond the date on which it is ascertained that such
            travel documents cannot be obtained from the country to
            which the stowaway is to be returned, or
              (III) section 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii) of this title, for a
            period not to exceed 15 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays,

            persecution.
        (B) Nonapplication

            (ii) the alien has an immigrant visa;
            (iii) the alien has a nonimmigrant visa or other

          Attorney General that the existence of the condition relating

          vessel or aircraft; or
            (vi) the individual claims to be a national of the United
          States and has a United States passport.

      (except an alien crewmember) to the United States shall - 
          (A) receive an alien back on the vessel or aircraft or

        interests if the alien is ordered removed under this part; and
          (B) take the alien to the foreign country to which the alien
        is ordered removed.
      (2) Alien stowaways
        An owner, agent, master, commanding officer, charterer, or
      consignee of a vessel or aircraft arriving in the United States
      with an alien stowaway - 
          (A) shall detain the alien on board the vessel or aircraft,
        or at such place as the Attorney General shall designate, until

      The Attorney General shall grant a timely request to remove the
      stowaway under subparagraph (C) on a vessel or aircraft other
      than that on which the stowaway arrived if the requester has
      obtained any travel documents necessary for departure or
      repatriation of the stowaway and removal of the stowaway will not
      be unreasonably delayed.
      (3) Removal upon order
        An owner, agent, master, commanding officer, person in charge,
      purser, or consignee of a vessel, aircraft, or other
      transportation line shall comply with an order of the Attorney
      General to take on board, guard safely, and transport to the
      destination specified any alien ordered to be removed under this
      chapter.
    (e) Payment of expenses of removal
      (1) Costs of removal at time of arrival

      removed either without a hearing under section 1225(a)(1) (!5) or
      1225(c) of this title or pursuant to proceedings under section
      1229a of this title initiated at the time of such alien's
      arrival, the owner of the vessel or aircraft (if any) on which
      the alien arrived in the United States shall pay the
      transportation cost of removing the alien. If removal is on a
      vessel or aircraft not owned by the owner of the vessel or
      aircraft on which the alien arrived in the United States, the
      Attorney General may - 

          (A) pay the cost from the appropriation "Immigration and
        Naturalization Service - Salaries and Expenses"; and
          (B) recover the amount of the cost in a civil action from the
        owner, agent, or consignee of the vessel or aircraft (if any)
        on which the alien arrived in the United States.
      (2) Costs of removal to port of removal for aliens admitted or
        permitted to land
        In the case of an alien who has been admitted or permitted to
      land and is ordered removed, the cost (if any) of removal of the
      alien to the port of removal shall be at the expense of the
      appropriation for the enforcement of this chapter.
      (3) Costs of removal from port of removal for aliens admitted or
        permitted to land
        (A) Through appropriation
          Except as provided in subparagraph (B), in the case of an
        alien who has been admitted or permitted to land and is ordered
        removed, the cost (if any) of removal of the alien from the
        port of removal shall be at the expense of the appropriation
        for the enforcement of this chapter.
        (B) Through owner
          (i) In general
            In the case of an alien described in clause (ii), the cost
          of removal of the alien from the port of removal may be
          charged to any owner of the vessel, aircraft, or other
          transportation line by which the alien came to the United
          States.
          (ii) Aliens described
            An alien described in this clause is an alien who - 
              (I) is admitted to the United States (other than lawfully
            admitted for permanent residence) and is ordered removed
            within 5 years of the date of admission based on a ground
            that existed before or at the time of admission, or
              (II) is an alien crewman permitted to land temporarily
            under section 1282 of this title and is ordered removed
            within 5 years of the date of landing.
        (C) Costs of removal of certain aliens granted voluntary
          departure
          In the case of an alien who has been granted voluntary
        departure under section 1229c of this title and who is
        financially unable to depart at the alien's own expense and
        whose removal the Attorney General deems to be in the best
        interest of the United States, the expense of such removal may
        be paid from the appropriation for the enforcement of this
        chapter.
    (f) Aliens requiring personal care during removal
      (1) In general
        If the Attorney General believes that an alien being removed
      requires personal care because of the alien's mental or physical
      condition, the Attorney General may employ a suitable person for
      that purpose who shall accompany and care for the alien until the
      alien arrives at the final destination.
      (2) Costs
        The costs of providing the service described in paragraph (1)
      shall be defrayed in the same manner as the expense of removing
      the accompanied alien is defrayed under this section.
    (g) Places of detention
      (1) In general
        The Attorney General shall arrange for appropriate places of
      detention for aliens detained pending removal or a decision on
      removal. When United States Government facilities are unavailable
      or facilities adapted or suitably located for detention are
      unavailable for rental, the Attorney General may expend from the
      appropriation "Immigration and Naturalization Service - Salaries
      and Expenses", without regard to section 6101 of title 41,
      amounts necessary to acquire land and to acquire, build, remodel,
      repair, and operate facilities (including living quarters for
      immigration officers if not otherwise available) necessary for
      detention.
      (2) Detention facilities of the Immigration and Naturalization
        Service
        Prior to initiating any project for the construction of any new
      detention facility for the Service, the Commissioner shall
      consider the availability for purchase or lease of any existing
      prison, jail, detention center, or other comparable facility
      suitable for such use.
    (h) Statutory construction
      Nothing in this section shall be construed to create any
    substantive or procedural right or benefit that is legally
    enforceable by any party against the United States or its agencies
    or officers or any other person.
    (i) Incarceration
      (1) If the chief executive officer of a State (or, if
    appropriate, a political subdivision of the State) exercising
    authority with respect to the incarceration of an undocumented
    criminal alien submits a written request to the Attorney General,
    the Attorney General shall, as determined by the Attorney General -
    
        (A) enter into a contractual arrangement which provides for
      compensation to the State or a political subdivision of the
      State, as may be appropriate, with respect to the incarceration
      of the undocumented criminal alien; or
        (B) take the undocumented criminal alien into the custody of
      the Federal Government and incarcerate the alien.

      (2) Compensation under paragraph (1)(A) shall be the average cost
    of incarceration of a prisoner in the relevant State as determined
    by the Attorney General.
      (3) For purposes of this subsection, the term "undocumented
    criminal alien" means an alien who - 
        (A) has been convicted of a felony or two or more misdemeanors;
      and
        (B)(i) entered the United States without inspection or at any
      time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General;
        (ii) was the subject of exclusion or deportation proceedings at
      the time he or she was taken into custody by the State or a
      political subdivision of the State; or
        (iii) was admitted as a nonimmigrant and at the time he or she
      was taken into custody by the State or a political subdivision of
      the State has failed to maintain the nonimmigrant status in which
      the alien was admitted or to which it was changed under section
      1258 of this title, or to comply with the conditions of any such
      status.

      (4)(A) In carrying out paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall
    give priority to the Federal incarceration of undocumented criminal
    aliens who have committed aggravated felonies.
      (B) The Attorney General shall ensure that undocumented criminal
    aliens incarcerated in Federal facilities pursuant to this
    subsection are held in facilities which provide a level of security
    appropriate to the crimes for which they were convicted.
      (5) There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this
    subsection - 
        (A) $750,000,000 for fiscal year 2006;
        (B) $850,000,000 for fiscal year 2007; and
        (C) $950,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2008 through
      2011.

      (6) Amounts appropriated pursuant to the authorization of
    appropriations in paragraph (5) that are distributed to a State or
    political subdivision of a State, including a municipality, may be
    used only for correctional purposes.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1232. Enhancing efforts to combat the trafficking of children

-STATUTE-
    (a) Combating child trafficking at the border and ports of entry of
      the United States
      (1) Policies and procedures
        In order to enhance the efforts of the United States to prevent
      trafficking in persons, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in
      conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General,
      and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall develop
      policies and procedures to ensure that unaccompanied alien
      children in the United States are safely repatriated to their
      country of nationality or of last habitual residence.
      (2) Special rules for children from contiguous countries
        (A) Determinations
          Any unaccompanied alien child who is a national or habitual
        resident of a country that is contiguous with the United States
        shall be treated in accordance with subparagraph (B), if the
        Secretary of Homeland Security determines, on a case-by-case
        basis, that - 
            (i) such child has not been a victim of a severe form of
          trafficking in persons, and there is no credible evidence
          that such child is at risk of being trafficked upon return to
          the child's country of nationality or of last habitual
          residence;
            (ii) such child does not have a fear of returning to the
          child's country of nationality or of last habitual residence
          owing to a credible fear of persecution; and
            (iii) the child is able to make an independent decision to
          withdraw the child's application for admission to the United
          States.
        (B) Return
          An immigration officer who finds an unaccompanied alien child
        described in subparagraph (A) at a land border or port of entry
        of the United States and determines that such child is
        inadmissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8
        U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) may - 
            (i) permit such child to withdraw the child's application
          for admission pursuant to section 235(a)(4) of the
          Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1225(a)(4)); and
            (ii) return such child to the child's country of
          nationality or country of last habitual residence.
        (C) Contiguous country agreements
          The Secretary of State shall negotiate agreements between the
        United States and countries contiguous to the United States
        with respect to the repatriation of children. Such agreements
        shall be designed to protect children from severe forms of
        trafficking in persons, and shall, at a minimum, provide that -
        
            (i) no child shall be returned to the child's country of
          nationality or of last habitual residence unless returned to
          appropriate employees or officials, including child welfare
          officials where available, of the accepting country's
          government;
            (ii) no child shall be returned to the child's country of
          nationality or of last habitual residence outside of
          reasonable business hours; and
            (iii) border personnel of the countries that are parties to
          such agreements are trained in the terms of such agreements.
      (3) Rule for other children
        The custody of unaccompanied alien children not described in
      paragraph (2)(A) who are apprehended at the border of the United
      States or at a United States port of entry shall be treated in
      accordance with subsection (b).
      (4) Screening
        Within 48 hours of the apprehension of a child who is believed
      to be described in paragraph (2)(A), but in any event prior to
      returning such child to the child's country of nationality or of
      last habitual residence, the child shall be screened to determine
      whether the child meets the criteria listed in paragraph (2)(A).
      If the child does not meet such criteria, or if no determination
      can be made within 48 hours of apprehension, the child shall
      immediately be transferred to the Secretary of Health and Human
      Services and treated in accordance with subsection (b). Nothing
      in this paragraph may be construed to preclude an earlier
      transfer of the child.
      (5) Ensuring the safe repatriation of children
        (A) Repatriation pilot program
          To protect children from trafficking and exploitation, the
        Secretary of State shall create a pilot program, in conjunction
        with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the
        Secretary of Homeland Security, nongovernmental organizations,
        and other national and international agencies and experts, to
        develop and implement best practices to ensure the safe and
        sustainable repatriation and reintegration of unaccompanied
        alien children into their country of nationality or of last
        habitual residence, including placement with their families,
        legal guardians, or other sponsoring agencies.
        (B) Assessment of country conditions
          The Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult the
        Department of State's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices
        and the Trafficking in Persons Report in assessing whether to
        repatriate an unaccompanied alien child to a particular
        country.
        (C) Report on repatriation of unaccompanied alien children
          Not later than 18 months after December 23, 2008, and
        annually thereafter, the Secretary of State and the Secretary
        of Health and Human Services, with assistance from the
        Secretary of Homeland Security, shall submit a report to the
        Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on
        the Judiciary of the House of Representatives on efforts to
        improve repatriation programs for unaccompanied alien children.
        Such report shall include -

          removed and the number of such children actually removed from
          the United States;
            (ii) a statement of the nationalities, ages, and gender of
          such children;
            (iii) a description of the policies and procedures used to
          effect the removal of such children from the United States
          and the steps taken to ensure that such children were safely
          and humanely repatriated to their country of nationality or
          of last habitual residence, including a description of the
          repatriation pilot program created pursuant to subparagraph
          (A);
            (iv) a description of the type of immigration relief sought
          and denied to such children;
            (v) any information gathered in assessments of country and
          local conditions pursuant to paragraph (2); and
            (vi) statistical information and other data on
          unaccompanied alien children as provided for in section
          279(b)(1)(J) of title 6.
        (D) Placement in removal proceedings
          Any unaccompanied alien child sought to be removed by the
        Department of Homeland Security, except for an unaccompanied
        alien child from a contiguous country subject to exceptions
        under subsection (a)(2), shall be - 
            (i) placed in removal proceedings under section 240 of the
          Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1229a);
            (ii) eligible for relief under section 240B of such Act (8
          U.S.C. 1229c) at no cost to the child; and
            (iii) provided access to counsel in accordance with
          subsection (c)(5).
    (b) Combating child trafficking and exploitation in the United
      States
      (1) Care and custody of unaccompanied alien children
        Consistent with section 279 of title 6, and except as otherwise
      provided under subsection (a), the care and custody of all
      unaccompanied alien children, including responsibility for their
      detention, where appropriate, shall be the responsibility of the
      Secretary of Health and Human Services.
      (2) Notification
        Each department or agency of the Federal Government shall
      notify the Department of Health and Human services (!1) within 48
      hours upon - 

          (A) the apprehension or discovery of an unaccompanied alien
        child; or
          (B) any claim or suspicion that an alien in the custody of
        such department or agency is under 18 years of age.
      (3) Transfers of unaccompanied alien children
        Except in the case of exceptional circumstances, any department
      or agency of the Federal Government that has an unaccompanied
      alien child in custody shall transfer the custody of such child
      to the Secretary of Health and Human Services not later than 72
      hours after determining that such child is an unaccompanied alien
      child.
      (4) Age determinations
        The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation
      with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall develop procedures
      to make a prompt determination of the age of an alien, which
      shall be used by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the
      Secretary of Health and Human Services for children in their
      respective custody. At a minimum, these procedures shall take
      into account multiple forms of evidence, including the non-
      exclusive use of radiographs, to determine the age of the
      unaccompanied alien.
    (c) Providing safe and secure placements for children
      (1) Policies and programs
        The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary of
      Homeland Security, Attorney General, and Secretary of State shall
      establish policies and programs to ensure that unaccompanied
      alien children in the United States are protected from
      traffickers and other persons seeking to victimize or otherwise
      engage such children in criminal, harmful, or exploitative
      activity, including policies and programs reflecting best
      practices in witness security programs.
      (2) Safe and secure placements
        Subject to section 279(b)(2) of title 6, an unaccompanied alien
      child in the custody of the Secretary of Health and Human
      Services shall be promptly placed in the least restrictive
      setting that is in the best interest of the child. In making such
      placements, the Secretary may consider danger to self, danger to
      the community, and risk of flight. Placement of child trafficking
      victims may include placement in an Unaccompanied Refugee Minor
      program, pursuant to section 412(d) of the Immigration and
      Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1522(d)), if a suitable family member
      is not available to provide care. A child shall not be placed in
      a secure facility absent a determination that the child poses a
      danger to self or others or has been charged with having
      committed a criminal offense. The placement of a child in a
      secure facility shall be reviewed, at a minimum, on a monthly
      basis, in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Secretary,
      to determine if such placement remains warranted.
      (3) Safety and suitability assessments
        (A) In general
          Subject to the requirements of subparagraph (B), an
        unaccompanied alien child may not be placed with a person or
        entity unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services makes
        a determination that the proposed custodian is capable of
        providing for the child's physical and mental well-being. Such
        determination shall, at a minimum, include verification of the
        custodian's identity and relationship to the child, if any, as
        well as an independent finding that the individual has not
        engaged in any activity that would indicate a potential risk to
        the child.
        (B) Home studies
          Before placing the child with an individual, the Secretary of
        Health and Human Services shall determine whether a home study
        is first necessary. A home study shall be conducted for a child
        who is a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, a
        special needs child with a disability (as defined in section
        12102 of title 42), a child who has been a victim of physical
        or sexual abuse under circumstances that indicate that the
        child's health or welfare has been significantly harmed or
        threatened, or a child whose proposed sponsor clearly presents
        a risk of abuse, maltreatment, exploitation, or trafficking to
        the child based on all available objective evidence. The
        Secretary of Health and Human Services shall conduct follow-up
        services, during the pendency of removal proceedings, on
        children for whom a home study was conducted and is authorized
        to conduct follow-up services in cases involving children with
        mental health or other needs who could benefit from ongoing
        assistance from a social welfare agency.
        (C) Access to information
          Not later than 2 weeks after receiving a request from the
        Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of
        Homeland Security shall provide information necessary to
        conduct suitability assessments from appropriate Federal,
        State, and local law enforcement and immigration databases.
      (4) Legal orientation presentations
        The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall cooperate with
      the Executive Office for Immigration Review to ensure that
      custodians receive legal orientation presentations provided
      through the Legal Orientation Program administered by the
      Executive Office for Immigration Review. At a minimum, such
      presentations shall address the custodian's responsibility to
      attempt to ensure the child's appearance at all immigration
      proceedings and to protect the child from mistreatment,
      exploitation, and trafficking.
      (5) Access to counsel
        The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall ensure, to the
      greatest extent practicable and consistent with section 292 of
      the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1362), that all
      unaccompanied alien children who are or have been in the custody
      of the Secretary or the Secretary of Homeland Security, and who
      are not described in subsection (a)(2)(A), have counsel to
      represent them in legal proceedings or matters and protect them
      from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking. To the greatest
      extent practicable, the Secretary of Health and Human Services
      shall make every effort to utilize the services of pro bono

      child advocate shall not be compelled to testify or provide
      evidence in any proceeding concerning any information or opinion

    contact with unaccompanied alien children. Such personnel shall be
    trained to work with unaccompanied alien children, including
    identifying children who are victims of severe forms of trafficking

    Sec. 1252. Judicial review of orders of removal

-STATUTE-
    (a) Applicable provisions
      (1) General orders of removal
        Judicial review of a final order of removal (other than an
      order of removal without a hearing pursuant to section 1225(b)(1)
      of this title) is governed only by chapter 158 of title 28,
      except as provided in subsection (b) of this section and except
      that the court may not order the taking of additional evidence
      under section 2347(c) of such title.
      (2) Matters not subject to judicial review
        (A) Review relating to section 1225(b)(1)
          Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or
        nonstatutory), including section 2241 of title 28, or any other
        habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such
        title, no court shall have jurisdiction to review - 
            (i) except as provided in subsection (e) of this section,
          any individual determination or to entertain any other cause
          or claim arising from or relating to the implementation or
          operation of an order of removal pursuant to section
          1225(b)(1) of this title,
            (ii) except as provided in subsection (e) of this section,
          a decision by the Attorney General to invoke the provisions
          of such section,
            (iii) the application of such section to individual aliens,
          including the determination made under section 1225(b)(1)(B)
          of this title, or
            (iv) except as provided in subsection (e) of this section,
          procedures and policies adopted by the Attorney General to
          implement the provisions of section 1225(b)(1) of this title.
        (B) Denials of discretionary relief
          Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or
        nonstatutory), including section 2241 of title 28, or any other
        habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such
        title, and except as provided in subparagraph (D), and
        regardless of whether the judgment, decision, or action is made
        in removal proceedings, no court shall have jurisdiction to
        review - 
            (i) any judgment regarding the granting of relief under
          section 1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, 1229c, or 1255 of this
          title, or
            (ii) any other decision or action of the Attorney General
          or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which
          is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of
          the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security,
          other than the granting of relief under section 1158(a) of
          this title.
        (C) Orders against criminal aliens
          Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or
        nonstatutory), including section 2241 of title 28, or any other
        habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such
        title, and except as provided in subparagraph (D), no court
        shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal
        against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed
        a criminal offense covered in section 1182(a)(2) or
        1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D) of this title, or any
        offense covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) of this title for
        which both predicate offenses are, without regard to their date
        of commission, otherwise covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) of
        this title.
        (D) Judicial review of certain legal claims
          Nothing in subparagraph (B) or (C), or in any other provision
        of this chapter (other than this section) which limits or
        eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding
        review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon
        a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of
        appeals in accordance with this section.
      (3) Treatment of certain decisions
        No alien shall have a right to appeal from a decision of an
      immigration judge which is based solely on a certification
      described in section 1229a(c)(1)(B) of this title.
      (4) Claims under the United Nations Convention
        Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or
      nonstatutory), including section 2241 of title 28, or any other
      habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such
      title, a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of
      appeals in accordance with this section shall be the sole and
      exclusive means for judicial review of any cause or claim under
      the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of
      Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, except as
      provided in subsection (e) of this section.
      (5) Exclusive means of review
        Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or
      nonstatutory), including section 2241 of title 28, or any other
      habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such
      title, a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of
      appeals in accordance with this section shall be the sole and
      exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal
      entered or issued under any provision of this chapter, except as
      provided in subsection (e) of this section. For purposes of this
      chapter, in every provision that limits or eliminates judicial
      review or jurisdiction to review, the terms "judicial review" and
      "jurisdiction to review" include habeas corpus review pursuant to
      section 2241 of title 28, or any other habeas corpus provision,
      sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, and review pursuant to any
      other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory).
    (b) Requirements for review of orders of removal
      With respect to review of an order of removal under subsection
    (a)(1) of this section, the following requirements apply:
      (1) Deadline
        The petition for review must be filed not later than 30 days
      after the date of the final order of removal.
      (2) Venue and forms
        The petition for review shall be filed with the court of
      appeals for the judicial circuit in which the immigration judge
      completed the proceedings. The record and briefs do not have to
      be printed. The court of appeals shall review the proceeding on a
      typewritten record and on typewritten briefs.
      (3) Service
        (A) In general
          The respondent is the Attorney General. The petition shall be
        served on the Attorney General and on the officer or employee
        of the Service in charge of the Service district in which the
        final order of removal under section 1229a of this title was
        entered.
        (B) Stay of order
          Service of the petition on the officer or employee does not
        stay the removal of an alien pending the court's decision on
        the petition, unless the court orders otherwise.
        (C) Alien's brief
          The alien shall serve and file a brief in connection with a
        petition for judicial review not later than 40 days after the
        date on which the administrative record is available, and may
        serve and file a reply brief not later than 14 days after
        service of the brief of the Attorney General, and the court may
        not extend these deadlines except upon motion for good cause
        shown. If an alien fails to file a brief within the time
        provided in this paragraph, the court shall dismiss the appeal
        unless a manifest injustice would result.
      (4) Scope and standard for review
        Except as provided in paragraph (5)(B) - 
          (A) the court of appeals shall decide the petition only on
        the administrative record on which the order of removal is
        based,
          (B) the administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless
        any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to
        the contrary,
          (C) a decision that an alien is not eligible for admission to
        the United States is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to
        law, and
          (D) the Attorney General's discretionary judgment whether to
        grant relief under section 1158(a) of this title shall be
        conclusive unless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse
        of discretion.

      No court shall reverse a determination made by a trier of fact
      with respect to the availability of corroborating evidence, as
      described in section 1158(b)(1)(B), 1229a(c)(4)(B), or
      1231(b)(3)(C) of this title, unless the court finds, pursuant to
      subsection (b)(4)(B) of this section, that a reasonable trier of
      fact is compelled to conclude that such corroborating evidence is
      unavailable.
      (5) Treatment of nationality claims
        (A) Court determination if no issue of fact
          If the petitioner claims to be a national of the United
        States and the court of appeals finds from the pleadings and
        affidavits that no genuine issue of material fact about the
        petitioner's nationality is presented, the court shall decide
        the nationality claim.
        (B) Transfer if issue of fact
          If the petitioner claims to be a national of the United
        States and the court of appeals finds that a genuine issue of
        material fact about the petitioner's nationality is presented,
        the court shall transfer the proceeding to the district court
        of the United States for the judicial district in which the
        petitioner resides for a new hearing on the nationality claim
        and a decision on that claim as if an action had been brought
        in the district court under section 2201 of title 28.
        (C) Limitation on determination
          The petitioner may have such nationality claim decided only
        as provided in this paragraph.
      (6) Consolidation with review of motions to reopen or reconsider
        When a petitioner seeks review of an order under this section,
      any review sought of a motion to reopen or reconsider the order
      shall be consolidated with the review of the order.
      (7) Challenge to validity of orders in certain criminal
        proceedings
        (A) In general
          If the validity of an order of removal has not been
        judicially decided, a defendant in a criminal proceeding
        charged with violating section 1253(a) of this title may
        challenge the validity of the order in the criminal proceeding
        only by filing a separate motion before trial. The district
        court, without a jury, shall decide the motion before trial.
        (B) Claims of United States nationality
          If the defendant claims in the motion to be a national of the
        United States and the district court finds that - 
            (i) no genuine issue of material fact about the defendant's
          nationality is presented, the court shall decide the motion
          only on the administrative record on which the removal order
          is based and the administrative findings of fact are
          conclusive if supported by reasonable, substantial, and
          probative evidence on the record considered as a whole; or
            (ii) a genuine issue of material fact about the defendant's
          nationality is presented, the court shall hold a new hearing
          on the nationality claim and decide that claim as if an
          action had been brought under section 2201 of title 28.

        The defendant may have such nationality claim decided only as
        provided in this subparagraph.
        (C) Consequence of invalidation
          If the district court rules that the removal order is

      (8) Construction
        This subsection - 
          (A) does not prevent the Attorney General, after a final
        order of removal has been issued, from detaining the alien
        under section 1231(a) of this title;
          (B) does not relieve the alien from complying with section
        1231(a)(4) of this title and section 1253(g) (!1) of this
        title; and

          (C) does not require the Attorney General to defer removal of
        the alien.
      (9) Consolidation of questions for judicial review
        Judicial review of all questions of law and fact, including
      interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory
      provisions, arising from any action taken or proceeding brought
      to remove an alien from the United States under this subchapter
      shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under
      this section. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no
      court shall have jurisdiction, by habeas corpus under section
      2241 of title 28 or any other habeas corpus provision, by section
      1361 or 1651 of such title, or by any other provision of law
      (statutory or nonstatutory), to review such an order or such
      questions of law or fact.
    (c) Requirements for petition
      A petition for review or for habeas corpus of an order of removal
    - 
        (1) shall attach a copy of such order, and
        (2) shall state whether a court has upheld the validity of the
      order, and, if so, shall state the name of the court, the date of
      the court's ruling, and the kind of proceeding.
    (d) Review of final orders
      A court may review a final order of removal only if - 
        (1) the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies
      available to the alien as of right, and
        (2) another court has not decided the validity of the order,
      unless the reviewing court finds that the petition presents
      grounds that could not have been presented in the prior judicial
      proceeding or that the remedy provided by the prior proceeding
      was inadequate or ineffective to test the validity of the order.
    (e) Judicial review of orders under section 1225(b)(1)
      (1) Limitations on relief
        Without regard to the nature of the action or claim and without
      regard to the identity of the party or parties bringing the
      action, no court may - 
          (A) enter declaratory, injunctive, or other equitable relief
        in any action pertaining to an order to exclude an alien in
        accordance with section 1225(b)(1) of this title except as
        specifically authorized in a subsequent paragraph of this
        subsection, or
          (B) certify a class under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of
        Civil Procedure in any action for which judicial review is
        authorized under a subsequent paragraph of this subsection.
      (2) Habeas corpus proceedings
        Judicial review of any determination made under section
      1225(b)(1) of this title is available in habeas corpus
      proceedings, but shall be limited to determinations of - 
          (A) whether the petitioner is an alien,
          (B) whether the petitioner was ordered removed under such
        section, and
          (C) whether the petitioner can prove by a preponderance of
        the evidence that the petitioner is an alien lawfully admitted
        for permanent residence, has been admitted as a refugee under
        section 1157 of this title, or has been granted asylum under
        section 1158 of this title, such status not having been
        terminated, and is entitled to such further inquiry as
        prescribed by the Attorney General pursuant to section
        1225(b)(1)(C) of this title.
      (3) Challenges on validity of the system
        (A) In general
          Judicial review of determinations under section 1225(b) of
        this title and its implementation is available in an action
        instituted in the United States District Court for the District
        of Columbia, but shall be limited to determinations of - 
            (i) whether such section, or any regulation issued to
          implement such section, is constitutional; or
            (ii) whether such a regulation, or a written policy
          directive, written policy guideline, or written procedure
          issued by or under the authority of the Attorney General to
          implement such section, is not consistent with applicable
          provisions of this subchapter or is otherwise in violation of
          law.
        (B) Deadlines for bringing actions
          Any action instituted under this paragraph must be filed no
        later than 60 days after the date the challenged section,
        regulation, directive, guideline, or procedure described in
        clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) is first implemented.
        (C) Notice of appeal
          A notice of appeal of an order issued by the District Court
        under this paragraph may be filed not later than 30 days after
        the date of issuance of such order.
        (D) Expeditious consideration of cases
          It shall be the duty of the District Court, the Court of
        Appeals, and the Supreme Court of the United States to advance
        on the docket and to expedite to the greatest possible extent
        the disposition of any case considered under this paragraph.
      (4) Decision
        In any case where the court determines that the petitioner - 
          (A) is an alien who was not ordered removed under section
        1225(b)(1) of this title, or
          (B) has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that
        the alien is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent
        residence, has been admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of
        this title, or has been granted asylum under section 1158 of
        this title, the court may order no remedy or relief other than
        to require that the petitioner be provided a hearing in
        accordance with section 1229a of this title. Any alien who is
        provided a hearing under section 1229a of this title pursuant
        to this paragraph may thereafter obtain judicial review of any
        resulting final order of removal pursuant to subsection (a)(1)
        of this section.
      (5) Scope of inquiry
        In determining whether an alien has been ordered removed under
      section 1225(b)(1) of this title, the court's inquiry shall be
      limited to whether such an order in fact was issued and whether
      it relates to the petitioner. There shall be no review of whether
      the alien is actually inadmissible or entitled to any relief from
      removal.
    (f) Limit on injunctive relief
      (1) In general
        Regardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the
      identity of the party or parties bringing the action, no court
      (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or
      authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of the provisions
      of part IV of this subchapter, as amended by the Illegal
      Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996,
      other than with respect to the application of such provisions to
      an individual alien against whom proceedings under such part have
      been initiated.
      (2) Particular cases
        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall
      enjoin the removal of any alien pursuant to a final order under
      this section unless the alien shows by clear and convincing
      evidence that the entry or execution of such order is prohibited
      as a matter of law.
    (g) Exclusive jurisdiction
      Except as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other
    provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), including section
    2241 of title 28, or any other habeas corpus provision, and
    sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, no court shall have
    jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any
    alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General
    to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal
    orders against any alien under this chapter.

        (2) has previously been convicted of a felony in the United
      States and deported or left the United States after such

    appropriate confirmation from the Immigration and Naturalization
    Service of the status of such individual and only for such period
    of time as may be required for the Service to take the individual
    into Federal custody for purposes of deporting or removing the

    Sec. 1253. Penalties related to removal

-STATUTE-
    (a) Penalty for failure to depart
      (1) In general
        Any alien against whom a final order of removal is outstanding
      by reason of being a member of any of the classes described in
      section 1227(a) of this title, who - 
          (A) willfully fails or refuses to depart from the United
        States within a period of 90 days from the date of the final
        order of removal under administrative processes, or if judicial
        review is had, then from the date of the final order of the
        court,
          (B) willfully fails or refuses to make timely application in
        good faith for travel or other documents necessary to the
        alien's departure,
          (C) connives or conspires, or takes any other action,
        designed to prevent or hamper or with the purpose of preventing
        or hampering the alien's departure pursuant to such, or
          (D) willfully fails or refuses to present himself or herself
        for removal at the time and place required by the Attorney
        General pursuant to such order,

      shall be fined under title 18, or imprisoned not more than four
      years (or 10 years if the alien is a member of any of the classes
      described in paragraph (1)(E), (2), (3), or (4) of section
      1227(a) of this title), or both.
      (2) Exception
        It is not a violation of paragraph (1) to take any proper steps
      for the purpose of securing cancellation of or exemption from
      such order of removal or for the purpose of securing the alien's
      release from incarceration or custody.
      (3) Suspension
        The court may for good cause suspend the sentence of an alien
      under this subsection and order the alien's release under such
      conditions as the court may prescribe. In determining whether
      good cause has been shown to justify releasing the alien, the
      court shall take into account such factors as - 
          (A) the age, health, and period of detention of the alien;
          (B) the effect of the alien's release upon the national
        security and public peace or safety;
          (C) the likelihood of the alien's resuming or following a
        course of conduct which made or would make the alien
        deportable;
          (D) the character of the efforts made by such alien himself
        and by representatives of the country or countries to which the
        alien's removal is directed to expedite the alien's departure
        from the United States;
          (E) the reason for the inability of the Government of the
        United States to secure passports, other travel documents, or
        removal facilities from the country or countries to which the
        alien has been ordered removed; and
          (F) the eligibility of the alien for discretionary relief
        under the immigration laws.
    (b) Willful failure to comply with terms of release under
      supervision
      An alien who shall willfully fail to comply with regulations or
    requirements issued pursuant to section 1231(a)(3) of this title or
    knowingly give false information in response to an inquiry under
    such section shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for
    not more than one year, or both.
    (c) Penalties relating to vessels and aircraft
      (1) Civil penalties
        (A) Failure to carry out certain orders
          If the Attorney General is satisfied that a person has
        violated subsection (d) or (e) of section 1231 of this title,
        the person shall pay to the Commissioner the sum of $2,000 for
        each violation.
        (B) Failure to remove alien stowaways
          If the Attorney General is satisfied that a person has failed
        to remove an alien stowaway as required under section
        1231(d)(2) of this title, the person shall pay to the
        Commissioner the sum of $5,000 for each alien stowaway not
        removed.
        (C) No compromise
          The Attorney General may not compromise the amount of such
        penalty under this paragraph.
      (2) Clearing vessels and aircraft
        (A) Clearance before decision on liability
          A vessel or aircraft may be granted clearance before a
        decision on liability is made under paragraph (1) only if a
        bond approved by the Attorney General or an amount sufficient
        to pay the civil penalty is deposited with the Commissioner.
        (B) Prohibition on clearance while penalty unpaid
          A vessel or aircraft may not be granted clearance if a civil
        penalty imposed under paragraph (1) is not paid.
    (d) Discontinuing granting visas to nationals of country denying or
      delaying accepting alien
      On being notified by the Attorney General that the government of
    a foreign country denies or unreasonably delays accepting an alien
    who is a citizen, subject, national, or resident of that country
    after the Attorney General asks whether the government will accept
    the alien under this section, the Secretary of State shall order
    consular officers in that foreign country to discontinue granting
    immigrant visas or nonimmigrant visas, or both, to citizens,
    subjects, nationals, and residents of that country until the
    Attorney General notifies the Secretary that the country has
    accepted the alien.

      case of eligibility for benefits under paragraph (1), but for the
      fact that the period of registration under subsection
      (c)(1)(A)(iv) of this section has not begun, until the alien has
      had a reasonable opportunity to register during the first 30 days
      of such period, the Attorney General shall provide for the
      benefits of paragraph (1).
        (B) In the case of an alien who establishes a prima facie case
      of eligibility for benefits under paragraph (1), until a final
      determination with respect to the alien's eligibility for such
      benefits under paragraph (1) has been made, the alien shall be
      provided such benefits.
      (5) Clarification
        Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing the
      Attorney General to deny temporary protected status to an alien
      based on the alien's immigration status or to require any alien,
      as a condition of being granted such status, either to relinquish
      nonimmigrant or other status the alien may have or to execute any
      waiver of other rights under this chapter. The granting of
      temporary protected status under this section shall not be
      considered to be inconsistent with the granting of nonimmigrant
      status under this chapter.
    (b) Designations
      (1) In general
        The Attorney General, after consultation with appropriate
      agencies of the Government, may designate any foreign state (or
      any part of such foreign state) under this subsection only if - 
          (A) the Attorney General finds that there is an ongoing armed
        conflict within the state and, due to such conflict, requiring
        the return of aliens who are nationals of that state to that
        state (or to the part of the state) would pose a serious threat
        to their personal safety;
          (B) the Attorney General finds that - 
            (i) there has been an earthquake, flood, drought, epidemic,
          or other environmental disaster in the state resulting in a
          substantial, but temporary, disruption of living conditions
          in the area affected,
            (ii) the foreign state is unable, temporarily, to handle
          adequately the return to the state of aliens who are
          nationals of the state, and
            (iii) the foreign state officially has requested
          designation under this subparagraph; or

          (C) the Attorney General finds that there exist extraordinary
        and temporary conditions in the foreign state that prevent
        aliens who are nationals of the state from returning to the
        state in safety, unless the Attorney General finds that
        permitting the aliens to remain temporarily in the United
        States is contrary to the national interest of the United
        States.

      A designation of a foreign state (or part of such foreign state)
      under this paragraph shall not become effective unless notice of
      the designation (including a statement of the findings under this
      paragraph and the effective date of the designation) is published
      in the Federal Register. In such notice, the Attorney General
      shall also state an estimate of the number of nationals of the
      foreign state designated who are (or within the effective period
      of the designation are likely to become) eligible for temporary
      protected status under this section and their immigration status
      in the United States.
      (2) Effective period of designation for foreign states
        The designation of a foreign state (or part of such foreign
      state) under paragraph (1) shall - 
          (A) take effect upon the date of publication of the
        designation under such paragraph, or such later date as the
        Attorney General may specify in the notice published under such
        paragraph, and
          (B) shall remain in effect until the effective date of the
        termination of the designation under paragraph (3)(B).

      For purposes of this section, the initial period of designation
      of a foreign state (or part thereof) under paragraph (1) is the
      period, specified by the Attorney General, of not less than 6
      months and not more than 18 months.
      (3) Periodic review, terminations, and extensions of designations
        (A) Periodic review
          At least 60 days before end of the initial period of
        designation, and any extended period of designation, of a
        foreign state (or part thereof) under this section the Attorney
        General, after consultation with appropriate agencies of the
        Government, shall review the conditions in the foreign state
        (or part of such foreign state) for which a designation is in
        effect under this subsection and shall determine whether the
        conditions for such designation under this subsection continue
        to be met. The Attorney General shall provide on a timely basis
        for the publication of notice of each such determination
        (including the basis for the determination, and, in the case of
        an affirmative determination, the period of extension of
        designation under subparagraph (C)) in the Federal Register.
        (B) Termination of designation
          If the Attorney General determines under subparagraph (A)
        that a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) no longer
        continues to meet the conditions for designation under
        paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall terminate the
        designation by publishing notice in the Federal Register of the
        determination under this subparagraph (including the basis for
        the determination). Such termination is effective in accordance
        with subsection (d)(3) of this section, but shall not be
        effective earlier than 60 days after the date the notice is
        published or, if later, the expiration of the most recent
        previous extension under subparagraph (C).
        (C) Extension of designation
          If the Attorney General does not determine under subparagraph
        (A) that a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) no
        longer meets the conditions for designation under paragraph
        (1), the period of designation of the foreign state is extended
        for an additional period of 6 months (or, in the discretion of
        the Attorney General, a period of 12 or 18 months).
      (4) Information concerning protected status at time of
        designations
        At the time of a designation of a foreign state under this
      subsection, the Attorney General shall make available information
      respecting the temporary protected status made available to
      aliens who are nationals of such designated foreign state.
      (5) Review
        (A) Designations
          There is no judicial review of any determination of the
        Attorney General with respect to the designation, or
        termination or extension of a designation, of a foreign state
        under this subsection.
        (B) Application to individuals
          The Attorney General shall establish an administrative
        procedure for the review of the denial of benefits to aliens
        under this subsection. Such procedure shall not prevent an
        alien from asserting protection under this section in removal
        proceedings if the alien demonstrates that the alien is a
        national of a state designated under paragraph (1).
    (c) Aliens eligible for temporary protected status
      (1) In general
        (A) Nationals of designated foreign states
          Subject to paragraph (3), an alien, who is a national of a
        state designated under subsection (b)(1) of this section (or in
        the case of an alien having no nationality, is a person who
        last habitually resided in such designated state), meets the
        requirements of this paragraph only if - 
            (i) the alien has been continuously physically present in
          the United States since the effective date of the most recent
          designation of that state;
            (ii) the alien has continuously resided in the United
          States since such date as the Attorney General may designate;
            (iii) the alien is admissible as an immigrant, except as
          otherwise provided under paragraph (2)(A), and is not
          ineligible for temporary protected status under paragraph
          (2)(B); and
            (iv) to the extent and in a manner which the Attorney
          General establishes, the alien registers for the temporary
          protected status under this section during a registration
          period of not less than 180 days.
        (B) Registration fee
          The Attorney General may require payment of a reasonable fee
        as a condition of registering an alien under subparagraph
        (A)(iv) (including providing an alien with an "employment
        authorized" endorsement or other appropriate work permit under
        this section). The amount of any such fee shall not exceed $50.
        In the case of aliens registered pursuant to a designation
        under this section made after July 17, 1991, the Attorney
        General may impose a separate, additional fee for providing an
        alien with documentation of work authorization. Notwithstanding
        section 3302 of title 31, all fees collected under this
        subparagraph shall be credited to the appropriation to be used
        in carrying out this section.
      (2) Eligibility standards
        (A) Waiver of certain grounds for inadmissibility
          In the determination of an alien's admissibility for purposes
        of subparagraph (A)(iii) of paragraph (1) - 
            (i) the provisions of paragraphs (5) and (7)(A) of section
          1182(a) of this title shall not apply;
            (ii) except as provided in clause (iii), the Attorney
          General may waive any other provision of section 1182(a) of
          this title in the case of individual aliens for humanitarian
          purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in
          the public interest; but
            (iii) the Attorney General may not waive - 
              (I) paragraphs (2)(A) and (2)(B) (relating to criminals)
            of such section,
              (II) paragraph (2)(C) of such section (relating to drug
            offenses), except for so much of such paragraph as relates
            to a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or
            less of marijuana, or
              (III) paragraphs (3)(A), (3)(B), (3)(C), and (3)(E) of
            such section (relating to national security and
            participation in the Nazi persecutions or those who have
            engaged in genocide).
        (B) Aliens ineligible
          An alien shall not be eligible for temporary protected status
        under this section if the Attorney General finds that - 
            (i) the alien has been convicted of any felony or 2 or more
          misdemeanors committed in the United States, or
            (ii) the alien is described in section 1158(b)(2)(A) of
          this title.
      (3) Withdrawal of temporary protected status
        The Attorney General shall withdraw temporary protected status
      granted to an alien under this section if - 
          (A) the Attorney General finds that the alien was not in fact
        eligible for such status under this section,
          (B) except as provided in paragraph (4) and permitted in
        subsection (f)(3) of this section, the alien has not remained
        continuously physically present in the United States from the
        date the alien first was granted temporary protected status
        under this section, or
          (C) the alien fails, without good cause, to register with the
        Attorney General annually, at the end of each 12-month period
        after the granting of such status, in a form and manner
        specified by the Attorney General.
      (4) Treatment of brief, casual, and innocent departures and
        certain other absences
        (A) For purposes of paragraphs (1)(A)(i) and (3)(B), an alien
      shall not be considered to have failed to maintain continuous
      physical presence in the United States by virtue of brief,
      casual, and innocent absences from the United States, without
      regard to whether such absences were authorized by the Attorney
      General.
        (B) For purposes of paragraph (1)(A)(ii), an alien shall not be
      considered to have failed to maintain continuous residence in the
      United States by reason of a brief, casual, and innocent absence
      described in subparagraph (A) or due merely to a brief temporary
      trip abroad required by emergency or extenuating circumstances
      outside the control of the alien.
      (5) Construction
        Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing an
      alien to apply for admission to, or to be admitted to, the United
      States in order to apply for temporary protected status under
      this section.
      (6) Confidentiality of information
        The Attorney General shall establish procedures to protect the
      confidentiality of information provided by aliens under this
      section.
    (d) Documentation
      (1) Initial issuance
        Upon the granting of temporary protected status to an alien
      under this section, the Attorney General shall provide for the
      issuance of such temporary documentation and authorization as may
      be necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.
      (2) Period of validity
        Subject to paragraph (3), such documentation shall be valid
      during the initial period of designation of the foreign state (or
      part thereof) involved and any extension of such period. The
      Attorney General may stagger the periods of validity of the
      documentation and authorization in order to provide for an
      orderly renewal of such documentation and authorization and for
      an orderly transition (under paragraph (3)) upon the termination
      of a designation of a foreign state (or any part of such foreign
      state).
      (3) Effective date of terminations
        If the Attorney General terminates the designation of a foreign
      state (or part of such foreign state) under subsection (b)(3)(B)
      of this section, such termination shall only apply to
      documentation and authorization issued or renewed after the
      effective date of the publication of notice of the determination
      under that subsection (or, at the Attorney General's option,
      after such period after the effective date of the determination
      as the Attorney General determines to be appropriate in order to
      provide for an orderly transition).
      (4) Detention of alien
        An alien provided temporary protected status under this section
      shall not be detained by the Attorney General on the basis of the
      alien's immigration status in the United States.
    (e) Relation of period of temporary protected status to
      cancellation of removal
      With respect to an alien granted temporary protected status under
    this section, the period of such status shall not be counted as a
    period of physical presence in the United States for purposes of
    section 1229b(a) of this title, unless the Attorney General
    determines that extreme hardship exists. Such period shall not
    cause a break in the continuity of residence of the period before
    and after such period for purposes of such section.
    (f) Benefits and status during period of temporary protected status
      During a period in which an alien is granted temporary protected
    status under this section - 
        (1) the alien shall not be considered to be permanently
      residing in the United States under color of law;
        (2) the alien may be deemed ineligible for public assistance by
      a State (as defined in section 1101(a)(36) of this title) or any
      political subdivision thereof which furnishes such assistance;
        (3) the alien may travel abroad with the prior consent of the
      Attorney General; and
        (4) for purposes of adjustment of status under section 1255 of
      this title and change of status under section 1258 of this title,
      the alien shall be considered as being in, and maintaining,
      lawful status as a nonimmigrant.
    (g) Exclusive remedy
      Except as otherwise specifically provided, this section shall
    constitute the exclusive authority of the Attorney General under
    law to permit aliens who are or may become otherwise deportable or
    have been paroled into the United States to remain in the United
    States temporarily because of their particular nationality or
    region of foreign state of nationality.
    (h) Limitation on consideration in Senate of legislation adjusting
      status
      (1) In general
        Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall not be in order
      in the Senate to consider any bill, resolution, or amendment that
      - 
          (A) provides for adjustment to lawful temporary or permanent
        resident alien status for any alien receiving temporary
        protected status under this section, or
          (B) has the effect of amending this subsection or limiting
        the application of this subsection.
      (2) Supermajority required
        Paragraph (1) may be waived or suspended in the Senate only by
      the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members duly chosen
      and sworn. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of
      the Senate duly chosen and sworn shall be required in the Senate
      to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of
      order raised under paragraph (1).
      (3) Rules
        Paragraphs (1) and (2) are enacted - 
          (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and
        as such they are deemed a part of the rules of the Senate, but
        applicable only with respect to the matters described in
        paragraph (1) and supersede other rules of the Senate only to
        the extent that such paragraphs are inconsistent therewith; and
          (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of the
        Senate to change such rules at any time, in the same manner as
        in the case of any other rule of the Senate.
    (i) Annual report and review
      (1) Annual report
        Not later than March 1 of each year (beginning with 1992), the
      Attorney General, after consultation with the appropriate
      agencies of the Government, shall submit a report to the
      Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and
      of the Senate on the operation of this section during the
      previous year. Each report shall include - 
          (A) a listing of the foreign states or parts thereof
        designated under this section,
          (B) the number of nationals of each such state who have been
        granted temporary protected status under this section and their
        immigration status before being granted such status, and
          (C) an explanation of the reasons why foreign states or parts
        thereof were designated under subsection (b)(1) of this section
        and, with respect to foreign states or parts thereof previously
        designated, why the designation was terminated or extended
        under subsection (b)(3) of this section.
      (2) Committee report
        No later than 180 days after the date of receipt of such a
      report, the Committee on the Judiciary of each House of Congress
      shall report to its respective House such oversight findings and
      legislation as it deems appropriate.

      Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1254a], the Service
      shall cancel such orders.
        "(2) Sanction for failure to appear. - If an alien is provided

        and
          (B) the Attorney General may waive other paragraphs of
        section 1182(a) of this title (other than paragraphs (2)(A),
        (2)(B), (2)(C) (except for so much of such paragraph as related
        to a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of
        marijuana), (3)(A), (3)(B), (3)(C), and (3)(E)) in the case of
        individual aliens for humanitarian purposes, family unity, or
        when it is otherwise in the public interest.

    The relationship between an alien and the alien's natural parents
    or prior adoptive parents shall not be considered a factor in
    making a waiver under paragraph (2)(B). Nothing in this subsection
    or section 1101(a)(27)(J) of this title shall be construed as
    authorizing an alien to apply for admission or be admitted to the
    United States in order to obtain special immigrant status described
    in such section.
    (i) Adjustment in status of certain aliens physically present in
      United States
      (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of
    this section, an alien physically present in the United States - 
        (A) who - 
          (i) entered the United States without inspection; or
          (ii) is within one of the classes enumerated in subsection
        (c) of this section;

        (B) who is the beneficiary (including a spouse or child of the
      principal alien, if eligible to receive a visa under section
      1153(d) of this title) of - 
          (i) a petition for classification under section 1154 of this
        title that was filed with the Attorney General on or before
        April 30, 2001; or
          (ii) an application for a labor certification under section
        1182(a)(5)(A) of this title that was filed pursuant to the
        regulations of the Secretary of Labor on or before such date;
        and

        (C) who, in the case of a beneficiary of a petition for
      classification, or an application for labor certification,

      1998, is physically present in the United States on December 21,
      2000;

    may apply to the Attorney General for the adjustment of his or her
    status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent
    residence. The Attorney General may accept such application only if
    the alien remits with such application a sum equalling $1,000 as of
    the date of receipt of the application, but such sum shall not be
    required from a child under the age of seventeen, or an alien who
    is the spouse or unmarried child of an individual who obtained
    temporary or permanent resident status under section 1160 or 1255a
    of this title or section 202 of the Immigration Reform and Control
    Act of 1986 at any date, who - 
        (i) as of May 5, 1988, was the unmarried child or spouse of the
      individual who obtained temporary or permanent resident status
      under section 1160 or 1255a of this title or section 202 of the
      Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986;
        (ii) entered the United States before May 5, 1988, resided in
      the United States on May 5, 1988, and is not a lawful permanent
      resident; and
        (iii) applied for benefits under section 301(a) of the
      Immigration Act of 1990. The sum specified herein shall be in
      addition to the fee normally required for the processing of an
      application under this section.

      (2) Upon receipt of such an application and the sum hereby
    required, the Attorney General may adjust the status of the alien
    to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if - 
        (A) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is
      admissible to the United States for permanent residence; and
        (B) an immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at
      the time the application is filed.

      (3)(A) The portion of each application fee (not to exceed $200)
    that the Attorney General determines is required to process an
    application under this section and is remitted to the Attorney
    General pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection shall
    be disposed of by the Attorney General as provided in subsections
    (m), (n), and (o) of section 1356 of this title.
      (B) Any remaining portion of such fees remitted under such
    paragraphs shall be deposited by the Attorney General into the
    Breached Bond/Detention Fund established under section 1356(r) of
    this title, except that in the case of fees attributable to
    applications for a beneficiary with respect to whom a petition for
    classification, or an application for labor certification,
    described in paragraph (1)(B) was filed after January 14, 1998, one-
    half of such remaining portion shall be deposited by the Attorney
    General into the Immigration Examinations Fee Account established
    under section 1356(m) of this title.
    (j) Adjustment to permanent resident status
      (1) If, in the opinion of the Attorney General - 
        (A) a nonimmigrant admitted into the United States under
      section 1101(a)(15)(S)(i) of this title has supplied information
      described in subclause (I) of such section; and
        (B) the provision of such information has substantially
      contributed to the success of an authorized criminal
      investigation or the prosecution of an individual described in
      subclause (III) of that section,

    the Attorney General may adjust the status of the alien (and the
    spouse, married and unmarried sons and daughters, and parents of
    the alien if admitted under that section) to that of an alien
    lawfully admitted for permanent residence if the alien is not
    described in section 1182(a)(3)(E) of this title.
      (2) If, in the sole discretion of the Attorney General - 
        (A) a nonimmigrant admitted into the United States under
      section 1101(a)(15)(S)(ii) of this title has supplied information
      described in subclause (I) of such section, and
        (B) the provision of such information has substantially
      contributed to - 
          (i) the prevention or frustration of an act of terrorism
        against a United States person or United States property, or
          (ii) the success of an authorized criminal investigation of,
        or the prosecution of, an individual involved in such an act of
        terrorism, and

        (C) the nonimmigrant has received a reward under section
      2708(a) of title 22,

    the Attorney General may adjust the status of the alien (and the
    spouse, married and unmarried sons and daughters, and parents of
    the alien if admitted under such section) to that of an alien
    lawfully admitted for permanent residence if the alien is not
    described in section 1182(a)(3)(E) of this title.
      (3) Upon the approval of adjustment of status under paragraph (1)
    or (2), the Attorney General shall record the alien's lawful
    admission for permanent residence as of the date of such approval
    and the Secretary of State shall reduce by one the number of visas
    authorized to be issued under sections 1151(d) and 1153(b)(4) of
    this title for the fiscal year then current.
    (k) Inapplicability of certain provisions for certain employment-
      based immigrants
      An alien who is eligible to receive an immigrant visa under
    paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of section 1153(b) of this title (or, in
    the case of an alien who is an immigrant described in section
    1101(a)(27)(C) of this title, under section 1153(b)(4) of this
    title) may adjust status pursuant to subsection (a) of this section

      adjustment of status, is present in the United States pursuant to
      a lawful admission;
        (2) the alien, subsequent to such lawful admission has not, for
      an aggregate period exceeding 180 days - 
          (A) failed to maintain, continuously, a lawful status;
          (B) engaged in unauthorized employment; or
          (C) otherwise violated the terms and conditions of the
        alien's admission.
    (l) Adjustment of status for victims of trafficking
      (1) If, in the opinion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, or
    in the case of subparagraph (C)(i), in the opinion of the Secretary
    of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, as
    appropriate (!3) a nonimmigrant admitted into the United States
    under section 1101(a)(15)(T)(i) of this title -

      or has been physically present in the United States for a
      continuous period during the investigation or prosecution of acts
      of trafficking and that, in the opinion of the Attorney General,
      the investigation or prosecution is complete, whichever period of
      time is less;
        (B) subject to paragraph (6), has, throughout such period, been
      a person of good moral character; and

      acts of trafficking;

      victimization qualifying the alien for relief under section
      1101(a)(15)(T) of this title.(!5)


    the Secretary of Homeland Security may adjust the status of the
    alien (and any person admitted under section 1101(a)(15)(T)(ii) of
    this title as the spouse, parent, sibling, or child of the alien)
    to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
      (2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien admitted under
    section 1101(a)(15)(T) of this title who is inadmissible to the
    United States by reason of a ground that has not been waived under
    section 1182 of this title, except that, if the Secretary of
    Homeland Security considers it to be in the national interest to do
    so, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in the Attorney General's
    (!6) discretion, may waive the application of - 

        (A) paragraphs (1) and (4) of section 1182(a) of this title;
      and
        (B) any other provision of such section (excluding paragraphs
      (3), (10)(C), and (10(E)),(!7) if the activities rendering the
      alien inadmissible under the provision were caused by, or were
      incident to, the victimization described in section
      1101(a)(15)(T)(i)(I) of this title.


      (3) An alien shall be considered to have failed to maintain
    continuous physical presence in the United States under paragraph
    (1)(A) if the alien has departed from the United States for any
    period in excess of 90 days or for any periods in the aggregate
    exceeding 180 days, unless - 
        (A) the absence was necessary to assist in the investigation or
      prosecution described in paragraph (1)(A); or
        (B) an official involved in the investigation or prosecution
      certifies that the absence was otherwise justified.

      (4)(A) The total number of aliens whose status may be adjusted
    under paragraph (1) during any fiscal year may not exceed 5,000.
      (B) The numerical limitation of subparagraph (A) shall only apply
    to principal aliens and not to the spouses, sons, daughters,
    siblings, or parents of such aliens.
      (5) Upon the approval of adjustment of status under paragraph
    (1), the Secretary of Homeland Security shall record the alien's
    lawful admission for permanent residence as of the date of such
    approval.
      (6) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), the Secretary of Homeland
    Security may waive consideration of a disqualification from good

    1101(a)(15)(T)(i)(I) of this title.
      (7) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall permit aliens to
    apply for a waiver of any fees associated with filing an

    of status for a VAWA self-petitioner and for relief under sections
    1101(a)(15)(T), 1101(a)(15)(U), 1105a, 1229b(b)(2), and 1254a(a)(3)

    an alien admitted into the United States (or otherwise provided
    nonimmigrant status) under section 1101(a)(15)(U) of this title to
    that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if the
    alien is not described in section 1182(a)(3)(E) of this title,
    unless the Secretary determines based on affirmative evidence that
    the alien unreasonably refused to provide assistance in a criminal
    investigation or prosecution, if - 
        (A) the alien has been physically present in the United States
      for a continuous period of at least 3 years since the date of
      admission as a nonimmigrant under clause (i) or (ii) of section
      1101(a)(15)(U) of this title; and
        (B) in the opinion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, the
      alien's continued presence in the United States is justified on
      humanitarian grounds, to ensure family unity, or is otherwise in
      the public interest.

      (2) An alien shall be considered to have failed to maintain
    continuous physical presence in the United States under paragraph
    (1)(A) if the alien has departed from the United States for any
    period in excess of 90 days or for any periods in the aggregate
    exceeding 180 days unless the absence is in order to assist in the
    investigation or prosecution or unless an official involved in the
    investigation or prosecution certifies that the absence was
    otherwise justified.
      (3) Upon approval of adjustment of status under paragraph (1) of
    an alien described in section 1101(a)(15)(U)(i) of this title the
    Secretary of Homeland Security may adjust the status of or issue an
    immigrant visa to a spouse, a child, or, in the case of an alien
    child, a parent who did not receive a nonimmigrant visa under
    section 1101(a)(15)(U)(ii) of this title if the Secretary considers
    the grant of such status or visa necessary to avoid extreme
    hardship.
      (4) Upon the approval of adjustment of status under paragraph (1)
    or (3), the Secretary of Homeland Security shall record the alien's
    lawful admission for permanent residence as of the date of such
    approval.
      (5)(A) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult with the
    Attorney General, as appropriate, in making a determination under
    paragraph (1) whether affirmative evidence demonstrates that the
    alien unreasonably refused to provide assistance to a Federal law
    enforcement official, Federal prosecutor, Federal judge, or other
    Federal authority investigating or prosecuting criminal activity
    described in section 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii) of this title.
      (B) Nothing in paragraph (1)(B) may be construed to prevent the
    Secretary from consulting with the Attorney General in making a
    determination whether affirmative evidence demonstrates that the
    alien unreasonably refused to provide assistance to a State or
    local law enforcement official, State or local prosecutor, State or
    local judge, or other State or local authority investigating or
    prosecuting criminal activity described in section
    1101(a)(15)(U)(iii) of this title.

    245(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [subsec. (c) of this
    section], the status of any alien who is a native or citizen of
    Cuba and who has been inspected and admitted or paroled into the
    United States subsequent to January 1, 1959 and has been physically
    present in the United States for at least one year, may be adjusted
    by the Attorney General, in his discretion and under such
    regulations as he may prescribe, to that of an alien lawfully
    admitted for permanent residence if the alien makes an application
    for such adjustment, and the alien is eligible to receive an
    immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent
    residence. Upon approval of such an application for adjustment of
    status, the Attorney General shall create a record of the alien's
    admission for permanent residence as of a date thirty months prior
    to the filing of such an application or the date of his last
    arrival into the United States, whichever date is later. The
    provisions of this Act shall be applicable to the spouse and child
    of any alien described in this subsection, regardless of their
    citizenship and place of birth, who are residing with such alien in
    the United States, except that such spouse or child who has been
    battered or subjected to extreme cruelty may adjust to permanent
    resident status under this Act without demonstrating that he or she
    is residing with the Cuban spouse or parent in the United States.
    In acting on applications under this section with respect to
    spouses or children who have been battered or subjected to extreme
    cruelty, the Attorney General shall apply the provisions of section
    204(a)(1)(J) [probably means section 204(a)(1)(J) of the
    Immigration and Nationality Act, which is classified to section
    1154(a)(1)(J) of this title]. An alien who was the spouse of any
    Cuban alien described in this section and has resided with such
    spouse shall continue to be treated as such a spouse for 2 years
    after the date on which the Cuban alien dies (or, if later, 2 years
    after the date of enactment of Violence Against Women and
    Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005) [Jan. 5, 2006],
    or for 2 years after the date of termination of the marriage (or,
    if later, 2 years after the date of enactment of Violence Against
    Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005) if
    there is demonstrated a connection between the termination of the
    marriage and the battering or extreme cruelty by the Cuban alien.
      "Sec. 2. In the case of any alien described in section 1 of this
    Act who prior to the effective date thereof [Nov. 2, 1966], has
    been lawfully admitted into the United States for permanent
    residence, the Attorney General shall, upon application, record his
    admission for permanent residence as of the date the alien
    originally arrived in the United States as a nonimmigrant or as a
    parolee, or a date thirty months prior to the date of enactment of
    this Act [Nov. 2, 1966], whichever date is later.

          The alien shall be required, at the alien's expense, to

      establish a prima facie case of eligibility to have his status
      adjusted under subsection (a) of this section (but for the fact

      such period), until the alien has had the opportunity during the
      first 30 days of the application period to complete the filing of
      an application for adjustment, the alien - 
          (A) may not be deported, and

      period, and until a final determination on the application has
      been made in accordance with this section, the alien - 
          (A) may not be deported, and
          (B) shall be granted authorization to engage in employment in
        the United States and be provided an "employment authorized"
        endorsement or other appropriate work permit.
    (f) Administrative and judicial review
      (1) Administrative and judicial review
        There shall be no administrative or judicial review of a
      determination respecting an application for adjustment of status

      any administrative proceeding of the United States Government.
      (3) Administrative review
        (A) Single level of administrative appellate review
          The Attorney General shall establish an appellate authority
        to provide for a single level of administrative appellate
        review of a determination described in paragraph (1).
        (B) Standard for review
          Such administrative appellate review shall be based solely
        upon the administrative record established at the time of the

        newly discovered evidence as may not have been available at the
        time of the determination.
      (4) Judicial review
        (A) Limitation to review of deportation
          There shall be judicial review of such a denial only in the
        judicial review of an order of deportation under section 1105a
        of this title (as in effect before October 1, 1996).
        (B) Standard for judicial review
          Such judicial review shall be based solely upon the
        administrative record established at the time of the review by
        the appellate authority and the findings of fact and
        determinations contained in such record shall be conclusive
        unless the applicant can establish abuse of discretion or that
        the findings are directly contrary to clear and convincing
        facts contained in the record considered as a whole.
        (C) Jurisdiction of courts
          Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall
        have jurisdiction of any cause of action or claim by or on
        behalf of any person asserting an interest under this section
        unless such person in fact filed an application under this
        section within the period specified by subsection (a)(1) of
        this section, or attempted to file a complete application and
        application fee with an authorized legalization officer of the
        Service but had the application and fee refused by that
        officer.

        continuously in the United States for purposes of this section,
        and
          (B) such other regulations as may be necessary to carry out
        this section.
      (2) Considerations
        In prescribing regulations described in paragraph (1)(A) - 
        (A) Periods of continuous residence
          The Attorney General shall specify individual periods, and
        aggregate periods, of absence from the United States which will
        be considered to break a period of continuous residence in the
        United States and shall take into account absences due merely
        to brief and casual trips abroad.
        (B) Absences caused by deportation or advanced parole
          The Attorney General shall provide that - 
            (i) an alien shall not be considered to have resided
          continuously in the United States, if, during any period for
          which continuous residence is required, the alien was outside
          the United States as a result of a departure under an order
          of deportation, and
            (ii) any period of time during which an alien is outside
          the United States pursuant to the advance parole procedures
          of the Service shall not be considered as part of the period
          of time during which an alien is outside the United States
          for purposes of this section.
        (C) Waivers of certain absences
          The Attorney General may provide for a waiver, in the
        discretion of the Attorney General, of the periods specified
        under subparagraph (A) in the case of an absence from the
        United States due merely to a brief temporary trip abroad
        required by emergency or extenuating circumstances outside the
        control of the alien.
        (D) Use of certain documentation
          The Attorney General shall require that - 
            (i) continuous residence and physical presence in the
          United States must be established through documents, together
          with independent corroboration of the information contained
          in such documents, and
            (ii) the documents provided under clause (i) be employment-
          related if employment-related documents with respect to the
          alien are available to the applicant.
      (3) Interim final regulations
        Regulations prescribed under this section may be prescribed to
      take effect on an interim final basis if the Attorney General
      determines that this is necessary in order to implement this

          1396 et seq.], to be so eligible, and

      of persons admitted for permanent residence

-STATUTE-
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law - 
    (a) Application
      Any alien admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant under
    the provisions of either section 101(a)(15)(A)(i) or (ii) or
    101(a)(15)(G)(i) or (ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8
    U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(A)(i), (ii), (G)(i), (ii)], who has failed to
    maintain a status under any of those provisions, may apply to the
    Attorney General for adjustment of his status to that of an alien
    lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
    (b) Record of admission
      If, after consultation with the Secretary of State, it shall
    appear to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the alien
    has shown compelling reasons demonstrating both that the alien is
    unable to return to the country represented by the government which
    accredited the alien or the member of the alien's immediate family
    and that adjustment of the alien's status to that of an alien
    lawfully admitted for permanent residence would be in the national
    interest, that the alien is a person of good moral character, that
    he is admissible for permanent residence under the Immigration and
    Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.], and that such action would
    not be contrary to the national welfare, safety, or security, the
    Attorney General, in his discretion, may record the alien's lawful
    admission for permanent residence as of the date the order of the
    Attorney General approving the application for adjustment of status
    is made.
    (c) Report to the Congress; resolution not favoring adjustment of
      status; reduction of quota
      A complete and detailed statement of the facts and pertinent
    provisions of law in the case shall be reported to the Congress
    with the reasons for such adjustment of status. Such reports shall
    be submitted on the first day of each calendar month in which
    Congress is in session. The Secretary of State shall, if the alien
    was classifiable as a quota immigrant at the time of his entry,
    reduce by one the quota of the quota area to which the alien is
    chargeable under section 202 of the Immigration and Nationality Act
    [8 U.S.C. 1152] for the fiscal year then current or the next
    following year in which a quota is available. No quota shall be so
    reduced by more than 50 per centum in any fiscal year.
    (d) Limitations
      The number of aliens who may be granted the status of aliens
    lawfully admitted for permanent residence in any fiscal year,
    pursuant to this section, shall not exceed fifty.

    immediate family and that adjustment of the alien's status to that
    of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence would be in

      (a) If, at any time within five years after the status of a
    person has been otherwise adjusted under the provisions of section
    1255 or 1259 of this title or any other provision of law to that of
    an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, it shall appear
    to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the person was not
    in fact eligible for such adjustment of status, the Attorney
    General shall rescind the action taken granting an adjustment of
    status to such person and cancelling removal in the case of such
    person if that occurred and the person shall thereupon be subject
    to all provisions of this chapter to the same extent as if the
    adjustment of status had not been made. Nothing in this subsection
    shall require the Attorney General to rescind the alien's status
    prior to commencement of procedures to remove the alien under
    section 1229a of this title, and an order of removal issued by an
    immigration judge shall be sufficient to rescind the alien's
    status.
      (b) Any person who has become a naturalized citizen of the United
    States upon the basis of a record of a lawful admission for
    permanent residence, created as a result of an adjustment of status
    for which such person was not in fact eligible, and which is
    subsequently rescinded under subsection (a) of this section, shall
    be subject to the provisions of section 1451 of this title as a
    person whose naturalization was procured by concealment of a
    material fact or by willful misrepresentation.

      (a) The status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent
    residence shall be adjusted by the Attorney General, under such
    regulations as he may prescribe, to that of a nonimmigrant under
    paragraph (15)(A), (E), or (G) of section 1101(a) of this title, if
    such alien had at the time of admission or subsequently acquires an
    occupational status which would, if he were seeking admission to
    the United States, entitle him to a nonimmigrant status under such
    paragraphs. As of the date of the Attorney General's order making
    such adjustment of status, the Attorney General shall cancel the
    record of the alien's admission for permanent residence, and the
    immigrant status of such alien shall thereby be terminated.
      (b) The adjustment of status required by subsection (a) of this
    section shall not be applicable in the case of any alien who
    requests that he be permitted to retain his status as an immigrant
    and who, in such form as the Attorney General may require, executes
    and files with the Attorney General a written waiver of all rights,
    privileges, exemptions, and immunities under any law or any
    executive order which would otherwise accrue to him because of the
    acquisition of an occupational status entitling him to a
    nonimmigrant status under paragraph (15)(A), (E), or (G) of section
    1101(a) of this title.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Arrival; submission of list; exceptions
      Upon arrival of any vessel or aircraft in the United States from
    any place outside the United States it shall be the duty of the
    owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer thereof to
    deliver to an immigration officer at the port of arrival (1) a
    complete, true, and correct list containing the names of all aliens
    employed on such vessel or aircraft, the positions they
    respectively hold in the crew of the vessel or aircraft, when and
    where they were respectively shipped or engaged, and those to be
    paid off or discharged in the port of arrival; or (2) in the
    discretion of the Attorney General, such a list containing so much
    of such information, or such additional or supplemental
    information, as the Attorney General shall by regulations
    prescribe. In the case of a vessel engaged solely in traffic on the
    Great Lakes, Saint Lawrence River, and connecting waterways, such
    lists shall be furnished at such times as the Attorney General may
    require.
    (b) Reports of illegal landings
      It shall be the duty of any owner, agent, consignee, master, or
    commanding officer of any vessel or aircraft to report to an
    immigration officer, in writing, as soon as discovered, all cases
    in which any alien crewman has illegally landed in the United
    States from the vessel or aircraft, together with a description of
    such alien and any information likely to lead to his apprehension.
    (c) Departure; submission of list; exceptions
      Before the departure of any vessel or aircraft from any port in
    the United States, it shall be the duty of the owner, agent,
    consignee, master, or commanding officer thereof, to deliver to an
    immigration officer at that port (1) a list containing the names of
    all alien employees who were not employed thereon at the time of
    the arrival at that port but who will leave such port thereon at
    the time of the departure of such vessel or aircraft and the names
    of those, if any, who have been paid off or discharged, and of
    those, if any, who have deserted or landed at that port, or (2) in
    the discretion of the Attorney General, such a list containing so
    much of such information, or such additional or supplemental
    information, as the Attorney General shall by regulations
    prescribe. In the case of a vessel engaged solely in traffic on the
    Great Lakes, Saint Lawrence River, and connecting waterways, such
    lists shall be furnished at such times as the Attorney General may
    require.
    (d) Violations
      In case any owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding
    officer shall fail to deliver complete, true, and correct lists or
    reports of aliens, or to report cases of desertion or landing, as
    required by subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section, such
    owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer, shall, if
    required by the Attorney General, pay to the Commissioner the sum
    of $200 for each alien concerning whom such lists are not delivered
    or such reports are not made as required in the preceding
    subsections. In the case that any owner, agent, consignee, master,
    or commanding officer of a vessel shall secure services of an alien
    crewman described in section 1101(a)(15)(D)(i) of this title to
    perform longshore work not included in the normal operation and
    service on board the vessel under section 1288 of this title, the
    owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer shall pay to
    the Commissioner the sum of $5,000, and such fine shall be a lien
    against the vessel. No such vessel or aircraft shall be granted
    clearance from any port at which it arrives pending the
    determination of the question of the liability to the payment of
    such fine, and if such fine is imposed, while it remains unpaid. No
    such fine shall be remitted or refunded. Clearance may be granted
    prior to the determination of such question upon deposit of a bond
    or a sum sufficient to cover such fine.
    (e) Regulations
      The Attorney General is authorized to prescribe by regulations
    the circumstances under which a vessel or aircraft shall be deemed
    to be arriving in, or departing from the United States or any port
    thereof within the meaning of any provision of this part.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1282. Conditional permits to land temporarily

-STATUTE-
    (a) Period of time
      No alien crewman shall be permitted to land temporarily in the
    United States except as provided in this section and sections
    1182(d)(3), (5) and 1283 of this title. If an immigration officer
    finds upon examination that an alien crewman is a nonimmigrant
    under paragraph (15)(D) of section 1101(a) of this title and is
    otherwise admissible and has agreed to accept such permit, he may,
    in his discretion, grant the crewman a conditional permit to land
    temporarily pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Attorney
    General, subject to revocation in subsequent proceedings as
    provided in subsection (b) of this section, and for a period of
    time, in any event, not to exceed - 
        (1) the period of time (not exceeding twenty-nine days) during
      which the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived remains in port,
      if the immigration officer is satisfied that the crewman intends
      to depart on the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived; or
        (2) twenty-nine days, if the immigration officer is satisfied
      that the crewman intends to depart, within the period for which
      he is permitted to land, on a vessel or aircraft other than the
      one on which he arrived.
    (b) Revocation; expenses of detention
      Pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, any
    immigration officer may, in his discretion, if he determines that
    an alien is not a bona fide crewman, or does not intend to depart
    on the vessel or aircraft which brought him, revoke the conditional
    permit to land which was granted such crewman under the provisions
    of subsection (a)(1) of this section, take such crewman into
    custody, and require the master or commanding officer of the vessel
    or aircraft on which the crewman arrived to receive and detain him
    on board such vessel or aircraft, if practicable, and such crewman
    shall be removed from the United States at the expense of the
    transportation line which brought him to the United States. Until
    such alien is so removed, any expenses of his detention shall be
    borne by such transportation company. Nothing in this section shall
    be construed to require the procedure prescribed in section 1229a
    of this title to cases falling within the provisions of this
    subsection.
    (c) Penalties
      Any alien crewman who willfully remains in the United States in
    excess of the number of days allowed in any conditional permit
    issued under subsection (a) of this section shall be fined under
    title 18 or imprisoned not more than 6 months, or both.

    Sec. 1283. Hospital treatment of alien crewmen afflicted with
      certain diseases

-STATUTE-
      An alien crewman, including an alien crewman ineligible for a
    conditional permit to land under section 1282(a) of this title, who
    is found on arrival in a port of the United States to be afflicted
    with any of the disabilities or diseases mentioned in section 1285
    of this title, shall be placed in a hospital designated by the
    immigration officer in charge at the port of arrival and treated,
    all expenses connected therewith, including burial in the event of
    death, to be borne by the owner, agent, consignee, commanding
    officer, or master of the vessel or aircraft, and not to be
    deducted from the crewman's wages. No such vessel or aircraft shall
    be granted clearance until such expenses are paid, or their payment
    appropriately guaranteed, and the collector of customs is so
    notified by the immigration officer in charge. An alien crewman
    suspected of being afflicted with any such disability or disease
    may be removed from the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived to
    an immigration station, or other appropriate place, for such
    observation as will enable the examining surgeons to determine
    definitely whether or not he is so afflicted, all expenses
    connected therewith to be borne in the manner hereinbefore
    prescribed. In cases in which it appears to the satisfaction of the
    immigration officer in charge that it will not be possible within a
    reasonable time to effect a cure, the return of the alien crewman
    shall be enforced on, or at the expense of, the transportation line
    on which he came, upon such conditions as the Attorney General
    shall prescribe, to insure that the alien shall be properly cared
    for and protected, and that the spread of contagion shall be
    guarded against.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1284. Control of alien crewmen

-STATUTE-
    (a) Penalties for failure
      The owner, agent, consignee, charterer, master, or commanding
    officer of any vessel or aircraft arriving in the United States
    from any place outside thereof who fails (1) to detain on board the
    vessel, or in the case of an aircraft to detain at a place
    specified by an immigration officer at the expense of the airline,
    any alien crewman employed thereon until an immigration officer has
    completely inspected such alien crewman, including a physical
    examination by the medical examiner, or (2) to detain any alien
    crewman on board the vessel, or in the case of an aircraft at a
    place specified by an immigration officer at the expense of the
    airline, after such inspection unless a conditional permit to land
    temporarily has been granted such alien crewman under section 1282
    of this title or unless an alien crewman has been permitted to land
    temporarily under section 1182(d)(5) or 1283 of this title for
    medical or hospital treatment, or (3) to remove such alien crewman
    if required to do so by an immigration officer, whether such
    removal requirement is imposed before or after the crewman is
    permitted to land temporarily under section 1182(d)(5), 1282, or
    1283 of this title, shall pay to the Commissioner the sum of $3,000
    for each alien crewman in respect to whom any such failure occurs.
    No such vessel or aircraft shall be granted clearance pending the
    determination of the liability to the payment of such fine, or
    while the fine remains unpaid, except that clearance may be granted
    prior to the determination of such question upon the deposit of a
    sum sufficient to cover such fine, or of a bond with sufficient
    surety to secure the payment thereof approved by the Commissioner.
    The Attorney General may, upon application in writing therefor,
    mitigate such penalty to not less than $500 for each alien crewman
    in respect of whom such failure occurs, upon such terms as he shall
    think proper.
    (b) Prima facie evidence against transportation line
      Except as may be otherwise prescribed by regulations issued by
    the Attorney General, proof that an alien crewman did not appear
    upon the outgoing manifest of the vessel or aircraft on which he
    arrived in the United States from any place outside thereof, or
    that he was reported by the master or commanding officer of such
    vessel or aircraft as a deserter, shall be prima facie evidence of
    a failure to detain or remove such alien crewman.
    (c) Removal on other than arriving vessel or aircraft; expenses
      If the Attorney General finds that removal of an alien crewman
    under this section on the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived is
    impracticable or impossible, or would cause undue hardship to such
    alien crewman, he may cause the alien crewman to be removed from
    the port of arrival or any other port on another vessel or aircraft
    of the same transportation line, unless the Attorney General finds
    this to be impracticable. All expenses incurred in connection with
    such removal, including expenses incurred in transferring an alien
    crewman from one place in the United States to another under such
    conditions and safeguards as the Attorney General shall impose,
    shall be paid by the owner or owners of the vessel or aircraft on
    which the alien arrived in the United States. The vessel or
    aircraft on which the alien arrived shall not be granted clearance
    until such expenses have been paid or their payment guaranteed to
    the satisfaction of the Attorney General. An alien crewman who is
    transferred within the United States in accordance with this
    subsection shall not be regarded as having been landed in the
    United States.

-STATUTE-
      It shall be unlawful for any vessel or aircraft carrying
    passengers between a port of the United States and a port outside
    thereof to have employed on board upon arrival in the United States
    any alien afflicted with feeble-mindedness, insanity, epilepsy,
    tuberculosis in any form, leprosy, or any dangerous contagious
    disease. If it appears to the satisfaction of the Attorney General,
    from an examination made by a medical officer of the United States
    Public Health Service, and is so certified by such officer, that
    any such alien was so afflicted at the time he was shipped or
    engaged and taken on board such vessel or aircraft and that the
    existence of such affliction might have been detected by means of a
    competent medical examination at such time, the owner, commanding
    officer, agent, consignee, or master thereof shall pay for each
    alien so afflicted to the Commissioner the sum of $1,000. No vessel
    or aircraft shall be granted clearance pending the determination of
    the question of the liability to the payment of such sums, or while
    such sums remain unpaid, except that clearance may be granted prior
    to the determination of such question upon the deposit of an amount
    sufficient to cover such sums or of a bond approved by the
    Commissioner with sufficient surety to secure the payment thereof.
    Any such fine may, in the discretion of the Attorney General, be
    mitigated or remitted.

    violation of the provisions of this section, such owner, agent,
    consignee, charterer, master, commanding officer, or other person,
    shall pay to the Commissioner the sum of $3,000 for each such

    Sec. 1288. Limitations on performance of longshore work by alien
      crewmen

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      For purposes of section 1101(a)(15)(D)(i) of this title, the term
    "normal operation and service on board a vessel" does not include
    any activity that is longshore work (as defined in subsection (b)
    of this section), except as provided under subsection (c), (d), or
    (e) of this section.
    (b) "Longshore work" defined
      (1) In general
        In this section, except as provided in paragraph (2), the term
      "longshore work" means any activity relating to the loading or
      unloading of cargo, the operation of cargo-related equipment
      (whether or not integral to the vessel), and the handling of
      mooring lines on the dock when the vessel is made fast or let go,
      in the United States or the coastal waters thereof.
      (2) Exception for safety and environmental protection
        The term "longshore work" does not include the loading or
      unloading of any cargo for which the Secretary of Transportation
      has, under the authority contained in chapter 37 of title 46
      (relating to Carriage of Liquid Bulk Dangerous Cargoes), section
      1321 of title 33, section 4106 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990,
      or section 5103(b), 5104, 5106, 5107, or 5110 of title 49
      prescribed regulations which govern - 
          (A) the handling or stowage of such cargo,
          (B) the manning of vessels and the duties, qualifications,
        and training of the officers and crew of vessels carrying such
        cargo, and
          (C) the reduction or elimination of discharge during
        ballasting, tank cleaning, handling of such cargo.
      (3) Construction
        Nothing in this section shall be construed as broadening,
      limiting, or otherwise modifying the meaning or scope of
      longshore work for purposes of any other law, collective
      bargaining agreement, or international agreement.
    (c) Prevailing practice exception
      (1) Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to a
    particular activity of longshore work in and about a local port if -
     
        (A)(i) there is in effect in the local port one or more
      collective bargaining agreements each covering at least 30
      percent of the number of individuals employed in performing
      longshore work and (ii) each such agreement (covering such
      percentage of longshore workers) permits the activity to be
      performed by alien crewmen under the terms of such agreement; or
        (B) there is no collective bargaining agreement in effect in
      the local port covering at least 30 percent of the number of
      individuals employed in performing longshore work, and an
      employer of alien crewmen (or the employer's designated agent or
      representative) has filed with the Secretary of Labor at least 14
      days before the date of performance of the activity (or later, if
      necessary due to an unanticipated emergency, but not later than
      the date of performance of the activity) an attestation setting
      forth facts and evidence to show that - 
          (i) the performance of the activity by alien crewmen is
        permitted under the prevailing practice of the particular port
        as of the date of filing of the attestation and that the use of
        alien crewmen for such activity - 
            (I) is not during a strike or lockout in the course of a
          labor dispute, and
            (II) is not intended or designed to influence an election
          of a bargaining representative for workers in the local port;
          and

          (ii) notice of the attestation has been provided by the
        owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer to the
        bargaining representative of longshore workers in the local
        port, or, where there is no such bargaining representative,
        notice of the attestation has been provided to longshore
        workers employed at the local port.

    In applying subparagraph (B) in the case of a particular activity
    of longshore work consisting of the use of an automated self-
    unloading conveyor belt or vacuum-actuated system on a vessel, the
    attestation shall be required to be filed only if the Secretary of
    Labor finds, based on a preponderance of the evidence which may be
    submitted by any interested party, that the performance of such
    particular activity is not described in clause (i) of such
    subparagraph.
      (2) Subject to paragraph (4), an attestation under paragraph (1)
    shall - 
        (A) expire at the end of the 1-year period beginning on the
      date of its filing with the Secretary of Labor, and
        (B) apply to aliens arriving in the United States during such 1-
      year period if the owner, agent, consignee, master, or
      commanding officer states in each list under section 1281 of this
      title that it continues to comply with the conditions in the
      attestation.

      (3) An owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer may
    meet the requirements under this subsection with respect to more
    than one alien crewman in a single list.
      (4)(A) The Secretary of Labor shall compile and make available
    for public examination in a timely manner in Washington, D.C., a
    list identifying owners, agents, consignees, masters, or commanding
    officers which have filed lists for nonimmigrants described in
    section 1101(a)(15)(D)(i) of this title with respect to whom an
    attestation under paragraph (1) or subsection (d)(1) of this
    section is made and, for each such entity, a copy of the entity's
    attestation under paragraph (1) or subsection (d)(1) of this
    section (and accompanying documentation) and each such list filed
    by the entity.
      (B)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process for the
    receipt, investigation, and disposition of complaints respecting an
    entity's failure to meet conditions attested to, an entity's
    misrepresentation of a material fact in an attestation, or, in the
    case described in the last sentence of paragraph (1), whether the
    performance of the particular activity is or is not described in
    paragraph (1)(B)(i).
      (ii) Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or
    organization (including bargaining representatives, associations
    deemed appropriate by the Secretary, and other aggrieved parties as
    determined under regulations of the Secretary).
      (iii) The Secretary shall promptly conduct an investigation under
    this subparagraph if there is reasonable cause to believe that an
    entity fails to meet conditions attested to, an entity has
    misrepresented a material fact in the attestation, or, in the case
    described in the last sentence of paragraph (1), the performance of
    the particular activity is not described in paragraph (1)(B)(i).
      (C)(i) If the Secretary determines that reasonable cause exists
    to conduct an investigation with respect to an attestation, a
    complaining party may request that the activities attested to by
    the employer cease during the hearing process described in
    subparagraph (D). If such a request is made, the attesting employer
    shall be issued notice of such request and shall respond within 14
    days to the notice. If the Secretary makes an initial determination
    that the complaining party's position is supported by a
    preponderance of the evidence submitted, the Secretary shall
    require immediately that the employer cease and desist from such
    activities until completion of the process described in
    subparagraph (D).
      (ii) If the Secretary determines that reasonable cause exists to
    conduct an investigation with respect to a matter under the last
    sentence of paragraph (1), a complaining party may request that the
    activities of the employer cease during the hearing process
    described in subparagraph (D) unless the employer files with the
    Secretary of Labor an attestation under paragraph (1). If such a
    request is made, the employer shall be issued notice of such
    request and shall respond within 14 days to the notice. If the
    Secretary makes an initial determination that the complaining
    party's position is supported by a preponderance of the evidence
    submitted, the Secretary shall require immediately that the
    employer cease and desist from such activities until completion of
    the process described in subparagraph (D) unless the employer files
    with the Secretary of Labor an attestation under paragraph (1).
      (D) Under the process established under subparagraph (B), the
    Secretary shall provide, within 180 days after the date a complaint
    is filed (or later for good cause shown), for a determination as to
    whether or not a basis exists to make a finding described in
    subparagraph (E). The Secretary shall provide notice of such
    determination to the interested parties and an opportunity for a
    hearing on the complaint within 60 days of the date of the
    determination.
      (E)(i) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and
    opportunity for a hearing, that an entity has failed to meet a
    condition attested to or has made a misrepresentation of material
    fact in the attestation, the Secretary shall notify the Attorney
    General of such finding and may, in addition, impose such other
    administrative remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an
    amount not to exceed $5,000 for each alien crewman performing
    unauthorized longshore work) as the Secretary determines to be
    appropriate. Upon receipt of such notice, the Attorney General
    shall not permit the vessels owned or chartered by such entity to
    enter any port of the United States during a period of up to 1
    year.
      (ii) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and
    opportunity for a hearing, that, in the case described in the last
    sentence of paragraph (1), the performance of the particular
    activity is not described in subparagraph (B)(i), the Secretary
    shall notify the Attorney General of such finding and, thereafter,
    the attestation described in paragraph (1) shall be required of the
    employer for the performance of the particular activity.
      (F) A finding by the Secretary of Labor under this paragraph that
    the performance of an activity by alien crewmen is not permitted
    under the prevailing practice of a local port shall preclude for
    one year the filing of a subsequent attestation concerning such
    activity in the port under paragraph (1).
      (5) Except as provided in paragraph (5) of subsection (d) of this
    section, this subsection shall not apply to longshore work
    performed in the State of Alaska.
    (d) State of Alaska exception
      (1) Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to a
    particular activity of longshore work at a particular location in
    the State of Alaska if an employer of alien crewmen has filed an
    attestation with the Secretary of Labor at least 30 days before the
    date of the first performance of the activity (or anytime up to 24
    hours before the first performance of the activity, upon a showing
    that the employer could not have reasonably anticipated the need to
    file an attestation for that location at that time) setting forth
    facts and evidence to show that - 
        (A) the employer will make a bona fide request for United
      States longshore workers who are qualified and available in
      sufficient numbers to perform the activity at the particular time
      and location from the parties to whom notice has been provided
      under clauses (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (D), except that - 
          (i) wherever two or more contract stevedoring companies have
        signed a joint collective bargaining agreement with a single
        labor organization described in subparagraph (D)(i), the
        employer may request longshore workers from only one of such
        contract stevedoring companies, and
          (ii) a request for longshore workers to an operator of a
        private dock may be made only for longshore work to be
        performed at that dock and only if the operator meets the
        requirements of section 932 of title 33;

        (B) the employer will employ all those United States longshore
      workers made available in response to the request made pursuant
      to subparagraph (A) who are qualified and available in sufficient
      numbers and who are needed to perform the longshore activity at
      the particular time and location;
        (C) the use of alien crewmembers for such activity is not
      intended or designed to influence an election of a bargaining
      representative for workers in the State of Alaska; and
        (D) notice of the attestation has been provided by the employer
      to - 
          (i) labor organizations which have been recognized as
        exclusive bargaining representatives of United States longshore
        workers within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act
        [29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.] and which make available or intend to
        make available workers to the particular location where the
        longshore work is to be performed,
          (ii) contract stevedoring companies which employ or intend to
        employ United States longshore workers at that location, and
          (iii) operators of private docks at which the employer will
        use longshore workers.

      (2)(A) An employer filing an attestation under paragraph (1) who
    seeks to use alien crewmen to perform longshore work shall be
    responsible while at (!1) the attestation is valid to make bona
    fide requests for United States longshore workers under paragraph
    (1)(A) and to employ United States longshore workers, as provided
    in paragraph (1)(B), before using alien crewmen to perform the
    activity or activities specified in the attestation, except that an
    employer shall not be required to request longshore workers from a
    party if that party has notified the employer in writing that it
    does not intend to make available United States longshore workers
    to the location at which the longshore work is to be performed.

      (B) If a party that has provided such notice subsequently
    notifies the employer in writing that it is prepared to make
    available United States longshore workers who are qualified and
    available in sufficient numbers to perform the longshore activity
    to the location at which the longshore work is to be performed,
    then the employer's obligations to that party under subparagraphs
    (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) shall begin 60 days following the
    issuance of such notice.
      (3)(A) In no case shall an employer filing an attestation be
    required - 
        (i) to hire less than a full work unit of United States
      longshore workers needed to perform the longshore activity;
        (ii) to provide overnight accommodations for the longshore
      workers while employed; or
        (iii) to provide transportation to the place of work, except
      where - 
          (I) surface transportation is available;
          (II) such transportation may be safely accomplished;
          (III) travel time to the vessel does not exceed one-half hour
        each way; and
          (IV) travel distance to the vessel from the point of
        embarkation does not exceed 5 miles.

      (B) In the cases of Wide Bay, Alaska, and Klawock/Craig, Alaska,
    the travel times and travel distances specified in subclauses (III)
    and (IV) of subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be extended to 45 minutes
    and 7 1/2  miles, respectively, unless the party responding to the
    request for longshore workers agrees to the lesser time and
    distance limitations specified in those subclauses.
      (4) Subject to subparagraphs (A) through (D) of subsection (c)(4)
    of this section, attestations filed under paragraph (1) of this
    subsection shall - 
        (A) expire at the end of the 1-year period beginning on the
      date the employer anticipates the longshore work to begin, as
      specified in the attestation filed with the Secretary of Labor,
      and
        (B) apply to aliens arriving in the United States during such 1-
      year period if the owner, agent, consignee, master, or
      commanding officer states in each list under section 1281 of this
      title that it continues to comply with the conditions in the
      attestation.

      (5)(A) Except as otherwise provided by subparagraph (B),
    subsection (c)(3) of this section and subparagraphs (A) through (E)
    of subsection (c)(4) of this section shall apply to attestations
    filed under this subsection.
      (B) The use of alien crewmen to perform longshore work in Alaska
    consisting of the use of an automated self-unloading conveyor belt
    or vacuum-actuated system on a vessel shall be governed by the
    provisions of subsection (c) of this section.
      (6) For purposes of this subsection - 
        (A) the term "contract stevedoring companies" means those
      stevedoring companies licensed to do business in the State of
      Alaska that meet the requirements of section 932 of title 33;
        (B) the term "employer" includes any agent or representative
      designated by the employer; and
        (C) the terms "qualified" and "available in sufficient numbers"
      shall be defined by reference to industry standards in the State
      of Alaska, including safety considerations.
    (e) Reciprocity exception
      (1) In general
        Subject to the determination of the Secretary of State pursuant
      to paragraph (2), the Attorney General shall permit an alien
      crewman to perform an activity constituting longshore work if - 
          (A) the vessel is registered in a country that by law,
        regulation, or in practice does not prohibit such activity by
        crewmembers aboard United States vessels; and
          (B) nationals of a country (or countries) which by law,
        regulation, or in practice does not prohibit such activity by
        crewmembers aboard United States vessels hold a majority of the
        ownership interest in the vessel.
      (2) Establishment of list
        The Secretary of State shall, in accordance with section 553 of
      title 5, compile and annually maintain a list, of longshore work
      by particular activity, of countries where performance of such a
      particular activity by crewmembers aboard United States vessels
      is prohibited by law, regulation, or in practice in the country.
      By not later than 90 days after November 29, 1990, the Secretary
      shall publish a notice of proposed rulemaking to establish such
      list. The Secretary shall first establish such list by not later
      than 180 days after November 29, 1990.

    Sec. 1321. Prevention of unauthorized landing of aliens

-STATUTE-
    (a) Failure to report; penalties
      It shall be the duty of every person, including the owners,
    masters, officers, and agents of vessels, aircraft, transportation
    lines, or international bridges or toll roads, other than
    transportation lines which may enter into a contract as provided in
    section 1223 of this title, bringing an alien to, or providing a
    means for an alien to come to, the United States (including an
    alien crewman whose case is not covered by section 1284(a) of this
    title) to prevent the landing of such alien in the United States at
    a port of entry other than as designated by the Attorney General or
    at any time or place other than as designated by the immigration
    officers. Any such person, owner, master, officer, or agent who
    fails to comply with the foregoing requirements shall be liable to
    a penalty to be imposed by the Attorney General of $3,000 for each
    such violation, which may, in the discretion of the Attorney
    General, be remitted or mitigated by him in accordance with such
    proceedings as he shall by regulation prescribe. Such penalty shall
    be a lien upon the vessel or aircraft whose owner, master, officer,
    or agent violates the provisions of this section, and such vessel
    or aircraft may be libeled therefor in the appropriate United
    States court.
    (b) Prima facie evidence
      Proof that the alien failed to present himself at the time and
    place designated by the immigration officers shall be prima facie
    evidence that such alien has landed in the United States at a time
    or place other than as designated by the immigration officers.
    (c) Liability of owners and operators of international bridges and
      toll roads
      (1) Any owner or operator of a railroad line, international
    bridge, or toll road who establishes to the satisfaction of the
    Attorney General that the person has acted diligently and
    reasonably to fulfill the duty imposed by subsection (a) of this
    section shall not be liable for the penalty described in such
    subsection, notwithstanding the failure of the person to prevent
    the unauthorized landing of any alien.
      (2)(A) At the request of any person described in paragraph (1),
    the Attorney General shall inspect any facility established, or any
    method utilized, at a point of entry into the United States by such
    person for the purpose of complying with subsection (a) of this
    section. The Attorney General shall approve any such facility or
    method (for such period of time as the Attorney General may
    prescribe) which the Attorney General determines is satisfactory
    for such purpose.
      (B) Proof that any person described in paragraph (1) has
    diligently maintained any facility, or utilized any method, which
    has been approved by the Attorney General under subparagraph (A)
    (within the period for which the approval is effective) shall be
    prima facie evidence that such person acted diligently and
    reasonably to fulfill the duty imposed by subsection (a) of this
    section (within the meaning of paragraph (1) of this subsection).

    Sec. 1323. Unlawful bringing of aliens into United States

-STATUTE-
    (a) Persons liable
      (1) It shall be unlawful for any person, including any
    transportation company, or the owner, master, commanding officer,
    agent, charterer, or consignee of any vessel or aircraft, to bring
    to the United States from any place outside thereof (other than
    from foreign contiguous territory) any alien who does not have a
    valid passport and an unexpired visa, if a visa was required under
    this chapter or regulations issued thereunder.
      (2) It is unlawful for an owner, agent, master, commanding
    officer, person in charge, purser, or consignee of a vessel or
    aircraft who is bringing an alien (except an alien crewmember) to
    the United States to take any consideration to be kept or returned
    contingent on whether an alien is admitted to, or ordered removed
    from, the United States.
    (b) Evidence
      If it appears to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that
    any alien has been so brought, such person, or transportation
    company, or the master, commanding officer, agent, owner,
    charterer, or consignee of any such vessel or aircraft, shall pay
    to the Commissioner a fine of $3,000 for each alien so brought and,
    except in the case of any such alien who is admitted, or permitted
    to land temporarily, in addition, an amount equal to that paid by
    such alien for his transportation from the initial point of
    departure, indicated in his ticket, to the port of arrival, such
    latter fine to be delivered by the Commissioner to the alien on
    whose account the assessment is made. No vessel or aircraft shall

    thereof approved by the Commissioner.
    (c) Remission or refund
      Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, such fine

    owner, master, commanding officer, agent, charterer, and consignee
    of the vessel or aircraft, prior to the departure of the vessel or
    aircraft from the last port outside the United States, did not
    know, and could not have ascertained by the exercise of reasonable
    diligence, that the individual transported was an alien and that a
    valid passport or visa was required.

    "remain".
      Subsec. (d). Pub. L. 104-208, Sec. 371(b)(8), substituted

      Pub. L. 104-208, Sec. 308(e)(13), struck out subsec. (d) which
    read as follows: "The owner, charterer, agent, consignee,
    commanding officer, or master of any vessel or aircraft arriving at
    the United States from any place outside the United States who
    fails to deport any alien stowaway on the vessel or aircraft on
    which such stowaway arrived or on another vessel or aircraft at the
    expense of the vessel or aircraft on which such stowaway arrived
    when required to do so by an immigration officer, shall pay to the
    Commissioner a fine of $3,000 for each alien stowaway, in respect
    of whom any such failure occurs. Pending final determination of
    liability for such fine, no such vessel or aircraft shall be
    granted clearance, except that clearance may be granted upon the
    deposit of an amount sufficient to cover such fine, or of a bond
    with sufficient surety to secure the payment thereof approved by
    the Commissioner. The provisions of section 1225 of this title for
    detention of aliens for examination before immigration judges and
    the right of appeal provided for in section 1226 of this title
    shall not apply to aliens who arrive as stowaways and no such alien
    shall be permitted to land in the United States, except temporarily
    for medical treatment, or pursuant to such regulations as the
    Attorney General may prescribe for the ultimate departure or
    removal or deportation of such alien from the United States."
      1994 - Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 103-416, Sec. 219(p), in first

    $3,000".
      Pub. L. 103-416, Sec. 209(a)(2), (4), in first sentence
    substituted "an amount equal to" for "a sum equal to" and "such
    latter fine" for "such latter sum", and in second sentence
    substituted "such fine or while such fine" for "such sums or while
    such sums" and "cover such fine" for "cover such sums".
      Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 103-416, Sec. 209(a)(4), (5), substituted
    "Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, such fine"
    for "Such sums".
      Subsec. (d). Pub. L. 103-416, Sec. 216, amended first sentence
    generally. Prior to amendment, first sentence read as follows: "The
    owner, charterer, agent, consignee, commanding officer, or master
    of any vessel or aircraft arriving at the United States from any
    place outside thereof who fails to detain on board or at such other
    place as may be designated by an immigration officer any alien
    stowaway until such stowaway has been inspected by an immigration
    officer, or who fails to detain such stowaway on board or at such
    other designated place after inspection if ordered to do so by an
    immigration officer, or who fails to deport such stowaway on the
    vessel or aircraft on which he arrived or on another vessel or
    aircraft at the expense of the vessel or aircraft on which he
    arrived when required to do so by an immigration officer, shall pay
    to the Commissioner the sum of $3,000 for each alien stowaway, in
    respect of whom any such failure occurs."
      Pub. L. 103-416, Sec. 209(a)(1), which directed that subsec. (d)
    be amended by substituting "a fine of $3,000" for "the sum of
    $3000", was executed in the first sentence by making the
    substitution for "the sum of $3,000", to reflect the probable
    intent of Congress.
      Pub. L. 103-416, Sec. 209(a)(3), in second sentence substituted
    "an amount" for "a sum" before "sufficient to cover such fine".

    $1,000".
      Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 101-649, Sec. 201(b)(2), inserted "valid
    passport or" before "visa was required".
      Subsec. (d). Pub. L. 101-649, Sec. 543(a)(10)(B), substituted
    "Commissioner the sum of $3,000" for "collector of customs of the

    $1,000" in first sentence and "Commissioner" for "collector of
    customs" in second sentence.

    or reside within, the United States" in subpar. (C).
      1981 - Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 97-116 strengthened the seizure and
    forfeiture authority by striking out the "innocent owner" exemption
    and merely requiring the Government to show probable cause that the
    conveyance seized has been used to illegally transport aliens,
    which when demonstrated, shifts the burden of proof to the owner or
    claimant to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the
    conveyance was not illegally used, by relieving the Government of
    the obligation to pay any administrative and incidental costs
    incurred by a successful claimant provided probable cause for the
    original seizure was demonstrated, and by striking out the
    requirement that the Government satisfy any valid lien or third
    party interest in the conveyance without expense to the interest
    holder by providing the lienholders interest be satisfied only
    after costs associated with the seizure have been deducted.

    redesignated former subsec. (b) as (c).

      (2) Continuing employment
        It is unlawful for a person or other entity, after hiring an

      alien is (or has become) an unauthorized alien with respect to
      such employment.
      (3) Defense
        A person or entity that establishes that it has complied in
      good faith with the requirements of subsection (b) of this
      section with respect to the hiring, recruiting, or referral for
      employment of an alien in the United States has established an
      affirmative defense that the person or entity has not violated
      paragraph (1)(A) with respect to such hiring, recruiting, or
      referral.
      (4) Use of labor through contract
        For purposes of this section, a person or other entity who uses

      alien in the United States knowing that the alien is an
      unauthorized alien (as defined in subsection (h)(3) of this
      section) with respect to performing such labor, shall be

        For purposes of paragraphs (1)(B) and (3), a person or entity

      subsection (b) of this section with respect to the hiring of an
      individual who was referred for such employment by a State
      employment agency (as defined by the Attorney General), if the
      person or entity has and retains (for the period and in the
      manner described in subsection (b)(3) of this section)
      appropriate documentation of such referral by that agency, which
      documentation certifies that the agency has complied with the

      respect to the individual's referral.
      (6) Treatment of documentation for certain employees

          For purposes of this section, if - 
            (i) an individual is a member of a collective-bargaining
          unit and is employed, under a collective bargaining agreement
          entered into between one or more employee organizations and

          agent of such association on behalf of the employer) has
          complied with the requirements of subsection (b) of this
          section with respect to the employment of the individual,

        the subsequent employer shall be deemed to have complied with

        to the hiring of the employee and shall not be liable for civil
        penalties described in subsection (e)(5) of this section.

        be employed in the United States.
        (C) Liability
          (i) In general
            If any employer that is a member of an association hires

          upon the provisions of subparagraph (A) to comply with the
          requirements of subsection (b) of this section and the
          individual is an alien not authorized to work in the United
          States, then for the purposes of paragraph (1)(A), subject to
          clause (ii), the employer shall be presumed to have known at
          the time of hiring or afterward that the individual was an
          alien not authorized to work in the United States.
          (ii) Rebuttal of presumption
            The presumption established by clause (i) may be rebutted
          by the employer only through the presentation of clear and
          convincing evidence that the employer did not know (and could
          not reasonably have known) that the individual at the time of
          hiring or afterward was an alien not authorized to work in
          the United States.
          (iii) Exception
            Clause (i) shall not apply in any prosecution under

    employment in the United States, the requirements specified in the
    following three paragraphs:
      (1) Attestation after examination of documentation
        (A) In general
          The person or entity must attest, under penalty of perjury
        and on a form designated or established by the Attorney General
        by regulation, that it has verified that the individual is not
        an unauthorized alien by examining - 
            (i) a document described in subparagraph (B), or
            (ii) a document described in subparagraph (C) and a
          document described in subparagraph (D).

        Such attestation may be manifested by either a hand-written or
        an electronic signature. A person or entity has complied with
        the requirement of this paragraph with respect to examination
        of a document if the document reasonably appears on its face to
        be genuine. If an individual provides a document or combination
        of documents that reasonably appears on its face to be genuine
        and that is sufficient to meet the requirements of the first
        sentence of this paragraph, nothing in this paragraph shall be
        construed as requiring the person or entity to solicit the
        production of any other document or as requiring the individual
        to produce such another document.
        (B) Documents establishing both employment authorization and
          identity
          A document described in this subparagraph is an individual's -
         
            (i) United States passport; (!1)

            (ii) resident alien card, alien registration card, or other
          document designated by the Attorney General, if the document -
           
              (I) contains a photograph of the individual and such
            other personal identifying information relating to the
            individual as the Attorney General finds, by regulation,
            sufficient for purposes of this subsection,
              (II) is evidence of authorization of employment in the
            United States, and
              (III) contains security features to make it resistant to
            tampering, counterfeiting, and fraudulent use.
        (C) Documents evidencing employment authorization
          A document described in this subparagraph is an individual's -
         
            (i) social security account number card (other than such a
          card which specifies on the face that the issuance of the
          card does not authorize employment in the United States); or
            (ii) other documentation evidencing authorization of
          employment in the United States which the Attorney General
          finds, by regulation, to be acceptable for purposes of this
          section.
        (D) Documents establishing identity of individual
          A document described in this subparagraph is an individual's -
         
            (i) driver's license or similar document issued for the
          purpose of identification by a State, if it contains a
          photograph of the individual or such other personal
          identifying information relating to the individual as the
          Attorney General finds, by regulation, sufficient for
          purposes of this section; or
            (ii) in the case of individuals under 16 years of age or in
          a State which does not provide for issuance of an
          identification document (other than a driver's license)
          referred to in clause (i), documentation of personal identity
          of such other type as the Attorney General finds, by
          regulation, provides a reliable means of identification.
        (E) Authority to prohibit use of certain documents
          If the Attorney General finds, by regulation, that any
        document described in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) as
        establishing employment authorization or identity does not
        reliably establish such authorization or identity or is being
        used fraudulently to an unacceptable degree, the Attorney
        General may prohibit or place conditions on its use for
        purposes of this subsection.
      (2) Individual attestation of employment authorization
        The individual must attest, under penalty of perjury on the
      form designated or established for purposes of paragraph (1),
      that the individual is a citizen or national of the United
      States, an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or an
      alien who is authorized under this chapter or by the Attorney
      General to be hired, recruited, or referred for such employment.
      Such attestation may be manifested by either a hand-written or an
      electronic signature.
      (3) Retention of verification form
        After completion of such form in accordance with paragraphs (1)
      and (2), the person or entity must retain a paper, microfiche,
      microfilm, or electronic version of the form and make it
      available for inspection by officers of the Service, the Special
      Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices, or
      the Department of Labor during a period beginning on the date of
      the hiring, recruiting, or referral of the individual and ending -
       
          (A) in the case of the recruiting or referral for a fee
        (without hiring) of an individual, three years after the date
        of the recruiting or referral, and
          (B) in the case of the hiring of an individual - 
            (i) three years after the date of such hiring, or
            (ii) one year after the date the individual's employment is
          terminated,

        whichever is later.
      (4) Copying of documentation permitted
        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the person or
      entity may copy a document presented by an individual pursuant to
      this subsection and may retain the copy, but only (except as
      otherwise permitted under law) for the purpose of complying with
      the requirements of this subsection.
      (5) Limitation on use of attestation form
        A form designated or established by the Attorney General under
      this subsection and any information contained in or appended to
      such form, may not be used for purposes other than for
      enforcement of this chapter and sections 1001, 1028, 1546, and
      1621 of title 18.
      (6) Good faith compliance
        (A) In general
          Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), a person or
        entity is considered to have complied with a requirement of
        this subsection notwithstanding a technical or procedural
        failure to meet such requirement if there was a good faith
        attempt to comply with the requirement.
        (B) Exception if failure to correct after notice
          Subparagraph (A) shall not apply if - 
            (i) the Service (or another enforcement agency) has
          explained to the person or entity the basis for the failure,
            (ii) the person or entity has been provided a period of not
          less than 10 business days (beginning after the date of the
          explanation) within which to correct the failure, and
            (iii) the person or entity has not corrected the failure
          voluntarily within such period.
        (C) Exception for pattern or practice violators

        subsection (a)(1)(A) or (a)(2) of this section.
    (c) No authorization of national identification cards
      Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize, directly
    or indirectly, the issuance or use of national identification cards
    or the establishment of a national identification card.
    (d) Evaluation and changes in employment verification system
      (1) Presidential monitoring and improvements in system
        (A) Monitoring
          The President shall provide for the monitoring and evaluation
        of the degree to which the employment verification system
        established under subsection (b) of this section provides a
        secure system to determine employment eligibility in the United
        States and shall examine the suitability of existing Federal
        and State identification systems for use for this purpose.
        (B) Improvements to establish secure system
          To the extent that the system established under subsection
        (b) of this section is found not to be a secure system to
        determine employment eligibility in the United States, the
        President shall, subject to paragraph (3) and taking into
        account the results of any demonstration projects conducted
        under paragraph (4), implement such changes in (including
        additions to) the requirements of subsection (b) of this
        section as may be necessary to establish a secure system to
        determine employment eligibility in the United States. Such
        changes in the system may be implemented only if the changes
        conform to the requirements of paragraph (2).
      (2) Restrictions on changes in system
        Any change the President proposes to implement under paragraph
      (1) in the verification system must be designed in a manner so
      the verification system, as so changed, meets the following
      requirements:
        (A) Reliable determination of identity
          The system must be capable of reliably determining whether - 
            (i) a person with the identity claimed by an employee or
          prospective employee is eligible to work, and
            (ii) the employee or prospective employee is claiming the
          identity of another individual.
        (B) Using of counterfeit-resistant documents
          If the system requires that a document be presented to or
        examined by an employer, the document must be in a form which
        is resistant to counterfeiting and tampering.
        (C) Limited use of system
          Any personal information utilized by the system may not be
        made available to Government agencies, employers, and other
        persons except to the extent necessary to verify that an
        individual is not an unauthorized alien.
        (D) Privacy of information
          The system must protect the privacy and security of personal
        information and identifiers utilized in the system.
        (E) Limited denial of verification
          A verification that an employee or prospective employee is
        eligible to be employed in the United States may not be
        withheld or revoked under the system for any reason other than
        that the employee or prospective employee is an unauthorized
        alien.
        (F) Limited use for law enforcement purposes
          The system may not be used for law enforcement purposes,
        other than for enforcement of this chapter or sections 1001,
        1028, 1546, and 1621 of title 18.
        (G) Restriction on use of new documents
          If the system requires individuals to present a new card or
        other document (designed specifically for use for this purpose)
        at the time of hiring, recruitment, or referral, then such
        document may not be required to be presented for any purpose
        other than under this chapter (or enforcement of sections 1001,
        1028, 1546, and 1621 of title 18) nor to be carried on one's
        person.
      (3) Notice to Congress before implementing changes
        (A) In general
          The President may not implement any change under paragraph
        (1) unless at least - 
            (i) 60 days,
            (ii) one year, in the case of a major change described in
          subparagraph (D)(iii), or
            (iii) two years, in the case of a major change described in
          clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (D),

        before the date of implementation of the change, the President
        has prepared and transmitted to the Committee on the Judiciary
        of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on the
        Judiciary of the Senate a written report setting forth the
        proposed change. If the President proposes to make any change
        regarding social security account number cards, the President
        shall transmit to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House
        of Representatives and to the Committee on Finance of the
        Senate a written report setting forth the proposed change. The
        President promptly shall cause to have printed in the Federal
        Register the substance of any major change (described in
        subparagraph (D)) proposed and reported to Congress.
        (B) Contents of report
          In any report under subparagraph (A) the President shall
        include recommendations for the establishment of civil and
        criminal sanctions for unauthorized use or disclosure of the
        information or identifiers contained in such system.
        (C) Congressional review of major changes
          (i) Hearings and review
            The Committees on the Judiciary of the House of

          in the Congressional Record the substance of any major change
          described in subparagraph (D), shall hold hearings respecting
          the feasibility and desirability of implementing such a
          change, and, within the two year period before
          implementation, shall report to their respective Houses
          findings on whether or not such a change should be
          implemented.
          (ii) Congressional action
            No major change may be implemented unless the Congress
          specifically provides, in an appropriations or other Act, for
          funds for implementation of the change.
        (D) Major changes defined
          As used in this paragraph, the term "major change" means a
        change which would - 
            (i) require an individual to present a new card or other
          document (designed specifically for use for this purpose) at
          the time of hiring, recruitment, or referral,
            (ii) provide for a telephone verification system under
          which an employer, recruiter, or referrer must transmit to a
          Federal official information concerning the immigration
          status of prospective employees and the official transmits to
          the person, and the person must record, a verification code,
          or
            (iii) require any change in any card used for accounting
          purposes under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et
          seq.], including any change requiring that the only social
          security account number cards which may be presented in order
          to comply with subsection (b)(1)(C)(i) of this section are
          such cards as are in a counterfeit-resistant form consistent
          with the second sentence of section 205(c)(2)(D) of the
          Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 405(c)(2)(D)].
        (E) General revenue funding of social security card changes
          Any costs incurred in developing and implementing any change
        described in subparagraph (D)(iii) for purposes of this
        subsection shall not be paid for out of any trust fund
        established under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et
        seq.].
      (4) Demonstration projects
        (A) Authority
          The President may undertake demonstration projects
        (consistent with paragraph (2)) of different changes in the

        demonstration projects conducted under this paragraph.
    (e) Compliance
      (1) Complaints and investigations
        The Attorney General shall establish procedures - 
          (A) for individuals and entities to file written, signed
        complaints respecting potential violations of subsection (a) or
        (g)(1) of this section,
          (B) for the investigation of those complaints which, on their
        face, have a substantial probability of validity,
          (C) for the investigation of such other violations of
        subsection (a) or (g)(1) of this section as the Attorney
        General determines to be appropriate, and
          (D) for the designation in the Service of a unit which has,
        as its primary duty, the prosecution of cases of violations of
        subsection (a) or (g)(1) of this section under this subsection.
      (2) Authority in investigations
        In conducting investigations and hearings under this subsection
      - 
          (A) immigration officers and administrative law judges shall
        have reasonable access to examine evidence of any person or
        entity being investigated,
          (B) administrative law judges, may, if necessary, compel by
        subpoena the attendance of witnesses and the production of
        evidence at any designated place or hearing, and
          (C) immigration officers designated by the Commissioner may
        compel by subpoena the attendance of witnesses and the
        production of evidence at any designated place prior to the
        filing of a complaint in a case under paragraph (2).

      In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena lawfully
      issued under this paragraph and upon application of the Attorney
      General, an appropriate district court of the United States may
      issue an order requiring compliance with such subpoena and any
      failure to obey such order may be punished by such court as a
      contempt thereof.
      (3) Hearing
        (A) In general
          Before imposing an order described in paragraph (4), (5), or
        (6) against a person or entity under this subsection for a
        violation of subsection (a) or (g)(1) of this section, the
        Attorney General shall provide the person or entity with notice
        and, upon request made within a reasonable time (of not less
        than 30 days, as established by the Attorney General) of the
        date of the notice, a hearing respecting the violation.
        (B) Conduct of hearing
          Any hearing so requested shall be conducted before an
        administrative law judge. The hearing shall be conducted in
        accordance with the requirements of section 554 of title 5. The
        hearing shall be held at the nearest practicable place to the
        place where the person or entity resides or of the place where
        the alleged violation occurred. If no hearing is so requested,
        the Attorney General's imposition of the order shall constitute
        a final and unappealable order.
        (C) Issuance of orders
          If the administrative law judge determines, upon the
        preponderance of the evidence received, that a person or entity
        named in the complaint has violated subsection (a) or (g)(1) of
        this section, the administrative law judge shall state his
        findings of fact and issue and cause to be served on such
        person or entity an order described in paragraph (4), (5), or
        (6).
      (4) Cease and desist order with civil money penalty for hiring,

      of this section, the order under this subsection - 
          (A) shall require the person or entity to cease and desist
        from such violations and to pay a civil penalty in an amount of
        - 
            (i) not less than $250 and not more than $2,000 for each
          unauthorized alien with respect to whom a violation of either
          such subsection occurred,
            (ii) not less than $2,000 and not more than $5,000 for each
          such alien in the case of a person or entity previously
          subject to one order under this paragraph, or
            (iii) not less than $3,000 and not more than $10,000 for
          each such alien in the case of a person or entity previously
          subject to more than one order under this paragraph; and

          (B) may require the person or entity - 
            (i) to comply with the requirements of subsection (b) of
          this section (or subsection (d) of this section if
          applicable) with respect to individuals hired (or recruited
          or referred for employment for a fee) during a period of up
          to three years, and
            (ii) to take such other remedial action as is appropriate.

        In applying this subsection in the case of a person or entity
        composed of distinct, physically separate subdivisions each of
        which provides separately for the hiring, recruiting, or
        referring for employment, without reference to the practices
        of, and not under the control of or common control with,
        another subdivision, each such subdivision shall be considered
        a separate person or entity.
      (5) Order for civil money penalty for paperwork violations
        With respect to a violation of subsection (a)(1)(B) of this
      section, the order under this subsection shall require the person
      or entity to pay a civil penalty in an amount of not less than
      $100 and not more than $1,000 for each individual with respect to
      whom such violation occurred. In determining the amount of the
      penalty, due consideration shall be given to the size of the
      business of the employer being charged, the good faith of the
      employer, the seriousness of the violation, whether or not the
      individual was an unauthorized alien, and the history of previous
      violations.
      (6) Order for prohibited indemnity bonds
        With respect to a violation of subsection (g)(1) of this
      section, the order under this subsection may provide for the
      remedy described in subsection (g)(2) of this section.
      (7) Administrative appellate review
        The decision and order of an administrative law judge shall
      become the final agency decision and order of the Attorney
      General unless either (A) within 30 days, an official delegated
      by regulation to exercise review authority over the decision and
      order modifies or vacates the decision and order, or (B) within
      30 days of the date of such a modification or vacation (or within
      60 days of the date of decision and order of an administrative
      law judge if not so modified or vacated) the decision and order
      is referred to the Attorney General pursuant to regulations, in
      which case the decision and order of the Attorney General shall
      become the final agency decision and order under this subsection.
      The Attorney General may not delegate the Attorney General's
      authority under this paragraph to any entity which has review
      authority over immigration-related matters.
      (8) Judicial review
        A person or entity adversely affected by a final order
      respecting an assessment may, within 45 days after the date the
      final order is issued, file a petition in the Court of Appeals
      for the appropriate circuit for review of the order.
      (9) Enforcement of orders
        If a person or entity fails to comply with a final order issued
      under this subsection against the person or entity, the Attorney
      General shall file a suit to seek compliance with the order in
      any appropriate district court of the United States. In any such
      suit, the validity and appropriateness of the final order shall
      not be subject to review.
    (f) Criminal penalties and injunctions for pattern or practice
      violations
      (1) Criminal penalty
        Any person or entity which engages in a pattern or practice of
      violations of subsection (a)(1)(A) or (a)(2) of this section
      shall be fined not more than $3,000 for each unauthorized alien
      with respect to whom such a violation occurs, imprisoned for not
      more than six months for the entire pattern or practice, or both,
      notwithstanding the provisions of any other Federal law relating
      to fine levels.
      (2) Enjoining of pattern or practice violations
        Whenever the Attorney General has reasonable cause to believe
      that a person or entity is engaged in a pattern or practice of
      employment, recruitment, or referral in violation of paragraph
      (1)(A) or (2) of subsection (a) of this section, the Attorney
      General may bring a civil action in the appropriate district
      court of the United States requesting such relief, including a
      permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other
      order against the person or entity, as the Attorney General deems
      necessary.
    (g) Prohibition of indemnity bonds
      (1) Prohibition
        It is unlawful for a person or other entity, in the hiring,
      recruiting, or referring for employment of any individual, to
      require the individual to post a bond or security, to pay or
      agree to pay an amount, or otherwise to provide a financial
      guarantee or indemnity, against any potential liability arising
      under this section relating to such hiring, recruiting, or
      referring of the individual.
      (2) Civil penalty
        Any person or entity which is determined, after notice and
      opportunity for an administrative hearing under subsection (e) of
      this section, to have violated paragraph (1) shall be subject to
      a civil penalty of $1,000 for each violation and to an
      administrative order requiring the return of any amounts received
      in violation of such paragraph to the employee or, if the
      employee cannot be located, to the general fund of the Treasury.
    (h) Miscellaneous provisions

        respectively.
        "(3) Termination of elections. - The Secretary of Homeland
      Security may terminate an election by a person or other entity
      under this section because the person or entity has substantially

      person or other entity may terminate an election in such form and
      manner as the Secretary of Homeland Security shall specify.
      "(d) Consultation, Education, and Publicity. - 
        "(1) Consultation. - The Secretary of Homeland Security shall

            "(ii) Election. - Subject to clause (iii), the Secretary of
          each such Department - 
         "(I) shall elect the pilot program (or programs) in which the

         "(II) may limit the election to hiring occurring in certain
          States (or geographic areas) covered by the program (or
          programs) and in specified divisions within the Department,
          so long as all hiring by such divisions and in such locations
          is covered.
            "(iii) Role of secretary of homeland security. - The
          Secretary of Homeland Security shall assist and coordinate
          elections under this subparagraph in such manner as assures
          that - 
         "(I) a significant portion of the total hiring within each
          Department within States covered by a pilot program is
          covered under such a program, and
         "(II) there is significant participation by the Federal
          Executive branch in each of the pilot programs.
          "(B) Legislative branch. - Each Member of Congress, each
        officer of Congress, and the head of each agency of the
        legislative branch, that conducts hiring in a State in which a

        pilot program, may specify which pilot program or programs (if
        there is more than one) in which the Member, officer, or agency
        will participate, and shall comply with the terms and
        conditions of such an election.
        "(2) Application to certain violators. - An order under section
      274A(e)(4) or section 274B(g) of the Immigration and Nationality
      Act [8 U.S.C. 1324a(e)(4), 1324b(g)] may require the subject of

        "(3) Consequence of failure to participate. - If a person or

        274A(a)(1)(B) with respect to that individual, and
          "(B) a rebuttable presumption is created that the person or
        entity has violated section 274A(a)(1)(A).
      Subparagraph (B) shall not apply in any prosecution under section
      274A(f)(1).
      "(f) Construction. - This subtitle shall not affect the authority

      "SEC. 403. PROCEDURES FOR PARTICIPANTS IN PILOT PROGRAMS.
      "(a) E-Verify Program. - A person or other entity that elects to
    participate in the E-Verify Program described in this subsection
    agrees to conform to the following procedures in the case of the
    hiring (or recruitment or referral) for employment in the United
    States of each individual covered by the election:
        "(1) Provision of additional information. - The person or
      entity shall obtain from the individual (and the individual shall
      provide) and shall record on the I-9 or similar form - 
          "(A) the individual's social security account number, if the
        individual has been issued such a number, and
          "(B) if the individual does not attest to United States
        citizenship under section 274A(b)(2), such identification or
        authorization number established by the Immigration and
        Naturalization Service for the alien as the Secretary of
        Homeland Security shall specify,
      and shall retain the original form and make it available for
      inspection for the period and in the manner required of I-9 forms
      under section 274A(b)(3).
        "(2) Presentation of documentation. - 
          "(A) In general. - The person or other entity, and the
        individual whose identity and employment eligibility are being
        confirmed, shall, subject to subparagraph (B), fulfill the
        requirements of section 274A(b) with the following
        modifications:
            "(i) A document referred to in section 274A(b)(1)(B)(ii)
          (as redesignated by section 412(a) of this division) must be
          designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security as suitable
          for the purpose of identification in a pilot program.
            "(ii) A document referred to in section 274A(b)(1)(D) must
          contain a photograph of the individual.
            "(iii) The person or other entity has complied with the
          requirements of section 274A(b)(1) with respect to
          examination of a document if the document reasonably appears
          on its face to be genuine and it reasonably appears to
          pertain to the individual whose identity and work eligibility
          is being confirmed.
          "(B) Limitation of requirement to examine documentation. - If
        the Secretary of Homeland Security finds that a pilot program
        would reliably determine with respect to an individual whether -
         
            "(i) the person with the identity claimed by the individual
          is authorized to work in the United States, and
            "(ii) the individual is claiming the identity of another
          person,
      if a person or entity could fulfill the requirement to examine
      documentation contained in subparagraph (A) of section 274A(b)(1)
      by examining a document specified in either subparagraph (B) or
      (D) of such section, the Secretary of Homeland Security may
      provide that, for purposes of such requirement, only such a
      document need be examined. In such case, any reference in section
      274A(b)(1)(A) to a verification that an individual is not an
      unauthorized alien shall be deemed to be a verification of the
      individual's identity.
        "(3) Seeking confirmation. - 
          "(A) In general. - The person or other entity shall make an
        inquiry, as provided in section 404(a)(1) of this division,
        using the confirmation system to seek confirmation of the
        identity and employment eligibility of an individual, by not
        later than the end of 3 working days (as specified by the
        Secretary of Homeland Security) after the date of the hiring
        (or recruitment or referral, as the case may be).
          "(B) Extension of time period. - If the person or other
        entity in good faith attempts to make an inquiry during such 3
        working days and the confirmation system has registered that
        not all inquiries were received during such time, the person or
        entity can make an inquiry in the first subsequent working day
        in which the confirmation system registers that it has received
        all inquiries. If the confirmation system cannot receive
        inquiries at all times during a day, the person or entity
        merely has to assert that the entity attempted to make the
        inquiry on that day for the previous sentence to apply to such
        an inquiry, and does not have to provide any additional proof
        concerning such inquiry.
        "(4) Confirmation or nonconfirmation. - 
          "(A) Confirmation upon initial inquiry. - If the person or
        other entity receives an appropriate confirmation of an
        individual's identity and work eligibility under the
        confirmation system within the time period specified under
        section 404(b) of this division, the person or entity shall
        record on the I-9 or similar form an appropriate code that is
        provided under the system and that indicates a final
        confirmation of such identity and work eligibility of the
        individual.
          "(B) Nonconfirmation upon initial inquiry and secondary
        verification. - 
            "(i) Nonconfirmation. - If the person or other entity
          receives a tentative nonconfirmation of an individual's
          identity or work eligibility under the confirmation system
          within the time period specified under 404(b) of this
          division, the person or entity shall so inform the individual
          for whom the confirmation is sought.
            "(ii) No contest. - If the individual does not contest the
          nonconfirmation within the time period specified in section
          404(c) of this division, the nonconfirmation shall be
          considered final. The person or entity shall then record on
          the I-9 or similar form an appropriate code which has been
          provided under the system to indicate a tentative
          nonconfirmation.
            "(iii) Contest. - If the individual does contest the
          nonconfirmation, the individual shall utilize the process for
          secondary verification provided under section 404(c) of this
          division. The nonconfirmation will remain tentative until a
          final confirmation or nonconfirmation is provided by the
          confirmation system within the time period specified in such
          section. In no case shall an employer terminate employment of
          an individual because of a failure of the individual to have
          identity and work eligibility confirmed under this section
          until a nonconfirmation becomes final. Nothing in this clause
          shall apply to a termination of employment for any reason
          other than because of such a failure.
            "(iv) Recording of conclusion on form. - If a final
          confirmation or nonconfirmation is provided by the
          confirmation system under section 404(c) of this division
          regarding an individual, the person or entity shall record on
          the I-9 or similar form an appropriate code that is provided
          under the system and that indicates a confirmation or
          nonconfirmation of identity and work eligibility of the
          individual.
          "(C) Consequences of nonconfirmation. - 
            "(i) Termination or notification of continued employment. -
          If the person or other entity has received a final
          nonconfirmation regarding an individual under subparagraph
          (B), the person or entity may terminate employment (or
          recruitment or referral) of the individual. If the person or
          entity does not terminate employment (or recruitment or
          referral) of the individual, the person or entity shall
          notify the Secretary of Homeland Security of such fact
          through the confirmation system or in such other manner as
          the Secretary of Homeland Security may specify.
            "(ii) Failure to notify. - If the person or entity fails to
          provide notice with respect to an individual as required
          under clause (i), the failure is deemed to constitute a
          violation of section 274A(a)(1)(B) with respect to that
          individual and the applicable civil monetary penalty under
          section 274A(e)(5) shall be (notwithstanding the amounts
          specified in such section) no less than $500 and no more than
          $1,000 for each individual with respect to whom such
          violation occurred.
            "(iii) Continued employment after final nonconfirmation. -
          If the person or other entity continues to employ (or to
          recruit or refer) an individual after receiving final
          nonconfirmation, a rebuttable presumption is created that the
          person or entity has violated section 274A(a)(1)(A). The
          previous sentence shall not apply in any prosecution under
          section 274A(f)(1).
      "(b) Citizen Attestation Pilot Program. - 
        "(1) In general. - Except as provided in paragraphs (3) through
      (5), the procedures applicable under the citizen attestation
      pilot program under this subsection shall be the same procedures
      as those under the E-Verify Program under subsection (a).
        "(2) Restrictions. - 
          "(A) State document requirement to participate in pilot
        program. - The Secretary of Homeland Security may not provide
        for the operation of the citizen attestation pilot program in a
        State unless each driver's license or similar identification
        document described in section 274A(b)(1)(D)(i) issued by the
        State - 
            "(i) contains a photograph of the individual involved, and
            "(ii) has been determined by the Secretary of Homeland
          Security to have security features, and to have been issued
          through application and issuance procedures, which make such
          document sufficiently resistant to counterfeiting, tampering,
          and fraudulent use that it is a reliable means of
          identification for purposes of this section.
          "(B) Authorization to limit employer participation. - The
        Secretary of Homeland Security may restrict the number of
        persons or other entities that may elect to participate in the
        citizen attestation pilot program under this subsection as the
        Secretary of Homeland Security determines to be necessary to
        produce a representative sample of employers and to reduce the
        potential impact of fraud.
        "(3) No confirmation required for certain individuals attesting
      to u.s. citizenship. - In the case of a person or other entity
      hiring (or recruiting or referring) an individual under the
      citizen attestation pilot program, if the individual attests to
      United States citizenship (under penalty of perjury on an I-9 or
      similar form which form states on its face the criminal and other
      penalties provided under law for a false representation of United
      States citizenship) - 
          "(A) the person or entity may fulfill the requirement to
        examine documentation contained in subparagraph (A) of section
        274A(b)(1) by examining a document specified in either
        subparagraph (B)(i) or (D) of such section; and
          "(B) the person or other entity is not required to comply
        with respect to such individual with the procedures described
        in paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (a), but only if the
        person or entity retains the form and makes it available for
        inspection in the same manner as in the case of an I-9 form
        under section 274A(b)(3).
        "(4) Waiver of document presentation requirement in certain
      cases. - 
          "(A) In general. - In the case of a person or entity that
        elects, in a manner specified by the Secretary of Homeland
        Security consistent with subparagraph (B), to participate in
        the pilot program under this paragraph, if an individual being
        hired (or recruited or referred) attests (in the manner
        described in paragraph (3)) to United States citizenship and
        the person or entity retains the form on which the attestation
        is made and makes it available for inspection in the same
        manner as in the case of an I-9 form under section 274A(b)(3),
        the person or entity is not required to comply with the
        procedures described in section 274A(b).
          "(B) Restriction. - The Secretary of Homeland Security shall
        restrict the election under this paragraph to no more than
        1,000 employers and, to the extent practicable, shall select
        among employers seeking to make such election in a manner that
        provides for such an election by a representative sample of
        employers.
        "(5) Nonreviewable determinations. - The determinations of the
      Secretary of Homeland Security under paragraphs (2) and (4) are
      within the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security and
      are not subject to judicial or administrative review.
      "(c) Machine-Readable-Document Pilot Program. - 
        "(1) In general. - Except as provided in paragraph (3), the
      procedures applicable under the machine-readable-document pilot
      program under this subsection shall be the same procedures as
      those under the E-Verify Program under subsection (a).
        "(2) State document requirement to participate in pilot
      program. - The Secretary of Homeland Security may not provide for
      the operation of the machine-readable-document pilot program in a
      State unless driver's licenses and similar identification
      documents described in section 274A(b)(1)(D)(i) issued by the
      State include a machine-readable social security account number.
        "(3) Use of machine-readable documents. - If the individual
      whose identity and employment eligibility must be confirmed
      presents to the person or entity hiring (or recruiting or
      referring) the individual a license or other document described
      in paragraph (2) that includes a machine-readable social security
      account number, the person or entity must make an inquiry through
      the confirmation system by using a machine-readable feature of
      such document. If the individual does not attest to United States
      citizenship under section 274A(b)(2), the individual's
      identification or authorization number described in subsection
      (a)(1)(B) shall be provided as part of the inquiry.
      "(d) Protection From Liability for Actions Taken on the Basis of
    Information Provided by the Confirmation System. - No person or
    entity participating in a pilot program shall be civilly or
    criminally liable under any law for any action taken in good faith
    reliance on information provided through the confirmation system.

      "SEC. 404. EMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITY CONFIRMATION SYSTEM.
      "(a) In General. - The Secretary of Homeland Security shall
    establish a pilot program confirmation system through which the
    Secretary of Homeland Security (or a designee of the Secretary of
    Homeland Security, which may be a nongovernmental entity) - 
        "(1) responds to inquiries made by electing persons and other
      entities (including those made by the transmittal of data from
      machine-readable documents under the machine-readable pilot
      program) at any time through a toll-free telephone line or other
      toll-free electronic media concerning an individual's identity
      and whether the individual is authorized to be employed, and
        "(2) maintains records of the inquiries that were made, of
      confirmations provided (or not provided), and of the codes
      provided to inquirers as evidence of their compliance with their
      obligations under the pilot programs.
    To the extent practicable, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall
    seek to establish such a system using one or more nongovernmental
    entities.
      "(b) Initial Response. - The confirmation system shall provide
    confirmation or a tentative nonconfirmation of an individual's
    identity and employment eligibility within 3 working days of the
    initial inquiry. If providing confirmation or tentative
    nonconfirmation, the confirmation system shall provide an
    appropriate code indicating such confirmation or such
    nonconfirmation.
      "(c) Secondary Verification Process in Case of Tentative
    Nonconfirmation. - In cases of tentative nonconfirmation, the
    Secretary of Homeland Security shall specify, in consultation with
    the Commissioner of Social Security and the Commissioner of the
    Immigration and Naturalization Service, an available secondary
    verification process to confirm the validity of information
    provided and to provide a final confirmation or nonconfirmation
    within 10 working days after the date of the tentative
    nonconfirmation. When final confirmation or nonconfirmation is
    provided, the confirmation system shall provide an appropriate code
    indicating such confirmation or nonconfirmation.
      "(d) Design and Operation of System. - The confirmation system
    shall be designed and operated - 
        "(1) to maximize its reliability and ease of use by persons and
      other entities making elections under section 402(a) of this
      division consistent with insulating and protecting the privacy
      and security of the underlying information;
        "(2) to respond to all inquiries made by such persons and
      entities on whether individuals are authorized to be employed and
      to register all times when such inquiries are not received;
        "(3) with appropriate administrative, technical, and physical
      safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personal
      information; and
        "(4) to have reasonable safeguards against the system's
      resulting in unlawful discriminatory practices based on national
      origin or citizenship status, including - 
          "(A) the selective or unauthorized use of the system to
        verify eligibility;
          "(B) the use of the system prior to an offer of employment;
        or
          "(C) the exclusion of certain individuals from consideration
        for employment as a result of a perceived likelihood that
        additional verification will be required, beyond what is
        required for most job applicants.
      "(e) Responsibilities of the Commissioner of Social Security. -
    As part of the confirmation system, the Commissioner of Social
    Security, in consultation with the entity responsible for
    administration of the system, shall establish a reliable, secure
    method, which, within the time periods specified under subsections
    (b) and (c), compares the name and social security account number
    provided in an inquiry against such information maintained by the
    Commissioner in order to confirm (or not confirm) the validity of
    the information provided regarding an individual whose identity and
    employment eligibility must be confirmed, the correspondence of the
    name and number, and whether the individual has presented a social
    security account number that is not valid for employment. The
    Commissioner shall not disclose or release social security
    information (other than such confirmation or nonconfirmation).
      "(f) Responsibilities of the Commissioner of the Immigration and
    Naturalization Service. - As part of the confirmation system, the
    Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in
    consultation with the entity responsible for administration of the
    system, shall establish a reliable, secure method, which, within
    the time periods specified under subsections (b) and (c), compares
    the name and alien identification or authorization number described
    in section 403(a)(1)(B) of this division which are provided in an
    inquiry against such information maintained by the Commissioner in
    order to confirm (or not confirm) the validity of the information
    provided, the correspondence of the name and number, and whether
    the alien is authorized to be employed in the United States.
      "(g) Updating Information. - The Commissioners of Social Security
    and the Immigration and Naturalization Service shall update their
    information in a manner that promotes the maximum accuracy and
    shall provide a process for the prompt correction of erroneous
    information, including instances in which it is brought to their
    attention in the secondary verification process described in
    subsection (c).
      "(h) Limitation on Use of the Confirmation System and Any Related
    Systems. - 
        "(1) In general. - Notwithstanding any other provision of law,
      nothing in this subtitle shall be construed to permit or allow
      any department, bureau, or other agency of the United States
      Government to utilize any information, data base, or other
      records assembled under this subtitle for any other purpose other
      than as provided for under this subtitle.
        "(2) No national identification card. - Nothing in this
      subtitle shall be construed to authorize, directly or indirectly,
      the issuance or use of national identification cards or the
      establishment of a national identification card.

      "SEC. 405. REPORTS.

      NATIONALITY ACT PROVISIONS AND USE OF AN ELECTRONIC EMPLOYMENT
                      ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION SYSTEM
      Ex. Ord. No. 12989, Feb. 13, 1996, 61 F.R. 6091, as amended by
    Ex. Ord. No. 13286, Sec. 19, Feb. 28, 2003, 68 F.R. 10623; Ex. Ord.
    No. 13465, Secs. 1-6, June 6, 2008, 73 F.R. 33285-33287, provided:
      This order is designed to promote economy and efficiency in
    Federal Government procurement. Stability and dependability are
    important elements of economy and efficiency. A contractor whose
    workforce is less stable will be less likely to produce goods and
    services economically and efficiently than a contractor whose
    workforce is more stable. It is the policy of the executive branch
    to enforce fully the immigration laws of the United States,
    including the detection and removal of illegal aliens and the
    imposition of legal sanctions against employers that hire illegal
    aliens. Because of the worksite enforcement policy of the United
    States and the underlying obligation of the executive branch to
    enforce the immigration laws, contractors that employ illegal
    aliens cannot rely on the continuing availability and service of
    those illegal workers, and such contractors inevitably will have a
    less stable and less dependable workforce than contractors that do
    not employ such persons. Where a contractor assigns illegal aliens
    to work on Federal contracts, the enforcement of Federal
    immigration laws imposes a direct risk of disruption, delay, and
    increased expense in Federal contracting. Such contractors are less
    dependable procurement sources, even if they do not knowingly hire
    or knowingly continue to employ unauthorized workers.
      Contractors that adopt rigorous employment eligibility
    confirmation policies are much less likely to face immigration
    enforcement actions, because they are less likely to employ
    unauthorized workers, and they are therefore generally more
    efficient and dependable procurement sources than contractors that
    do not employ the best available measures to verify the work
    eligibility of their workforce. It is the policy of the executive
    branch to use an electronic employment verification system because,
    among other reasons, it provides the best available means to
    confirm the identity and work eligibility of all employees that
    join the Federal workforce. Private employers that choose to
    contract with the Federal Government should meet the same standard.
      I find, therefore, that adherence to the general policy of
    contracting only with providers that do not knowingly employ
    unauthorized alien workers and that have agreed to utilize an
    electronic employment verification system designated by the
    Secretary of Homeland Security to confirm the employment
    eligibility of their workforce will promote economy and efficiency
    in Federal procurement.
      NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and efficient
    administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, and
    by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and
    the laws of the United States of America, including subsection
    121(a) of title 40 and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
    it is hereby ordered as follows:
      Section 1. (a) It is the policy of the executive branch in
    procuring goods and services that, to ensure the economical and
    efficient administration and completion of Federal Government
    contracts, contracting agencies should not contract with employers
    that have not complied with section 274A(a)(1)(A) and 274A(a)(2) of
    the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324a(a)(1)(A),
    1324a(a)(2)) (the "INA employment provisions") prohibiting the
    unlawful employment of aliens.
      (b) It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods
    and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient
    administration and completion of Federal Government contracts,
    contracting agencies may not enter into contracts with employers
    that do not use the best available means to confirm the work
    authorization of their workforce.
      (c) It is the policy of the executive branch to enforce fully the
    antidiscrimination provisions of the INA. Nothing in this order
    relieves employers of antidiscrimination obligations under section
    274B of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1324b) or any other law.
      (d) All discretion under this order shall be exercised consistent
    with the policies set forth in this section.
      Sec. 2. Contractor, as used in this Executive order, shall have
    the same meaning as defined in subpart 9.4 of the Federal
    Acquisition Regulation.
      Sec. 3. Using the procedures established pursuant to 8 U.S.C.
    1324a(e): (a) the Secretary of Homeland Security may investigate to
    determine whether a contractor or an organizational unit thereof is
    not in compliance with the INA employment provisions;
      (b) the Secretary of Homeland Security shall receive and may
    investigate complaints by employees of any entity covered under
    section 3(a) of this order where such complaints allege
    noncompliance with the INA employment provisions; and
      (c) the Attorney General shall hold such hearings as are required
    under 8 U.S.C. 1324a(e) to determine whether an entity covered
    under section 3(a) is not in compliance with the INA employment
    provisions.
      Sec. 4. (a) Whenever the Secretary of Homeland Security or the
    Attorney General determines that a contractor or an organizational
    unit thereof is not in compliance with the INA employment
    provisions, the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney
    General shall transmit that determination to the appropriate
    contracting agency and such other Federal agencies as the Secretary
    of Homeland Security or the Attorney General may determine. Upon
    receipt of such determination from the Secretary of Homeland
    Security or the Attorney General, the head of the appropriate
    contracting agency shall consider the contractor or an
    organizational unit thereof for debarment as well as for such other
    action as may be appropriate in accordance with the procedures and
    standards prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
      (b) The head of the contracting agency may debar the contractor
    or an organizational unit thereof based on the determination of the

    not in compliance with the INA employment provisions. Such
    determination shall not be reviewable in the debarment proceedings.
      (c) The scope of the debarment generally should be limited to
    those organizational units of a Federal contractor that the
    Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General finds are
    not in compliance with the INA employment provisions.
      (d) The period of the debarment shall be for 1 year and may be
    extended for additional periods of 1 year if, using the procedures
    established pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1324a(e), the Secretary of
    Homeland Security or the Attorney General determines that the
    organizational unit of the Federal contractor continues to be in
    violation of the INA employment provisions.
      (e) The Administrator of General Services shall list a debarred
    contractor or an organizational unit thereof on the List of Parties
    Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs and
    the contractor or an organizational unit thereof shall be
    ineligible to participate in any procurement or nonprocurement
    activities.
      Sec. 5. (a) Executive departments and agencies that enter into
    contracts shall require, as a condition of each contract, that the
    contractor agree to use an electronic employment eligibility
    verification system designated by the Secretary of Homeland
    Security to verify the employment eligibility of: (i) all persons
    hired during the contract term by the contractor to perform
    employment duties within the United States; and (ii) all persons
    assigned by the contractor to perform work within the United States
    on the Federal contract.
      (b) The Secretary of Homeland Security:
      (i) shall administer, maintain, and modify as necessary and
    appropriate the electronic employment eligibility verification
    system designated by the Secretary under subsection (a) of this
    section; and
      (ii) may establish with respect to such electronic employment
    verification system:
        (A) terms and conditions for use of the system; and
        (B) procedures for monitoring the use, failure to use, or
      improper use of the system.
      (c) The Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of General
    Services, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and
    Space Administration shall amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation
    to the extent necessary and appropriate to implement the debarment
    responsibility, the employment eligibility verification
    responsibility, and other related responsibilities assigned to
    heads of departments and agencies under this order.
      (d) Except to the extent otherwise specified by law or this
    order, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General:
      (i) shall administer and enforce this order; and
      (ii) may, after consultation to the extent appropriate with the
    Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Labor, the Administrator of
    General Services, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and
    Space Administration, the Administrator for Federal Procurement
    Policy, and the heads of such other departments or agencies as may
    be appropriate, issue such rules, regulations, or orders, or
    establish such requirements, as may be necessary and appropriate to
    implement this order.
      Sec. 6. Each contracting department and agency shall cooperate
    with and provide such information and assistance to the Secretary
    of Homeland Security and the Attorney General as may be required in
    the performance of their respective functions under this order.
      Sec. 7. The Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General,
    the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of General Services,
    the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space
    Administration, and the heads of contracting departments and
    agencies may delegate any of their functions or duties under this
    order to any officer or employee of their respective departments or
    agencies.
      Sec. 8. (a) This order shall be implemented in a manner intended
    to minimize the burden on participants in the Federal procurement
    process.
      (b) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with
    the protection of intelligence and law enforcement sources,
    methods, and activities from unauthorized disclosure.

      (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
    Budget relating to budget, administrative, or legislative
    proposals.
      (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable

    other person.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1324b. Unfair immigration-related employment practices

-STATUTE-
    (a) Prohibition of discrimination based on national origin or
      citizenship status
      (1) General rule
        It is an unfair immigration-related employment practice for a
      person or other entity to discriminate against any individual
      (other than an unauthorized alien, as defined in section
      1324a(h)(3) of this title) with respect to the hiring, or
      recruitment or referral for a fee, of the individual for
      employment or the discharging of the individual from employment -
      
          (A) because of such individual's national origin, or
          (B) in the case of a protected individual (as defined in
        paragraph (3)), because of such individual's citizenship
        status.
      (2) Exceptions
        Paragraph (1) shall not apply to - 
          (A) a person or other entity that employs three or fewer
        employees,
          (B) a person's or entity's discrimination because of an
        individual's national origin if the discrimination with respect
        to that person or entity and that individual is covered under
        section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000e-
        2], or
          (C) discrimination because of citizenship status which is
        otherwise required in order to comply with law, regulation, or
        executive order, or required by Federal, State, or local
        government contract, or which the Attorney General determines
        to be essential for an employer to do business with an agency
        or department of the Federal, State, or local government.
      (3) "Protected individual" defined
        As used in paragraph (1), the term "protected individual" means
      an individual who - 
          (A) is a citizen or national of the United States, or
          (B) is an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent
        residence, is granted the status of an alien lawfully admitted
        for temporary residence under section 1160(a) or 1255a(a)(1) of
        this title, is admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of this
        title, or is granted asylum under section 1158 of this title;
        but does not include (i) an alien who fails to apply for
        naturalization within six months of the date the alien first
        becomes eligible (by virtue of period of lawful permanent
        residence) to apply for naturalization or, if later, within six
        months after November 6, 1986, and (ii) an alien who has
        applied on a timely basis, but has not been naturalized as a
        citizen within 2 years after the date of the application,
        unless the alien can establish that the alien is actively
        pursuing naturalization, except that time consumed in the
        Service's processing the application shall not be counted
        toward the 2-year period.
      (4) Additional exception providing right to prefer equally
        qualified citizens
        Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, it is not
      an unfair immigration-related employment practice for a person or
      other entity to prefer to hire, recruit, or refer an individual
      who is a citizen or national of the United States over another
      individual who is an alien if the two individuals are equally
      qualified.
      (5) Prohibition of intimidation or retaliation
        It is also an unfair immigration-related employment practice
      for a person or other entity to intimidate, threaten, coerce, or
      retaliate against any individual for the purpose of interfering
      with any right or privilege secured under this section or because
      the individual intends to file or has filed a charge or a
      complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in
      an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this section. An
      individual so intimidated, threatened, coerced, or retaliated
      against shall be considered, for purposes of subsections (d) and
      (g) of this section, to have been discriminated against.
      (6) Treatment of certain documentary practices as employment
        practices
        A person's or other entity's request, for purposes of
      satisfying the requirements of section 1324a(b) of this title,
      for more or different documents than are required under such
      section or refusing to honor documents tendered that on their
      face reasonably appear to be genuine shall be treated as an
      unfair immigration-related employment practice if made for the
      purpose or with the intent of discriminating against an
      individual in violation of paragraph (1).
    (b) Charges of violations
      (1) In general
        Except as provided in paragraph (2), any person alleging that
      the person is adversely affected directly by an unfair
      immigration-related employment practice (or a person on that
      person's behalf) or an officer of the Service alleging that an
      unfair immigration-related employment practice has occurred or is
      occurring may file a charge respecting such practice or violation
      with the Special Counsel (appointed under subsection (c) of this
      section). Charges shall be in writing under oath or affirmation
      and shall contain such information as the Attorney General
      requires. The Special Counsel by certified mail shall serve a
      notice of the charge (including the date, place, and
      circumstances of the alleged unfair immigration-related
      employment practice) on the person or entity involved within 10
      days.
      (2) No overlap with EEOC complaints
        No charge may be filed respecting an unfair immigration-related
      employment practice described in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this
      section if a charge with respect to that practice based on the
      same set of facts has been filed with the Equal Employment
      Opportunity Commission under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
      1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.], unless the charge is dismissed as
      being outside the scope of such title. No charge respecting an
      employment practice may be filed with the Equal Employment
      Opportunity Commission under such title if a charge with respect
      to such practice based on the same set of facts has been filed
      under this subsection, unless the charge is dismissed under this
      section as being outside the scope of this section.
    (c) Special Counsel
      (1) Appointment
        The President shall appoint, by and with the advice and consent
      of the Senate, a Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair
      Employment Practices (hereinafter in this section referred to as
      the "Special Counsel") within the Department of Justice to serve
      for a term of four years. In the case of a vacancy in the office
      of the Special Counsel the President may designate the officer or
      employee who shall act as Special Counsel during such vacancy.
      (2) Duties
        The Special Counsel shall be responsible for investigation of
      charges and issuance of complaints under this section and in
      respect of the prosecution of all such complaints before
      administrative law judges and the exercise of certain functions
      under subsection (j)(1) of this section.
      (3) Compensation
        The Special Counsel is entitled to receive compensation at a
      rate not to exceed the rate now or hereafter provided for grade
      GS-17 of the General Schedule, under section 5332 of title 5.
      (4) Regional offices
        The Special Counsel, in accordance with regulations of the
      Attorney General, shall establish such regional offices as may be
      necessary to carry out his duties.
    (d) Investigation of charges
      (1) By Special Counsel
        The Special Counsel shall investigate each charge received and,
      within 120 days of the date of the receipt of the charge,
      determine whether or not there is reasonable cause to believe
      that the charge is true and whether or not to bring a complaint
      with respect to the charge before an administrative law judge.
      The Special Counsel may, on his own initiative, conduct
      investigations respecting unfair immigration-related employment
      practices and, based on such an investigation and subject to
      paragraph (3), file a complaint before such a judge.
      (2) Private actions
        If the Special Counsel, after receiving such a charge
      respecting an unfair immigration-related employment practice
      which alleges knowing and intentional discriminatory activity or
      a pattern or practice of discriminatory activity, has not filed a
      complaint before an administrative law judge with respect to such
      charge within such 120-day period, the Special Counsel shall
      notify the person making the charge of the determination not to
      file such a complaint during such period and the person making
      the charge may (subject to paragraph (3)) file a complaint
      directly before such a judge within 90 days after the date of
      receipt of the notice. The Special Counsel's failure to file such
      a complaint within such 120-day period shall not affect the right
      of the Special Counsel to investigate the charge or to bring a
      complaint before an administrative law judge during such 90-day
      period.
      (3) Time limitations on complaints
        No complaint may be filed respecting any unfair immigration-
      related employment practice occurring more than 180 days prior
      to the date of the filing of the charge with the Special Counsel.
      This subparagraph shall not prevent the subsequent amending of a
      charge or complaint under subsection (e)(1) of this section.
    (e) Hearings
      (1) Notice
        Whenever a complaint is made that a person or entity has
      engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair immigration-related
      employment practice, an administrative law judge shall have power
      to issue and cause to be served upon such person or entity a copy
      of the complaint and a notice of hearing before the judge at a
      place therein fixed, not less than five days after the serving of
      the complaint. Any such complaint may be amended by the judge
      conducting the hearing, upon the motion of the party filing the
      complaint, in the judge's discretion at any time prior to the
      issuance of an order based thereon. The person or entity so
      complained of shall have the right to file an answer to the
      original or amended complaint and to appear in person or
      otherwise and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the
      complaint.
      (2) Judges hearing cases
        Hearings on complaints under this subsection shall be
      considered before administrative law judges who are specially
      designated by the Attorney General as having special training
      respecting employment discrimination and, to the extent
      practicable, before such judges who only consider cases under
      this section.
      (3) Complainant as party
        Any person filing a charge with the Special Counsel respecting
      an unfair immigration-related employment practice shall be
      considered a party to any complaint before an administrative law
      judge respecting such practice and any subsequent appeal
      respecting that complaint. In the discretion of the judge
      conducting the hearing, any other person may be allowed to
      intervene in the proceeding and to present testimony.
    (f) Testimony and authority of hearing officers
      (1) Testimony
        The testimony taken by the administrative law judge shall be
      reduced to writing. Thereafter, the judge, in his discretion,
      upon notice may provide for the taking of further testimony or
      hear argument.
      (2) Authority of administrative law judges
        In conducting investigations and hearings under this subsection
      (!1) and in accordance with regulations of the Attorney General,
      the Special Counsel and administrative law judges shall have
      reasonable access to examine evidence of any person or entity
      being investigated. The administrative law judges by subpoena may
      compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence
      at any designated place or hearing. In case of contumacy or
      refusal to obey a subpoena lawfully issued under this paragraph
      and upon application of the administrative law judge, an
      appropriate district court of the United States may issue an
      order requiring compliance with such subpoena and any failure to
      obey such order may be punished by such court as a contempt
      thereof.

    (g) Determinations
      (1) Order
        The administrative law judge shall issue and cause to be served
      on the parties to the proceeding an order, which shall be final
      unless appealed as provided under subsection (i) of this section.
      (2) Orders finding violations
        (A) In general
          If, upon the preponderance of the evidence, an administrative
        law judge determines that any person or entity named in the
        complaint has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair
        immigration-related employment practice, then the judge shall
        state his findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be
        served on such person or entity an order which requires such
        person or entity to cease and desist from such unfair
        immigration-related employment practice.
        (B) Contents of order
          Such an order also may require the person or entity - 
            (i) to comply with the requirements of section 1324a(b) of
          this title with respect to individuals hired (or recruited or
          referred for employment for a fee) during a period of up to
          three years;
            (ii) to retain for the period referred to in clause (i) and
          only for purposes consistent with section 1324a(b)(5) of this
          title, the name and address of each individual who applies,
          in person or in writing, for hiring for an existing position,
          or for recruiting or referring for a fee, for employment in
          the United States;
            (iii) to hire individuals directly and adversely affected,
          with or without back pay;
            (iv)(I) except as provided in subclauses (II) through (IV),
          to pay a civil penalty of not less than $250 and not more
          than $2,000 for each individual discriminated against,
            (II) except as provided in subclauses (III) and (IV), in
          the case of a person or entity previously subject to a single
          order under this paragraph, to pay a civil penalty of not
          less than $2,000 and not more than $5,000 for each individual
          discriminated against,
            (III) except as provided in subclause (IV), in the case of
          a person or entity previously subject to more than one order
          under this paragraph, to pay a civil penalty of not less than
          $3,000 and not more than $10,000 for each individual
          discriminated against, and
            (IV) in the case of an unfair immigration-related
          employment practice described in subsection (a)(6) of this
          section, to pay a civil penalty of not less than $100 and not
          more than $1,000 for each individual discriminated against;
            (v) to post notices to employees about their rights under
          this section and employers' obligations under section 1324a
          of this title;
            (vi) to educate all personnel involved in hiring and
          complying with this section or section 1324a of this title
          about the requirements of this section or such section;
            (vii) to remove (in an appropriate case) a false
          performance review or false warning from an employee's
          personnel file; and
            (viii) to lift (in an appropriate case) any restrictions on
          an employee's assignments, work shifts, or movements.
        (C) Limitation on back pay remedy
          In providing a remedy under subparagraph (B)(iii), back pay
        liability shall not accrue from a date more than two years
        prior to the date of the filing of a charge with the Special
        Counsel. Interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable
        diligence by the individual or individuals discriminated
        against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise
        allowable under such paragraph. No order shall require the
        hiring of an individual as an employee or the payment to an
        individual of any back pay, if the individual was refused
        employment for any reason other than discrimination on account
        of national origin or citizenship status.
        (D) Treatment of distinct entities
          In applying this subsection in the case of a person or entity
        composed of distinct, physically separate subdivisions each of
        which provides separately for the hiring, recruiting, or
        referring for employment, without reference to the practices
        of, and not under the control of or common control with,
        another subdivision, each such subdivision shall be considered
        a separate person or entity.
      (3) Orders not finding violations
        If upon the preponderance of the evidence an administrative law
      judge determines that the person or entity named in the complaint
      has not engaged and is not engaging in any such unfair
      immigration-related employment practice, then the judge shall
      state his findings of fact and shall issue an order dismissing
      the complaint.
    (h) Awarding of attorney's fees
      In any complaint respecting an unfair immigration-related
    employment practice, an administrative law judge, in the judge's
    discretion, may allow a prevailing party, other than the United
    States, a reasonable attorney's fee, if the losing party's argument
    is without reasonable foundation in law and fact.
    (i) Review of final orders
      (1) In general
        Not later than 60 days after the entry of such final order, any
      person aggrieved by such final order may seek a review of such
      order in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in
      which the violation is alleged to have occurred or in which the
      employer resides or transacts business.
      (2) Further review
        Upon the filing of the record with the court, the jurisdiction
      of the court shall be exclusive and its judgment shall be final,
      except that the same shall be subject to review by the Supreme
      Court of the United States upon writ of certiorari or
      certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.
    (j) Court enforcement of administrative orders
      (1) In general
        If an order of the agency is not appealed under subsection
      (i)(1) of this section, the Special Counsel (or, if the Special
      Counsel fails to act, the person filing the charge) may petition
      the United States district court for the district in which a
      violation of the order is alleged to have occurred, or in which
      the respondent resides or transacts business, for the enforcement

    shall be aimed at increasing the knowledge of employers, employees,
    and the general public concerning employer and employee rights,
    responsibilities, and remedies under this section and such title.
      (2) In order to carry out the campaign under this subsection, the

      the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the heads of
      such other agencies as may be appropriate.

        provide the person or entity with notice and, upon request made
        within a reasonable time (of not less than 30 days, as
        established by the Attorney General) of the date of the notice,
        a hearing respecting the violation.
        (B) Conduct of hearing
          Any hearing so requested shall be conducted before an
        administrative law judge. The hearing shall be conducted in
        accordance with the requirements of section 554 of title 5. The
        hearing shall be held at the nearest practicable place to the
        place where the person or entity resides or of the place where
        the alleged violation occurred. If no hearing is so requested,
        the Attorney General's imposition of the order shall constitute
        a final and unappealable order.
        (C) Issuance of orders
          If the administrative law judge determines, upon the
        preponderance of the evidence received, that a person or entity
        has violated subsection (a) of this section, the administrative
        law judge shall state his findings of fact and issue and cause
        to be served on such person or entity an order described in
        paragraph (3).
      (3) Cease and desist order with civil money penalty
        With respect to a violation of subsection (a) of this section,
      the order under this subsection shall require the person or
      entity to cease and desist from such violations and to pay a
      civil penalty in an amount of - 
          (A) not less than $250 and not more than $2,000 for each
        document that is the subject of a violation under subsection
        (a) of this section, or
          (B) in the case of a person or entity previously subject to
        an order under this paragraph, not less than $2,000 and not
        more than $5,000 for each document that is the subject of a
        violation under subsection (a) of this section.

      In applying this subsection in the case of a person or entity
      composed of distinct, physically separate subdivisions each of
      which provides separately for the hiring, recruiting, or
      referring for employment, without reference to the practices of,
      and not under the control of or common control with, another
      subdivision, each such subdivision shall be considered a separate
      person or entity.
      (4) Administrative appellate review
        The decision and order of an administrative law judge shall
      become the final agency decision and order of the Attorney
      General unless either (A) within 30 days, an official delegated
      by regulation to exercise review authority over the decision and
      order modifies or vacates the decision and order, or (B) within
      30 days of the date of such a modification or vacation (or within
      60 days of the date of decision and order of an administrative
      law judge if not so modified or vacated) the decision and order
      is referred to the Attorney General pursuant to regulations, in
      which case the decision and order of the Attorney General shall
      become the final agency decision and order under this subsection.
      (5) Judicial review
        A person or entity adversely affected by a final order under
      this section may, within 45 days after the date the final order
      is issued, file a petition in the Court of Appeals for the
      appropriate circuit for review of the order.
      (6) Enforcement of orders
        If a person or entity fails to comply with a final order issued
      under this section against the person or entity, the Attorney
      General shall file a suit to seek compliance with the order in
      any appropriate district court of the United States. In any such
      suit, the validity and appropriateness of the final order shall
      not be subject to review.
      (7) Waiver by Attorney General
        The Attorney General may waive the penalties imposed by this
      section with respect to an alien who knowingly violates
      subsection (a)(6) of this section if the alien is granted asylum
      under section 1158 of this title or withholding of removal under
      section 1231(b)(3) of this title.
    (e) Criminal penalties for failure to disclose role as document
      preparer
      (1) Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the
    Service, knowingly and willfully fails to disclose, conceals, or

    a fee or other remuneration, prepared or assisted in preparing an
    application which was falsely made (as defined in subsection (f) of
    this section) for immigration benefits, shall be fined in

    both, and prohibited from preparing or assisting in preparing,
    whether or not for a fee or other remuneration, any other such
    application.
      (2) Whoever, having been convicted of a violation of paragraph
    (1), knowingly and willfully prepares or assists in preparing an
    application for immigration benefits pursuant to this chapter, or
    the regulations promulgated thereunder, whether or not for a fee or
    other remuneration and regardless of whether in any matter within
    the jurisdiction of the Service, shall be fined in accordance with
    title 18, imprisoned for not more than 15 years, or both, and
    prohibited from preparing or assisting in preparing any other such
    application.
    (f) Falsely make
      For purposes of this section, the term "falsely make" means to
    prepare or provide an application or document, with knowledge or in
    reckless disregard of the fact that the application or document
    contains a false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or material

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1326. Reentry of removed aliens

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      Subject to subsection (b) of this section, any alien who - 
        (1) has been denied admission, excluded, deported, or removed
      or has departed the United States while an order of exclusion,
      deportation, or removal is outstanding, and thereafter
        (2) enters, attempts to enter, or is at any time found in, the
      United States, unless (A) prior to his reembarkation at a place
      outside the United States or his application for admission from
      foreign contiguous territory, the Attorney General has expressly
      consented to such alien's reapplying for admission; or (B) with
      respect to an alien previously denied admission and removed,
      unless such alien shall establish that he was not required to
      obtain such advance consent under this chapter or any prior Act,

    shall be fined under title 18, or imprisoned not more than 2 years,
    or both.
    (b) Criminal penalties for reentry of certain removed aliens
      Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in the case of
    any alien described in such subsection - 
        (1) whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission
      of three or more misdemeanors involving drugs, crimes against the
      person, or both, or a felony (other than an aggravated felony),
      such alien shall be fined under title 18, imprisoned not more
      than 10 years, or both;
        (2) whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission
      of an aggravated felony, such alien shall be fined under such
      title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both;
        (3) who has been excluded from the United States pursuant to
      section 1225(c) of this title because the alien was excludable
      under section 1182(a)(3)(B) of this title or who has been removed
      from the United States pursuant to the provisions of subchapter
      V, and who thereafter, without the permission of the Attorney
      General, enters the United States, or attempts to do so, shall be
      fined under title 18 and imprisoned for a period of 10 years,
      which sentence shall not run concurrently with any other
      sentence.(!1) or

        (4) who was removed from the United States pursuant to section
      1231(a)(4)(B) of this title who thereafter, without the
      permission of the Attorney General, enters, attempts to enter, or
      is at any time found in, the United States (unless the Attorney
      General has expressly consented to such alien's reentry) shall be
      fined under title 18, imprisoned for not more than 10 years, or
      both.

    For the purposes of this subsection, the term "removal" includes
    any agreement in which an alien stipulates to removal during (or
    not during) a criminal trial under either Federal or State law.
    (c) Reentry of alien deported prior to completion of term of
      imprisonment
      Any alien deported pursuant to section 1252(h)(2) (!2) of this
    title who enters, attempts to enter, or is at any time found in,
    the United States (unless the Attorney General has expressly
    consented to such alien's reentry) shall be incarcerated for the
    remainder of the sentence of imprisonment which was pending at the
    time of deportation without any reduction for parole or supervised
    release. Such alien shall be subject to such other penalties
    relating to the reentry of deported aliens as may be available
    under this section or any other provision of law.

    (d) Limitation on collateral attack on underlying deportation order
      In a criminal proceeding under this section, an alien may not
    challenge the validity of the deportation order described in
    subsection (a)(1) of this section or subsection (b) of this section
    unless the alien demonstrates that - 
        (1) the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may
      have been available to seek relief against the order;
        (2) the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued
      improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial
      review; and
        (3) the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.

    efficiency. No intoxicating liquors shall be sold at any immigrant
    station.
      (b) Such articles determined by the Attorney General to be
    necessary to the health and welfare of aliens detained at any
    immigrant station, when not otherwise readily procurable by such
    aliens, may be sold at reasonable prices to such aliens through
    Government canteens operated by the Service, under such conditions
    and limitations as the Attorney General shall prescribe.
      (c) All rentals or other receipts accruing from the disposal of
    privileges, and all moneys arising from the sale of articles
    through Service-operated canteens, authorized by this section,

    year in which the expenses were incurred.
    (b) Purchase of evidence
      Moneys expended from appropriations for the Service for the
    purchase of evidence and subsequently recovered shall be reimbursed
    to the current appropriation for the Service.
    (c) Fees and administrative fines and penalties; exception
      Except as otherwise provided in subsection (a) and subsection (b)
    of this section, or in any other provision of this subchapter, all
    moneys received in payment of fees and administrative fines and
    penalties under this subchapter shall be covered into the Treasury
    as miscellaneous receipts: Provided, however, That all fees
    received from applicants residing in the Virgin Islands of the
    United States, and in Guam, required to be paid under section 1351
    of this title, shall be paid over to the Treasury of the Virgin
    Islands and to the Treasury of Guam, respectively.
    (d) Schedule of fees
      In addition to any other fee authorized by law, the Attorney
    General shall charge and collect $7 per individual for the

    in a place outside of the United States prior to such arrival,
    aboard a commercial aircraft or commercial vessel.
    (e) Limitations on fees
      (1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), no fee shall be charged
    under subsection (d) of this section for immigration inspection or
    preinspection provided in connection with the arrival of any

      (1) Each person that issues a document or ticket to an individual
    for transportation by a commercial vessel or commercial aircraft
    into the United States shall - 
        (A) collect from that individual the fee charged under
      subsection (d) of this section at the time the document or ticket
      is issued; and
        (B) identify on that document or ticket the fee charged under
      subsection (d) of this section as a Federal inspection fee.

      (2) If - 
        (A) a document or ticket for transportation of a passenger into
      the United States is issued in a foreign country; and
        (B) the fee charged under subsection (d) of this section is not
      collected at the time such document or ticket is issued;

    the person providing transportation to such passenger shall collect
    such fee at the time such passenger departs from the United States
    and shall provide such passenger a receipt for the payment of such
    fee.
      (3) The person who collects fees under paragraph (1) or (2) shall
    remit those fees to the Attorney General at any time before the

    the date that is ten days before the end of the fiscal year, and
    the first quarter payment shall include any collections made in the
    preceding quarter that were not remitted with the previous payment.

    (d) of this section and the remittance of such fees to the Treasury
    of the United States shall be consistent with the regulations
    issued by the Secretary of the Treasury for the collection and
    remittance of the taxes imposed by subchapter C of chapter 33 of
    title 26, but only to the extent the regulations issued with
    respect to such taxes do not conflict with the provisions of this
    section.
    (g) Provision of immigration inspection and preinspection services
      Notwithstanding section 1353b of this title, or any other
    provision of law, the immigration services required to be provided
    to passengers upon arrival in the United States on scheduled
    airline flights shall be adequately provided when needed and at no
    cost (other than the fees imposed under subsection (d) of this
    section) to airlines and airline passengers at:
        (1) immigration serviced airports, and
        (2) places located outside of the United States at which an
      immigration officer is stationed for the purpose of providing
      such immigration services.
    (h) Disposition of receipts
      (1)(A) There is established in the general fund of the Treasury a
    separate account which shall be known as the "Immigration User Fee

    Immigration User Fee Account all fees collected under subsection
    (d) of this section, to remain available until expended..(!1) At
    the end of each 2-year period, beginning with the creation of this
    account, the Attorney General, following a public rulemaking with
    opportunity for notice and comment, shall submit a report to the
    Congress concerning the status of the account, including any
    balances therein, and recommend any adjustment in the prescribed
    fee that may be required to ensure that the receipts collected from
    the fee charged for the succeeding two years equal, as closely as
    possible, the cost of providing these services.

      (B) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, all civil fines
    or penalties collected pursuant to sections 1253(c), 1321, and 1323
    of this title and all liquidated damages and expenses collected
    pursuant to this chapter shall be deposited in the Immigration User
    Fee Account.

    services for commercial aircraft or vessels and in - 
        (i) providing overtime immigration inspection services for
      commercial aircraft or vessels;

      systems for nonimmigrant control and debt collection;
        (iv) detection of fraudulent documents used by passengers
      traveling to the United States, including training of, and
      technical assistance to, commercial airline personnel regarding
      such detection;

      aliens arriving on commercial aircraft and vessels and for any

      avoidance of immigration inspection at air or sea ports-of-entry;
      and
        (vi) providing removal and asylum proceedings at air or sea
      ports-of-entry for inadmissible aliens arriving on commercial
      aircraft and vessels including immigration removal proceedings
      resulting from presentation of fraudulent documents and failure
      to present documentation and for any alien who is inadmissible
      under section 1182(a) of this title who has attempted illegal
      entry into the United States through avoidance of immigration

    amounts subsequently refunded under subparagraph (A) to the extent
    prior estimates were in excess of, or less than, the amount
    required to be refunded under subparagraph (A).
    (i) Reimbursement
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Attorney General
    is authorized to receive reimbursement from the owner, operator, or
    agent of a private or commercial aircraft or vessel, or from any

    issues as the time periods during which such services should be
    performed, the proper number and deployment of inspection officers,
    the level of fees, and the appropriateness of any proposed fee. The
    Attorney General shall give substantial consideration to the views
    of the advisory committee in the exercise of his duties.
    (l) Report to Congress

    General or through clerks of courts: Provided, however, That all
    fees received by the Attorney General from applicants residing in

    subsection shall be paid over to the treasury of the Virgin Islands

    providing adjudication and naturalization services may be set at a
    level that will ensure recovery of the full costs of providing all
    such services, including the costs of similar services provided

    may also be set at a level that will recover any additional costs
    associated with the administration of the fees collected.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Powers without warrant
      Any officer or employee of the Service authorized under
    regulations prescribed by the Attorney General shall have power
    without warrant - 
        (1) to interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien
      as to his right to be or to remain in the United States;
        (2) to arrest any alien who in his presence or view is entering
      or attempting to enter the United States in violation of any law
      or regulation made in pursuance of law regulating the admission,
      exclusion, expulsion, or removal of aliens, or to arrest any
      alien in the United States, if he has reason to believe that the
      alien so arrested is in the United States in violation of any
      such law or regulation and is likely to escape before a warrant
      can be obtained for his arrest, but the alien arrested shall be
      taken without unnecessary delay for examination before an officer
      of the Service having authority to examine aliens as to their
      right to enter or remain in the United States;
        (3) within a reasonable distance from any external boundary of
      the United States, to board and search for aliens any vessel
      within the territorial waters of the United States and any
      railway car, aircraft, conveyance, or vehicle, and within a
      distance of twenty-five miles from any such external boundary to
      have access to private lands, but not dwellings, for the purpose
      of patrolling the border to prevent the illegal entry of aliens
      into the United States;
        (4) to make arrests for felonies which have been committed and
      which are cognizable under any law of the United States
      regulating the admission, exclusion, expulsion, or removal of
      aliens, if he has reason to believe that the person so arrested
      is guilty of such felony and if there is likelihood of the person
      escaping before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest, but the
      person arrested shall be taken without unnecessary delay before
      the nearest available officer empowered to commit persons charged
      with offenses against the laws of the United States; and
        (5) to make arrests - 
          (A) for any offense against the United States, if the offense
        is committed in the officer's or employee's presence, or
          (B) for any felony cognizable under the laws of the United
        States, if the officer or employee has reasonable grounds to
        believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is
        committing such a felony,

      if the officer or employee is performing duties relating to the
      enforcement of the immigration laws at the time of the arrest and
      if there is a likelihood of the person escaping before a warrant
      can be obtained for his arrest.

    employee of the Service may carry a firearm and may execute and
    serve any order, warrant, subpoena, summons, or other process
    issued under the authority of the United States. The authority to
    make arrests under paragraph (5)(B) shall only be effective on and
    after the date on which the Attorney General publishes final
    regulations which (i) prescribe the categories of officers and
    employees of the Service who may use force (including deadly force)
    and the circumstances under which such force may be used, (ii)
    establish standards with respect to enforcement activities of the
    Service, (iii) require that any officer or employee of the Service
    is not authorized to make arrests under paragraph (5)(B) unless the
    officer or employee has received certification as having completed
    a training program which covers such arrests and standards
    described in clause (ii), and (iv) establish an expedited, internal
    review process for violations of such standards, which process is
    consistent with standard agency procedure regarding confidentiality
    of matters related to internal investigations.
    (b) Administration of oath; taking of evidence
      Any officer or employee of the Service designated by the Attorney
    General, whether individually or as one of a class, shall have

    pass through, or reside in the United States, or concerning any
    matter which is material or relevant to the enforcement of this
    chapter and the administration of the Service; and any person to
    whom such oath has been administered, (or who has executed an
    unsworn declaration, certificate, verification, or statement under
    penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28)
    under the provisions of this chapter, who shall knowingly or
    willfully give false evidence or swear (or subscribe under penalty
    of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28) to any
    false statement concerning any matter referred to in this
    subsection shall be guilty of perjury and shall be punished as
    provided by section 1621 of title 18.
    (c) Search without warrant
      Any officer or employee of the Service authorized and designated
    under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, whether
    individually or as one of a class, shall have power to conduct a
    search, without warrant, of the person, and of the personal effects
    in the possession of any person seeking admission to the United
    States, concerning whom such officer or employee may have
    reasonable cause to suspect that grounds exist for denial of
    admission to the United States under this chapter which would be
    disclosed by such search.
    (d) Detainer of aliens for violation of controlled substances laws
      In the case of an alien who is arrested by a Federal, State, or
    local law enforcement official for a violation of any law relating
    to controlled substances, if the official (or another official) - 
        (1) has reason to believe that the alien may not have been
      lawfully admitted to the United States or otherwise is not
      lawfully present in the United States,

-STATUTE-
      Whenever any person makes application for a visa or any other
    document required for entry, or makes application for admission, or
    otherwise attempts to enter the United States, the burden of proof
    shall be upon such person to establish that he is eligible to
    receive such visa or such document, or is not inadmissible under
    any provision of this chapter, and, if an alien, that he is
    entitled to the nonimmigrant, immigrant, special immigrant,
    immediate relative, or refugee status claimed, as the case may be.
    If such person fails to establish to the satisfaction of the
    consular officer that he is eligible to receive a visa or other
    document required for entry, no visa or other document required for
    entry shall be issued to such person, nor shall such person be

    proof shall be upon such person to show the time, place, and manner
    of his entry into the United States, but in presenting such proof
    he shall be entitled to the production of his visa or other entry

        were released into the community due to a lack of detention
        facilities in each of the 3 fiscal years concluded prior to the
        date of the report notwithstanding circumstances that the
        Attorney General believed justified detention (for example, a
        significant probability that the released alien would not
        appear, as agreed, at subsequent exclusion or deportation
        proceedings).
        (C) Subsequent reports
          Each report under paragraph (1) following the first such
        report shall include the estimates under subparagraphs (A) and
        (B), made with respect to the 6-month period immediately
        preceding the date of the submission of the report.

    shall break the continuity of such residence, except that in the
    case of a person who has been physically present and residing in
    the United States, after being lawfully admitted for permanent
    residence, for an uninterrupted period of at least one year, and
    who thereafter is employed by or under contract with the Government
    of the United States or an American institution of research
    recognized as such by the Attorney General, or is employed by an

      (whether such period begins before or after his departure from
      the United States), but prior to the expiration of one year of
      continuous absence from the United States, the person has
      established to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that his
      absence from the United States for such period is to be on behalf
      of such Government, or for the purpose of carrying on scientific
      research on behalf of such institution, or to be engaged in the
      development of such foreign trade and commerce or whose residence
      abroad is necessary to the protection of the property rights in
      such countries in such firm or corporation, or to be employed by
      a public international organization of which the United States is
      a member by treaty or statute and by which the alien was not
      employed until after being lawfully admitted for permanent
      residence; and
        (2) such person proves to the satisfaction of the Attorney
      General that his absence from the United States for such period

    shall not relieve the applicant from the requirement of physical
    presence within the United States for the period specified in
    subsection (a) of this section, except in the case of those persons
    who are employed by, or under contract with, the Government of the
    United States. In the case of a person employed by or under

    subsection (b) of this section of an uninterrupted period of at
    least one year of physical presence in the United States may be
    complied with by such person at any time prior to filing an
    application for naturalization.
    (d) Moral character
      No finding by the Attorney General that the applicant is not
    deportable shall be accepted as conclusive evidence of good moral
    character.
    (e) Determination
      In determining whether the applicant has sustained the burden of
    establishing good moral character and the other qualifications for
    citizenship specified in subsection (a) of this section, the
    Attorney General shall not be limited to the applicant's conduct
    during the five years preceding the filing of the application, but
    may take into consideration as a basis for such determination the
    applicant's conduct and acts at any time prior to that period.
    (f) Persons making extraordinary contributions to national security
      (1) Whenever the Director of Central Intelligence, the Attorney
    General and the Commissioner of Immigration determine that an
    applicant otherwise eligible for naturalization has made an
    extraordinary contribution to the national security of the United
    States or to the conduct of United States intelligence activities,
    the applicant may be naturalized without regard to the residence
    and physical presence requirements of this section, or to the
    prohibitions of section 1424 of this title, and no residence within
    a particular State or district of the Service in the United States
    shall be required: Provided, That the applicant has continuously
    resided in the United States for at least one year prior to
    naturalization: Provided further, That the provisions of this
    subsection shall not apply to any alien described in clauses (i)

    administered the oath of allegiance under section 1448(a) of this
    title by any district court of the United States, without regard to

    and is so accompanying and residing with the member - 
        (1) any period of time during which the member of the Armed
      Forces is residing abroad pursuant to official orders shall be
      treated, for purposes of subsection (a)(2)(A), as physical
      presence in the United States;
        (2) subsection (a)(5) shall not apply; and

    person's spouse, or (2) on or after September 22, 1922, lost United
    States citizenship by marriage to an alien ineligible to

    naturalized upon compliance with all requirements of this
    subchapter, except - 
        (1) no period of residence or specified period of physical

    status existed in the case of such person prior to the loss of
    citizenship: Provided, That nothing contained herein or in any
    other provision of law shall be construed as conferring United
    States citizenship retroactively upon such person, or upon any
    person who was naturalized in accordance with the provisions of
    section 317(a) of the Nationality Act of 1940, during any period in

    Constitution of the United States, and well disposed to the good
    order and happiness of the United States for a period of not less
    than five years immediately preceding the date of filing an
    application for naturalization and up to the time of admission to
    citizenship, and, unless she has resided continuously in the United
    States since the date of her marriage, has been lawfully admitted
    for permanent residence prior to filing her application for
    naturalization.

    States by birth, without filing an application for naturalization,
    and notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this subchapter
    except the provisions of section 1424 of this title: Provided, That
    nothing contained herein or in any other provision of law shall be
    construed as conferring United States citizenship retroactively
    upon such person, or upon any person who was naturalized in
    accordance with the provisions of section 317(b) of the Nationality
    Act of 1940, during any period in which such person was not a
    citizen.
      (2) Such oath of allegiance may be taken abroad before a
    diplomatic or consular officer of the United States, or in the
    United States before the Attorney General or the judge or clerk of
    a court described in section 1421(b) of this title.
      (3) Such oath of allegiance shall be entered in the records of
    the appropriate embassy, legation, consulate, court, or the
    Attorney General, and, upon demand, a certified copy of the
    proceedings, including a copy of the oath administered, under the
    seal of the embassy, legation, consulate, court, or the Attorney
    General, shall be delivered to such woman at a cost not exceeding
    $5, which certified copy shall be evidence of the facts stated
    therein before any court of record or judicial tribunal and in any
    department or agency of the Government of the United States.
    (d) Persons losing citizenship for failure to meet physical
      presence retention requirement

    the United States by birth, without filing an application for
    naturalization, and notwithstanding any of the other provisions of
    this subchapter except the provisions of section 1424 of this
    title. Nothing in this subsection or any other provision of law
    shall be construed as conferring United States citizenship
    retroactively upon such person during any period in which such
    person was not a citizen.

    this section shall apply to a person regaining citizenship under

    Sec. 1439. Naturalization through service in the armed forces

-STATUTE-
    (a) Requirements
      A person who has served honorably at any time in the armed forces
    of the United States for a period or periods aggregating one year,
    and, who, if separated from such service, was never separated
    except under honorable conditions, may be naturalized without
    having resided, continuously immediately preceding the date of
    filing such person's application, in the United States for at least
    five years, and in the State or district of the Service in the
    United States in which the application for naturalization is filed
    for at least three months, and without having been physically
    present in the United States for any specified period, if such
    application is filed while the applicant is still in the service or
    within six months after the termination of such service.
    (b) Exceptions
      A person filing an application under subsection (a) of this
    section shall comply in all other respects with the requirements of
    this subchapter, except that - 
        (1) no residence within a State or district of the Service in
      the United States shall be required;
        (2) notwithstanding section 1429 of this title insofar as it
      relates to deportability, such applicant may be naturalized
      immediately if the applicant be then actually in the Armed Forces
      of the United States, and if prior to the filing of the
      application, the applicant shall have appeared before and been
      examined by a representative of the Service;
        (3) the applicant shall furnish to the Secretary of Homeland
      Security, prior to any hearing upon his application, a certified
      statement from the proper executive department for each period of
      his service upon which he relies for the benefits of this
      section, clearly showing that such service was honorable and that
      no discharges from service, including periods of service not
      relied upon by him for the benefits of this section, were other
      than honorable (the certificate or certificates herein provided
      for shall be conclusive evidence of such service and discharge);
      and
        (4) notwithstanding any other provision of law, no fee shall be
      charged or collected from the applicant for filing the
      application, or for the issuance of a certificate of
      naturalization upon being granted citizenship, and no clerk of
      any State court shall charge or collect any fee for such services
      unless the laws of the State require such charge to be made, in
      which case nothing more than the portion of the fee required to
      be paid to the State shall be charged or collected.
    (c) Periods when not in service
      In the case such applicant's service was not continuous, the
    applicant's residence in the United States and State or district of
    the Service in the United States, good moral character, attachment
    to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and
    favorable disposition toward the good order and happiness of the
    United States, during any period within five years immediately
    preceding the date of filing such application between the periods
    of applicant's service in the Armed Forces, shall be alleged in the
    application filed under the provisions of subsection (a) of this
    section, and proved at any hearing thereon. Such allegation and
    proof shall also be made as to any period between the termination
    of applicant's service and the filing of the application for
    naturalization.
    (d) Residence requirements
      The applicant shall comply with the requirements of section
    1427(a) of this title, if the termination of such service has been
    more than six months preceding the date of filing the application
    for naturalization, except that such service within five years
    immediately preceding the date of filing such application shall be
    considered as residence and physical presence within the United
    States.
    (e) Moral character
      Any such period or periods of service under honorable conditions,
    and good moral character, attachment to the principles of the
    Constitution of the United States, and favorable disposition toward
    the good order and happiness of the United States, during such
    service, shall be proved by duly authenticated copies of the
    records of the executive departments having custody of the records
    of such service, and such authenticated copies of records shall be
    accepted in lieu of compliance with the provisions of section
    1427(a) of this title.

    accordance with section 1451 of this title if the person is
    separated from the Armed Forces under other than honorable
    conditions before the person has served honorably for a period or
    periods aggregating five years. Such ground for revocation shall be
    in addition to any other provided by law, including the grounds
    described in section 1451 of this title. The fact that the
    naturalized person was separated from the service under other than
    honorable conditions shall be proved by a duly authenticated
    certification from the executive department under which the person
    was serving at the time of separation. Any period or periods of
    service shall be proved by duly authenticated copies of the records
    of the executive departments having custody of the records of such
    service.
    (g) Processing and adjudication of applications
      Not later than 6 months after receiving an application for
    naturalization filed by a current member of the Armed Forces under
    subsection (a), section 1440(a) of this title, or section 1440-1 of

      Any person who, while an alien or a noncitizen national of the

    Reserve of the Ready Reserve or in an active-duty status in the
    military, air, or naval forces of the United States during either
    World War I or during a period beginning September 1, 1939, and
    ending December 31, 1946, or during a period beginning June 25,
    1950, and ending July 1, 1955, or during a period beginning
    February 28, 1961, and ending on a date designated by the President
    by Executive order as of the date of termination of the Vietnam
    hostilities, or thereafter during any other period which the
    President by Executive order shall designate as a period in which
    Armed Forces of the United States are or were engaged in military
    operations involving armed conflict with a hostile foreign force,
    and who, if separated from such service, was separated under
    honorable conditions, may be naturalized as provided in this
    section if (1) at the time of enlistment, reenlistment, extension
    of enlistment, or induction such person shall have been in the
    United States, the Canal Zone, American Samoa, or Swains Island, or
    on board a public vessel owned or operated by the United States for
    noncommercial service, whether or not he has been lawfully admitted
    to the United States for permanent residence, or (2) at any time
    subsequent to enlistment or induction such person shall have been
    lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence. The
    executive department under which such person served shall determine
    whether persons have served honorably in an active-duty status, and
    whether separation from such service was under honorable
    conditions: Provided, however, That no person who is or has been
    separated from such service on account of alienage, or who was a
    conscientious objector who performed no military, air, or naval
    duty whatever or refused to wear the uniform, shall be regarded as
    having served honorably or having been separated under honorable
    conditions for the purposes of this section. No period of service
    in the Armed Forces shall be made the basis of an application for
    naturalization under this section if the applicant has previously
    been naturalized on the basis of the same period of service.
    (b) Exceptions
      A person filing an application under subsection (a) of this
    section shall comply in all other respects with the requirements of
    this subchapter, except that -

      they relate to deportability and the provisions of section 1442
      of this title;
        (2) no period of residence or specified period of physical
      presence within the United States or any State or district of the
      Service in the United States shall be required;
        (3) service in the military, air or naval forces of the United
      States shall be proved by a duly authenticated certification from
      the executive department under which the applicant served or is
      serving, which shall state whether the applicant served honorably
      in an active-duty status during either World War I or during a
      period beginning September 1, 1939, and ending December 31, 1946,
      or during a period beginning June 25, 1950, and ending July 1,
      1955, or during a period beginning February 28, 1961, and ending
      on a date designated by the President by Executive order as the
      date of termination of the Vietnam hostilities, or thereafter
      during any other period which the President by Executive order
      shall designate as a period in which Armed Forces of the United
      States are or were engaged in military operations involving armed
      conflict with a hostile foreign force, and was separated from
      such service under honorable conditions; and
        (4) notwithstanding any other provision of law, no fee shall be
      charged or collected from the applicant for filing a petition for
      naturalization or for the issuance of a certificate of
      naturalization upon citizenship being granted to the applicant,
      and no clerk of any State court shall charge or collect any fee
      for such services unless the laws of the State require such
      charge to be made, in which case nothing more than the portion of
      the fee required to be paid to the State shall be charged or
      collected.
    (c) Revocation
      Citizenship granted pursuant to this section may be revoked in
    accordance with section 1451 of this title if the person is
    separated from the Armed Forces under other than honorable
    conditions before the person has served honorably for a period or
    periods aggregating five years. Such ground for revocation shall be
    in addition to any other provided by law, including the grounds
    described in section 1451 of this title. The fact that the
    naturalized person was separated from the service under other than
    honorable conditions shall be proved by a duly authenticated
    certification from the executive department under which the person
    was serving at the time of separation. Any period or periods of
    service shall be proved by duly authenticated copies of the records
    of the executive departments having custody of the records of such
    service.

    Sec. 1440f. Fingerprints and other biometric information for
      members of the United States Armed Forces

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including section
    552a of title 5 (commonly referred to as the "Privacy Act of
    1974"), the Secretary of Homeland Security shall use the
    fingerprints provided by an individual at the time the individual
    enlisted in the United States Armed Forces, or at the time the
    individual filed an application for adjustment of status, to
    satisfy any requirement for background and security checks in
    connection with an application for naturalization if - 
        (1) the individual may be naturalized pursuant to section 1439
      or 1440 of this title;
        (2) the individual was fingerprinted and provided other
      biometric information in accordance with the requirements of the
      Department of Defense at the time the individual enlisted in the
      United States Armed Forces;
        (3) the individual - 
          (A) submitted an application for naturalization not later
        than 24 months after the date on which the individual enlisted
        in the United States Armed Forces; or
          (B) provided the required biometric information to the
        Department of Homeland Security through a United States
        Citizenship and Immigration Services Application Support Center
        at the time of the individual's application for adjustment of
        status if filed not later than 24 months after the date on
        which the individual enlisted in the United States Armed
        Forces; and

        (4) the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that the
      biometric information provided, including fingerprints, is
      sufficient to conduct the required background and security checks
      needed for the applicant's naturalization application.
    (b) More timely and effective adjudication
      Nothing in this section precludes an individual described in
    subsection (a) from submitting a new set of biometric information,
    including fingerprints, to the Secretary of Homeland Security with
    an application for naturalization. If the Secretary determines that
    submitting a new set of biometric information, including
    fingerprints, would result in more timely and effective
    adjudication of the individual's naturalization application, the
    Secretary shall - 
        (1) inform the individual of such determination; and
        (2) provide the individual with a description of how to submit
      such biometric information, including fingerprints.
    (c) Cooperation
      The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the
    Secretary of Defense, shall determine the format of biometric
    information, including fingerprints, acceptable for usage under
    subsection (a). The Secretary of Defense, or any other official
    having custody of the biometric information, including
    fingerprints, referred to in subsection (a), shall - 
        (1) make such prints available, without charge, to the
      Secretary of Homeland Security for the purpose described in
      subsection (a); and
        (2) otherwise cooperate with the Secretary of Homeland Security
      to facilitate the processing of applications for naturalization
      under subsection (a).
    (d) Electronic transmission
      Not later than one year after June 26, 2008, the Secretary of
    Homeland Security shall, in coordination with the Secretary of
    Defense and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
    implement procedures that will ensure the rapid electronic
    transmission of biometric information, including fingerprints, from
    existing repositories of such information needed for military
    personnel applying for naturalization as described in subsection
    (a) and that will safeguard privacy and civil liberties.
    (e) Centralization and expedited processing
      (1) Centralization
        The Secretary of Homeland Security shall centralize the data
      processing of all applications for naturalization filed by
      members of the United States Armed Forces on active duty serving
      abroad.
      (2) Expedited processing
        The Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the Federal
      Bureau of Investigation, and the Director of National
      Intelligence shall take appropriate actions to ensure that
      applications for naturalization by members of the United States
      Armed Forces described in paragraph (1), and associated
      background checks, receive expedited processing and are
      adjudicated within 180 days of the receipt of responses to all
      background checks.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1445. Application for naturalization; declaration of intention

-STATUTE-
    (a) Evidence and form
      An applicant for naturalization shall make and file with the
    Attorney General a sworn application in writing, signed by the
    applicant in the applicant's own handwriting if physically able to
    write, which application shall be on a form prescribed by the
    Attorney General and shall include averments of all facts which in
    the opinion of the Attorney General may be material to the
    applicant's naturalization, and required to be proved under this
    subchapter. In the case of an applicant subject to a requirement of
    continuous residence under section 1427(a) or 1430(a) of this
    title, the application for naturalization may be filed up to 3
    months before the date the applicant would first otherwise meet
    such continuous residence requirement.
    (b) Who may file
      No person shall file a valid application for naturalization
    unless he shall have attained the age of eighteen years. An
    application for naturalization by an alien shall contain an
    averment of lawful admission for permanent residence.
    (c) Hearings
      Hearings under section 1447(a) of this title on applications for
    naturalization shall be held at regular intervals specified by the
    Attorney General.
    (d) Filing of application
      Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, an
    application for naturalization shall be filed in the office of the
    Attorney General.
    (e) Substitute filing place and administering oath other than
      before Attorney General
      A person may file an application for naturalization other than in
    the office of the Attorney General, and an oath of allegiance
    administered other than in a public ceremony before the Attorney
    General or a court, if the Attorney General determines that the
    person has an illness or other disability which - 
        (1) is of a permanent nature and is sufficiently serious to
      prevent the person's personal appearance, or
        (2) is of a nature which so incapacitates the person as to
      prevent him from personally appearing.
    (f) Declaration of intention
      An alien over 18 years of age who is residing in the United
    States pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence may
    file with the Attorney General a declaration of intention to become
    a citizen of the United States. Such a declaration shall be filed
    in duplicate and in a form prescribed by the Attorney General and
    shall be accompanied by an application prescribed and approved by
    the Attorney General. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed
    as requiring any such alien to make and file a declaration of
    intention as a condition precedent to filing an application for
    naturalization nor shall any such declaration of intention be
    regarded as conferring or having conferred upon any such alien
    United States citizenship or nationality or the right to United
    States citizenship or nationality, nor shall such declaration be
    regarded as evidence of such alien's lawful admission for permanent
    residence in any proceeding, action, or matter arising under this
    chapter or any other Act.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Waiver
      Before a person may be naturalized, an employee of the Service,
    or of the United States designated by the Attorney General, shall
    conduct a personal investigation of the person applying for
    naturalization in the vicinity or vicinities in which such person
    has maintained his actual place of abode and in the vicinity or
    vicinities in which such person has been employed or has engaged in
    business or work for at least five years immediately preceding the
    filing of his application for naturalization. The Attorney General
    may, in his discretion, waive a personal investigation in an
    individual case or in such cases or classes of cases as may be
    designated by him.
    (b) Conduct of examinations; authority of designees; record
      The Attorney General shall designate employees of the Service to
    conduct examinations upon applications for naturalization. For such
    purposes any such employee so designated is authorized to take
    testimony concerning any matter touching or in any way affecting
    the admissibility of any applicant for naturalization, to
    administer oaths, including the oath of the applicant for
    naturalization, and to require by subpena the attendance and
    testimony of witnesses, including applicant, before such employee
    so designated and the production of relevant books, papers, and
    documents, and to that end may invoke the aid of any district court
    of the United States; and any such court may, in the event of
    neglect or refusal to respond to a subpena issued by any such
    employee so designated or refusal to testify before such employee
    so designated issue an order requiring such person to appear before
    such employee so designated, produce relevant books, papers, and
    documents if demanded, and testify; and any failure to obey such
    order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt
    thereof. The record of the examination authorized by this
    subsection shall be admissible as evidence in any hearing conducted
    by an immigration officer under section 1447(a) of this title. Any
    such employee shall, at the examination, inform the applicant of
    the remedies available to the applicant under section 1447 of this
    title.
    (c) Transmittal of record of examination
      The record of the examination upon any application for
    naturalization may, in the discretion of the Attorney General be
    transmitted to the Attorney General and the determination with
    respect thereto of the employee designated to conduct such
    examination shall when made also be transmitted to the Attorney
    General.
    (d) Determination to grant or deny application
      The employee designated to conduct any such examination shall
    make a determination as to whether the application should be
    granted or denied, with reasons therefor.
    (e) Withdrawal of application
      After an application for naturalization has been filed with the
    Attorney General, the applicant shall not be permitted to withdraw
    his application, except with the consent of the Attorney General.
    In cases where the Attorney General does not consent to the
    withdrawal of the application, the application shall be determined
    on its merits and a final order determination made accordingly. In
    cases where the applicant fails to prosecute his application, the
    application shall be decided on the merits unless the Attorney
    General dismisses it for lack of prosecution.
    (f) Transfer of application
      An applicant for naturalization who moves from the district of
    the Service in the United States in which the application is
    pending may, at any time thereafter, request the Service to
    transfer the application to any district of the Service in the
    United States which may act on the application. The transfer shall
    not be made without the consent of the Attorney General. In the
    case of such a transfer, the proceedings on the application shall
    continue as though the application had originally been filed in the
    district of the Service to which the application is transferred.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Request for hearing before immigration officer

    application for naturalization is denied, the applicant may request
    a hearing before an immigration officer.
    (b) Request for hearing before district court
      If there is a failure to make a determination under section 1446
    of this title before the end of the 120-day period after the date
    on which the examination is conducted under such section, the
    applicant may apply to the United States district court for the
    district in which the applicant resides for a hearing on the
    matter. Such court has jurisdiction over the matter and may either
    determine the matter or remand the matter, with appropriate
    instructions, to the Service to determine the matter.
    (c) Appearance of Attorney General
      The Attorney General shall have the right to appear before any
    immigration officer in any naturalization proceedings for the
    purpose of cross-examining the applicant and the witnesses produced
    in support of the application concerning any matter touching or in
    any way affecting the applicant's right to admission to
    citizenship, and shall have the right to call witnesses, including

    in favor of the granting of any application in naturalization
    proceedings.
    (d) Subpena of witnesses
      The immigration officer shall, if the applicant requests it at
    the time of filing the request for the hearing, issue a subpena for
    the witnesses named by such applicant to appear upon the day set
    for the hearing, but in case such witnesses cannot be produced upon
    the hearing other witnesses may be summoned upon notice to the
    Attorney General, in such manner and at such time as the Attorney
    General may by regulation prescribe. Such subpenas may be enforced

    bona fide prayer of the applicant included in an appropriate
    petition to the court, to make a decree changing the name of said
    person, and the certificate of naturalization shall be issued in
    accordance therewith.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1448. Oath of renunciation and allegiance

-STATUTE-
    (a) Public ceremony
      A person who has applied for naturalization shall, in order to be
    and before being admitted to citizenship, take in a public ceremony
    before the Attorney General or a court with jurisdiction under
    section 1421(b) of this title an oath (1) to support the
    Constitution of the United States; (2) to renounce and abjure
    absolutely and entirely all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign
    prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or which the
    applicant was before a subject or citizen; (3) to support and
    defend the Constitution and the laws of the United States against
    all enemies, foreign and domestic; (4) to bear true faith and
    allegiance to the same; and (5)(A) to bear arms on behalf of the
    United States when required by the law, or (B) to perform
    noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when
    required by the law, or (C) to perform work of national importance
    under civilian direction when required by the law. Any such person
    shall be required to take an oath containing the substance of
    clauses (1) to (5) of the preceding sentence, except that a person
    who shows by clear and convincing evidence to the satisfaction of
    the Attorney General that he is opposed to the bearing of arms in
    the Armed Forces of the United States by reason of religious
    training and belief shall be required to take an oath containing
    the substance of clauses (1) to (4) and clauses (5)(B) and (5)(C)
    of this subsection, and a person who shows by clear and convincing
    evidence to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that he is
    opposed to any type of service in the Armed Forces of the United
    States by reason of religious training and belief shall be required
    to take an oath containing the substance of said clauses (1) to (4)
    and clause (5)(C). The term "religious training and belief" as used
    in this section shall mean an individual's belief in a relation to
    a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any
    human relation, but does not include essentially political,
    sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral
    code. In the case of the naturalization of a child under the
    provisions of section 1433 of this title the Attorney General may
    waive the taking of the oath if in the opinion of the Attorney
    General the child is unable to understand its meaning. The Attorney
    General may waive the taking of the oath by a person if in the
    opinion of the Attorney General the person is unable to understand,
    or to communicate an understanding of, its meaning because of a
    physical or developmental disability or mental impairment. If the
    Attorney General waives the taking of the oath by a person under
    the preceding sentence, the person shall be considered to have met
    the requirements of section 1427(a)(3) of this title with respect
    to attachment to the principles of the Constitution and well
    disposition to the good order and happiness of the United States.
    (b) Hereditary titles or orders of nobility
      In case the person applying for naturalization has borne any
    hereditary title, or has been of any of the orders of nobility in
    any foreign state, the applicant shall in addition to complying
    with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, make under
    oath in the same public ceremony in which the oath of allegiance is
    administered, an express renunciation of such title or order of
    nobility, and such renunciation shall be recorded as a part of such
    proceedings.
    (c) Expedited judicial oath administration ceremony
      Notwithstanding section 1421(b) of this title, an individual may
    be granted an expedited judicial oath administration ceremony or
    administrative naturalization by the Attorney General upon
    demonstrating sufficient cause. In determining whether to grant an
    expedited judicial oath administration ceremony, a court shall
    consider special circumstances (such as serious illness of the
    applicant or a member of the applicant's immediate family,
    permanent disability sufficiently incapacitating as to prevent the
    applicant's personal appearance at the scheduled ceremony,
    developmental disability or advanced age, or exigent circumstances
    relating to travel or employment). If an expedited judicial oath
    administration ceremony is impracticable, the court shall refer
    such individual to the Attorney General who may provide for
    immediate administrative naturalization.
    (d) Rules and regulations
      The Attorney General shall prescribe rules and procedures to
    ensure that the ceremonies conducted by the Attorney General for
    the administration of oaths of allegiance under this section are
    public, conducted frequently and at regular intervals, and are in
    keeping with the dignity of the occasion.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1451. Revocation of naturalization

-STATUTE-
    (a) Concealment of material evidence; refusal to testify
      It shall be the duty of the United States attorneys for the
    respective districts, upon affidavit showing good cause therefor,
    to institute proceedings in any district court of the United States
    in the judicial district in which the naturalized citizen may
    reside at the time of bringing suit, for the purpose of revoking
    and setting aside the order admitting such person to citizenship
    and canceling the certificate of naturalization on the ground that
    such order and certificate of naturalization were illegally
    procured or were procured by concealment of a material fact or by
    willful misrepresentation, and such revocation and setting aside of
    the order admitting such person to citizenship and such canceling
    of certificate of naturalization shall be effective as of the
    original date of the order and certificate, respectively: Provided,
    That refusal on the part of a naturalized citizen within a period
    of ten years following his naturalization to testify as a witness
    in any proceeding before a congressional committee concerning his
    subversive activities, in a case where such person has been
    convicted of contempt for such refusal, shall be held to constitute
    a ground for revocation of such person's naturalization under this
    subsection as having been procured by concealment of a material
    fact or by willful misrepresentation. If the naturalized citizen
    does not reside in any judicial district in the United States at
    the time of bringing such suit, the proceedings may be instituted
    in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or
    in the United States district court in the judicial district in
    which such person last had his residence.
    (b) Notice to party
      The party to whom was granted the naturalization alleged to have
    been illegally procured or procured by concealment of a material
    fact or by willful misrepresentation shall, in any such proceedings
    under subsection (a) of this section, have sixty days' personal
    notice, unless waived by such party, in which to make answers to
    the petition of the United States; and if such naturalized person
    be absent from the United States or from the judicial district in
    which such person last had his residence, such notice shall be
    given either by personal service upon him or by publication in the
    manner provided for the service of summons by publication or upon
    absentees by the laws of the State or the place where such suit is
    brought.
    (c) Membership in certain organizations; prima facie evidence
      If a person who shall have been naturalized after December 24,
    1952 shall within five years next following such naturalization
    become a member of or affiliated with any organization, membership
    in or affiliation with which at the time of naturalization would
    have precluded such person from naturalization under the provisions
    of section 1424 of this title, it shall be considered prima facie
    evidence that such person was not attached to the principles of the
    Constitution of the United States and was not well disposed to the
    good order and happiness of the United States at the time of
    naturalization, and, in the absence of countervailing evidence, it
    shall be sufficient in the proper proceeding to authorize the
    revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such person to
    citizenship and the cancellation of the certificate of
    naturalization as having been obtained by concealment of a material
    fact or by willful misrepresentation, and such revocation and
    setting aside of the order admitting such person to citizenship and
    such canceling of certificate of naturalization shall be effective
    as of the original date of the order and certificate, respectively.
    (d) Applicability to citizenship through naturalization of parent
      or spouse
      Any person who claims United States citizenship through the
    naturalization of a parent or spouse in whose case there is a
    revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such parent or
    spouse to citizenship under the provisions of subsection (a) of
    this section on the ground that the order and certificate of
    naturalization were procured by concealment of a material fact or
    by willful misrepresentation shall be deemed to have lost and to
    lose his citizenship and any right or privilege of citizenship
    which he may have, now has, or may hereafter acquire under and by
    virtue of such naturalization of such parent or spouse, regardless
    of whether such person is residing within or without the United
    States at the time of the revocation and setting aside of the order
    admitting such parent or spouse to citizenship. Any person who
    claims United States citizenship through the naturalization of a
    parent or spouse in whose case there is a revocation and setting
    aside of the order admitting such parent or spouse to citizenship
    and the cancellation of the certificate of naturalization under the
    provisions of subsection (c) of this section, or under the
    provisions of section 1440(c) of this title on any ground other
    than that the order and certificate of naturalization were procured
    by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation,
    shall be deemed to have lost and to lose his citizenship and any
    right or privilege of citizenship which would have been enjoyed by
    such person had there not been a revocation and setting aside of
    the order admitting such parent or spouse to citizenship and the
    cancellation of the certificate of naturalization, unless such
    person is residing in the United States at the time of the
    revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such parent or
    spouse to citizenship and the cancellation of the certificate of
    naturalization.
    (e) Citizenship unlawfully procured
      When a person shall be convicted under section 1425 of title 18
    of knowingly procuring naturalization in violation of law, the
    court in which such conviction is had shall thereupon revoke, set
    aside, and declare void the final order admitting such person to
    citizenship, and shall declare the certificate of naturalization of
    such person to be canceled. Jurisdiction is conferred on the courts
    having jurisdiction of the trial of such offense to make such
    adjudication.
    (f) Cancellation of certificate of naturalization
      Whenever an order admitting an alien to citizenship shall be
    revoked and set aside or a certificate of naturalization shall be
    canceled, or both, as provided in this section, the court in which
    such judgment or decree is rendered shall make an order canceling
    such certificate and shall send a certified copy of such order to
    the Attorney General. The clerk of court shall transmit a copy of
    such order and judgment to the Attorney General. A person holding a
    certificate of naturalization or citizenship which has been
    canceled as provided by this section shall upon notice by the court
    by which the decree of cancellation was made, or by the Attorney
    General, surrender the same to the Attorney General.
    (g) Applicability to certificates of naturalization and citizenship
      The provisions of this section shall apply not only to any
    naturalization granted and to certificates of naturalization and
    citizenship issued under the provisions of this subchapter, but to
    any naturalization heretofore granted by any court, and to all
    certificates of naturalization and citizenship which may have been
    issued heretofore by any court or by the Commissioner based upon
    naturalization granted by any court, or by a designated
    representative of the Commissioner under the provisions of section
    702 of the Nationality Act of 1940, as amended, or by such
    designated representative under any other act.
    (h) Power to correct, reopen, alter, modify, or vacate order
      Nothing contained in this section shall be regarded as limiting,
    denying, or restricting the power of the Attorney General to
    correct, reopen, alter, modify, or vacate an order naturalizing the
    person.

    is a natural and inherent right of all people, indispensable to the
    enjoyment of the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of

    Government has freely received emigrants from all nations, and
    invested them with the rights of citizenship; and whereas it is
    claimed that such American citizens, with their descendants, are
    subjects of foreign states, owing allegiance to the governments
    thereof; and whereas it is necessary to the maintenance of public
    peace that this claim of foreign allegiance should be promptly and
    finally disavowed: Therefore any declaration, instruction, opinion,

    denies, restricts, impairs, or questions the right of expatriation,
    is declared inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the
    Republic."

    Sec. 1503. Denial of rights and privileges as national

-STATUTE-
    (a) Proceedings for declaration of United States nationality
      If any person who is within the United States claims a right or
    privilege as a national of the United States and is denied such
    right or privilege by any department or independent agency, or
    official thereof, upon the ground that he is not a national of the
    United States, such person may institute an action under the
    provisions of section 2201 of title 28 against the head of such
    department or independent agency for a judgment declaring him to be
    a national of the United States, except that no such action may be
    instituted in any case if the issue of such person's status as a
    national of the United States (1) arose by reason of, or in
    connection with any removal proceeding under the provisions of this
    chapter or any other act, or (2) is in issue in any such removal
    proceeding. An action under this subsection may be instituted only
    within five years after the final administrative denial of such
    right or privilege and shall be filed in the district court of the
    United States for the district in which such person resides or
    claims a residence, and jurisdiction over such officials in such
    cases is conferred upon those courts.
    (b) Application for certificate of identity; appeal
      If any person who is not within the United States claims a right
    or privilege as a national of the United States and is denied such
    right or privilege by any department or independent agency, or
    official thereof, upon the ground that he is not a national of the
    United States, such person may make application to a diplomatic or
    consular officer of the United States in the foreign country in
    which he is residing for a certificate of identity for the purpose
    of traveling to a port of entry in the United States and applying
    for admission. Upon proof to the satisfaction of such diplomatic or
    consular officer that such application is made in good faith and
    has a substantial basis, he shall issue to such person a
    certificate of identity. From any denial of an application for such
    certificate the applicant shall be entitled to an appeal to the
    Secretary of State, who, if he approves the denial, shall state in
    writing his reasons for his decision. The Secretary of State shall
    prescribe rules and regulations for the issuance of certificates of
    identity as above provided. The provisions of this subsection shall
    be applicable only to a person who at some time prior to his
    application for the certificate of identity has been physically
    present in the United States, or to a person under sixteen years of
    age who was born abroad of a United States citizen parent.
    (c) Application for admission to United States under certificate of
      identity; revision of determination
      A person who has been issued a certificate of identity under the
    provisions of subsection (b) of this section, and while in
    possession thereof, may apply for admission to the United States at
    any port of entry, and shall be subject to all the provisions of
    this chapter relating to the conduct of proceedings involving
    aliens seeking admission to the United States. A final
    determination by the Attorney General that any such person is not
    entitled to admission to the United States shall be subject to
    review by any court of competent jurisdiction in habeas corpus
    proceedings and not otherwise. Any person described in this section
    who is finally denied admission to the United States shall be
    subject to all the provisions of this chapter relating to aliens
    seeking admission to the United States.

    (a) Conditions and considerations
      (1)(A) In providing assistance under this section, the Director
    shall, to the extent of available appropriations, (i) make
    available sufficient resources for employment training and
    placement in order to achieve economic self-sufficiency among
    refugees as quickly as possible, (ii) provide refugees with the
    opportunity to acquire sufficient English language training to
    enable them to become effectively resettled as quickly as possible,
    (iii) insure that cash assistance is made available to refugees in
    such a manner as not to discourage their economic self-sufficiency,
    in accordance with subsection (e)(2) of this section, and (iv)
    insure that women have the same opportunities as men to participate
    in training and instruction.
      (B) It is the intent of Congress that in providing refugee
    assistance under this section - 
        (i) employable refugees should be placed on jobs as soon as
      possible after their arrival in the United States;
        (ii) social service funds should be focused on employment-
      related services, English-as-a-second-language training (in
      nonwork hours where possible), and case-management services; and
        (iii) local voluntary agency activities should be conducted in
      close cooperation and advance consultation with State and local
      governments.

      (2)(A) The Director and the Federal agency administering
    subsection (b)(1) of this section shall consult regularly (not less
    often than quarterly) with State and local governments and private
    nonprofit voluntary agencies concerning the sponsorship process and
    the intended distribution of refugees among the States and
    localities before their placement in those States and localities.
      (B) The Director shall develop and implement, in consultation
    with representatives of voluntary agencies and State and local
    governments, policies and strategies for the placement and
    resettlement of refugees within the United States.
      (C) Such policies and strategies, to the extent practicable and
    except under such unusual circumstances as the Director may
    recognize, shall - 
        (i) insure that a refugee is not initially placed or resettled
      in an area highly impacted (as determined under regulations
      prescribed by the Director after consultation with such agencies
      and governments) by the presence of refugees or comparable
      populations unless the refugee has a spouse, parent, sibling,
      son, or daughter residing in that area,
        (ii) provide for a mechanism whereby representatives of local
      affiliates of voluntary agencies regularly (not less often than
      quarterly) meet with representatives of State and local
      governments to plan and coordinate in advance of their arrival
      the appropriate placement of refugees among the various States
      and localities, and
        (iii) take into account - 
          (I) the proportion of refugees and comparable entrants in the
        population in the area,
          (II) the availability of employment opportunities, affordable
        housing, and public and private resources (including
        educational, health care, and mental health services) for
        refugees in the area,
          (III) the likelihood of refugees placed in the area becoming
        self-sufficient and free from long-term dependence on public
        assistance, and
          (IV) the secondary migration of refugees to and from the area
        that is likely to occur.

      (D) With respect to the location of placement of refugees within
    a State, the Federal agency administering subsection (b)(1) of this
    section shall, consistent with such policies and strategies and to
    the maximum extent possible, take into account recommendations of
    the State.
      (3) In the provision of domestic assistance under this section,
    the Director shall make a periodic assessment, based on refugee
    population and other relevant factors, of the relative needs of
    refugees for assistance and services under this subchapter and the
    resources available to meet such needs. The Director shall compile
    and maintain data on secondary migration of refugees within the
    United States and, by State of residence and nationality, on the
    proportion of refugees receiving cash or medical assistance
    described in subsection (e) of this section. In allocating
    resources, the Director shall avoid duplication of services and
    provide for maximum coordination between agencies providing related
    services.
      (4)(A) No grant or contract may be awarded under this section
    unless an appropriate proposal and application (including a
    description of the agency's ability to perform the services
    specified in the proposal) are submitted to, and approved by, the
    appropriate administering official. Grants and contracts under this
    section shall be made to those agencies which the appropriate
    administering official determines can best perform the services.
    Payments may be made for activities authorized under this
    subchapter in advance or by way of reimbursement. In carrying out
    this section, the Director, the Secretary of State, and any such
    other appropriate administering official are authorized - 
        (i) to make loans, and
        (ii) to accept and use money, funds, property, and services of
      any kind made available by gift, devise, bequest, grant, or
      otherwise for the purpose of carrying out this section.

      (B) No funds may be made available under this subchapter (other
    than under subsection (b)(1) of this section) to States or
    political subdivisions in the form of block grants, per capita
    grants, or similar consolidated grants or contracts. Such funds
    shall be made available under separate grants or contracts - 
        (i) for medical screening and initial medical treatment under
      subsection (b)(5) of this section,
        (ii) for services for refugees under subsection (c)(1) of this
      section,
        (iii) for targeted assistance project grants under subsection
      (c)(2) of this section, and
        (iv) for assistance for refugee children under subsection
      (d)(2) of this section.

      (C) The Director may not delegate to a State or political
    subdivision his authority to review or approve grants or contracts
    under this subchapter or the terms under which such grants or
    contracts are made.
      (5) Assistance and services funded under this section shall be
    provided to refugees without regard to race, religion, nationality,
    sex, or political opinion.
      (6) As a condition for receiving assistance under this section, a
    State must - 
        (A) submit to the Director a plan which provides - 
          (i) a description of how the State intends to encourage
        effective refugee resettlement and to promote economic self-
        sufficiency as quickly as possible,
          (ii) a description of how the State will insure that language
        training and employment services are made available to refugees
        receiving cash assistance,
          (iii) for the designation of an individual, employed by the
        State, who will be responsible for insuring coordination of
        public and private resources in refugee resettlement,
          (iv) for the care and supervision of and legal responsibility
        for unaccompanied refugee children in the State, and
          (v) for the identification of refugees who at the time of
        resettlement in the State are determined to have medical
        conditions requiring, or medical histories indicating a need
        for, treatment or observation and such monitoring of such
        treatment or observation as may be necessary;

        (B) meet standards, goals, and priorities, developed by the
      Director, which assure the effective resettlement of refugees and
      which promote their economic self-sufficiency as quickly as
      possible and the efficient provision of services; and
        (C) submit to the Director, within a reasonable period of time
      after the end of each fiscal year, a report on the uses of funds
      provided under this subchapter which the State is responsible for
      administering.

      (7) The Secretary, together with the Secretary of State with
    respect to assistance provided by the Secretary of State under
    subsection (b) of this section, shall develop a system of
    monitoring the assistance provided under this section. This system
    shall include - 
        (A) evaluations of the effectiveness of the programs funded
      under this section and the performance of States, grantees, and
      contractors;
        (B) financial auditing and other appropriate monitoring to
      detect any fraud, abuse, or mismanagement in the operation of
      such programs; and
        (C) data collection on the services provided and the results
      achieved.

      (8) The Attorney General shall provide the Director with
    information supplied by refugees in conjunction with their
    applications to the Attorney General for adjustment of status, and
    the Director shall compile, summarize, and evaluate such
    information.
      (9) The Secretary, the Secretary of Education, the Attorney
    General, and the Secretary of State may issue such regulations as
    each deems appropriate to carry out this subchapter.
      (10) For purposes of this subchapter, the term "refugee" includes
    any alien described in section 1157(c)(2) of this title.
    (b) Program of initial resettlement
      (1)(A) For - 
        (i) fiscal years 1980 and 1981, the Secretary of State is
      authorized, and
        (ii) fiscal year 1982 and succeeding fiscal years, the Director
      (except as provided in subparagraph (B)) is authorized,

    to make grants to, and contracts with, public or private nonprofit
    agencies for initial resettlement (including initial reception and
    placement with sponsors) of refugees in the United States. Grants
    to, or contracts with, private nonprofit voluntary agencies under
    this paragraph shall be made consistent with the objectives of this
    subchapter, taking into account the different resettlement
    approaches and practices of such agencies. Resettlement assistance
    under this paragraph shall be provided in coordination with the
    Director's provision of other assistance under this subchapter.
    Funds provided to agencies under such grants and contracts may only
    be obligated or expended during the fiscal year in which they are
    provided (or the subsequent fiscal year or such subsequent fiscal
    period as the Federal contracting agency may approve) to carry out
    the purposes of this subsection.
      (B) If the President determines that the Director should not
    administer the program under this paragraph, the authority of the
    Director under the first sentence of subparagraph (A) shall be
    exercised by such officer as the President shall from time to time
    specify.
      (2) The Director is authorized to develop programs for such
    orientation, instruction in English, and job training for refugees,
    and such other education and training of refugees, as facilitates
    their resettlement in the United States. The Director is authorized
    to implement such programs, in accordance with the provisions of
    this section, with respect to refugees in the United States. The
    Secretary of State is authorized to implement such programs with
    respect to refugees awaiting entry into the United States.
      (3) The Secretary is authorized to make arrangements (including
    cooperative arrangements with other Federal agencies) for the
    temporary care of refugees in the United States in emergency
    circumstances, including the establishment of processing centers,
    if necessary, without regard to such provisions of law (other than
    the Renegotiation Act of 1951 [50 U.S.C. App. 1211 et seq.] and
    section 1524(b) of this title) regulating the making, performance,
    amendment, or modification of contracts and the expenditure of
    funds of the United States Government as the Secretary may specify.
      (4) The Secretary shall - 
        (A) assure that an adequate number of trained staff are
      available at the location at which the refugees enter the United
      States to assure that all necessary medical records are available
      and in proper order;
        (B) provide for the identification of refugees who have been
      determined to have medical conditions affecting the public health
      and requiring treatment;
        (C) assure that State or local health officials at the
      resettlement destination within the United States of each refugee
      are promptly notified of the refugee's arrival and provided with
      all applicable medical records; and
        (D) provide for such monitoring of refugees identified under
      subparagraph (B) as will insure that they receive appropriate and
      timely treatment.

    The Secretary shall develop and implement methods for monitoring
    and assessing the quality of medical screening and related health
    services provided to refugees awaiting resettlement in the United
    States.
      (5) The Director is authorized to make grants to, and enter into
    contracts with, State and local health agencies for payments to
    meet their costs of providing medical screening and initial medical
    treatment to refugees.
      (6) The Comptroller General shall directly conduct an annual
    financial audit of funds expended under each grant or contract made
    under paragraph (1) for fiscal year 1986 and for fiscal year 1987.
      (7) Each grant or contract with an agency under paragraph (1)
    shall require the agency to do the following:
        (A) To provide quarterly performance and financial status
      reports to the Federal agency administering paragraph (1).
        (B)(i) To provide, directly or through its local affiliate,
      notice to the appropriate county or other local welfare office at
      the time that the agency becomes aware that a refugee is offered
      employment and to provide notice to the refugee that such notice
      has been provided, and
        (ii) upon request of such a welfare office to which a refugee
      has applied for cash assistance, to furnish that office with
      documentation respecting any cash or other resources provided
      directly by the agency to the refugee under this subsection.
        (C) To assure that refugees, known to the agency as having been
      identified pursuant to paragraph (4)(B) as having medical
      conditions affecting the public health and requiring treatment,
      report to the appropriate county or other health agency upon
      their resettlement in an area.
        (D) To fulfill its responsibility to provide for the basic
      needs (including food, clothing, shelter, and transportation for
      job interviews and training) of each refugee resettled and to
      develop and implement a resettlement plan including the early
      employment of each refugee resettled and to monitor the
      implementation of such plan.
        (E) To transmit to the Federal agency administering paragraph
      (1) an annual report describing the following:
          (i) The number of refugees placed (by county of placement)
        and the expenditures made in the year under the grant or
        contract, including the proportion of such expenditures used
        for administrative purposes and for provision of services.
          (ii) The proportion of refugees placed by the agency in the
        previous year who are receiving cash or medical assistance
        described in subsection (e) of this section.
          (iii) The efforts made by the agency to monitor placement of
        the refugees and the activities of local affiliates of the
        agency.
          (iv) The extent to which the agency has coordinated its
        activities with local social service providers in a manner
        which avoids duplication of activities and has provided notices
        to local welfare offices and the reporting of medical
        conditions of certain aliens to local health departments in
        accordance with subparagraphs (B)(i) and (C).
          (v) Such other information as the agency administering
        paragraph (1) deems to be appropriate in monitoring the
        effectiveness of agencies in carrying out their functions under
        such grants and contracts.

    The agency administering paragraph (1) shall promptly forward a
    copy of each annual report transmitted under subparagraph (E) to
    the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and
    of the Senate.
      (8) The Federal agency administering paragraph (1) shall
    establish criteria for the performance of agencies under grants and
    contracts under that paragraph, and shall include criteria relating
    to an agency's - 
        (A) efforts to reduce welfare dependency among refugees
      resettled by that agency,
        (B) collection of travel loans made to refugees resettled by
      that agency for travel to the United States,
        (C) arranging for effective local sponsorship and other
      nonpublic assistance for refugees resettled by that agency,
        (D) cooperation with refugee mutual assistance associations,
      local social service providers, health agencies, and welfare
      offices,
        (E) compliance with the guidelines established by the Director
      for the placement and resettlement of refugees within the United
      States, and
        (F) compliance with other requirements contained in the grant
      or contract, including the reporting and other requirements under
      subsection (b)(7) of this section.

    The Federal administering agency shall use the criteria in the
    process of awarding or renewing grants and contracts under
    paragraph (1).
    (c) Project grants and contracts for services for refugees
      (1)(A) The Director is authorized to make grants to, and enter
    into contracts with, public or private nonprofit agencies for
    projects specifically designed - 
        (i) to assist refugees in obtaining the skills which are
      necessary for economic self-sufficiency, including projects for
      job training, employment services, day care, professional
      refresher training, and other recertification services;
        (ii) to provide training in English where necessary (regardless
      of whether the refugees are employed or receiving cash or other
      assistance); and
        (iii) to provide where specific needs have been shown and
      recognized by the Director, health (including mental health)
      services, social services, educational and other services.

      (B) The funds available for a fiscal year for grants and
    contracts under subparagraph (A) shall be allocated among the
    States based on the total number of refugees (including children
    and adults) who arrived in the United States not more than 36
    months before the beginning of such fiscal year and who are
    actually residing in each State (taking into account secondary
    migration) as of the beginning of the fiscal year.
      (C) Any limitation which the Director establishes on the
    proportion of funds allocated to a State under this paragraph that
    the State may use for services other than those described in
    subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section shall not apply if the
    Director receives a plan (established by or in consultation with
    local governments) and determines that the plan provides for the
    maximum appropriate provision of employment-related services for,
    and the maximum placement of, employable refugees consistent with
    performance standards established under section 106 of the Job
    Training Partnership Act.
      (2)(A) The Director is authorized to make grants to States for
    assistance to counties and similar areas in the States where,
    because of factors such as unusually large refugee populations
    (including secondary migration), high refugee concentrations, and
    high use of public assistance by refugees, there exists and can be
    demonstrated a specific need for supplementation of available
    resources for services to refugees.
      (B) Grants shall be made available under this paragraph - 
        (i) primarily for the purpose of facilitating refugee
      employment and achievement of self-sufficiency,
        (ii) in a manner that does not supplant other refugee program
      funds and that assures that not less than 95 percent of the
      amount of the grant award is made available to the county or
      other local entity.
    (d) Assistance for refugee children
      (1) The Secretary of Education is authorized to make grants, and
    enter into contracts, for payments for projects to provide special
    educational services (including English language training) to
    refugee children in elementary and secondary schools where a
    demonstrated need has been shown.
      (2)(A) The Director is authorized to provide assistance,
    reimbursement to States, and grants to and contracts with public
    and private nonprofit agencies, for the provision of child welfare
    services, including foster care maintenance payments and services
    and health care, furnished to any refugee child (except as provided
    in subparagraph (B)) during the thirty-six month period beginning
    with the first month in which such refugee child is in the United
    States.
      (B)(i) In the case of a refugee child who is unaccompanied by a
    parent or other close adult relative (as defined by the Director),
    the services described in subparagraph (A) may be furnished until
    the month after the child attains eighteen years of age (or such
    higher age as the State's child welfare services plan under part B
    of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 620 et seq.]
    prescribes for the availability of such services to any other child
    in that State).
      (ii) The Director shall attempt to arrange for the placement
    under the laws of the States of such unaccompanied refugee
    children, who have been accepted for admission to the United
    States, before (or as soon as possible after) their arrival in the
    United States. During any interim period while such a child is in
    the United States or in transit to the United States but before the
    child is so placed, the Director shall assume legal responsibility
    (including financial responsibility) for the child, if necessary,
    and is authorized to make necessary decisions to provide for the
    child's immediate care.
      (iii) In carrying out the Director's responsibilities under
    clause (ii), the Director is authorized to enter into contracts
    with appropriate public or private nonprofit agencies under such
    conditions as the Director determines to be appropriate.
      (iv) The Director shall prepare and maintain a list of (I) all
    such unaccompanied children who have entered the United States
    after April 1, 1975, (II) the names and last known residences of
    their parents (if living) at the time of arrival, and (III) the
    children's location, status, and progress.
    (e) Cash assistance and medical assistance to refugees
      (1) The Director is authorized to provide assistance,
    reimbursement to States, and grants to, and contracts with, public
    or private nonprofit agencies for 100 per centum of the cash
    assistance and medical assistance provided to any refugee during
    the thirty-six month period beginning with the first month in which
    such refugee has entered the United States and for the identifiable
    and reasonable administrative costs of providing this assistance.
      (2)(A) Cash assistance provided under this subsection to an
    employable refugee is conditioned, except for good cause shown - 
        (i) on the refugee's registration with an appropriate agency
      providing employment services described in subsection
      (c)(1)(A)(i) of this section, or, if there is no such agency
      available, with an appropriate State or local employment service;
        (ii) on the refugee's participation in any available and
      appropriate social service or targeted assistance program (funded
      under subsection (c) of this section) providing job or language
      training in the area in which the refugee resides; and
        (iii) on the refugee's acceptance of appropriate offers of
      employment.

      (B) Cash assistance shall not be made available to refugees who
    are full-time students in institutions of higher education (as
    defined by the Director after consultation with the Secretary of
    Education).
      (C) In the case of a refugee who - 
        (i) refuses an offer of employment which has been determined to
      be appropriate either by the agency responsible for the initial
      resettlement of the refugee under subsection (b) of this section
      or by the appropriate State or local employment service,
        (ii) refuses to go to a job interview which has been arranged
      through such agency or service, or
        (iii) refuses to participate in a social service or targeted
      assistance program referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) which such
      agency or service determines to be available and appropriate,

    cash assistance to the refugee shall be terminated (after
    opportunity for an administrative hearing) for a period of three
    months (for the first such refusal) or for a period of six months
    (for any subsequent refusal).
      (3) The Director shall develop plans to provide English training
    and other appropriate services and training to refugees receiving
    cash assistance.
      (4) If a refugee is eligible for aid or assistance under a State
    program funded under part A of title IV or under title XIX of the
    Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq., 1396 et seq.], or for
    supplemental security income benefits (including State
    supplementary payments) under the program established under title
    XVI of that Act [42 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.], funds authorized under
    this subsection shall only be used for the non-Federal share of
    such aid or assistance, or for such supplementary payments, with
    respect to cash and medical assistance provided with respect to
    such refugee under this paragraph.
      (5) The Director is authorized to allow for the provision of
    medical assistance under paragraph (1) to any refugee, during the
    one-year period after entry, who does not qualify for assistance
    under a State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security
    Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.] on account of any resources or income
    requirement of such plan, but only if the Director determines that -
     
        (A) this will (i) encourage economic self-sufficiency, or (ii)
      avoid a significant burden on State and local governments; and
        (B) the refugee meets such alternative financial resources and
      income requirements as the Director shall establish.

      (6) As a condition for receiving assistance, reimbursement, or a
    contract under this subsection and notwithstanding any other
    provision of law, a State or agency must provide assurances that
    whenever a refugee applies for cash or medical assistance for which
    assistance or reimbursement is provided under this subsection, the
    State or agency must notify promptly the agency (or local
    affiliate) which provided for the initial resettlement of the
    refugee under subsection (b) of this section of the fact that the
    refugee has so applied.
      (7)(A) The Secretary shall develop and implement alternative
    projects for refugees who have been in the United States less than
    thirty-six months, under which refugees are provided interim
    support, medical services, support services, and case management,
    as needed, in a manner that encourages self-sufficiency, reduces
    welfare dependency, and fosters greater coordination among the
    resettlement agencies and service providers. The Secretary may
    permit alternative projects to cover specific groups of refugees
    who have been in the United States 36 months or longer if the
    Secretary determines that refugees in the group have been
    significantly and disproportionately dependent on welfare and need
    the services provided under the project in order to become self-
    sufficient and that their coverage under the projects would be
    cost-effective.
      (B) Refugees covered under such alternative projects shall be
    precluded from receiving cash or medical assistance under any other
    paragraph of this subsection or under title XIX or part A of title
    IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq., 601 et
    seq.].
      (C) The Secretary shall report to Congress not later than October
    31, 1985, on the results of these projects and on any
    recommendations respecting changes in the refugee assistance
    program under this section to take into account such results.
      (D) To the extent that the use of such funds is consistent with
    the purposes of such provisions, funds appropriated under section

      State and which are exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3)
      of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)].
        "(3) The term 'eligible participant' means any alien who - 
          "(A) has been admitted into the United States as a refugee
        under section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act
        [section 1157 of this title];
          "(B) has been paroled into the United States as a refugee by

      month in which the alien entered the United States (in the case
      of an alien described in (A), (B), or (D)) or the month in which
      the alien applied for asylum (in the case of an alien described
      in subparagraph (C)).
        "(4) The term 'Secretary' means the Secretary of Education.

             "AUTHORIZATIONS AND ALLOCATION OF APPROPRIATIONS         
      "Sec. 102. (a) There are authorized to be appropriated for each
    of the fiscal years 1981, 1982, and 1983, but only in a lump sum
    for all programs under this Act, subject to allocation in
    accordance with subsection (b), such sums as may be necessary to
    make payments to which State educational agencies are entitled
    under this Act and payments for administration under section 104.
      "(b)(1) If the sums appropriated for any fiscal year to make
    payments to States under this Act are not sufficient to pay in full
    the sum of the amounts which State educational agencies are
    entitled to receive under titles II through IV for such year, the
    allocations to State educational agencies under each of such titles
    shall be ratably reduced by the same percentage to the extent
    necessary to bring the aggregate of such allocations within the
    limits of the amounts so appropriated.
      "(2) In the event that funds become available for making payments
    under this Act for any period after allocations have been made
    under paragraph (1) of this subsection for such period, the amounts
    reduced under such paragraph shall be increased on the same basis
    as they were reduced.

                    "TREATMENT OF CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS                
      "Sec. 103. (a) The jurisdictions to which this section applies
    are Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana
    Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
      "(b)(1) Each jurisdiction to which this section applies shall be
    entitled to grants for the purposes set forth in sections 201(a),
    302, and 402 in amounts equal to amounts determined by the
    Secretary in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary,
    except that the aggregate of the amount to which such jurisdictions
    are so entitled for any period - 
        "(A) for the purposes set forth in section 201(a), shall not
      exceed an amount equal to 1 percent of the amount authorized to
      be appropriated under section 201 for that period;
        "(B) for the purposes set forth in section 302, shall not
      exceed an amount equal to 1 percent of the aggregate of the
      amounts to which all States are entitled under section 301 for
      that period; and
        "(C) for the purposes set forth in section 402, shall not
      exceed an amount equal to 1 percent of the aggregate of the
      amounts to which all States are entitled under section 401 for
      that period.
      "(2) If the aggregate of the amounts determined by the Secretary
    pursuant to paragraph (1) to be so needed for any period exceeds an
    amount equal to such 1 percent limitation, the entitlement of each
    such jurisdiction shall be reduced proportionately until such
    aggregate does not exceed such limitation.

                        "STATE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS                    
      "Sec. 104. The Secretary is authorized to pay to each State
    educational agency amounts equal to the amounts expended by it for
    the proper and efficient administration of its functions under this
    Act, except that the total of such payments or any period shall not
    exceed 2 percent of the amount which that State educational agency
    receives for that period under this Act.

                               "WITHHOLDING                           
      "Sec. 105. Whenever the Secretary, after reasonable notice and
    opportunity for a hearing to any State educational agency, finds
    that there is a failure to meet the requirements of any title of
    this Act, the Secretary shall notify that agency that further
    payments will not be made to the agency under such title, or in the
    discretion of the Secretary, that the State educational agency
    shall not make further payments under such title to specified local
    education agencies or other entities (in the case of funds under
    title IV) whose actions cause or are involved in such failure until
    the Secretary is satisfied that there is no longer any such failure
    to comply. Until the Secretary is so satisfied, no further payments
    shall be made to the State educational agency under such title, or
    payments by the State educational agency under such title shall be
    limited to local educational agencies or other entities (in the
    case of funds under title IV) whose actions did not cause or were
    not involved in the failure, as the case may be.

                     "CONSULTATION WITH OTHER AGENCIES                 
      "Sec. 106. To the extent that may be appropriate to facilitate
    the determination of the amount of any reductions under sections
    201(b)(2), 301(b)(3), and 401(b)(2), the Secretary shall consult
    with the heads of other agencies providing assistance to eligible
    participants in order to secure information concerning the
    disbursement of funds for educational purposes under programs
    administered by them and provide, wherever feasible, for
    coordination among those programs and the programs under titles II
    through IV of this Act.

                            "STATE ENTITLEMENTS                        
      "Sec. 201. (a) The Secretary shall, in accordance with the
    provisions of this title, make grants to State educational agencies
    for fiscal year 1981, and for each subsequent fiscal year, for the
    purposes of assisting local educational agencies of that State in
    providing basic education for eligible participants enrolled in
    elementary or secondary public schools. Payments made under this
    title to any State shall be used in accordance with applications
    approved under section 202 for public educational services for
    eligible participants enrolled in the elementary and secondary
    public schools under the jurisdiction of the local educational
    agencies of that State.
      "(b)(1) As soon as possible after the date of the enactment of
    the Consolidated Refugee Education Assistance Act [Aug. 13, 1981],
    the Secretary shall establish a formula (reflecting the
    availability of the full amount authorized for this title under
    section 203(b)) by which to determine the amount of the grant which
    each State educational agency is entitled to receive under this
    title for any fiscal year. The formula established by the Secretary
    shall take into account the number of years that an eligible
    participant assisted under this title has resided within the United
    States and the relative costs, by grade level, of providing
    education for elementary and secondary school children. On the
    basis of the formula the Secretary shall allocate among the State
    educational agencies, for each fiscal year, the amounts available
    to carry out this title, subject to such reductions or adjustments
    as may be required under paragraph (2) or subsection (c). Funds
    shall be allocated among State educational agencies pursuant to the
    formula without regard to variations in educational costs among
    different geographical areas.
      "(2) The amount of the grant to which a State educational agency
    is otherwise entitled for any fiscal year, as determined under
    paragraph (1), shall be reduced by the amounts made available for
    such fiscal year under any other Federal law for expenditure within
    the State for the same purposes as those for which funds are made
    available under this title, except that the reduction shall be made
    only to the extent that (A) such amounts are made available for
    such purposes specifically because of the refugee, parolee, or
    asylee status of the individuals to be served by such funds, and
    (B) such amounts are made available to provide assistance to
    individuals eligible for services under this title. The amount of
    the reduction required under this paragraph shall be determined by
    the Secretary in a manner consistent with subsection (c).
      "(3) For the purpose of this subsection, the term 'State' does
    not include Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern
    Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
    The entitlements of such jurisdictions shall be determined in the
    manner specified in section 103, but for purposes of this title and
    section 105 any payments made under section 103 for the purposes
    set forth in section 201(a) shall be considered to be payments
    under this title.
      "(c) Determinations by the Secretary under this title for any
    period with respect to the number of eligible participants and the
    amount of the reduction under subsection (b)(2) shall be made,
    whenever actual satisfactory data are not available, on the basis
    of estimates. No such determination shall operate because of an
    underestimate or overestimate to deprive any State educational
    agency of its entitlement to any payment (or the amount thereof)
    under this title to which such agency would be entitled had such
    determination been made on the basis of accurate data.

    any payment under this title for any period unless that agency
    submits an application to the Secretary at such time, in such
    manner, and containing or accompanied by such information, as the
    Secretary may reasonably require. Each such application shall - 
        "(1) provide that the payments under this title will be used
      for the purposes set forth in section 201(a);
        "(2) provide assurances that such payments will be distributed
      among local educational agencies within that State in accordance
      with the formula established by the Secretary under section 201,
      subject to any reductions in payments for those local educational
      agencies identified under paragraph (3) to which funds described
      by section 201(b)(2) are made available for the same purposes
      under other Federal laws;
        "(3) specify the amount of funds described by section 201(b)(2)
      which are made available under other Federal laws for expenditure
      within the State for the same purposes as those for which funds
      are made available under this title and the local educational
      agencies to which such funds are made available;
        "(4) provide assurances that the State educational agency will
      not finally disapprove in whole or in part any application for
      funds received under this title without first affording the local
      educational agency submitting the application for such funds
      reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing; and
        "(5) provide for making such reports as the Secretary may
      reasonably require to carry out this title.
      "(b) The Secretary shall approve an application which meets the
    requirements of subsection (a). The Secretary shall not finally
    disapprove an application of a State educational agency except
    after reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing on the record
    to such agency.

    under section 102, to make payments under this title an amount
    equal to the product of -

    paragraph, the local educational agencies referred to in paragraph
    (1) shall include local educational agencies eligible to receive
    assistance by reason of the last sentence of section 3(b) and
    section 3(c)(2)(B) of the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law
    874, Eighty-first Congress) [formerly 20 U.S.C. 238(b) and
    (c)(2)(B)], relating to Federal impact aid, subject to paragraph
    (5) of this subsection.
      "(3) The amount of the grant to which a State educational agency
    is otherwise entitled for any fiscal year, as determined under
    paragraph (1), shall be reduced by the amounts made available under
    any other Federal law to agencies or other entities for
    educational, or education-related, services or activities within
    the State because of the significant concentration of eligible
    participants. The amount of the reduction required under this
    paragraph shall be determined by the Secretary in a manner
    consistent with subsection (c).
      "(4) For the purpose of this subsection, the term 'State' does
    not include Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern
    Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
    The entitlements of such jurisdictions shall be determined in the
    manner specified in section 103, but for purposes of this title and
    section 105 any payments made under section 103 for the purposes
    set forth in section 302 shall be considered to be payments under
    this title.
      "(5) The amount of the grant to which a State educational agency
    is entitled as a result of the last sentence of paragraph (2) shall
    be limited to eligible participants who meet the requirements of
    section 101(4).
      "(c) Determinations by the Secretary under this title for any
    period with respect to the number of eligible participants and the
    amount of the reduction under subsection (b)(3) shall be made,
    whenever actual satisfactory data are not available, on the basis
    of estimates. No such determination shall operate because of an
    underestimate or overestimate to deprive any State educational
    agency of its entitlement to any payment (or the amount thereof)
    under this title to which such agency would be entitled had such
    determination been made on the basis of accurate data.
      "(d) Whenever the Secretary determines that any amount of a
    payment made to a State under this title for a fiscal year will not
    be used by such State for carrying out the purpose for which the
    payment was made, the Secretary shall make such amount available
    for carrying out such purpose to one or more other States to the
    extent the Secretary determines that such other States will be able
    to use such additional amount for carrying out such purpose. Any
    amount made available to a State from an appropriation for a fiscal
    year in accordance with the preceding sentence shall, for purposes
    of this title, be regarded as part of such State's payment (as
    determined under subsection (b)) for such year, but shall remain
    available until the end of the succeeding fiscal year.

    Sec. 1533. Removal court procedure

-STATUTE-
    (a) Application
      (1) In general
        In any case in which the Attorney General has classified
      information that an alien is an alien terrorist, the Attorney
      General may seek removal of the alien under this subchapter by
      filing an application with the removal court that contains - 
          (A) the identity of the attorney in the Department of Justice
        making the application;
          (B) a certification by the Attorney General or the Deputy
        Attorney General that the application satisfies the criteria
        and requirements of this section;
          (C) the identity of the alien for whom authorization for the
        removal proceeding is sought; and
          (D) a statement of the facts and circumstances relied on by
        the Department of Justice to establish probable cause that - 
            (i) the alien is an alien terrorist;
            (ii) the alien is physically present in the United States;
          and
            (iii) with respect to such alien, removal under subchapter
          II would pose a risk to the national security of the United
          States.
      (2) Filing
        An application under this section shall be submitted ex parte
      and in camera, and shall be filed under seal with the removal
      court.
    (b) Right to dismiss
      The Attorney General may dismiss a removal action under this
    subchapter at any stage of the proceeding.
    (c) Consideration of application
      (1) Basis for decision
        In determining whether to grant an application under this
      section, a single judge of the removal court may consider, ex
      parte and in camera, in addition to the information contained in
      the application - 
          (A) other information, including classified information,
        presented under oath or affirmation; and
          (B) testimony received in any hearing on the application, of
        which a verbatim record shall be kept.
      (2) Approval of order
        The judge shall issue an order granting the application, if the
      judge finds that there is probable cause to believe that - 
          (A) the alien who is the subject of the application has been
        correctly identified and is an alien terrorist present in the
        United States; and
          (B) removal under subchapter II would pose a risk to the
        national security of the United States.
      (3) Denial of order
        If the judge denies the order requested in the application, the
      judge shall prepare a written statement of the reasons for the
      denial, taking all necessary precautions not to disclose any
      classified information contained in the Government's application.
    (d) Exclusive provisions
      If an order is issued under this section granting an application,
    the rights of the alien regarding removal and expulsion shall be
    governed solely by this subchapter, and except as they are
    specifically referenced in this subchapter, no other provisions of
    this chapter shall be applicable.

    TITLE 8 - ALIENS AND NATIONALITY
    CHAPTER 12 - IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY
    SUBCHAPTER V - ALIEN TERRORIST REMOVAL PROCEDURES

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1534. Removal hearing

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      (1) Expeditious hearing
        In any case in which an application for an order is approved
      under section 1533(c)(2) of this title, a removal hearing shall
      be conducted under this section as expeditiously as practicable
      for the purpose of determining whether the alien to whom the
      order pertains should be removed from the United States on the
      grounds that the alien is an alien terrorist.
      (2) Public hearing
        The removal hearing shall be open to the public.
    (b) Notice
      An alien who is the subject of a removal hearing under this
    subchapter shall be given reasonable notice of - 
        (1) the nature of the charges against the alien, including a
      general account of the basis for the charges; and
        (2) the time and place at which the hearing will be held.
    (c) Rights in hearing
      (1) Right of counsel
        The alien shall have a right to be present at such hearing and
      to be represented by counsel. Any alien financially unable to
      obtain counsel shall be entitled to have counsel assigned to
      represent the alien. Such counsel shall be appointed by the judge
      pursuant to the plan for furnishing representation for any person
      financially unable to obtain adequate representation for the
      district in which the hearing is conducted, as provided for in
      section 3006A of title 18. All provisions of that section shall
      apply and, for purposes of determining the maximum amount of
      compensation, the matter shall be treated as if a felony was
      charged.
      (2) Introduction of evidence
        Subject to the limitations in subsection (e) of this section,
      the alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to introduce
      evidence on the alien's own behalf.
      (3) Examination of witnesses
        Subject to the limitations in subsection (e) of this section,
      the alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine the
      evidence against the alien and to cross-examine any witness.
      (4) Record
        A verbatim record of the proceedings and of all testimony and
      evidence offered or produced at such a hearing shall be kept.
      (5) Removal decision based on evidence at hearing
        The decision of the judge regarding removal shall be based only
      on that evidence introduced at the removal hearing.
    (d) Subpoenas
      (1) Request
        At any time prior to the conclusion of the removal hearing,
      either the alien or the Department of Justice may request the
      judge to issue a subpoena for the presence of a named witness
      (which subpoena may also command the person to whom it is
      directed to produce books, papers, documents, or other objects
      designated therein) upon a satisfactory showing that the presence
      of the witness is necessary for the determination of any material
      matter. Such a request may be made ex parte except that the judge
      shall inform the Department of Justice of any request for a
      subpoena by the alien for a witness or material if compliance
      with such a subpoena would reveal classified evidence or the
      source of that evidence. The Department of Justice shall be given
      a reasonable opportunity to oppose the issuance of such a
      subpoena.
      (2) Payment for attendance
        If an application for a subpoena by the alien also makes a
      showing that the alien is financially unable to pay for the
      attendance of a witness so requested, the court may order the
      costs incurred by the process and the fees of the witness so
      subpoenaed to be paid from funds appropriated for the enforcement
      of subchapter II of this chapter.
      (3) Nationwide service
        A subpoena under this subsection may be served anywhere in the
      United States.
      (4) Witness fees
        A witness subpoenaed under this subsection shall receive the
      same fees and expenses as a witness subpoenaed in connection with
      a civil proceeding in a court of the United States.
      (5) No access to classified information
        Nothing in this subsection is intended to allow an alien to
      have access to classified information.
    (e) Discovery
      (1) In general
        For purposes of this subchapter - 
          (A) the Government is authorized to use in a removal
        proceedings (!1) the fruits of electronic surveillance and
        unconsented physical searches authorized under the Foreign
        Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.)
        without regard to subsections (c), (e), (f), (g), and (h) of
        section 106 of that Act [50 U.S.C. 1806(c), (e), (f), (g), (h)]
        and discovery of information derived pursuant to such Act, or
        otherwise collected for national security purposes, shall not
        be authorized if disclosure would present a risk to the
        national security of the United States;

          (B) an alien subject to removal under this subchapter shall
        not be entitled to suppress evidence that the alien alleges was
        unlawfully obtained; and
          (C) section 3504 of title 18 and section 1806(c) of title 50
        shall not apply if the Attorney General determines that public
        disclosure would pose a risk to the national security of the
        United States because it would disclose classified information
        or otherwise threaten the integrity of a pending investigation.
      (2) Protective orders
        Nothing in this subchapter shall prevent the United States from
      seeking protective orders and from asserting privileges
      ordinarily available to the United States to protect against the
      disclosure of classified information, including the invocation of
      the military and State secrets privileges.
      (3) Treatment of classified information
        (A) Use
          The judge shall examine, ex parte and in camera, any evidence
        for which the Attorney General determines that public
        disclosure would pose a risk to the national security of the
        United States or to the security of any individual because it
        would disclose classified information and neither the alien nor
        the public shall be informed of such evidence or its sources
        other than through reference to the summary provided pursuant
        to this paragraph. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the
        Department of Justice may, in its discretion and, in the case
        of classified information, after coordination with the
        originating agency, elect to introduce such evidence in open
        session.
        (B) Submission
          With respect to such information, the Government shall submit
        to the removal court an unclassified summary of the specific
        evidence that does not pose that risk.
        (C) Approval
          Not later than 15 days after submission, the judge shall
        approve the summary if the judge finds that it is sufficient to
        enable the alien to prepare a defense. The Government shall
        deliver to the alien a copy of the unclassified summary
        approved under this subparagraph.
        (D) Disapproval
          (i) In general
            If an unclassified summary is not approved by the removal
          court under subparagraph (C), the Government shall be
          afforded 15 days to correct the deficiencies identified by
          the court and submit a revised unclassified summary.
          (ii) Revised summary
            If the revised unclassified summary is not approved by the
          court within 15 days of its submission pursuant to
          subparagraph (C), the removal hearing shall be terminated
          unless the judge makes the findings under clause (iii).
          (iii) Findings
            The findings described in this clause are, with respect to
          an alien, that - 
              (I) the continued presence of the alien in the United
            States would likely cause serious and irreparable harm to
            the national security or death or serious bodily injury to
            any person, and
              (II) the provision of the summary would likely cause
            serious and irreparable harm to the national security or
            death or serious bodily injury to any person.
        (E) Continuation of hearing without summary
          If a judge makes the findings described in subparagraph
        (D)(iii) - 
            (i) if the alien involved is an alien lawfully admitted for
          permanent residence, the procedures described in subparagraph
          (F) shall apply; and
            (ii) in all cases the special removal hearing shall
          continue, the Department of Justice shall cause to be
          delivered to the alien a statement that no summary is
          possible, and the classified information submitted in camera
          and ex parte may be used pursuant to this paragraph.
        (F) Special procedures for access and challenges to classified
          information by special attorneys in case of lawful permanent
          aliens
          (i) In general
            The procedures described in this subparagraph are that the
          judge (under rules of the removal court) shall designate a
          special attorney to assist the alien - 
              (I) by reviewing in camera the classified information on
            behalf of the alien, and
              (II) by challenging through an in camera proceeding the
            veracity of the evidence contained in the classified
            information.
          (ii) Restrictions on disclosure
            A special attorney receiving classified information under
          clause (i) - 
              (I) shall not disclose the information to the alien or to
            any other attorney representing the alien, and
              (II) who discloses such information in violation of
            subclause (I) shall be subject to a fine under title 18,
            imprisoned for not less than 10 years nor more than 25
            years, or both.
    (f) Arguments
      Following the receipt of evidence, the Government and the alien
    shall be given fair opportunity to present argument as to whether
    the evidence is sufficient to justify the removal of the alien. The
    Government shall open the argument. The alien shall be permitted to
    reply. The Government shall then be permitted to reply in rebuttal.
    The judge may allow any part of the argument that refers to
    evidence received in camera and ex parte to be heard in camera and
    ex parte.
    (g) Burden of proof
      In the hearing, it is the Government's burden to prove, by the
    preponderance of the evidence, that the alien is subject to removal
    because the alien is an alien terrorist.
    (h) Rules of evidence
      The Federal Rules of Evidence shall not apply in a removal
    hearing.
    (i) Determination of deportation
      If the judge, after considering the evidence on the record as a
    whole, finds that the Government has met its burden, the judge
    shall order the alien removed and detained pending removal from the
    United States. If the alien was released pending the removal
    hearing, the judge shall order the Attorney General to take the
    alien into custody.
    (j) Written order
      At the time of issuing a decision as to whether the alien shall
    be removed, the judge shall prepare a written order containing a
    statement of facts found and conclusions of law. Any portion of the
    order that would reveal the substance or source of information
    received in camera and ex parte pursuant to subsection (e) of this
    section shall not be made available to the alien or the public.
    (k) No right to ancillary relief
      At no time shall the judge consider or provide for relief from
    removal based on - 
        (1) asylum under section 1158 of this title;
        (2) by (!2) withholding of removal under section 1231(b)(3) of
      this title;

        (3) cancellation of removal under section 1229b of this title;
        (4) voluntary departure under section 1254a(e) (!3) of this
      title;

        (5) adjustment of status under section 1255 of this title; or
        (6) registry under section 1259 of this title.
    (l) Report on terrorist removal proceedings
      Not later than 3 months from December 28, 2001, the Attorney
    General shall submit to Congress a report concerning the effect and
    efficacy of alien terrorist removal proceedings, including the
    reasons why proceedings pursuant to this section have not been used
    by the Attorney General in the past and the effect on the use of
    these proceedings after the enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act of
    2001 (Public Law 107-56).

      (1) In general
        Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), the Attorney General may - 
          (A) take into custody any alien with respect to whom an

      (2) Special rules for permanent resident aliens
        (A) Release hearing
          An alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence shall be
        entitled to a release hearing before the judge assigned to hear
        the removal hearing. Such an alien shall be detained pending
        the removal hearing, unless the alien demonstrates to the court
        that the alien - 
            (i) is a person lawfully admitted for permanent residence
          in the United States;
            (ii) if released upon such terms and conditions as the
          court may prescribe (including the posting of any monetary
          amount), is not likely to flee; and

          any person or the community, if released.
        (B) Information considered

      (3) Release if order denied and no review sought
        (A) In general
          Subject to subparagraph (B), if a judge of the removal court

        seek review of such denial, the alien shall be released from
        custody.
        (B) Application of regular procedures
          Subparagraph (A) shall not prevent the arrest and detention
        of the alien pursuant to subchapter II of this chapter.
    (b) Conditional release if order denied and review sought
      (1) In general
        If a judge of the removal court denies the order sought in an
      application filed pursuant to section 1533 of this title and the
      Attorney General seeks review of such denial, the judge shall
      release the alien from custody subject to the least restrictive
      condition, or combination of conditions, of release described in
      section 3142(b) and clauses (i) through (xiv) of section
      3142(c)(1)(B) of title 18 that - 
          (A) will reasonably assure the appearance of the alien at any
        future proceeding pursuant to this subchapter; and
          (B) will not endanger the safety of any other person or the
        community.

        If the judge finds no such condition or combination of
      conditions, as described in paragraph (1), the alien shall remain
      in custody until the completion of any appeal authorized by this
      subchapter.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1537. Custody and release after removal hearing

-STATUTE-
    (a) Release
      (1) In general
        Subject to paragraph (2), if the judge decides that an alien
      should not be removed, the alien shall be released from custody.
      (2) Custody pending appeal
        If the Attorney General takes an appeal from such decision, the
      alien shall remain in custody, subject to the provisions of
      section 3142 of title 18.
    (b) Custody and removal
      (1) Custody
        If the judge decides that an alien shall be removed, the alien
      shall be detained pending the outcome of any appeal. After the
      conclusion of any judicial review thereof which affirms the
      removal order, the Attorney General shall retain the alien in
      custody and remove the alien to a country specified under
      paragraph (2).
      (2) Removal
        (A) In general
          The removal of an alien shall be to any country which the
        alien shall designate if such designation does not, in the
        judgment of the Attorney General, in consultation with the
        Secretary of State, impair the obligation of the United States
        under any treaty (including a treaty pertaining to extradition)
        or otherwise adversely affect the foreign policy of the United
        States.
        (B) Alternate countries
          If the alien refuses to designate a country to which the
        alien wishes to be removed or if the Attorney General, in
        consultation with the Secretary of State, determines that
        removal of the alien to the country so designated would impair
        a treaty obligation or adversely affect United States foreign
        policy, the Attorney General shall cause the alien to be
        removed to any country willing to receive such alien.
        (C) Continued detention
          If no country is willing to receive such an alien, the
        Attorney General may, notwithstanding any other provision of
        law, retain the alien in custody. The Attorney General, in
        coordination with the Secretary of State, shall make periodic
        efforts to reach agreement with other countries to accept such
        an alien and at least every 6 months shall provide to the
        attorney representing the alien at the removal hearing a
        written report on the Attorney General's efforts. Any alien in
        custody pursuant to this subparagraph shall be released from
        custody solely at the discretion of the Attorney General and
        subject to such conditions as the Attorney General shall deem
        appropriate.
        (D) Fingerprinting
          Before an alien is removed from the United States pursuant to
        this subsection, or pursuant to an order of removal because
        such alien is inadmissible under section 1182(a)(3)(B) of this
        title, the alien shall be photographed and fingerprinted, and
        shall be advised of the provisions of section 1326(b) of this
        title.
    (c) Continued detention pending trial
      (1) Delay in removal
        The Attorney General may hold in abeyance the removal of an

      mechanisms it needs to eliminate the current backlog in the
      processing of immigration benefit applications within 1 year
      after October 17, 2000, and to maintain the elimination of the
      backlog in future years; and
        (2) provide for regular congressional oversight of the

    Sec. 1601. Statements of national policy concerning welfare and
      immigration

-STATUTE-
      The Congress makes the following statements concerning national
    policy with respect to welfare and immigration:
        (1) Self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United
      States immigration law since this country's earliest immigration
      statutes.
        (2) It continues to be the immigration policy of the United
      States that - 
          (A) aliens within the Nation's borders not depend on public
        resources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own
        capabilities and the resources of their families, their
        sponsors, and private organizations, and
          (B) the availability of public benefits not constitute an
        incentive for immigration to the United States.

        (3) Despite the principle of self-sufficiency, aliens have been
      applying for and receiving public benefits from Federal, State,
      and local governments at increasing rates.
        (4) Current eligibility rules for public assistance and
      unenforceable financial support agreements have proved wholly
      incapable of assuring that individual aliens not burden the
      public benefits system.
        (5) It is a compelling government interest to enact new rules
      for eligibility and sponsorship agreements in order to assure
      that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national
      immigration policy.
        (6) It is a compelling government interest to remove the
      incentive for illegal immigration provided by the availability of
      public benefits.
        (7) With respect to the State authority to make determinations
      concerning the eligibility of qualified aliens for public
      benefits in this chapter, a State that chooses to follow the
      Federal classification in determining the eligibility of such
      aliens for public assistance shall be considered to have chosen
      the least restrictive means available for achieving the
      compelling governmental interest of assuring that aliens be self-
      reliant in accordance with national immigration policy.

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      Subject to subsection (b) of this section and notwithstanding any
    other provision of law, a State or political subdivision of a State
    is authorized to prohibit or otherwise limit or restrict the
    eligibility of aliens or classes of aliens for programs of general
    cash public assistance furnished under the law of the State or a
    political subdivision of a State.
    (b) Limitation
      The authority provided for under subsection (a) of this section
    may be exercised only to the extent that any prohibitions,
    limitations, or restrictions imposed by a State or political
    subdivision of a State are not more restrictive than the
    prohibitions, limitations, or restrictions imposed under comparable

    alien of a sponsor's income and resources (as described in section
    1631 of this title) for purposes of determining eligibility for,

    Sec. 1631. Federal attribution of sponsor's income and resources to
      alien

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in determining the
    eligibility and the amount of benefits of an alien for any Federal
    means-tested public benefits program (as provided under section
    1613 of this title), the income and resources of the alien shall be
    deemed to include the following:
        (1) The income and resources of any person who executed an
      affidavit of support pursuant to section 213A of the Immigration
      and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1183a] (as added by section 423 and
      as amended by section 551(a) of the Illegal Immigration Reform
      and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996) on behalf of such
      alien.
        (2) The income and resources of the spouse (if any) of the
      person.
    (b) Duration of attribution period
      Subsection (a) of this section shall apply with respect to an
    alien until such time as the alien - 
        (1) achieves United States citizenship through naturalization
      pursuant to chapter 2 of title III of the Immigration and
      Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.]; or
        (2)(A) has worked 40 qualifying quarters of coverage as defined
      under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.]
      or can be credited with such qualifying quarters as provided
      under section 1645 of this title, and (B) in the case of any such
      qualifying quarter creditable for any period beginning after
      December 31, 1996, did not receive any Federal means-tested
      public benefit (as provided under section 1613 of this title)
      during any such period.
    (c) Review of income and resources of alien upon reapplication
      Whenever an alien is required to reapply for benefits under any
    Federal means-tested public benefits program, the applicable agency
    shall review the income and resources attributed to the alien under
    subsection (a) of this section.
    (d) Application
      (1) If on August 22, 1996, a Federal means-tested public benefits
    program attributes a sponsor's income and resources to an alien in
    determining the alien's eligibility and the amount of benefits for
    an alien, this section shall apply to any such determination
    beginning on the day after August 22, 1996.
      (2) If on August 22, 1996, a Federal means-tested public benefits
    program does not attribute a sponsor's income and resources to an
    alien in determining the alien's eligibility and the amount of
    benefits for an alien, this section shall apply to any such
    determination beginning 180 days after August 22, 1996.
      (3) This section shall not apply to assistance or benefits under
    the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (!1) (7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.) to the
    extent that a qualified alien is eligible under section
    1612(a)(2)(J) of this title.

    (e) Indigence exception
      (1) In general
        For an alien for whom an affidavit of support under section
      213A of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1183a] has
      been executed, if a determination described in paragraph (2) is
      made, the amount of income and resources of the sponsor or the
      sponsor's spouse which shall be attributed to the sponsored alien
      shall not exceed the amount actually provided for a period
      beginning on the date of such determination and ending 12 months
      after such date.
      (2) Determination described
        A determination described in this paragraph is a determination
      by an agency that a sponsored alien would, in the absence of the
      assistance provided by the agency, be unable to obtain food and
      shelter, taking into account the alien's own income, plus any
      cash, food, housing, or other assistance provided by other
      individuals, including the sponsor. The agency shall notify the
      Attorney General of each such determination, including the names
      of the sponsor and the sponsored alien involved.
    (f) Special rule for battered spouse and child
      (1) In general
        Subject to paragraph (2) and notwithstanding any other
      provision of this section, subsection (a) of this section shall
      not apply to benefits - 
          (A) during a 12 month period if the alien demonstrates that
        (i) the alien has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty
        in the United States by a spouse or a parent, or by a member of
        the spouse or parent's family residing in the same household as
        the alien and the spouse or parent consented to or acquiesced
        to such battery or cruelty, (ii) the alien's child has been
        battered or subjected to extreme cruelty in the United States
        by the spouse or parent of the alien (without the active
        participation of the alien in the battery or cruelty), or by a
        member of the spouse's or parent's family residing in the same
        household as the alien when the spouse or parent consented or
        acquiesced to and the alien did not actively participate in
        such battery or cruelty, or (iii) the alien is a child whose
        parent (who resides in the same household as the alien child)
        has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty in the United
        States by that parent's spouse, or by a member of the spouse's
        family residing in the same household as the parent and the
        spouse consented to, or acquiesced in, such battery or cruelty,
        and the battery or cruelty described in clause (i), (ii), or
        (iii) (in the opinion of the agency providing such public
        benefits, which opinion is not subject to review by any court)
        has a substantial connection to the need for the public
        benefits applied for; and
          (B) after a 12 month period (regarding the batterer's income
        and resources only) if the alien demonstrates that such battery
        or cruelty under subparagraph (A) has been recognized in an
        order of a judge or administrative law judge or a prior
        determination of the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
        and that such battery or cruelty (in the opinion of the agency
        providing such public benefits, which opinion is not subject to
        review by any court) has a substantial connection to the need
        for the benefits.
      (2) Limitation
        The exception under paragraph (1) shall not apply to benefits
      for an alien during any period in which the individual
      responsible for such battery or cruelty resides in the same
      household or family eligibility unit as the individual who was
      subjected to such battery or cruelty.

    applying for a State or local public benefit is a qualified alien,
    a nonimmigrant under the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C.
    1101 et seq.], or an alien paroled into the United States under
    section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C.
    1182(d)(5)] for less than 1 year, for purposes of determining

    in subsection (a) of this section are adopted, a State that

    have in effect a verification system that complies with the
    regulations.
    (c) Authorization of appropriations
      There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be
    necessary to carry out the purpose of this section.
    (d) No verification requirement for nonprofit charitable
      organizations

    benefit (as defined in section 1621(c) of this title), is not
    required under this chapter to determine, verify, or otherwise
    require proof of eligibility of any applicant for such benefits.

    Supreme Court of the United States under Plyler v. Doe (457 U.S.
    202)(1982).
    (b) Benefit eligibility limitations applicable only with respect to
      aliens present in United States
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the

      under section 274A [8 U.S.C. 1324a] or other applicable provision
      of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.];

    under any program of foreign assistance as determined by the
    Secretary of State in consultation with the Attorney General.
    (d) Severability
      If any provision of this chapter or the application of such
    provision to any person or circumstance is held to be

                                 FINDINGS                             
      Pub. L. 108-458, title VII, Sec. 7201(a), Dec. 17, 2004, 118
    Stat. 3808, provided that: "Consistent with the report of the
    National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States,
    Congress makes the following findings:
        "(1) Travel documents are as important to terrorists as weapons
      since terrorists must travel clandestinely to meet, train, plan,
      case targets, and gain access to attack sites.
        "(2) International travel is dangerous for terrorists because
      they must surface to pass through regulated channels, present
      themselves to border security officials, or attempt to circumvent
      inspection points.
        "(3) Terrorists use evasive, but detectable, methods to travel,
      such as altered and counterfeit passports and visas, specific
      travel methods and routes, liaisons with corrupt government
      officials, human smuggling networks, supportive travel agencies,
      and immigration and identity fraud.
        "(4) Before September 11, 2001, no Federal agency
      systematically analyzed terrorist travel strategies. If an agency
      had done so, the agency could have discovered the ways in which
      the terrorist predecessors to al Qaeda had been systematically,
      but detectably, exploiting weaknesses in our border security
      since the early 1990s.
        "(5) Many of the hijackers were potentially vulnerable to
      interception by border authorities. Analyzing their
      characteristic travel documents and travel patterns could have
      allowed authorities to intercept some of the hijackers and a more
      effective use of information available in government databases
      could have identified some of the hijackers.
        "(6) The routine operations of our immigration laws and the
      aspects of those laws not specifically aimed at protecting
      against terrorism inevitably shaped al Qaeda's planning and
      opportunities.
        "(7) New insights into terrorist travel gained since September
      11, 2001, have not been adequately integrated into the front
      lines of border security.
        "(8) The small classified terrorist travel intelligence
      collection and analysis program currently in place has produced
      useful results and should be expanded."
