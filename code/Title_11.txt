-STATUTE-
      The Bankruptcy Rules and Forms govern procedure in cases under
    title 11 of the United States Code. The rules shall be cited as the
    Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and the forms as the Official
    Bankruptcy Forms. These rules shall be construed to secure the
    just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every case and
    proceeding.

      Section 247 of Public Law 95-598, 92 Stat. 2549 amended 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 2075 by omitting the last sentence. The effect of the
    amendment is to require that procedural rules promulgated pursuant
    to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2075 be consistent with the bankruptcy statute,
    both titles 11 and 28 U.S.C. Thus, although Rule 1001 sets forth
    the scope of the bankruptcy rules and forms, any procedural matters
    contained in title 11 or 28 U.S.C. with respect to cases filed
    under 11 U.S.C. would control. See 1 Collier, Bankruptcy &#182;
    3.04 [2][c] (15th ed. 1980).
      28 U.S.C. Sec. 151 establishes a United States Bankruptcy Court
    in each district as an adjunct to the district court. This
    provision does not, however, become effective until April 1, 1984.
    Public Law 95-598, Sec. 402(b). From October 1, 1979 through March
    31, 1984, the courts of bankruptcy as defined in Sec. 1(10) of the
    Bankruptcy Act, and created in Sec. 2a of that Act continue to be
    the courts of bankruptcy. Public Law 95-598, Sec. 404(a). From
    their effective date these rules and forms are to be applicable in
    cases filed under chapters 7, 9, 11 and 13 of title 11 regardless
    of whether the court is established by the Bankruptcy Act or by 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 151. Rule 9001 contains a broad and general definition
    of "bankruptcy court," "court" and "United States Bankruptcy Court"
    for this purpose.
      "Bankruptcy Code" or "Code" as used in these rules means title 11
    of the United States Code, the codification of the bankruptcy law.
    Public Law 95-598, Sec. 101. See Rule 9001.
      "Bankruptcy Act" as used in the notes to these rules means the
    Bankruptcy Act of 1898 as amended which was repealed by Sec. 401(a)
    of Public Law 95-598.
      These rules apply to all cases filed under the Code except as
    otherwise specifically stated.
      The final sentence of the rule is derived from former Bankruptcy
    Rule 903. The objective of "expeditious and economical
    administration" of cases under the Code has frequently been
    recognized by the courts to be "a chief purpose of the bankruptcy
    laws." See Katchen v. Landy, 382 U.S. 323, 328 (1966): Bailey v.
    Glover, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 342, 346-47 (1874): Ex parte Christy, 44
    U.S. (3 How.) 292, 312-14, 320-22 (1845). The rule also
    incorporates the wholesome mandate of the last sentence of Rule 1
    of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 2 Moore, Federal Practice
    &#182; 1.13 (2d ed. 1980); 4 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Title I of the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of
    1984, Pub. L. No. 98-353, 98 Stat. 333 (hereinafter the 1984
    amendments), created a new bankruptcy judicial system in which the
    role of the district court was substantially increased. 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 1334 confers on the United States district courts original and
    exclusive jurisdiction over all cases under title 11 of the United
    States Code and original but not exclusive jurisdiction over civil
    proceedings arising under title 11 and civil proceedings arising in
    or related to a case under title 11.
      Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 157(a) the district court may but need
    not refer cases and proceedings within the district court's
    jurisdiction to the bankruptcy judges for the district. Judgments
    or orders of the bankruptcy judges entered pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 157(b)(1) and (c)(2) are subject to appellate review by the
    district courts or bankruptcy appellate panels under 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    158(a).
      Rule 81(a)(1) F.R.Civ.P. provides that the civil rules do not
    apply to proceedings in bankruptcy, except as they may be made
    applicable by rules promulgated by the Supreme Court, e.g., Part
    VII of these rules. This amended Bankruptcy Rule 1001 makes the
    Bankruptcy Rules applicable to cases and proceedings under title
    11, whether before the district judges or the bankruptcy judges of
    the district.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      The citation to these rules is amended to conform to the citation

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Under Secs. 301-303 of the Code, a voluntary or involuntary case
    is commenced by filing a petition with the bankruptcy court. The
    voluntary petition may request relief under chapter 7, 9, 11, or 13
    whereas an involuntary petition may be filed only under chapter 7
    or 11. Section 109 of the Code specifies the types of debtors for
    whom the different forms of relief are available and Sec. 303(a)
    indicates the persons against whom involuntary petitions may be
    filed.
      The rule in subdivision (a) is in harmony with the Code in that
    it requires the filing to be with the bankruptcy court.
      The number of copies of the petition to be filed is specified in
    this rule but a local rule may require additional copies. This rule
    provides for filing sufficient copies for the court's files and for
    the trustee in a chapter 7 or 13 case.
      Official Form No. 1 may be used to seek relief voluntarily under
    any of the chapters. Only the original need be signed and verified,
    but the copies must be conformed to the original. See Rules 1008
    and 9011(c). As provided in Sec. 362(a) of the Code, the filing of
    a petition acts as a stay of certain acts and proceedings against
    the debtor, property of the debtor, and property of the estate.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Rules 1002(a), governing a voluntary petition, 1003(a), governing
    an involuntary petition, and 1003(e), governing a petition in a
    case ancillary to a foreign proceeding, are combined into this Rule
    1002. If a bankruptcy clerk has been appointed for the district,
    the petition is filed with the bankruptcy clerk. Otherwise, the
    petition is filed with the clerk of the district court.
      The elimination of the reference to the Official Forms of the
    petition is not intended to change the practice. Rule 9009 provides
    that the Official Forms "shall be observed and used" in cases and
    proceedings under the Code.
      Subdivision (b) which provided for the distribution of copies of
    the petition to agencies of the United States has been deleted.
    Some of these agencies no longer wish to receive copies of the
    petition, while others not included in subdivision (b) have now
    requested copies. The Director of the Administrative Office will
    determine on an ongoing basis which government agencies will be
    provided a copy of the petition.
      The number of copies of a petition that must be filed is a matter
    for local rule.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b) is derived from Rule X-1002(a). The duties of the
    United States trustee pursuant to the Code and 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    586(a) require that the United States trustee be apprised of the
    commencement of every case under chapters 7, 11, 12 and 13 and this
    is most easily accomplished by providing that office with a copy of
    the petition. Although 28 U.S.C. Sec. 586(a) does not give the
    United States trustee an administrative role in chapter 9 cases,
    Sec. 1102 of the Code requires the United States trustee to appoint
    committees and that section is applicable in chapter 9 cases
    pursuant to Sec. 901(a). It is therefore appropriate that the
    United States trustee receive a copy of every chapter 9 petition.
      Notwithstanding subdivision (b), pursuant to Rule 5005(b)(3), the
    clerk is not required to transmit a copy of the petition to the
    United States trustee if the United States trustee requests that it
    not be transmitted. Many rules require the clerk to transmit a
    certain document to the United States trustee, but Rule 5005(b)(3)
    relieves the clerk of that duty under this or any other rule if the
    United States trustee requests that such document not be
    transmitted.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Transferor or Transferee of Claim. A transferor or transferee
    of a claim shall annex to the original and each copy of the
    petition a copy of all documents evidencing the transfer, whether
    transferred unconditionally, for security, or otherwise, and a
    signed statement that the claim was not transferred for the purpose
    of commencing the case and setting forth the consideration for and
    terms of the transfer. An entity that has transferred or acquired a
    claim for the purpose of commencing a case for liquidation under
    chapter 7 or for reorganization under chapter 11 shall not be a
    qualified petitioner.
      (b) Joinder of Petitioners After Filing. If the answer to an
    involuntary petition filed by fewer than three creditors avers the
    existence of 12 or more creditors, the debtor shall file with the
    answer a list of all creditors with their addresses, a brief
    statement of the nature of their claims, and the amounts thereof.
    If it appears that there are 12 or more creditors as provided in
    Sec. 303(b) of the Code, the court shall afford a reasonable
    opportunity for other creditors to join in the petition before a
    hearing is held thereon.

      Subdivision (a). Official Form No. 11 (Involuntary Case:
    Creditors' Petition), is prescribed for use by petitioning
    creditors to have a debtor's assets liquidated under chapter 7 of
    the Code or the business reorganized under chapter 11. It contains
    the required allegations as specified in Sec. 303(b) of the Code.
    Official Form 12 is prescribed for use by fewer than all the
    general partners to obtain relief for the partnership as governed
    by Sec. 303(b)(3) of the Code and Rule 1004(b).
      Although the number of copies to be filed is specified in Rule
    1002, a local rule may require additional copies.
      Only the original need be signed and verified, but the copies
    must be conformed to the original. See Rules 1008 and 9011(c). The
    petition must be filed with the bankruptcy court. This provision
    implements Sec. 303(b) which provides that an involuntary case is
    commenced by filing the petition with the court.
      As provided in Sec. 362 of the Code, the filing of the petition
    acts as a stay of certain acts and proceedings against the debtor,
    the debtor's property and property of the estate.
      Subdivision (c) retains the explicitness of former Bankruptcy
    Rule 104(d) that a transfer of a claim for the purpose of
    commencing a case under the Code is a ground for disqualification
    of a party to the transfer as a petitioner.
      Section 303(b) "is not intended to overrule Bankruptcy Rule
    104(d), which places certain restrictions on the transfer of claims
    for the purpose of commencing an involuntary case." House Report
    No. 95-595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977) 322; Senate Report No. 95-
    989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978) 33.
      The subdivision requires disclosure of any transfer of the
    petitioner's claim as well as a transfer to the petitioner and
    applies to transfers for security as well as unconditional
    transfers, Cf. In re 69th & Crandon Bldg. Corp., 97 F.2d 392, 395
    (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 305 U.S. 629 (1938), recognizing the
    right of a creditor to sign a bankruptcy petition notwithstanding a
    prior assignment of his claim for the purpose of security. This
    rule does not, however, qualify the requirement of Sec. 303(b)(1)
    that a petitioning creditor must have a claim not contingent as to
    liability.
      Subdivision (d). Section 303(c) of the Code permits a creditor to
    join in the petition at any time before the case is dismissed or
    relief is ordered. While this rule does not require the court to
    give all creditors notice of the petition, the list of creditors
    filed by the debtor affords a petitioner the information needed to
    enable him to give notice for the purpose of obtaining the co-
    petitioners required to make the petition sufficient. After a
    reasonable opportunity has been afforded other creditors to join in
    an involuntary petition, the hearing on the petition should be held
    without further delay.
      Subdivision (e). This subdivision implements Sec. 304. A petition
    for relief under Sec. 304 may only be filed by a foreign
    representative who is defined in Sec. 101(20) generally as a
    representative of an estate in a foreign proceeding. The term
    "foreign proceeding" is defined in Sec. 101(19).
      Section 304(b) permits a petition filed thereunder to be
    contested by a party in interest. Subdivision (e)(2) therefore
    requires that the summons and petition be served on any person
    against whom the relief permitted by Sec. 304(b) is sought as well
    as on any other party the court may direct.
      The rules applicable to the procedure when an involuntary
    petition is filed are made applicable generally when a case
    ancillary to a foreign proceeding is commenced. These rules include
    Rule 1010 with respect to issuance and service of a summons, Rule
    1011 concerning responsive pleadings and motions, and Rule 1018
    which makes various rules in Part VII applicable in proceedings on
    contested petitions.
      The venue for a case ancillary to a foreign proceeding is
    provided in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1474.

    Rule 1004. Involuntary Petition Against a Partnership

-STATUTE-
      After filing of an involuntary petition under Sec. 303(b)(3) of
    the Code, (1) the petitioning partners or other petitioners shall
    promptly send to or serve on each general partner who is not a
    petitioner a copy of the petition; and (2) the clerk shall promptly
    issue a summons for service on each general partner who is not a
    petitioner. Rule 1010 applies to the form and service of the
    summons.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 105 and
    complements Secs. 301 and 303(b)(3) of the Code.
      Subdivision (a) specifies that while all general partners must
    consent to the filing of a voluntary petition, it is not necessary
    that they all execute the petition. It may be executed and filed on
    behalf of the partnership by fewer than all.
      Subdivision (b) implements Sec. 303(b)(3) of the Code which
    provides that an involuntary petition may be filed by fewer than
    all the general partners or, when all the general partners are
    debtors, by a general partner, trustee of the partner or creditors
    of the partnership. Rule 1010, which governs service of a petition
    and summons in an involuntary case, specifies the time and mode of
    service on the partnership. When a petition is filed against a
    partnership under Sec. 303(b)(3), this rule requires an additional
    service on the nonfiling general partners. It is the purpose of
    this subdivision to protect the interests of the nonpetitioning
    partners and the partnership.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Section 303(b)(3)(A) of the Code provides that fewer than all of
    the general partners in a partnership may commence an involuntary
    case against the partnership. There is no counterpart provision in
    the Code setting out the manner in which a partnership commences a
    voluntary case. The Supreme Court has held in the corporate context
    that applicable nonbankruptcy law determines whether authority
    exists for a particular debtor to commence a bankruptcy case. See
    Price v. Gurney, 324 U.S. 100 (1945). The lower courts have
    followed this rule in the partnership context as well. See, e.g.,
    Jolly v. Pittore, 170 B.R. 793 (S.D.N.Y. 1994); Union Planters
    National Bank v. Hunters Horn Associates, 158 B.R. 729 (Bankr. M.D.
    Tenn. 1993); In re Channel 64 Joint Venture, 61 B.R. 255 (Bankr.
    S.D. Oh. 1986). Rule 1004(a) could be construed as requiring the
    consent of all of the general partners to the filing of a voluntary
    petition, even if fewer than all of the general partners would have
    the authority under applicable nonbankruptcy law to commence a
    bankruptcy case for the partnership. Since this is a matter of
    substantive law beyond the scope of these rules, Rule 1004(a) is
    deleted as is the designation of subdivision (b).
      The rule is retitled to reflect that it applies only to
    involuntary petitions filed against partnerships.

    fiduciary, the representative may file a voluntary petition on
    behalf of the infant or incompetent person. An infant or
    incompetent person who does not have a duly appointed
    representative may file a voluntary petition by next friend or
    guardian ad litem. The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for
    an infant or incompetent person who is a debtor and is not
    otherwise represented or shall make any other order to protect the

      The caption of a petition commencing a case under the Code shall

    docket number. The title of the case shall include the following
    information about the debtor: name, employer identification number,
    last four digits of the social-security number or individual
    debtor's taxpayer-identification number, any other federal taxpayer-
    identification number, and all other names used within eight years
    before filing the petition. If the petition is not filed by the
    debtor, it shall include all names used by the debtor which are
    known to the petitioners.

      The title of the case should include all names used by the
    debtor, such as trade names, former married names and maiden name.
    See also Official Form No. 1 and the Advisory Committee Note to
    that Form. Additional names of the debtor are also required to
    appear in the caption of each notice to creditors. See Rule
    2002(m).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement the Judicial Conference policy
    to limit the disclosure of a party's social security number and
    similar identifiers. Under the rule, as amended, only the last four
    digits of the debtor's social security number need be disclosed.
    Publication of the employer identification number does not present
    the same identity theft or privacy protection issues. Therefore,
    the caption must include the full employer identification number.
      Debtors must submit with the petition a statement setting out
    their social security numbers. This enables the clerk to include
    the full social security number on the notice of the section 341
    meeting of creditors, but the statement itself is not submitted in
    the case or maintained in the case file.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The rule was changed
    only slightly after publication. The rule was changed to make clear
    that only the debtor's social security number is truncated to the
    final four digits, but other numerical identifiers must be set out
    in full. The rule also was amended to include a requirement that a
    debtor list other federal taxpayer identification numbers that may
    be in use.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to require the disclosure of all names used
    by the debtor in the past eight years. Section 727(a)(8) was
    amended in 2005 to extend the time between chapter 7 discharges
    from six to eight years, and the rule is amended to implement that
    change. The rule also is amended to require the disclosure of the
    last four digits of an individual debtor's taxpayer-identification
    number. This truncation of the number applies only to individual
    debtors. This is consistent with the requirements of Rule 9037.
      Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after

-HEAD-
    Rule 1006. Filing Fee

-STATUTE-
      (a) General Requirement. Every petition shall be accompanied by
    the filing fee except as provided in subdivisions (b) and (c) of
    this rule. For the purpose of this rule, "filing fee" means the
    filing fee prescribed by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1930(a)(1)-(a)(5) and any
    other fee prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United
    States under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1930(b) that is payable to the clerk
    upon the commencement of a case under the Code.
      (b) Payment of Filing Fee in Installments.
        (1) Application to Pay Filing Fee in Installments. A voluntary
      petition by an individual shall be accepted for filing if
      accompanied by the debtor's signed application, prepared as
      prescribed by the appropriate Official Form, stating that the
      debtor is unable to pay the filing fee except in installments.
        (2) Action on Application. Prior to the meeting of creditors,
      the court may order the filing fee paid to the clerk or grant
      leave to pay in installments and fix the number, amount and dates
      of payment. The number of installments shall not exceed four, and
      the final installment shall be payable not later than 120 days
      after filing the petition. For cause shown, the court may extend
      the time of any installment, provided the last installment is
      paid not later than 180 days after filing the petition.
        (3) Postponement of Attorney's Fees. All installments of the
      filing fee must be paid in full before the debtor or chapter 13
      trustee may make further payments to an attorney or any other
      person who renders services to the debtor in connection with the
      case.

      (c) Waiver of Filing Fee. A voluntary chapter 7 petition filed by
    an individual shall be accepted for filing if accompanied by the
    debtor's application requesting a waiver under 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    1930(f), prepared as prescribed by the appropriate Official Form.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      28 U.S.C. Sec. 1930 specifies the filing fees for petitions under
    chapters 7, 9, 11 and 13 of the Code. It also permits the payment
    in installments by individual debtors.
      Subdivision (b) is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 107. The
    administrative cost of installments in excess of four is
    disproportionate to the benefits conferred. Prolonging the period
    beyond 180 days after the commencement of the case causes
    undesirable delays in administration. Paragraph (2) accordingly
    continues the imposition of a maximum of four on the number of
    installments and retains the maximum period of installment payments
    allowable on an original application at 120 days. Only in
    extraordinary cases should it be necessary to give an applicant an
    extension beyond the four months. The requirement of paragraph (3)
    that filing fees be paid in full before the debtor may pay an
    attorney for services in connection with the case codifies the rule
    declared in In re Latham, 271 Fed. 538 (N.D.N.Y. 1921), and In re
    Darr, 232 Fed. 415 (N.D. Cal. 1916).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b)(3) is expanded to prohibit payments by the debtor
    or the chapter 13 trustee not only to attorneys but to any person
    who renders services to the debtor in connection with the case.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1996 AMENDMENT       
      The Judicial Conference prescribes miscellaneous fees pursuant to
    28 U.S.C. Sec. 1930(b). In 1992, a $30 miscellaneous administrative
    fee was prescribed for all chapter 7 and chapter 13 cases. The
    Judicial Conference fee schedule was amended in 1993 to provide
    that an individual debtor may pay this fee in installments.
      Subdivision (a) of this rule is amended to clarify that every
    petition must be accompanied by any fee prescribed under 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 1930(b) that is required to be paid when a petition is filed,
    as well as the filing fee prescribed by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1930(a). By
    defining "filing fee" to include Judicial Conference fees, the
    procedures set forth in subdivision (b) for paying the filing fee
    in installments will also apply with respect to any Judicial
    Conference fee required to be paid at the commencement of the case.
      GAP Report on Rule 1006. No changes since publication, except for
    a stylistic change in subdivision (a).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a) is amended to include a reference to new
    subdivision (c), which deals with fee waivers under 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    1930(f), which was added in 2005.
      Subdivision (b)(1) is amended to delete the sentence requiring a
    disclosure that the debtor has not paid an attorney or other person
    in connection with the case. Inability to pay the filing fee in
    installments is one of the requirements for a fee waiver under the
    2005 revisions to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1930(f). If the attorney payment
    prohibition were retained, payment of an attorney's fee would
    render many debtors ineligible for installment payments and thus
    enhance their eligibility for the fee waiver. The deletion of this
    prohibition from the rule, which was not statutorily required,
    ensures that debtors who have the financial ability to pay the fee
    in installments will do so rather than request a waiver.
      Subdivision (b)(3) is amended in conformance with the changes to
    subdivision (b)(1) to reflect the 2005 amendments. The change is
    meant to clarify that subdivision (b)(3) refers to payments made
    after the debtor has filed the bankruptcy case and after the debtor
    has received permission to pay the fee in installments. Otherwise,
    the subdivision may conflict with the intent and effect of the
    amendments to subdivision (b)(1).

    publication.

      (a) Corporate Ownership Statement, List of Creditors and Equity
    Security Holders, and Other Lists.
        (1) Voluntary Case. In a voluntary case, the debtor shall file
      with the petition a list containing the name and address of each
      entity included or to be included on Schedules D, E, F, G, and H
      as prescribed by the Official Forms. If the debtor is a
      corporation, other than a governmental unit, the debtor shall
      file with the petition a corporate ownership statement containing
      the information described in Rule 7007.1. The debtor shall file a
      supplemental statement promptly upon any change in circumstances
      that renders the corporate ownership statement inaccurate.
        (2) Involuntary Case. In an involuntary case, the debtor shall
      file within 14 days after entry of the order for relief, a list
      containing the name and address of each entity included or to be
      included on Schedules D, E, F, G, and H as prescribed by the
      Official Forms.
        (3) Equity Security Holders. In a chapter 11 reorganization
      case, unless the court orders otherwise, the debtor shall file
      within 14 days after entry of the order for relief a list of the
      debtor's equity security holders of each class showing the number
      and kind of interests registered in the name of each holder, and
      the last known address or place of business of each holder.
        (4) Chapter 15 Case. In addition to the documents required
      under Sec. 1515 of the Code, a foreign representative filing a
      petition for recognition under chapter 15 shall file with the
      petition: (A) a corporate ownership statement containing the
      information described in Rule 7007.1; and (B) unless the court
      orders otherwise, a list containing the names and addresses of
      all persons or bodies authorized to administer foreign
      proceedings of the debtor, all parties to litigation pending in
      the United States in which the debtor is a party at the time of
      the filing of the petition, and all entities against whom
      provisional relief is being sought under Sec. 1519 of the Code.
        (5) Extension of Time. Any extension of time for the filing of
      the lists required by this subdivision may be granted only on
      motion for cause shown and on notice to the United States trustee
      and to any trustee, committee elected under Sec. 705 or appointed
      under Sec. 1102 of the Code, or other party as the court may
      direct.

      (b) Schedules, Statements, and Other Documents Required.

          (E) copies of all payment advices or other evidence of
        payment, if any, received by the debtor from an employer within
        60 days before the filing of the petition, with redaction of
        all but the last four digits of the debtor's social-security
        number or individual taxpayer-identification number; and
          (F) a record of any interest that the debtor has in an
        account or program of the type specified in Sec. 521(c) of the
        Code.

        (2) An individual debtor in a chapter 7 case shall file a
      statement of intention as required by Sec. 521(a) of the Code,
      prepared as prescribed by the appropriate Official Form. A copy
      of the statement of intention shall be served on the trustee and
      the creditors named in the statement on or before the filing of
      the statement.
        (3) Unless the United States trustee has determined that the
      credit counseling requirement of Sec. 109(h) does not apply in
      the district, an individual debtor must file a statement of
      compliance with the credit counseling requirement, prepared as
      prescribed by the appropriate Official Form which must include
      one of the following:

        required by Sec. 521(b);
          (B) a statement that the debtor has received the credit
        counseling briefing required by Sec. 109(h)(1) but does not
        have the certificate required by Sec. 521(b);
          (C) a certification under Sec. 109(h)(3); or
          (D) a request for a determination by the court under Sec.
        109(h)(4).

        (4) Unless Sec. 707(b)(2)(D) applies, an individual debtor in a
      chapter 7 case shall file a statement of current monthly income
      prepared as prescribed by the appropriate Official Form, and, if
      the current monthly income exceeds the median family income for

      the appropriate Official Form.
        (6) A debtor in a chapter 13 case shall file a statement of

      Official Form, and, if the current monthly income exceeds the
      median family income for the applicable state and household size,
      a calculation of disposable income made in accordance with Sec.
      1325(b)(3), prepared as prescribed by the appropriate Official
      Form.
        (7) An individual debtor in a chapter 7 or chapter 13 case
      shall file a statement of completion of a course concerning
      personal financial management, prepared as prescribed by the
      appropriate Official Form. An individual debtor shall file the
      statement in a chapter 11 case in which Sec. 1141(d)(3) applies.
        (8) If an individual debtor in a chapter 11, 12, or 13 case has
      claimed an exemption under Sec. 522(b)(3)(A) in property of the
      kind described in Sec. 522(p)(1) with a value in excess of the
      amount set out in Sec. 522(q)(1), the debtor shall file a
      statement as to whether there is any proceeding pending in which
      the debtor may be found guilty of a felony of a kind described in
      Sec. 522(q)(1)(A) or found liable for a debt of the kind
      described in Sec. 522(q)(1)(B).

      (c) Time Limits. In a voluntary case, the schedules, statements,
    and other documents required by subdivision (b)(1), (4), (5), and
    (6) shall be filed with the petition or within 14 days thereafter,
    except as otherwise provided in subdivisions (d), (e), (f), and (h)
    of this rule. In an involuntary case, the list in subdivision
    (a)(2), and the schedules, statements, and other documents required
    by subdivision (b)(1) shall be filed by the debtor within 14 days
    of the entry of the order for relief. In a voluntary case, the
    documents required by paragraphs (A), (C), and (D) of subdivision
    (b)(3) shall be filed with the petition. Unless the court orders
    otherwise, a debtor who has filed a statement under subdivision
    (b)(3)(B), shall file the documents required by subdivision
    (b)(3)(A) within 14 days of the order for relief. In a chapter 7
    case, the debtor shall file the statement required by subdivision
    (b)(7) within 45 days after the first date set for the meeting of
    creditors under Sec. 341 of the Code, and in a chapter 11 or 13
    case no later than the date when the last payment was made by the
    debtor as required by the plan or the filing of a motion for a
    discharge under Sec. 1141(d)(5)(B) or Sec. 1328(b) of the Code. The
    court may, at any time and in its discretion, enlarge the time to
    file the statement required by subdivision (b)(7). The debtor shall
    file the statement required by subdivision (b)(8) no earlier than
    the date of the last payment made under the plan or the date of the
    filing of a motion for a discharge under Secs. 1141(d)(5)(B),(!1)
    1228(b), or 1328(b) of the Code. Lists, schedules, statements, and
    other documents filed prior to the conversion of a case to another
    chapter shall be deemed filed in the converted case unless the
    court directs otherwise. Except as provided in Sec. 1116(3), any
    extension of time to file schedules, statements, and other
    documents required under this rule may be granted only on motion
    for cause shown and on notice to the United States trustee, any
    committee elected under Sec. 705 or appointed under Sec. 1102 of
    the Code, trustee, examiner, or other party as the court may
    direct. Notice of an extension shall be given to the United States
    trustee and to any committee, trustee, or other party as the court
    may direct.

      (d) List of 20 Largest Creditors in Chapter 9 Municipality Case
    or Chapter 11 Reorganization Case. In addition to the list required
    by subdivision (a) of this rule, a debtor in a chapter 9
    municipality case or a debtor in a voluntary chapter 11
    reorganization case shall file with the petition a list containing
    the name, address and claim of the creditors that hold the 20
    largest unsecured claims, excluding insiders, as prescribed by the
    appropriate Official Form. In an involuntary chapter 11
    reorganization case, such list shall be filed by the debtor within
    2 days after entry of the order for relief under Sec. 303(h) of the
    Code.
      (e) List in Chapter 9 Municipality Cases. The list required by
    subdivision (a) of this rule shall be filed by the debtor in a
    chapter 9 municipality case within such time as the court shall
    fix. If a proposed plan requires a revision of assessments so that
    the proportion of special assessments or special taxes to be
    assessed against some real property will be different from the
    proportion in effect at the date the petition is filed, the debtor
    shall also file a list showing the name and address of each known
    holder of title, legal or equitable, to real property adversely
    affected. On motion for cause shown, the court may modify the
    requirements of this subdivision and subdivision (a) of this rule.
      (f) Statement of Social Security Number. An individual debtor
    shall submit a verified statement that sets out the debtor's social
    security number, or states that the debtor does not have a social
    security number. In a voluntary case, the debtor shall submit the
    statement with the petition. In an involuntary case, the debtor
    shall submit the statement within 14 days after the entry of the
    order for relief.
      (g) Partnership and Partners. The general partners of a debtor
    partnership shall prepare and file the list required under
    subdivision (a), schedules of the assets and liabilities, schedule
    of current income and expenditures, schedule of executory contracts
    and unexpired leases, and statement of financial affairs of the
    partnership. The court may order any general partner to file a
    statement of personal assets and liabilities within such time as
    the court may fix.
      (h) Interests Acquired or Arising After Petition. If, as provided
    by Sec. 541(a)(5) of the Code, the debtor acquires or becomes
    entitled to acquire any interest in property, the debtor shall
    within 14 days after the information comes to the debtor's
    knowledge or within such further time the court may allow, file a
    supplemental schedule in the chapter 7 liquidation case, chapter 11
    reorganization case, chapter 12 family farmer's debt adjustment
    case, or chapter 13 individual debt adjustment case. If any of the
    property required to be reported under this subdivision is claimed
    by the debtor as exempt, the debtor shall claim the exemptions in
    the supplemental schedule. The duty to file a supplemental schedule
    in accordance with this subdivision continues notwithstanding the
    closing of the case, except that the schedule need not be filed in
    a chapter 11, chapter 12, or chapter 13 case with respect to
    property acquired after entry of the order confirming a chapter 11
    plan or discharging the debtor in a chapter 12 or chapter 13 case.
      (i) Disclosure of List of Security Holders. After notice and
    hearing and for cause shown, the court may direct an entity other
    than the debtor or trustee to disclose any list of security holders
    of the debtor in its possession or under its control, indicating
    the name, address and security held by any of them. The entity
    possessing this list may be required either to produce the list or
    a true copy thereof, or permit inspection or copying, or otherwise
    disclose the information contained on the list.
      (j) Impounding of Lists. On motion of a party in interest and for
    cause shown the court may direct the impounding of the lists filed
    under this rule, and may refuse to permit inspection by any entity.
    The court may permit inspection or use of the lists, however, by
    any party in interest on terms prescribed by the court.
      (k) Preparation of List, Schedules, or Statements on Default of
    Debtor. If a list, schedule, or statement, other than a statement
    of intention, is not prepared and filed as required by this rule,
    the court may order the trustee, a petitioning creditor, committee,
    or other party to prepare and file any of these papers within a
    time fixed by the court. The court may approve reimbursement of the
    cost incurred in complying with such an order as an administrative
    expense.
      (l) Transmission to United States Trustee. The clerk shall
    forthwith transmit to the United States trustee a copy of every
    list, schedule, and statement filed pursuant to subdivision (a)(1),
    (a)(2), (b), (d), or (h) of this rule.
      (m) Infants and Incompetent Persons. If the debtor knows that a
    person on the list of creditors or schedules is an infant or
    incompetent person, the debtor also shall include the name,
    address, and legal relationship of any person upon whom process
    would be served in an adversary proceeding against the infant or
    incompetent person in accordance with Rule 7004(b)(2).

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is an adaptation of former Rules 108, 8-106, 10-108 and
    11-11. As specified in the rule, it is applicable in all types of
    cases filed under the Code.
      Subdivision (a) requires at least a list of creditors with their
    names and addresses to be filed with the petition. This list is
    needed for notice of the meeting of creditors (Rule 2002) and
    notice of the order for relief (Sec. 342 of the Code). The list
    will also serve to meet the requirements of Sec. 521(1) of the
    Code. Subdivision (a) recognizes that it may be impossible to file
    the schedules required by Sec. 521(1) and subdivision (b) of the
    rule at the time the petition is filed but in order for the case to
    proceed expeditiously and efficiently it is necessary that the
    clerk have the names and addresses of creditors. It should be noted
    that subdivision (d) of the rule requires a special list of the 20
    largest unsecured creditors in chapter 9 and 11 cases. That list is
    for the purpose of selecting a committee of unsecured creditors.
      Subdivision (b) is derived from former Rule 11-11 and conforms
    with Sec. 521. This subdivision indicates the forms to be used. The
    court may dispense with the filing of schedules and the statement
    of affairs pursuant to Sec. 521.
      Subdivisions (c) and (f) specify the time periods for filing the
    papers required by the rule as well as the number of copies. The
    provisions dealing with an involuntary case are derived from former
    Bankruptcy Rule 108. Under the Code, a chapter 11 case may be
    commenced by an involuntary petition (Sec. 303(a)), whereas under
    the Act, a Chapter XI case could have been commenced only by a
    voluntary petition. A motion for an extension of time to file the
    schedules and statements is required to be made on notice to
    parties, as the court may direct, including a creditors' committee
    if one has been appointed under Sec. 1102 of the Code and a trustee
    or examiner if one has been appointed pursuant to Sec. 1104 of the
    Code. Although written notice is preferable, it is not required by
    the rule; in proper circumstances the notice may be by telephone or
    otherwise.
      Subdivision (d) is new and requires that a list of the 20 largest
    unsecured creditors, excluding insiders as defined in Sec. 101(25)
    of the Code, be filed with the petition. The court, pursuant to
    Sec. 1102 of the Code, is required to appoint a committee of
    unsecured creditors as soon as practicable after the order for
    relief. That committee generally is to consist of the seven largest
    unsecured creditors who are willing to serve. The list should, as
    indicated on Official Form No. 9, specify the nature and amount of
    the claim. It is important for the court to be aware of the
    different types of claims existing in the case and this form should
    supply such information.
      Subdivision (e) applies only in chapter 9 municipality cases. It
    gives greater discretion to the court to determine the time for
    filing a list of creditors and any other matter related to the
    list. A list of creditors must at some point be filed since one is
    required by Sec. 924 of the Code. When the plan affects special
    assessments, the definitions in Sec. 902(2) and (3) for "special
    tax payer" and "special tax payer affected by the plan" become
    relevant.
      Subdivision (g) is derived from former Rules 108(c) and 11-11.
    Nondebtor general partners are liable to the partnership's trustee
    for any deficiency in the partnership's estate to pay creditors in
    full as provided by Sec. 723 of the Code. Subdivision (g)
    authorizes the court to require a partner to file a statement of
    personal assets and liabilities to provide the trustee with the
    relevant information.
      Subdivision (h) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 108(e) for
    chapter 7, 11 and 13 purposes. It implements the provisions in and
    language of Sec. 541(a)(5) of the Code.
      Subdivisions (i) and (j) are adapted from Secs. 165 and 166 of
    the Act and former Rule 10-108(b) and (c) without change in
    substance. The term "party in interest" is not defined in the Code
    or the rules, but reference may be made to Sec. 1109(b) of the
    Code. In the context of this subdivision, the term would include
    the debtor, the trustee, any indenture trustee, creditor, equity
    security holder or committee appointed pursuant to Sec. 1102 of the
    Code.
      Subdivision (k) is derived from former Rules 108(d) and 10-
    108(a).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivisions (b), (c), and (g) are amended to provide for the
    filing of a schedule of current income and current expenditures and
    the individual debtor's statement of intention. These documents are
    required by the 1984 amendments to Sec. 521 of the Code. Official
    Form No. 6A is prescribed for use by an individual debtor for
    filing a schedule of current income and current expenditures in a
    chapter 7 or chapter 11 case. Although a partnership or corporation
    is also required by Sec. 521(1) to file a schedule of current
    income and current expenditures, no Official Form is prescribed
    therefor.
      The time for filing the statement of intention is governed by
    Sec. 521(2)(A). A copy of the statement of intention must be served
    on the trustee and the creditors named in the statement within the
    same time. The provisions of subdivision (c) governing the time for
    filing when a chapter 11 or chapter 13 case is converted to a
    chapter 7 case have been omitted from subdivision (c) as amended.
    Filing after conversion is now governed exclusively by Rule 1019.
      Subdivision (f) has been abrogated. The number of copies of the
    documents required by this rule will be determined by local rule.
      Subdivision (h) is amended to include a direct reference to Sec.
    541(a)(5).
      Subdivision (k) provides that the court may not order an entity
    other than the debtor to prepare and file the statement of
    intention.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      References to Official Form numbers and to the Chapter 13
    Statement are deleted and subdivision (b) is amended in
    anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the Official
    Forms. The debtor in a chapter 12 or chapter 13 case shall file the
    list, schedules and statements required in subdivisions (a)(1),
    (b)(1), and (h). It is expected that the information currently
    provided in the Chapter 13 Statement will be included in the
    schedules and statements as revised not later than the effective
    date of these rule amendments.
      Subdivisions (a)(4) and (c) are amended to provide the United
    States trustee with notice of any motion to extend the time for the
    filing of any lists, schedules, or statements. Such notice enables
    the United States trustee to take appropriate steps to avoid undue
    delay in the administration of the case. See 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    586(a)(3)(G). Subdivisions (a)(4) and (c) are amended further to
    provide notice to committees elected under Sec. 705 or appointed
    pursuant to Sec. 1102 of the Code. Committees of retired employees
    appointed pursuant to Sec. 1114 are not included.
      The additions of references to unexpired leases in subdivisions
    (b)(1) and (g) indicate that the schedule requires the inclusion of
    unexpired leases as well as other executory contracts.
      The words "with the court" in subdivisions (b)(1), (e), and (g)
    are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).
      Subdivision (l), which is derived from Rule X-1002(a), provides
    the United States trustee with the information required to perform
    certain administrative duties such as the appointment of a
    committee of unsecured creditors. In a chapter 7 case, the United
    States trustee should be aware of the debtor's intention with
    respect to collateral that secures a consumer debt so that the
    United States trustee may monitor the progress of the case.
    Pursuant to Sec. 307 of the Code, the United States trustee has
    standing to raise, appear and be heard on issues and the lists,
    schedules and statements contain information that, when provided to
    the United States trustee, enable that office to participate
    effectively in the case. The United States trustee has standing to
    move to dismiss a chapter 7 or 13 case for failure to file timely
    the list, schedules or statement required by Sec. 521(1) of the
    Code. See Secs. 707(a)(3) and 1307(c)(9). It is therefore necessary
    for the United States trustee to receive notice of any extension of
    time to file such documents. Upon request, the United States
    trustee also may receive from the trustee or debtor in possession a
    list of equity security holders.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1996 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (c) is amended to provide that schedules and
    statements filed prior to the conversion of a case to another
    chapter shall be deemed filed in the converted case, whether or not
    the case was a chapter 7 case prior to conversion. This amendment
    is in recognition of the 1991 amendments to the Official Forms that
    abrogated the Chapter 13 Statement and made the same forms for
    schedules and statements applicable in all cases.
      This subdivision also contains a technical correction. The phrase
    "superseded case" creates the erroneous impression that conversion
    of a case results in a new case that is distinct from the original
    case. The effect of conversion of a case is governed by Sec. 348 of
    the Code.
      GAP Report on Rule 1007(c). No changes since publication, except
    for stylistic changes.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2001 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (m) is added to enable the person required to mail
    notices under Rule 2002 to mail them to the appropriate guardian or
    other representative when the debtor knows that a creditor or other
    person listed is an infant or incompetent person.
      The proper mailing address of the representative is determined in
    accordance with Rule 7004(b)(2), which requires mailing to the
    person's dwelling house or usual place of abode or at the place
    where the person regularly conducts a business or profession.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were
    made.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             
      [Subdivision (a).] This rule is amended to require the debtor to
    file a corporate ownership statement setting out the information
    described in Rule 7007.1. Requiring debtors to file the statement
    provides the court with an opportunity to make judicial
    disqualification determinations at the outset of the case. This
    could reduce problems later in the case by preventing the initial
    assignment of the case to a judge who holds a financial interest in
    a parent company of the debtor or some other entity that holds a
    significant ownership interest in the debtor. Moreover, by
    including the disclosure statement filing requirement at the
    commencement of the case, the debtor does not have to make the same
    disclosure filing each time it is involved in an adversary
    proceeding throughout the case. The debtor also must file
    supplemental statements as changes in ownership might arise.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes since
    publication.
      [Subdivisions (c) and (f).] The rule is amended to add a
    requirement that a debtor submit a statement setting out the
    debtor's social security number. The addition is necessary because
    of the corresponding amendment to Rule 1005 which now provides that
    the caption of the petition includes only the final four digits of
    the debtor's social security number. The debtor submits the
    statement, but it is not filed, nor is it included in the case
    file. The statement provides the information necessary to include
    on the service copy of the notice required under Rule 2002(a)(1).
    It will also provide the information to facilitate the ability of
    creditors to search the court record by a search of a social
    security number already in the creditor's possession.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The rule amendment
    is made in response to the extensive commentary that urged the
    Advisory Committee to continue the obligation contained in current
    Rule 1005 that a debtor must include his or her social security
    number on the caption of the bankruptcy petition. Rule 1005 is
    amended to limit that disclosure to the final four digits of the
    social security number, and Rule 1007 is amended to reinstate the
    obligation in a manner that will provide more protection of the
    debtor's privacy while continuing access to the information to
    those persons with legitimate need for that data. The debtor must
    disclose the information, but the method of disclosure is by a
    verified statement that is submitted to the clerk. The statement is
    not filed in the case and does not become a part of the court
    record. Therefore, it enables the clerk to deliver that information
    to the creditors and the trustee in the case, but it does not
    become a part of the court record governed by Sec. 107 of the
    Bankruptcy Code and is not available to the public.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             
      Notice to creditors and other parties in interest is essential to
    the operation of the bankruptcy system. Sending notice requires a
    convenient listing of the names and addresses of the entities to
    whom notice must be sent, and virtually all of the bankruptcy
    courts have adopted a local rule requiring the submission of a list
    of these entities with the petition and in a particular format.
    These lists are commonly called the "mailing matrix."
      Given the universal adoption of these local rules, the need for
    such lists in all cases is apparent. Consequently, the rule is
    amended to require the debtor to submit such a list at the
    commencement of the case. This list may be amended when necessary.
    See Rule 1009(a).
      The content of the list is described by reference to Schedules D
    through H of the Official Forms rather than by reference to
    creditors or persons holding claims. The cross reference to the
    Schedules as the source of the names for inclusion in the list
    ensures that persons such as codebtors or nondebtor parties to
    executory contracts and unexpired leases will receive appropriate
    notices in the case.
      While this rule renders unnecessary, in part, local rules on the
    subject, this rule does not direct any particular format or form
    for the list to take. Local rules still may govern those
    particulars of the list.
      Subdivision (c) is amended to reflect that subdivision (a)(1) no
    longer requires the debtor to file a schedule of liabilities with
    the petition in lieu of a list of creditors. The filing of the list
    is mandatory, and subdivision (b) of the rule requires the filing
    of schedules. Thus, subdivision (c) no longer needs to account for
    the possibility that the debtor can delay filing a schedule of
    liabilities when the petition is accompanied by a list of
    creditors. Subdivision (c) simply addresses the situation in which
    the debtor does not file schedules or statements with the petition,
    and the procedure for seeking an extension of time for filing.
      Other changes are stylistic.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes since
    publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      The title of this rule is expanded to refer to "documents" in
    conformity with the 2005 amendments to Sec. 521 and related
    provisions of the Bankruptcy Code that include a wider range of
    documentary requirements.
      Subdivision (a) is amended to require that any foreign
    representative filing a petition for recognition to commence a case
    under chapter 15, which was added to the Code in 2005, file a list
    of entities with whom the debtor is engaged in litigation in the
    United States. The foreign representative filing the petition for
    recognition must also list any entities against whom provisional
    relief is being sought as well as all persons or bodies authorized
    to administer foreign proceedings of the debtor. This should ensure
    that entities most interested in the case, or their
    representatives, will receive notice of the petition under Rule
    2002(q).
      Subdivision (a)(4) is amended to require the foreign
    representative who files a petition for recognition under chapter
    15 to file the documents described in Sec. 1515 of the Code as well
    as a corporate ownership statement. The subdivision is also amended
    to identify the foreign representative in language that more
    closely follows the text of the Code. Former subdivision (a)(4) is
    renumbered as subdivision (a)(5) and stylistic changes were made to
    the subdivision.
      Subdivision (b)(1) addresses schedules, statements, and other
    documents that the debtor must file unless the court orders
    otherwise and other than in a case under chapter 9. This
    subdivision is amended to include documentary requirements added by
    the 2005 amendments to Sec. 521 that apply to the same group of
    debtors and have the same time limits as the existing requirements
    of (b)(1). Consistent with the E-Government Act of 2002, Pub. L.
    No. 107-347, the payment advices should be redacted before they are
    filed.
      Subdivision (b)(2) is amended to conform to the renumbering of
    the subsections of Sec. 521.
      Subdivisions (b)(3) through (b)(8) are new and implement the 2005
    amendments to the Code. Subdivision (b)(3) provides for the filing
    of a document relating to the credit counseling requirement
    provided by the 2005 amendments to Sec. 109 in the context of an
    Official Form that warns the debtor of the consequences of failing
    to comply with the credit counseling requirement.
      Subdivision (b)(4) addresses the filing of information about
    current monthly income, as defined in Sec. 101, for certain chapter
    7 debtors and, if required, additional calculations of expenses
    required by the 2005 amendments to Sec. 707(b).
      Subdivision (b)(5) addresses the filing of information about
    current monthly income, as defined in Sec. 101, for individual
    chapter 11 debtors. The 2005 amendments to Sec. 1129(a)(15)
    condition plan confirmation for individual debtors on the
    commitment of disposable income, as defined in Sec. 1325(b)(2),
    which is based on current monthly income.
      Subdivision (b)(6) addresses the filing of information about
    current monthly income, as defined in Sec. 101, for chapter 13
    debtors and, if required, additional calculations of expenses.
    These changes are necessary because the 2005 amendments to Sec.
    1325 require that the determination of disposable income begin with
    current monthly income.
      Subdivision (b)(7) reflects the 2005 amendments to Secs. 727 and
    1328 of the Code that condition the receipt of a discharge on the
    completion of a personal financial management course, with certain
    exceptions. Certain individual chapter 11 debtors may also be
    required to complete a personal financial management course under
    Sec. 727(a)(11) as incorporated by Sec. 1141(d)(3)(C). To evidence
    compliance with that requirement, the subdivision requires the
    debtor to file the appropriate Official Form certifying that the
    debtor has completed the personal financial management course.
      Subdivision (b)(8) requires an individual debtor in a case under
    chapter 11, 12, or 13 to file a statement that there are no
    reasonable grounds to believe that the restrictions on a homestead
    exemption as set out in Sec. 522(q) of the Code are applicable.
    Sections 1141(d)(5)(C), 1228(f), and 1328(h) each provide that the
    court shall not enter a discharge order unless it finds that there
    is no reasonable cause to believe that Sec. 522(q) applies.
    Requiring the debtor to submit a statement to that effect in cases
    under chapters 11, 12, and 13 in which an exemption is claimed in
    excess of the amount allowed under Sec. 522(q)(1) provides the
    court with a basis to conclude, in the absence of any contrary
    information, that Sec. 522(q) does not apply. Creditors receive
    notice under Rule 2002(f)(11) of the time to request postponement
    of the entry of the discharge to permit an opportunity to challenge
    the debtor's assertions in the Rule 1007(b)(8) statement in
    appropriate cases.
      Subdivision (c) is amended to include time limits for the filing
    requirements added to subdivision (b) due to the 2005 amendments to
    the Code, and to make conforming amendments. Separate time limits
    are provided for the documentation of credit counseling and for the
    statement of the completion of the financial management course.
    While most documents relating to credit counseling must be filed
    with the voluntary petition, the credit counseling certificate and
    debt repayment plan can be filed within 15 days of the filing of a
    voluntary petition if the debtor files a statement under
    subdivision (b)(3)(B) with the petition. Sections 727(a)(11),
    1141(d)(3), and 1328(g) of the Code require individual debtors to
    complete a personal financial management course prior to the entry
    of a discharge. The amendment allows the court to enlarge the
    deadline for the debtor to file the statement of completion.
    Because no party is harmed by the enlargement, no specific
    restriction is placed on the court's discretion to enlarge the
    deadline, even after its expiration.
      Subdivision (c) of the rule is also amended to recognize the
    limitation on the extension of time to file schedules and
    statements when the debtor is a small business debtor. Section
    1116(3), added to the Code in 2005, establishes a specific standard
    for courts to apply in the event that the debtor in possession or
    the trustee seeks an extension for filing these forms for a period
    beyond 30 days after the order for relief.
      Changes Made After Publication. Subdivision (a)(4) was amended to
    insert the requirement that the foreign representative who files
    the chapter 15 petition must file the corporate ownership
    statement. Subdivision (b)(4) was amended to provide that all
    individual debtors rather than just those whose debts are primarily
    consumer debts must file the statement of current monthly income.
    Subdivisions (b)(7) and (c) were amended to make the obligation to
    file a statement of the completion of a personal financial
    management course applicable to certain individual chapter 11
    debtors as well as to individual debtors in chapters 7 and 13.
    Subdivision (c) is also amended to provide the court with broad
    discretion to enlarge the time to file the statement of completion
    of a personal financial management course. The Committee Note was
    amended to explain these changes.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. Each deadline in the rule of fewer than 30 days is
    amended to substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days.
    Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
    manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 15-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 20-day periods become 21-day periods
        -- 25-day periods become 28-day periods

-HEAD-
    Rule 1009. Amendments of Voluntary Petitions, Lists, Schedules and
      Statements

-STATUTE-
      (a) General Right To Amend. A voluntary petition, list, schedule,
    or statement may be amended by the debtor as a matter of course at
    any time before the case is closed. The debtor shall give notice of
    the amendment to the trustee and to any entity affected thereby. On
    motion of a party in interest, after notice and a hearing, the
    court may order any voluntary petition, list, schedule, or
    statement to be amended and the clerk shall give notice of the
    amendment to entities designated by the court.
      (b) Statement of Intention. The statement of intention may be
    amended by the debtor at any time before the expiration of the
    period provided in Sec. 521(a) of the Code. The debtor shall give
    notice of the amendment to the trustee and to any entity affected
    thereby.
      (c) Statement of Social Security Number. If a debtor becomes
    aware that the statement of social security number submitted under
    Rule 1007(f) is incorrect, the debtor shall promptly submit an
    amended verified statement setting forth the correct social
    security number. The debtor shall give notice of the amendment to
    all of the entities required to be included on the list filed under
    Rule 1007(a)(1) or (a)(2).
      (d) Transmission to United States Trustee. The clerk shall
    promptly transmit to the United States trustee a copy of every
    amendment filed or submitted under subdivision (a), (b), or (c) of
    this rule.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule continues the permissive approach adopted by former
    Bankruptcy Rule 110 to amendments of voluntary petitions and
    accompanying papers. Notice of any amendment is required to be
    given to the trustee. This is particularly important with respect
    to any amendment of the schedule of property affecting the debtor's
    claim of exemptions. Notice of any amendment of the schedule of
    liabilities is to be given to any creditor whose claim is changed
    or newly listed.
      The rule does not continue the provision permitting the court to
    order an amendment on its own initiative. Absent a request in some
    form by a party in interest, the court should not be involved in
    administrative matters affecting the estate.
      If a list or schedule is amended to include an additional
    creditor, the effect on the dischargeability of the creditor's
    claim is governed by the provisions of Sec. 523(a)(3) of the Code.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to require notice and a hearing in the
    event a party in interest other than the debtor seeks to amend. The
    number of copies of the amendment will be determined by local rule
    of court.
      Subdivision (b) is added to treat amendments of the statement of
    intention separately from other amendments. The intention of the
    individual debtor must be performed within 45 days of the filing of
    the statement, unless the court extends the period. Subdivision (b)
    limits the time for amendment to the time for performance under
    Sec. 521(2)(B) of the Code or any extension granted by the court.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments to subdivision (a) are stylistic.
      Subdivision (c) is derived from Rule X-1002(a) and is designed to
    provide the United States trustee with current information to
    enable that office to participate effectively in the case.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (c). Rule 2002(a)(1) provides that the notice of the
    Sec. 341 meeting of creditors include the debtor's social security
    number. It provides creditors with the full number while limiting
    publication of the social security number otherwise to the final
    four digits of the number to protect the debtor's identity from
    others who do not have the same need for that information. If,
    however, the social security number that the debtor submitted under
    Rule 1007(f) is incorrect, then the only notice to the entities
    contained on the list filed under Rule 1007(a)(1) or (a)(2) would
    be incorrect. This amendment adds a new subdivision (c) that
    directs the debtor to submit a verified amended statement of social
    security number and to give notice of the new statement to all
    entities in the case who received the notice containing the
    erroneous social security number.
      Subdivision (d). Former subdivision (c) becomes subdivision (d)
    and is amended to include new subdivision (c) amendments in the
    list of documents that the clerk must transmit to the United States
    trustee.
      Other amendments are stylistic.
      Changes Made After Publication. No changes since publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT

    Sec. 521 of the Code.

    Rule 1010. Service of Involuntary Petition and Summons; Petition
      For Recognition of a Foreign Nonmain Proceeding

-STATUTE-
      (a) Service of Involuntary Petition and Summons; Service of
    Petition for Recognition of Foreign Nonmain Proceeding. On the
    filing of an involuntary petition or a petition for recognition of
    a foreign nonmain proceeding, the clerk shall forthwith issue a
    summons for service. When an involuntary petition is filed, service
    shall be made on the debtor. When a petition for recognition of a
    foreign nonmain proceeding is filed, service shall be made on the
    debtor, any entity against whom provisional relief is sought under
    Sec. 1519 of the Code, and on any other party as the court may
    direct. The summons shall be served with a copy of the petition in
    the manner provided for service of a summons and complaint by Rule
    7004(a) or (b). If service cannot be so made, the court may order
    that the summons and petition be served by mailing copies to the
    party's last known address, and by at least one publication in a
    manner and form directed by the court. The summons and petition may
    be served on the party anywhere. Rule 7004(e) and Rule 4(l)
    F.R.Civ.P. apply when service is made or attempted under this rule.
      (b) Corporate Ownership Statement. Each petitioner that is a
    corporation shall file with the involuntary petition a corporate
    ownership statement containing the information described in Rule
    7007.1.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule provides the procedure for service of the involuntary
    petition and summons. It does not deal with service of a summons
    and complaint instituting an adversary proceeding pursuant to Part
    VII.
      While this rule is similar to former Bankruptcy Rule 111, it
    substitutes the clerk of the bankruptcy court for the clerk of the
    district court as the person who is to issue the summons.
      The modes of service prescribed by the rule are personal or by
    mail, when service can be effected in one of these ways in the
    United States. Such service is to be made in the manner prescribed
    in adversary proceedings by Rule 7004(a) and (b). If service must
    be made in a foreign country, the mode of service is one of that
    set forth in Rule 4(i) F.R.Civ.P.
      When the methods set out in Rule 7004(a) and (b) cannot be
    utilized, service by publication coupled with mailing to the last
    known address is authorized. Cf. Rule 7004(c). The court determines
    the form and manner of publication as provided in Rule 9007. The
    publication need not set out the petition or the order directing
    service by publication. In order to apprise the debtor fairly,
    however, the publication should include all the information
    required to be in the summons by Official Form No. 13 and a notice
    indicating how service is being effected and how a copy of the
    petition may be obtained.
      There are no territorial limits on the service authorized by this
    rule, which continues the practice under the former rules and Act.
    There must, however, be a basis for jurisdiction pursuant to Sec.
    109(a) of the Code for the court to order relief. Venue provisions
    are set forth in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1472.
      Subdivision (f) of Rule 7004 and subdivisions (g) and (h) of Rule
    4 F.R.Civ.P. govern time and proof of service and amendment of
    process or of proof of service.
      Rule 1004 provides for transmission to nonpetitioning partners of
    a petition filed against the partnership by fewer than all the
    general partners.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The rule has been broadened to include service of a petition
    commencing a case ancillary to a foreign proceeding, previously
    included in Rule 1003(e)(2).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Reference to the Official Form number is deleted in anticipation
    of future revision and renumbering of the Official Forms.
      Rule 4(g) and (h) F.R.Civ.P. made applicable by this rule refers
    to Rule 4(g) and (h) F.R.Civ.P. in effect on January 1, 1990,
    notwithstanding any subsequent amendment thereto. See Rule 7004(g).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to delete the reference to the Official
    Form. The Official Form for the summons was abrogated in 1991.
    Other amendments are stylistic and make no substantive change.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments to this rule are technical, are promulgated solely
    to conform to changes in subdivision designations in Rule 4,
    F.R.Civ.P., and in Rule 7004, and are not intended to effectuate
    any material change in substance.
      In 1996, the letter designation of subdivision (f) of Rule 7004
    (Summons; Time Limit for Service) was changed to subdivision (e).
    In 1993, the provisions of Rule 4, F.R.Civ.P., relating to proof of
    service contained in Rule 4(g) (Return) and Rule 4(h) (Amendments),
    were placed in the new subdivision (l) of Rule 4 (Proof of
    Service). The technical amendments to Rule 1010 are designed solely
    to conform to these new subdivision designations.
      The 1996 amendments to Rule 7004 and the 1993 amendments to Rule
    4, F.R.Civ.P., have not affected the availability of service by
    first class mail in accordance with Rule 7004(b) for the service of
    a summons and petition in an involuntary case commenced under Sec.
    303 or an ancillary case commenced under Sec. 304 of the Code.
      GAP Report on Rule 1010. These amendments, which are technical
    and conforming, were not published for comment.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      This rule is amended to implement the 2005 amendments to the
    Code, which repealed Sec. 304 and replaced it with chapter 15
    governing ancillary and other cross-border cases. Under chapter 15,
    a foreign representative commences a case by filing a petition for
    recognition of a pending foreign nonmain proceeding. The amendment
    requires service of the summons and petition on the debtor and any
    entity against whom the representative is seeking provisional
    relief. Until the court enters a recognition order under Sec. 1517,
    no stay is in effect unless the court enters some form of
    provisional relief under Sec. 1519. Thus, only those entities
    against whom specific provisional relief is sought need to be
    served. The court may, however, direct that service be made on
    additional entities as appropriate.
      This rule does not apply to a petition for recognition of a
    foreign main proceeding.
      The rule is also amended by renumbering the prior rule as
    subdivision (a) and adding a new subdivision (b) requiring any
    corporate creditor that files or joins an involuntary petition to
    file a corporate ownership statement.
      Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after
    publication.

    within the state in which the court sits, the court shall prescribe
    the time for filing and serving the response.
      (c) Effect of Motion. Service of a motion under Rule 12(b)
    F.R.Civ.P. shall extend the time for filing and serving a
    responsive pleading as permitted by Rule 12(a) F.R.Civ.P.
      (d) Claims Against Petitioners. A claim against a petitioning
    creditor may not be asserted in the answer except for the purpose
    of defeating the petition.
      (e) Other Pleadings. No other pleadings shall be permitted,
    except that the court may order a reply to an answer and prescribe
    the time for filing and service.
      (f) Corporate Ownership Statement. If the entity responding to
    the involuntary petition or the petition for recognition of a
    foreign proceeding is a corporation, the entity shall file with its
    first appearance, pleading, motion, response, or other request
    addressed to the court a corporate ownership statement containing
    the information described in Rule 7007.1.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 112. A petition
    filed by fewer than all the general partners under Rule 1004(b) to
    have an order for relief entered with respect to the partnership is
    referred to as a petition against the partnership because of the
    adversary character of the proceeding it commences. Cf. Sec.
    303(b)(3) of the Code; 2 Collier Bankruptcy &#182; 303.05[5][a]
    (15th ed. 1981); 2 id. &#182;&#182; 18.33[2], 18.46 (14th ed.
    1966). One who denies an allegation of membership in the firm is
    nevertheless recognized as a party entitled to contest a petition
    filed against a partnership under subdivision (b) of Rule 1004 in
    view of the possible consequences to him of an order for relief
    against the entity alleged to include him as a member. See Sec. 723
    of the Code; Francis v. McNeal, 228 U.S. 695 (1913); Manson v.
    Williams, 213 U.S. 453 (1909); Carter v. Whisler, 275 Fed. 743, 746-
    747 (8th Cir. 1921). The rule preserves the features of the former
    Act and Rule 112 and the Code permitting no response by creditors
    to an involuntary petition or petition against a partnership under
    Rule 1004(b).
      Subdivision (b): Rule 12 F.R.Civ.P. has been looked to by the
    courts as prescribing the mode of making a defense or objection to
    a petition in bankruptcy. See Fada of New York, Inc. v.
    Organization Service Co., Inc., 125 F.2d 120. (2d Cir. 1942); In
    the Matter of McDougald, 17 F.R.D. 2, 5 (W.D. Ark. 1955); In the
    Matter of Miller, 6 Fed. Rules Serv. 12f.26, Case No. 1 (N.D. Ohio
    1942); Tatum v. Acadian Production Corp. of La., 35 F. Supp. 40, 50
    (E.D. La. 1940); 2 Collier, supra &#182; 303.07 (15th ed. 1981); 2
    id. at 134-40 (14th ed. 1966). As pointed out in the Note
    accompanying former Bankruptcy Rule 915 an objection that a debtor
    is neither entitled to the benefits of the Code nor amenable to an
    involuntary petition goes to jurisdiction of the subject matter and
    may be made at any time consistent with Rule 12(h)(3) F.R.Civ.P.
    Nothing in this rule recognizes standing in a creditor or any other
    person not authorized to contest a petition to raise an objection
    that a person eligible to file a voluntary petition cannot be the
    subject of an order for relief on an involuntary petition. See
    Seligson & King, Jurisdiction and Venue in Bankruptcy, 36 Ref.J.
    36, 38-40 (1962).
      As Collier has pointed out with respect to the Bankruptcy Act,
    "the mechanics of the provisions in Sec. 18a and b relating to time
    for appearance and pleading are unnecessarily confusing. . . . It
    would seem, though, to be more straightforward to provide, as does
    Federal Rule 12(a), that the time to respond runs from the date of
    service rather than the date of issuance of process." 2 Collier,
    supra at 119. The time normally allowed for the service and filing
    of an answer or motion under Rule 1011 runs from the date of the
    issuance of the summons. Compare Rule 7012. Service of the summons
    and petition will ordinarily be made by mail under Rule 1010 and
    must be made within 10 days of the issuance of the summons under
    Rule 7004(e), which governs the time of service. When service is
    made by publication, the court should fix the time for service and
    filing of the response in the light of all the circumstances so as
    to afford a fair opportunity to the debtor to enter a defense or
    objection without unduly delaying the hearing on the petition. Cf.
    Rule 12(a) F.R.Civ.P.
      Subdivision (c): Under subdivision (c), the timely service of a
    motion permitted by Rule 12(b), (e), (f), or (h) F.R.Civ.P. alters
    the time within which an answer must be filed. If the court denies
    a motion or postpones its disposition until trial on the merits,
    the answer must be served within 10 days after notice of the
    court's action. If the court grants a motion for a more definite
    statement, the answer may be served any time within 10 days after
    the service of the more definite statement.
      Many of the rules governing adversary proceedings apply to
    proceedings on a contested petition unless the court otherwise
    directs as provided in Rule 1018. The specific provisions of this
    Rule 1011 or 7005, however, govern the filing of an answer or
    motion responsive to a petition. The rules of Part VII are
    adaptations of the corresponding Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
    and the effect of Rule 1018 is thus to make the provisions of Civil
    Rules 5, 8, 9, 15, and 56, inter alia, generally applicable to the
    making of defenses and objections to the petition. Rule 1018
    follows prior law and practice in this respect. See 2 Collier,
    Bankruptcy &#182;&#182; 18.39-18.41 (14th ed. 1966).
      Subdivision (d). This subdivision adopts the position taken in
    many cases that an affirmative judgment against a petitioning
    creditor cannot be sought by a counterclaim filed in an answer to
    an involuntary petition. See, e.g., Georgia Jewelers, Inc. v.
    Bulova Watch Co., 302 F.2d 362, 369-70 (5th Cir. 1962); Associated
    Electronic Supply Co. of Omaha v. C.B.S. Electronic Sales Corp.,
    288 F.2d 683, 684-85 (8th Cir. 1961). The subdivision follows
    Harris v. Capehart-Farnsworth Corp., 225 F.2d 268 (8th Cir. 1955),
    in permitting the debtor to challenge the standing of a petitioner
    by filing a counterclaim against him. It does not foreclose the
    court from rejecting a counterclaim that cannot be determined
    without unduly delaying the decision upon the petition. See In the
    Matter of Bichel Optical Laboratories, Inc., 299 F. Supp. 545 (D.
    Minn. 1969).
      Subdivision (e). This subdivision makes it clear that no reply
    needs to be made to an answer, including one asserting a
    counterclaim, unless the court orders otherwise.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The rule has been broadened to make applicable in ancillary cases
    the provisions concerning responsive pleadings to involuntary
    petitions.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2004 AMENDMENT             
      The amendment to Rule 1004 that became effective on December 1,
    2002, deleted former subdivision (a) of that rule leaving only the
    provisions relating to involuntary petitions against partnerships.
    The rule no longer includes subdivisions. Therefore, this technical
    amendment changes the reference to Rule 1004(b) to Rule 1004.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to reflect the 2005 amendments to the Code,
    which repealed Sec. 304 and added chapter 15. Section 304 covered
    cases ancillary to foreign proceedings, while chapter 15 governs
    ancillary and other cross-border cases and introduces the concept
    of a petition for recognition of a foreign proceeding.
      The rule is also amended in tandem with the amendment to Rule
    1010 to require the parties responding to an involuntary petition
    and a petition for recognition of a foreign proceeding to file
    corporate ownership statements to assist the court in determining
    whether recusal is necessary.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute
    a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules,
    deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 15-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 20-day periods become 21-day periods
        -- 25-day periods become 28-day periods
      Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after
    publication.

      This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 115(a) and (c)
    and applies in chapter 7 and 11 cases. The right to trial by jury
    under Sec. 19a of the Bankruptcy Act has been abrogated and the
    availability of a trial by jury is within the discretion of the
    bankruptcy judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1480(b). Rule 9015
    governs the demand for a jury trial.
      Subdivision (b) of Rule 1013 is derived from former Bankruptcy
    Rule 115(c) and Sec. 18(e) of the Bankruptcy Act. If an order for
    relief is not entered on default, dismissal will ordinarily be
    appropriate but the court may postpone definitive action. See also
    Rule 9024 with respect to setting aside an order for relief on
    default for cause.
      Subdivision (e) of former Bankruptcy Rule 115 has not been
    carried over because its provisions are covered by Sec. 303(i) of

-STATUTE-
      (a) Dismissal and Transfer of Cases.
        (1) Cases Filed in Proper District. If a petition is filed in
      the proper district, the court, on the timely motion of a party
      in interest or on its own motion, and after hearing on notice to
      the petitioners, the United States trustee, and other entities as
      directed by the court, may transfer the case to any other
      district if the court determines that the transfer is in the
      interest of justice or for the convenience of the parties.
        (2) Cases Filed in Improper District. If a petition is filed in
      an improper district, the court, on the timely motion of a party
      in interest or on its own motion, and after hearing on notice to
      the petitioners, the United States trustee, and other entities as
      directed by the court, may dismiss the case or transfer it to any
      other district if the court determines that transfer is in the
      interest of justice or for the convenience of the parties.

      (b) Procedure When Petitions Involving the Same Debtor or Related
    Debtors Are Filed in Different Courts. If petitions commencing
    cases under the Code are filed in different districts by or against
    (1) the same debtor, or (2) a partnership and one or more of its
    general partners, or (3) two or more general partners, or (4) a
    debtor and an affiliate, on motion filed in the district in which
    the petition filed first is pending and after hearing on notice to
    the petitioners, the United States trustee, and other entities as
    directed by the court, the court may determine, in the interest of
    justice or for the convenience of the parties, the district or
    districts in which the case or cases should proceed. Except as
    otherwise ordered by the court in the district in which the
    petition filed first is pending, the proceedings on the other
    petitions shall be stayed by the courts in which they have been
    filed until the determination is made.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 116 which
    contained venue as well as transfer provisions. Public Law 95-598,
    however, placed the venue provisions in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1472, and no
    purpose is served by repeating them in this rule. Transfer of cases
    is provided in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1475 but this rule adds the procedure
    for obtaining transfer. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1472, proper
    venue for cases filed under the Code is either the district of
    domicile, residence, principal place of business, or location of
    principal assets for 180 days or the longer portion thereof
    immediately preceding the petition. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1475 permits the
    court to transfer a case in the interest of justice and for the
    convenience of the parties. If the venue is improper, the court may
    retain or transfer the case in the interest of justice and for the
    convenience of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1477.
      Subdivision (a) of the rule is derived from former Bankruptcy
    Rule 116(b). It implements 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1475 and 1477 and
    clarifies the procedure to be followed in requesting and effecting
    transfer of a case. Subdivision (a) protects the parties against
    being subjected to a transfer except on a timely motion of a party
    in interest. If the transfer would result in fragmentation or
    duplication of administration, increase expense, or delay closing
    the estate, such a factor would bear on the timeliness of the
    motion as well as on the propriety of the transfer under the
    standards prescribed in subdivision (a). Subdivision (a) of the
    rule requires the interest of justice and the convenience of the
    parties to be the grounds of any transfer of a case or of the
    retention of a case filed in an improper district as does 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 1477. Cf. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1404(a) (district court may transfer
    any civil action "[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses,
    in the interest of justice"). It also expressly requires a hearing
    on notice to the petitioner or petitioners before the transfer of
    any case may be ordered. Under this rule, a motion by a party in
    interest is necessary. There is no provision for the court to act
    on its own initiative.
      Subdivision (b) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 116(c). It
    authorizes the court in which the first petition is filed under the
    Code by or against a debtor to entertain a motion seeking a
    determination whether the case so commenced should continue or be
    transferred and consolidated or administered jointly with another
    case commenced by or against the same or related person in another
    court under a different chapter of the Code. Subdivision (b) is
    correlated with 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1472 which authorizes petitioners to
    file cases involving a partnership and partners or affiliated
    debtors.
      The reference in subdivision (b) to petitions filed "by" a
    partner or "by" any other of the persons mentioned is to be
    understood as referring to voluntary petitions. It is not the
    purpose of this subdivision to permit more than one case to be
    filed in the same court because a creditor signing an involuntary
    petition happens to be a partner, a partnership, or an affiliate of
    a debtor.
      Transfers of adversary proceedings in cases under title 11 are
    governed by Rule 7087 and 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1475.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Both paragraphs 1 and 2 of subdivision (a) are amended to conform
    to the standard for transfer in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1412. Formerly, 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 1477 authorized a court either to transfer or retain a
    case which had been commenced in a district where venue was
    improper. However, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1412, which supersedes 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 1477, authorizes only the transfer of a case. The rule is
    amended to delete the reference to retention of a case commenced in
    the improper district. Dismissal of a case commenced in the
    improper district as authorized by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1406 has been
    added to the rule. If a timely motion to dismiss for improper venue
    is not filed, the right to object to venue is waived.
      The last sentence of the rule has been deleted as unnecessary.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b) is amended to provide that a motion for transfer
    of venue under this subdivision shall be filed in the district in
    which the first petition is pending. If the case commenced by the
    first petition has been transferred to another district prior to
    the filing of a motion to transfer a related case under this
    subdivision, the motion must be filed in the district to which the
    first petition had been transferred.
      The other amendments to this rule are consistent with the
    responsibilities of the United States trustee in the supervision
    and administration of cases pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 586(a)(3).
    The United States trustee may appear and be heard on issues
    relating to the transfer of the case or dismissal due to improper
    venue. See Sec. 307 of the Code.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      Courts have generally held that they have the authority to
    dismiss or transfer cases on their own motion. The amendment
    recognizes this authority and also provides that dismissal or
    transfer of the case may take place only after notice and a
    hearing.
      Other amendments are stylistic.

      (b) Cases Involving Two or More Related Debtors. If a joint

    or against (1) a husband and wife, or (2) a partnership and one or
    more of its general partners, or (3) two or more general partners,
    or (4) a debtor and an affiliate, the court may order a joint
    administration of the estates. Prior to entering an order the court

    522(b)(2) of the Code and the other has elected the exemptions
    under Sec. 522(b)(3), fix a reasonable time within which either may
    amend the election so that both shall have elected the same
    exemptions. The order shall notify the debtors that unless they
    elect the same exemptions within the time fixed by the court, they
    will be deemed to have elected the exemptions provided by Sec.
    522(b)(2).
      (c) Expediting and Protective Orders. When an order for
    consolidation or joint administration of a joint case or two or
    more cases is entered pursuant to this rule, while protecting the
    rights of the parties under the Code, the court may enter orders as
    may tend to avoid unnecessary costs and delay.

      Subdivision (a) of this rule is derived from former Bankruptcy
    Rule 117(a). It applies to cases when the same debtor is named in
    both voluntary and involuntary petitions, when husband and wife
    have filed a joint petition pursuant to Sec. 302 of the Code, and
    when two or more involuntary petitions are filed against the same
    debtor. It also applies when cases are pending in the same court by
    virtue of a transfer of one or more petitions from another court.
    Subdivision (c) allows the court discretion regarding the order of
    trial of issues raised by two or more involuntary petitions against
    the same debtor.
      Subdivision (b) recognizes the propriety of joint administration
    of estates in certain kinds of cases. The election or appointment
    of one trustee for two or more jointly administered estates is
    authorized by Rule 2009. The authority of the court to order joint
    administration under subdivision (b) extends equally to the
    situation when the petitions are filed under different sections,
    e.g., when one petition is voluntary and the other involuntary, and
    when all of the petitions are filed under the same section of the
    Code.
      Consolidation of cases implies a unitary administration of the
    estate and will ordinarily be indicated under the circumstances to
    which subdivision (a) applies. This rule does not deal with the
    consolidation of cases involving two or more separate debtors.
    Consolidation of the estates of separate debtors may sometimes be
    appropriate, as when the affairs of an individual and a corporation
    owned or controlled by that individual are so intermingled that the
    court cannot separate their assets and liabilities. Consolidation,
    as distinguished from joint administration, is neither authorized
    nor prohibited by this rule since the propriety of consolidation
    depends on substantive considerations and affects the substantive
    rights of the creditors of the different estates. For illustrations
    of the substantive consolidation of separate estates, see Sampsell
    v. Imperial Paper & Color Corp., 313 U.S. 215 (1941). See also
    Chemical Bank N.Y. Trust Co. v. Kheel, 369 F.2d 845 (2d Cir. 1966);

    Debtors and Due Process of Law, 73 Com.L.J. 341 (1968); Kennedy,
    Insolvency and the Corporate Veil in the United States in
    Proceedings of the 8th International Symposium on Comparative Law
    232, 248-55 (1971).
      Joint administration as distinguished from consolidation may
    include combining the estates by using a single docket for the
    matters occurring in the administration, including the listing of
    filed claims, the combining of notices to creditors of the
    different estates, and the joint handling of other purely
    administrative matters that may aid in expediting the cases and
    rendering the process less costly.
      Subdivision (c) is an adaptation of the provisions of Rule 42(a)
    F.R.Civ.P. for the purposes of administration of estates under this
    rule. The rule does not deal with filing fees when an order for the
    consolidation of cases or joint administration of estates is made.
      A joint petition of husband and wife, requiring the payment of a
    single filing fee, is permitted by Sec. 302 of the Code.
    Consolidation of such a case, however, rests in the discretion of
    the court; see Sec. 302(b) of the Code.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment to subdivision (b) implements the provisions of
    Sec. 522(b) of the Code, as enacted by the 1984 amendments.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to conform to the change in the numbering of
    Sec. 522(b) of the Code that was made as a part of the 2005
    amendments. Former subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) of Sec. 522 were
    renumbered as subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3), respectively. The rule
    is amended to make the parallel change.

-STATUTE-
      Death or incompetency of the debtor shall not abate a liquidation
    case under chapter 7 of the Code. In such event the estate shall be
    administered and the case concluded in the same manner, so far as
    possible, as though the death or incompetency had not occurred. If
    a reorganization, family farmer's debt adjustment, or individual's
    debt adjustment case is pending under chapter 11, chapter 12, or
    chapter 13, the case may be dismissed; or if further administration
    is possible and in the best interest of the parties, the case may
    proceed and be concluded in the same manner, so far as possible, as
    though the death or incompetency had not occurred.

-HEAD-
    Rule 1017. Dismissal or Conversion of Case; Suspension

-STATUTE-
      (a) Voluntary Dismissal; Dismissal for Want of Prosecution or
    Other Cause. Except as provided in Secs. 707(a)(3), 707(b),
    1208(b), and 1307(b) of the Code, and in Rule 1017(b), (c), and
    (e), a case shall not be dismissed on motion of the petitioner, for
    want of prosecution or other cause, or by consent of the parties,
    before a hearing on notice as provided in Rule 2002. For the
    purpose of the notice, the debtor shall file a list of creditors
    with their addresses within the time fixed by the court unless the
    list was previously filed. If the debtor fails to file the list,
    the court may order the debtor or another entity to prepare and
    file it.
      (b) Dismissal for Failure To Pay Filing Fee.
        (1) If any installment of the filing fee has not been paid, the
      court may, after a hearing on notice to the debtor and the
      trustee, dismiss the case.
        (2) If the case is dismissed or closed without full payment of
      the filing fee, the installments collected shall be distributed
      in the same manner and proportions as if the filing fee had been
      paid in full.

      (c) Dismissal of Voluntary Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 Case for
    Failure To Timely File List of Creditors, Schedules, and Statement
    of Financial Affairs. The court may dismiss a voluntary chapter 7
    or chapter 13 case under Sec. 707(a)(3) or Sec. 1307(c)(9) after a
    hearing on notice served by the United States trustee on the
    debtor, the trustee, and any other entities as the court directs.
      (d) Suspension. The court shall not dismiss a case or suspend
    proceedings under Sec. 305 before a hearing on notice as provided
    in Rule 2002(a).
      (e) Dismissal of an Individual Debtor's Chapter 7 Case, or
    Conversion to a Case Under Chapter 11 or 13, for Abuse. The court
    may dismiss or, with the debtor's consent, convert an individual
    debtor's case for abuse under Sec. 707(b) only on motion and after
    a hearing on notice to the debtor, the trustee, the United States
    trustee, and any other entity as the court directs.
        (1) Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 704(b)(2), a motion to
      dismiss a case for abuse under Sec. 707(b) or (c) may be filed
      only within 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of
      creditors under Sec. 341(a), unless, on request filed before the
      time has expired, the court for cause extends the time for filing
      the motion to dismiss. The party filing the motion shall set
      forth in the motion all matters to be considered at the hearing.
      In addition, a motion to dismiss under Sec. 707(b)(1) and (3)
      shall state with particularity the circumstances alleged to
      constitute abuse.
        (2) If the hearing is set on the court's own motion, notice of
      the hearing shall be served on the debtor no later than 60 days
      after the first date set for the meeting of creditors under Sec.
      341(a). The notice shall set forth all matters to be considered
      by the court at the hearing.

      (f) Procedure for Dismissal, Conversion, or Suspension.
        (1) Rule 9014 governs a proceeding to dismiss or suspend a
      case, or to convert a case to another chapter, except under Secs.
      706(a), 1112(a), 1208(a) or (b), or 1307(a) or (b).
        (2) Conversion or dismissal under Secs. 706(a), 1112(a),
      1208(b), or 1307(b) shall be on motion filed and served as
      required by Rule 9013.
        (3) A chapter 12 or chapter 13 case shall be converted without
      court order when the debtor files a notice of conversion under
      Secs. 1208(a) or 1307(a). The filing date of the notice becomes
      the date of the conversion order for the purposes of applying
      Sec. 348(c) and Rule 1019. The clerk shall promptly transmit a
      copy of the notice to the United States trustee.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Subdivision (a) of this rule is derived from former Bankruptcy
    Rule 120(a). While the rule applies to voluntary and involuntary
    cases, the "consent of the parties" referred to is that of
    petitioning creditors and the debtor in an involuntary case. The
    last sentence recognizes that the court should not be confined to
    petitioning creditors in its choice of parties on whom to call for
    assistance in preparing the list of creditors when the debtor fails
    to do so. This subdivision implements Secs. 303(j), 707, 1112 and
    1307 of the Code by specifying the manner of and persons to whom
    notice shall be given and requiring the court to hold a hearing on
    the issue of dismissal.
      Subdivision (b) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 120(b). A
    dismissal under this subdivision can occur only when the petition
    has been permitted to be filed pursuant to Rule 1006(b). The
    provision for notice in paragraph (3) is correlated with the
    provision in Rule 4006 when there is a waiver, denial, or
    revocation of a discharge. As pointed out in the Note accompanying
    Rule 4008, the purpose of notifying creditors of a debtor that no
    discharge has been granted is to correct their assumption to the
    contrary so that they can take appropriate steps to protect their
    claims.
      Subdivision (c) is new and specifies the notice required for a
    hearing on dismissal or suspension pursuant to Sec. 305 of the
    Code. The suspension to which this subdivision refers is that of
    the case; it does not concern abstention of the court in hearing an
    adversary proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1478(b).
      Subdivision (d). Any proceeding, whether by a debtor or other
    party, to dismiss or convert a case under Secs. 706, 707, 1112, or
    1307 is commenced by a motion pursuant to Rule 9014.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (d) is amended to provide that dismissal or
    conversion pursuant to Secs. 706(a), 707(b), 1112(a), and 1307(b)
    is not automatically a contested matter under Rule 9014. Conversion
    or dismissal under these sections is initiated by the filing and
    serving of a motion as required by Rule 9013. No hearing is
    required on these motions unless the court directs.
      Conversion of a chapter 13 case to a chapter 7 case as authorized
    by Sec. 1307(a) is accomplished by the filing of a notice of
    conversion. The notice of conversion procedure is modeled on the
    voluntary dismissal provision of Rule 41(a)(1) F.R.Civ.P.
    Conversion occurs on the filing of the notice. No court order is
    required.
      Subdivision (e) is new and provides the procedure to be followed
    when a court on its own motion has made a preliminary determination
    that an individual debtor's chapter 7 case may be dismissed
    pursuant to Sec. 707(b) of the Code, which was added by the 1984
    amendments. A debtor's failure to attend the hearing is not a
    ground for dismissal pursuant to Sec. 707(b).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to clarify that all entities required
    to receive notice under Rule 2002, including but not limited to
    creditors, are entitled to the 20 day notice of the hearing to
    dismiss the case. The United States trustee receives the notice
    pursuant to Rule 2002(k).
      The word "petition" is changed to "case" in subdivisions (a),
    (b), and (c) to conform to Secs. 707, 930, 1112, 1208, and 1307.
      Subdivision (d) is amended to conform to Sec. 348(c) of the Code
    which refers to the "conversion order."
      Subdivisions (a) and (d) are amended to provide procedures for
    dismissal or conversion of a chapter 12 case. Procedures for
    dismissal or conversion under Sec. 1208(a) and (b) are the same as
    the procedures for dismissal or conversion of a chapter 13 case
    under Sec. 1307(a) and (b).
      Subdivision (e) is amended to conform to the 1986 amendment to
    Sec. 707(b) of the Code which permits the United States trustee to
    make a motion to dismiss a case for substantial abuse. The time
    limit for such a motion is added by this subdivision. In general,
    the facts that are the basis for a motion to dismiss under Sec.
    707(b) exist at the time the case is commenced and usually can be
    discovered early in the case by reviewing the debtor's schedules
    and examining the debtor at the meeting of creditors. Since
    dismissal for substantial abuse has the effect of denying the
    debtor a discharge in the chapter 7 case based on matters which may
    be discovered early, a motion to dismiss under Sec. 707(b) is
    analogous to an objection to discharge pursuant to Rule 4004 and,
    therefore, should be required to be made within a specified time
    period. If matters relating to substantial abuse are not discovered
    within the time period specified in subdivision (e) because of the
    debtor's false testimony, refusal to obey a court order, fraudulent
    schedules or other fraud, and the debtor receives a discharge, the
    debtor's conduct may constitute the basis for revocation of the
    discharge under Sec. 727(d) and (e) of the Code.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (d) is amended to clarify that the date of the filing
    of a notice of conversion in a chapter 12 or chapter 13 case is
    treated as the date of the conversion order for the purpose of
    applying Rule 1019. Other amendments are stylistic and make no
    substantive change.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1999 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (b)(3), which provides that notice of dismissal for
    failure to pay the filing fee shall be sent to all creditors within
    30 days after the dismissal, is deleted as unnecessary. Rule
    2002(f) provides for notice to creditors of the dismissal of a
    case.
      Rule 2002(a) and this rule currently require notice to all
    creditors of a hearing on dismissal of a voluntary chapter 7 case
    for the debtor's failure to file a list of creditors, schedules,
    and statement of financial affairs within the time provided in Sec.
    707(a)(3) of the Code. A new subdivision (c) is added to provide
    that the United States trustee, who is the only entity with
    standing to file a motion to dismiss under Sec. 707(a)(3) or Sec.
    1307(c)(9), is required to serve the motion on only the debtor, the
    trustee, and any other entities as the court directs. This
    amendment, and the amendment to Rule 2002, will have the effect of
    avoiding the expense of sending notices of the motion to all
    creditors in a chapter 7 case.
      New subdivision (f) is the same as current subdivision (d),
    except that it provides that a motion to suspend all proceedings in
    a case or to dismiss a case for substantial abuse of chapter 7
    under Sec. 707(b) is governed by Rule 9014.
      Other amendments to this rule are stylistic or for clarification.

    stylistic changes in Rule 1017(e) and (f).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      This rule is amended to permit the court to grant a timely
    request filed by the United States trustee for an extension of time
    to file a motion to dismiss a chapter 7 case under Sec. 707(b),
    whether the court rules on the request before or after the
    expiration of the 60-day period.
      Reporter's Note on Text of Rule 1017(e). The above text of Rule
    1017(e) is not based on the text of the rule in effect on this
    date. The above text embodies amendments that have been promulgated
    by the Supreme Court in April 1999 and, unless Congress acts with
    respect to the amendments, will become effective on December 1,
    1999.
      GAP Report on Rule 1017(e). No changes since publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (e) is amended to implement the 2005 amendments to
    Sec. 707 of the Code. These statutory amendments permit conversion
    of a chapter 7 case to a case under chapter 11 or 13, change the
    basis for dismissal or conversion from "substantial abuse" to
    "abuse," authorize parties other than the United States trustee to
    bring motions under Sec. 707(b) under certain circumstances, and
    add Sec. 707(c) to create an explicit ground for dismissal based on
    the request of a victim of a crime of violence or drug trafficking.
    The conforming amendments to subdivision (e) preserve the time
    limits already in place for Sec. 707(b) motions, except to the
    extent that Sec. 704(b)(2) sets the deadline for the United States
    trustee to act. In contrast to the grounds for a motion to dismiss
    under Sec. 707(b)(2), which are quite specific, the grounds under
    Sec. 707(b)(1) and (3) are very general. Therefore, to enable the
    debtor to respond, subdivision (e) requires that motions to dismiss
    under Sec. 707(b)(1) and (3) state with particularity the
    circumstances alleged to constitute abuse.

    Part VII to facilitate the settlement of multiple controversies
    involving many persons in a single lawsuit is not compatible with
    the exigencies of bankruptcy administration. See United States F. &
    G. Co. v. Bray, 225 U.S. 205, 218 (1912). For that reason Rules
    7013, 7014 and 7018-7023 will rarely be appropriate in a proceeding
    on a contested petition.
      Certain terms used in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have
    altered meanings when they are made applicable in cases under the
    Code by these rules. See Rule 9002 infra. This Rule 1018 requires
    that the terms "adversary proceedings" when used in the rules in
    Part VII and "complaint" when used in the Federal Rules of Civil
    Procedure be given altered meanings when they are made applicable
    to proceedings relating to a contested petition or proceedings to
    vacate any order for relief. A motion to vacate an order for
    relief, whether or not made on a petition that was or could have
    been contested, is governed by the rules in Part VII referred to in
    this Rule 1018.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 1018 is amended to include within its terms a petition
    commencing an ancillary case when it is contested. This provision
    was formerly included in Rule 1003(e)(4).
      Although this rule does not contain an explicit authorization for
    the entry of an order for relief when a debtor refuses to cooperate
    in discovery relating to a contested involuntary petition, the
    court has ample power under Rule 37(b) F.R.Civ.P., as incorporated
    by Rule 7037, to enter an order for relief under appropriate
    circumstances. Rule 37(b) authorizes the court to enter judgment by
    default or an order that "facts shall be taken as established."

-HEAD-
    Rule 1019. Conversion of a Chapter 11 Reorganization Case, Chapter
      12 Family Farmer's Debt Adjustment Case, or Chapter 13
      Individual's Debt Adjustment Case to a Chapter 7 Liquidation Case

-STATUTE-
      When a chapter 11, chapter 12, or chapter 13 case has been
    converted or reconverted to a chapter 7 case:
        (1) Filing of Lists, Inventories, Schedules, Statements.
          (A) Lists, inventories, schedules, and statements of
        financial affairs theretofore filed shall be deemed to be filed
        in the chapter 7 case, unless the court directs otherwise. If
        they have not been previously filed, the debtor shall comply
        with Rule 1007 as if an order for relief had been entered on an
        involuntary petition on the date of the entry of the order
        directing that the case continue under chapter 7.
          (B) If a statement of intention is required, it shall be
        filed within 30 days after entry of the order of conversion or
        before the first date set for the meeting of creditors,
        whichever is earlier. The court may grant an extension of time
        for cause only on written motion filed, or oral request made
        during a hearing, before the time has expired. Notice of an
        extension shall be given to the United States trustee and to
        any committee, trustee, or other party as the court may direct.

        (2) New Filing Periods. A new time period for filing a motion
      under Sec. 707(b) or (c), a claim, a complaint objecting to
      discharge, or a complaint to obtain a determination of
      dischargeability of any debt shall commence under Rules 1017,
      3002, 4004, or 4007, but a new time period shall not commence if
      a chapter 7 case had been converted to a chapter 11, 12, or 13
      case and thereafter reconverted to a chapter 7 case and the time
      for filing a motion under Sec. 707(b) or (c), a claim, a
      complaint objecting to discharge, or a complaint to obtain a
      determination of the dischargeability of any debt, or any
      extension thereof, expired in the original chapter 7 case.
        (3) Claims Filed Before Conversion. All claims actually filed
      by a creditor before conversion of the case are deemed filed in
      the chapter 7 case.
        (4) Turnover of Records and Property. After qualification of,
      or assumption of duties by the chapter 7 trustee, any debtor in
      possession or trustee previously acting in the chapter 11, 12, or
      13 case shall, forthwith, unless otherwise ordered, turn over to
      the chapter 7 trustee all records and property of the estate in
      the possession or control of the debtor in possession or trustee.
        (5) Filing Final Report and Schedule of Postpetition Debts.
          (A) Conversion of Chapter 11 or Chapter 12 Case. Unless the
        court directs otherwise, if a chapter 11 or chapter 12 case is
        converted to chapter 7, the debtor in possession or, if the
        debtor is not a debtor in possession, the trustee serving at
        the time of conversion, shall:
            (i) not later than 14 days after conversion of the case,
          file a schedule of unpaid debts incurred after the filing of
          the petition and before conversion of the case, including the
          name and address of each holder of a claim; and
            (ii) not later than 30 days after conversion of the case,
          file and transmit to the United States trustee a final report
          and account;

          (B) Conversion of Chapter 13 Case. Unless the court directs
        otherwise, if a chapter 13 case is converted to chapter 7,
            (i) the debtor, not later than 14 days after conversion of
          the case, shall file a schedule of unpaid debts incurred
          after the filing of the petition and before conversion of the
          case, including the name and address of each holder of a
          claim; and
            (ii) the trustee, not later than 30 days after conversion
          of the case, shall file and transmit to the United States
          trustee a final report and account;

          (C) Conversion After Confirmation of a Plan. Unless the court
        orders otherwise, if a chapter 11, chapter 12, or chapter 13
        case is converted to chapter 7 after confirmation of a plan,
        the debtor shall file:
            (i) a schedule of property not listed in the final report
          and account acquired after the filing of the petition but
          before conversion, except if the case is converted from
          chapter 13 to chapter 7 and Sec. 348(f)(2) does not apply;
            (ii) a schedule of unpaid debts not listed in the final
          report and account incurred after confirmation but before the
          conversion; and
            (iii) a schedule of executory contracts and unexpired
          leases entered into or assumed after the filing of the
          petition but before conversion.

          (D) Transmission to United States Trustee. The clerk shall
        forthwith transmit to the United States trustee a copy of every
        schedule filed pursuant to Rule 1019(5).

        (6) Postpetition Claims; Preconversion Administrative Expenses;
      Notice. A request for payment of an administrative expense
      incurred before conversion of the case is timely filed under Sec.
      503(a) of the Code if it is filed before conversion or a time
      fixed by the court. If the request is filed by a governmental
      unit, it is timely if it is filed before conversion or within the
      later of a time fixed by the court or 180 days after the date of
      the conversion. A claim of a kind specified in Sec. 348(d) may be
      filed in accordance with Rules 3001(a)-(d) and 3002. Upon the
      filing of the schedule of unpaid debts incurred after
      commencement of the case and before conversion, the clerk, or
      some other person as the court may direct, shall give notice to
      those entities listed on the schedule of the time for filing a
      request for payment of an administrative expense and, unless a
      notice of insufficient assets to pay a dividend is mailed in
      accordance with Rule 2002(e), the time for filing a claim of a
      kind specified in Sec. 348(d).

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 122 and
    implements Sec. 348 of the Code. The rule applies to proceedings in
    a chapter 7 case following supersession of a case commenced under
    chapter 11 or 13, whether the latter was initiated by an original
    petition or was converted from a pending chapter 7 or another
    chapter case. The rule is not intended to invalidate any action
    taken in the superseded case before its conversion to chapter 7.
      Paragraph (1): If requirements applicable in the superseded case
    respecting the filing of schedules of debts and property, or lists
    of creditors and inventory, and of statements of financial affairs
    have been complied with before the order directing conversion to
    liquidation, these documents will ordinarily provide all the
    information about the debts, property, financial affairs, and
    contracts of the debtor needed for the administration of the
    estate. If the information submitted in the superseded case is
    inadequate for the purposes of administration, however, the court
    may direct the preparation of further informational material and
    the manner and time of its submission pursuant to paragraph (1). If
    no schedules, lists, inventories, or statements were filed in the
    superseded case, this paragraph imposes the duty on the debtor to
    file schedules and a statement of affairs pursuant to Rule 1007 as
    if an involuntary petition had been filed on the date when the
    court directed the conversion of the case to a liquidation case.
      Paragraphs (2) and (3). Paragraph (2) requires notice to be given
    to all creditors of the order of conversion. The notice is to be
    included in the notice of the meeting of creditors and Official
    Form No. 16 may be adapted for use. A meeting of creditors may have
    been held in the superseded case as required by Sec. 341(a) of the
    Code but that would not dispense with the need to hold one in the
    ensuing liquidation case. Section 701(a) of the Code permits the
    court to appoint the trustee acting in the chapter 11 or 13 case as
    interim trustee in the chapter 7 case. Section 702(a) of the Code
    allows creditors to elect a trustee but only at the meeting of
    creditors held under Sec. 341. The right to elect a trustee is not
    lost because the chapter 7 case follows a chapter 11 or 13 case.
    Thus a meeting of creditors is necessary. The date fixed for the
    meeting of creditors will control at least the time for filing
    claims pursuant to Rule 3002(c). That time will remain applicable
    in the ensuing chapter 7 case except as paragraph (3) provides, if
    that time had expired in an earlier chapter 7 case which was
    converted to the chapter 11 or 13 case, it is not revived in the
    subsequent chapter 7 case. The same is true if the time for filing
    a complaint objecting to discharge or to determine
    nondischargeability of a debt had expired. Paragraph (3), however,
    recognizes that such time may be extended by the court under Rule
    4004 or 4007 on motion made within the original prescribed time.
      Paragraph (4) renders it unnecessary to file anew claims that had
    been filed in the chapter 11 or 13 case before conversion to
    chapter 7.
      Paragraph (5) contemplates that typically, after the court orders
    conversion of a chapter case to liquidation, a trustee under
    chapter 7 will forthwith take charge of the property of the estate
    and proceed expeditiously to liquidate it. The court may appoint
    the interim trustee in the chapter 7 case pursuant to Sec. 701(a)
    of the Code. If creditors do not elect a trustee under Sec. 702,
    the interim trustee becomes the trustee.
      Paragraph (6) requires the trustee or debtor in possession acting
    in the chapter 11 or 13 case to file a final report and schedule of
    debts incurred in that case. This schedule will provide the
    information necessary for giving the notice required by paragraph
    (7) of the rule.
      Paragraph (7) requires that claims that arose in the chapter 11
    or 13 case be filed within 60 days after entry of the order
    converting the case to one under chapter 7. Claims not scheduled
    pursuant to paragraph (6) of the rule or arising from the rejection
    of an executory contract entered into during the chapter case may
    be filed within a time fixed by the court. Pursuant to Sec. 348(c)
    of the Code, the conversion order is treated as the order for
    relief to fix the time for the trustee to assume or reject
    executory contracts under Sec. 365(d).
      Paragraph (8) permits the extension of the time for filing claims
    when claims are not timely filed but only with respect to any
    surplus that may remain in the estate. See also Sec. 726(a)(2)(C)
    and (3) of the Code.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Paragraph (1) is amended to provide for the filing of a statement
    of intention in a case converted to chapter 7. Paragraph (1)(B) is
    added to provide for the filing of the statement of intention when
    a case is converted to chapter 7. The time for filing the statement
    of intention and for an extension of that time is governed by Sec.
    521(2)(A) of the Code. An extension of time for other required
    filings is governed by Rule 1007(c), which paragraph (1)(A)
    incorporates by reference. Because of the amendment to Rule
    1007(c), the filing of new lists, schedules, and statements is now
    governed exclusively by Rule 1019(1).
      Paragraph (3) of the rule is expanded to include the effect of
    conversion of a chapter 11 or 13 case to a chapter 7 case. On
    conversion of a case from chapter 11 or 13 to a chapter 7 case,
    parties have a new period within which to file claims or complaints
    relating to the granting of the discharge or the dischargeability
    of a debt. This amendment is consistent with the holding and
    reasoning of the court in F & M Marquette Nat'l Bank v. Richards,
    780 F.2d 24 (8th Cir. 1985).
      Paragraph (4) is amended to deal directly with the status of
    claims which are properly listed on the schedules filed in a
    chapter 11 case and deemed filed pursuant to Sec. 1111(a) of the
    Code. Section 1111(a) is only applicable to the chapter 11 case. On
    conversion of the chapter 11 case to a chapter 7 case, paragraph
    (4) governs the status of claims filed in the chapter 11 case. The
    Third Circuit properly construed paragraph (4) as applicable to
    claims deemed filed in the superseded chapter 11 case. In re
    Crouthamel Potato Chip Co., 786 F.2d 141 (3d Cir. 1986).
      The amendment to paragraph (4) changes that result by providing
    that only claims that are actually filed in the chapter 11 case are
    treated as filed in the superseding chapter 7 case. When chapter 11
    cases are converted to chapter 7 cases, difficulties in obtaining
    and verifying the debtors' records are common. It is unfair to the
    chapter 7 trustee and creditors to require that they be bound by
    schedules which may not be subject to verification.
      Paragraph (6) is amended to place the obligation on the chapter
    13 debtor to file a schedule of unpaid debts incurred during the
    superseded chapter 13 case.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to include conversion of a case from chapter
    12 to chapter 7 and to implement the United States trustee system.
      The amendments to paragraph (1)(A) are stylistic. Reference to
    the statement of executory contracts is deleted to conform to the
    amendment to Rule 1007(b)(1) which changes the statement to a
    schedule of executory contracts and unexpired leases.
      Paragraph (1)(B) is amended to enable the United States trustee
    to monitor the progress of the case and to take appropriate action
    to enforce the debtor's obligation to perform the statement of
    intention in a timely manner.
      Paragraph (2) is deleted because notice of conversion of the case
    is required by Rules 1017(d), 2002(f)(2), and 9022. The United
    States trustee, who supervises trustees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    586(a), may give notice of the conversion to the trustee in the
    superseded case.
      Paragraph (6), renumbered as paragraph (5), is amended to reduce
    to 15 days the time for filing a schedule of postpetition debts and
    requires inclusion of the name and address of each creditor in
    connection with the postpetition debt. These changes will enable
    the clerk to send postpetition creditors a timely notice of the
    meeting of creditors held pursuant to Sec. 341(a) of the Code. The
    amendments to this paragraph also provide the United States trustee
    with the final report and account of the superseded case, and with
    a copy of every schedule filed after conversion of the case.
    Conversion to chapter 7 terminates the service of the trustee in
    the superseded case pursuant to Sec. 348(e) of the Code. Sections
    704(a)(9), 1106(a)(1), 1107(a), 1202(b)(1), 1203 and 1302(b)(1) of
    the Code require the trustee or debtor in possession to file a
    final report and account with the court and the United States
    trustee. The words "with the court" are deleted as unnecessary. See
    Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).
      Paragraph (7), renumbered as paragraph (6), is amended to conform
    the time for filing postpetition claims to the time for filing
    prepetition claims pursuant to paragraph (3) (renumbered as
    paragraph (2)) of this rule and Rule 3002(c). This paragraph is
    also amended to eliminate the need for a court order to provide
    notice of the time for filing claims. It is anticipated that this
    notice will be given together with the notice of the meeting of
    creditors. It is amended further to avoid the need to fix a time
    for filing claims arising under Sec. 365(d) if it is a no asset
    case upon conversion. If assets become available for distribution,
    the court may fix a time for filing such claims pursuant to Rule
    3002(c)(4).
      The additions of references to unexpired leases in paragraph
    (1)(A) and in paragraphs (6) and (7) (renumbered as paragraphs (5)
    and (6)) are technical amendments to clarify that unexpired leases
    are included as well as other executory contracts.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1996 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (7) is abrogated to conform to the abrogation of Rule
    3002(c)(6).
      GAP Report on Rule 1019. No changes were made to the text of the
    rule. The Committee Note was changed to conform to the proposed
    changes to Rule 3002 (see GAP Report on Rule 3002 below).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments to subdivisions (3) and (5) are technical
    corrections and stylistic changes. The phrase "superseded case" is
    deleted because it creates the erroneous impression that conversion
    of a case results in a new case that is distinct from the original
    case. Similarly, the phrase "original petition" is deleted because
    it erroneously implies that there is a second petition with respect
    to a converted case. See Sec. 348 of the Code.
      GAP Report on Rule 1019. No changes to the published draft.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1999 AMENDMENT             
      Paragraph (1)(B) is amended to clarify that a motion for an
    extension of time to file a statement of intention must be made by
    written motion filed before the time expires, or by oral request
    made at a hearing before the time expires.
      Subdivision (6) is amended to provide that a holder of an
    administrative expense claim incurred after the commencement of the
    case, but before conversion to chapter 7, is required to file a
    request for payment under Sec. 503(a) within a time fixed by the
    court, rather than a proof of claim under Sec. 501 and Rules
    3001(a)-(d) and 3002. The 180-day period applicable to governmental
    units is intended to conform to Sec. 502(b)(9) of the Code and Rule
    3002(c)(1). It is unnecessary for the court to fix a time for
    filing requests for payment if it appears that there are not
    sufficient assets to pay preconversion administrative expenses. If
    a time for filing a request for payment of an administrative
    expense is fixed by the court, it may be enlarged as provided in
    Rule 9006(b). If an administrative expense claimant fails to timely
    file the request, it may be tardily filed under Sec. 503(a) if
    permitted by the court for cause.
      The final sentence of Rule 1019(6) is deleted because it is
    unnecessary in view of the other amendments to this paragraph. If a
    party has entered into a postpetition contract or lease with the
    trustee or debtor that constitutes an administrative expense, a
    timely request for payment must be filed in accordance with this
    paragraph and Sec. 503(b) of the Code. The time for filing a proof
    of claim in connection with the rejection of any other executory
    contract or unexpired lease is governed by Rule 3002(c)(4).
      The phrase "including the United States, any state, or any
    subdivision thereof" is deleted as unnecessary. Other amendments to
    this rule are stylistic.
      GAP Report on Rule 1019. The proposed amendments to Rule 1019(6)
    were changed to delete the deadline for filing requests for payment
    of preconversion administrative expenses that would be applicable
    in all cases, and to provide instead that the court may fix such a
    deadline. The committee note was revised to clarify that it is not
    necessary for the court to fix a deadline where there are
    insufficient assets to pay preconversion administrative expenses.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (2) is amended to include a new filing period for
    motions under Sec. 707(b) and (c) of the Code when a case is
    converted to chapter 7. The establishment of a deadline for filing
    such motions is not intended to express a position as to whether
    such motions are permitted under the Code.
      Changes Made After Publication. The Committee Note was amended by
    adding the second sentence to the Note stating explicitly that the
    rule was not intended to take a position on whether motions to
    dismiss a case under Sec. 707(b) and (c) are proper in a case that
    is converted from another chapter.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to
    substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout

-HEAD-
    Rule 1020. Small Business Chapter 11 Reorganization Case

-STATUTE-
      (a) Small Business Debtor Designation. In a voluntary chapter 11
    case, the debtor shall state in the petition whether the debtor is
    a small business debtor. In an involuntary chapter 11 case, the
    debtor shall file within 14 days after entry of the order for
    relief a statement as to whether the debtor is a small business
    debtor. Except as provided in subdivision (c), the status of the
    case as a small business case shall be in accordance with the
    debtor's statement under this subdivision, unless and until the
    court enters an order finding that the debtor's statement is
    incorrect.
      (b) Objecting to Designation. Except as provided in subdivision
    (c), the United States trustee or a party in interest may file an
    objection to the debtor's statement under subdivision (a) no later
    than 30 days after the conclusion of the meeting of creditors held
    under Sec. 341(a) of the Code, or within 30 days after any
    amendment to the statement, whichever is later.
      (c) Appointment of Committee of Unsecured Creditors. If a
    committee of unsecured creditors has been appointed under Sec.
    1102(a)(1), the case shall proceed as a small business case only
    if, and from the time when, the court enters an order determining
    that the committee has not been sufficiently active and
    representative to provide effective oversight of the debtor and
    that the debtor satisfies all the other requirements for being a
    small business. A request for a determination under this
    subdivision may be filed by the United States trustee or a party in
    interest only within a reasonable time after the failure of the
    committee to be sufficiently active and representative. The debtor
    may file a request for a determination at any time as to whether
    the committee has been sufficiently active and representative.
      (d) Procedure for Objection or Determination. Any objection or
    request for a determination under this rule shall be governed by
    Rule 9014 and served on: the debtor; the debtor's attorney; the
    United States trustee; the trustee; any committee appointed under
    Sec. 1102 or its authorized agent, or, if no committee of unsecured
    creditors has been appointed under Sec. 1102, the creditors
    included on the list filed under Rule 1007(d); and any other entity
    as the court directs.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997            
      This rule is designed to implement Secs. 1121(e) and 1125(f) that
    were added to the Code by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994.
      GAP Report on Rule 1020. The phrase "or by a later date as the
    court, for cause, may fix" at the end of the published draft was
    deleted. The general provisions on reducing or extending time
    periods under Rule 9006 will be applicable.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      Under the Code, as amended in 2005, there are no longer any
    provisions permitting or requiring a small business debtor to elect
    to be treated as a small business. Therefore, the election
    provisions in the rule are eliminated.
      The 2005 amendments to the Code include several provisions
    relating to small business cases under chapter 11. Section 101
    includes definitions of "small business debtor" and "small business
    case." The purpose of the new language in this rule is to provide a
    procedure for informing the parties, the United States trustee, and
    the court of whether the debtor is a small business debtor, and to
    provide procedures for resolving disputes regarding the proper
    characterization of the debtor. Because it is important to resolve
    such disputes early in the case, a time limit for objecting to the
    debtor's self-designation is imposed. Rule 9006(b)(1), which
    governs enlargement of time, is applicable to the time limits set
    forth in this rule.
      An important factor in determining whether the debtor is a small
    business debtor is whether the United States trustee has appointed
    a committee of unsecured creditors under Sec. 1102, and whether
    such a committee is sufficiently active and representative.
    Subdivision (c), relating to the appointment and activity of a
    committee of unsecured creditors, is designed to be consistent with
    the Code's definition of "small business debtor."

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute
    a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules,
    deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 15-day periods become 14-day periods

    Rule 1021. Health Care Business Case

-STATUTE-
      (a) Health Care Business Designation. Unless the court orders
    otherwise, if a petition in a case under chapter 7, chapter 9, or
    chapter 11 states that the debtor is a health care business, the
    case shall proceed as a case in which the debtor is a health care
    business.
      (b) Motion. The United States trustee or a party in interest may
    file a motion to determine whether the debtor is a health care
    business. The motion shall be transmitted to the United States
    trustee and served on: the debtor; the trustee; any committee
    elected under Sec. 705 or appointed under Sec. 1102 of the Code or
    its authorized agent, or, if the case is a chapter 9 municipality
    case or a chapter 11 reorganization case and no committee of
    unsecured creditors has been appointed under Sec. 1102, the
    creditors included on the list filed under Rule 1007(d); and any
    other entity as the court directs. The motion shall be governed by
    Rule 9014.

      Section 101(27A) of the Code, added by the 2005 amendments,
    defines a health care business. This rule provides procedures for
    designating the debtor as a health care business. The debtor in a
    voluntary case, or petitioning creditors in an involuntary case,
    make that designation by checking the appropriate box on the
    petition. The rule also provides procedures for resolving disputes
    regarding the status of the debtor as a health care business.

-HEAD-
    Rule 2001. Appointment of Interim Trustee Before Order for Relief
      in a Chapter 7 Liquidation Case

-STATUTE-
      (a) Appointment. At any time following the commencement of an
    involuntary liquidation case and before an order for relief, the
    court on written motion of a party in interest may order the
    appointment of an interim trustee under Sec. 303(g) of the Code.
    The motion shall set forth the necessity for the appointment and
    may be granted only after hearing on notice to the debtor, the
    petitioning creditors, the United States trustee, and other parties
    in interest as the court may designate.
      (b) Bond of Movant. An interim trustee may not be appointed under
    this rule unless the movant furnishes a bond in an amount approved
    by the court, conditioned to indemnify the debtor for costs,
    attorney's fee, expenses, and damages allowable under Sec. 303(i)
    of the Code.
      (c) Order of Appointment. The order directing the appointment of
    an interim trustee shall state the reason the appointment is
    necessary and shall specify the trustee's duties.
      (d) Turnover and Report. Following qualification of the trustee
    selected under Sec. 702 of the Code, the interim trustee, unless
    otherwise ordered, shall (1) forthwith deliver to the trustee all
    the records and property of the estate in possession or subject to
    control of the interim trustee and, (2) within 30 days thereafter
    file a final report and account.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 201. See also
    former Chapter X Rule 10-201. In conformity with title 11 of the
    United States Code, this rule substitutes "interim trustee" for
    "receiver." Subdivision (a) and (e) of Rule 201 are not included
    because the provisions contained therein are found in detail in
    Sec. 303(g) of the Code, or they are inconsistent with Sec. 701 of
    the Code. Similarly, the provisions in Rule 201(d) relating to a
    debtor's counterbond are not included because of their presence in
    Sec. 303(g).
      Subdivision (a) makes it clear that the court may not on its own
    motion order the appointment of an interim trustee before an order
    for relief is entered. Appointment may be ordered only on motion of
    a party in interest.
      Subdivision (b) requires those seeking the appointment of an
    interim trustee to furnish a bond. The bond may be the same one
    required of petitioning creditors under Sec. 303(e) of the Code to
    indemnify the debtor for damages allowed by the court under Sec.
    303(i).
      Subdivision (c) requires that the order specify which duties
    enumerated in Sec. 303(g) shall be performed by the interim
    trustee. Reference should be made to Rule 2015 for additional
    duties required of an interim trustee including keeping records and
    filing periodic reports with the court.
      Subdivision (d) requires turnover of records and property to the
    trustee selected under Sec. 702 of the Code, after qualification.
    That trustee may be the interim trustee who becomes the trustee
    because of the failure of creditors to elect one under Sec. 702(d)
    or the trustee elected by creditors under Sec. 702(b), (c).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to conform to Sec. 303(g) of the Code which
    provides that the United States trustee appoints the interim
    trustee. See Rule X-1003. This rule does not apply to the exercise
    by the court of the power to act sua sponte pursuant to Sec. 105(a)
    of the Code.

    provided in subdivisions (h), (i), (l), (p), and (q) of this rule,
    the clerk, or some other person as the court may direct, shall give
    the debtor, the trustee, all creditors and indenture trustees at
    least 21 days' notice by mail of:
        (1) the meeting of creditors under Sec. 341 or Sec. 1104(b) of
      the Code, which notice, unless the court orders otherwise, shall
      include the debtor's employer identification number, social
      security number, and any other federal taxpayer identification
      number;
        (2) a proposed use, sale, or lease of property of the estate
      other than in the ordinary course of business, unless the court
      for cause shown shortens the time or directs another method of
      giving notice;
        (3) the hearing on approval of a compromise or settlement of a
      controversy other than approval of an agreement pursuant to Rule
      4001(d), unless the court for cause shown directs that notice not
      be sent;
        (4) in a chapter 7 liquidation, a chapter 11 reorganization
      case, or a chapter 12 family farmer debt adjustment case, the
      hearing on the dismissal of the case or the conversion of the
      case to another chapter, unless the hearing is under Sec.
      707(a)(3) or Sec. 707(b) or is on dismissal of the case for
      failure to pay the filing fee;
        (5) the time fixed to accept or reject a proposed modification
      of a plan;
        (6) a hearing on any entity's request for compensation or
      reimbursement of expenses if the request exceeds $1,000;
        (7) the time fixed for filing proofs of claims pursuant to Rule
      3003(c); and
        (8) the time fixed for filing objections and the hearing to
      consider confirmation of a chapter 12 plan.

      (b) Twenty-Eight-Day Notices to Parties in Interest. Except as
    provided in subdivision (l) of this rule, the clerk, or some other
    person as the court may direct, shall give the debtor, the trustee,
    all creditors and indenture trustees not less than 28 days' notice
    by mail of the time fixed (1) for filing objections and the hearing
    to consider approval of a disclosure statement or, under Sec.
    1125(f), to make a final determination whether the plan provides
    adequate information so that a separate disclosure statement is not
    necessary; and (2) for filing objections and the hearing to
    consider confirmation of a chapter 9, chapter 11, or chapter 13
    plan.
      (c) Content of Notice.
        (1) Proposed Use, Sale, or Lease of Property. Subject to Rule
      6004, the notice of a proposed use, sale, or lease of property
      required by subdivision (a)(2) of this rule shall include the
      time and place of any public sale, the terms and conditions of
      any private sale and the time fixed for filing objections. The
      notice of a proposed use, sale, or lease of property, including
      real estate, is sufficient if it generally describes the
      property. The notice of a proposed sale or lease of personally
      identifiable information under Sec. 363(b)(1) of the Code shall
      state whether the sale is consistent with any policy prohibiting
      the transfer of the information.
        (2) Notice of Hearing on Compensation. The notice of a hearing
      on an application for compensation or reimbursement of expenses
      required by subdivision (a)(6) of this rule shall identify the
      applicant and the amounts requested.
        (3) Notice of Hearing on Confirmation When Plan Provides for an
      Injunction. If a plan provides for an injunction against conduct
      not otherwise enjoined under the Code, the notice required under
      Rule 2002(b)(2) shall:
          (A) include in conspicuous language (bold, italic, or
        underlined text) a statement that the plan proposes an
        injunction;
          (B) describe briefly the nature of the injunction; and
          (C) identify the entities that would be subject to the
        injunction.

      (d) Notice to Equity Security Holders. In a chapter 11
    reorganization case, unless otherwise ordered by the court, the
    clerk, or some other person as the court may direct, shall in the
    manner and form directed by the court give notice to all equity
    security holders of (1) the order for relief; (2) any meeting of
    equity security holders held pursuant to Sec. 341 of the Code; (3)
    the hearing on the proposed sale of all or substantially all of the
    debtor's assets; (4) the hearing on the dismissal or conversion of
    a case to another chapter; (5) the time fixed for filing objections
    to and the hearing to consider approval of a disclosure statement;
    (6) the time fixed for filing objections to and the hearing to
    consider confirmation of a plan; and (7) the time fixed to accept
    or reject a proposed modification of a plan.
      (e) Notice of No Dividend. In a chapter 7 liquidation case, if it
    appears from the schedules that there are no assets from which a
    dividend can be paid, the notice of the meeting of creditors may
    include a statement to that effect; that it is unnecessary to file
    claims; and that if sufficient assets become available for the
    payment of a dividend, further notice will be given for the filing
    of claims.
      (f) Other Notices. Except as provided in subdivision (l) of this
    rule, the clerk, or some other person as the court may direct,
    shall give the debtor, all creditors, and indenture trustees notice
    by mail of:
        (1) the order for relief;
        (2) the dismissal or the conversion of the case to another
      chapter, or the suspension of proceedings under Sec. 305;
        (3) the time allowed for filing claims pursuant to Rule 3002;
        (4) the time fixed for filing a complaint objecting to the
      debtor's discharge pursuant to Sec. 727 of the Code as provided
      in Rule 4004;
        (5) the time fixed for filing a complaint to determine the
      dischargeability of a debt pursuant to Sec. 523 of the Code as
      provided in Rule 4007;
        (6) the waiver, denial, or revocation of a discharge as
      provided in Rule 4006;
        (7) entry of an order confirming a chapter 9, 11, or 12 plan;
        (8) a summary of the trustee's final report in a chapter 7 case
      if the net proceeds realized exceed $1,500;
        (9) a notice under Rule 5008 regarding the presumption of
      abuse;
        (10) a statement under Sec. 704(b)(1) as to whether the
      debtor's case would be presumed to be an abuse under Sec. 707(b);
      and
        (11) the time to request a delay in the entry of the discharge
      under Secs. 1141(d)(5)(C), 1228(f), and 1328(h). Notice of the
      time fixed for accepting or rejecting a plan pursuant to Rule
      3017(c) shall be given in accordance with Rule 3017(d).

      (g) Addressing Notices.
        (1) Notices required to be mailed under Rule 2002 to a
      creditor, indenture trustee, or equity security holder shall be
      addressed as such entity or an authorized agent has directed in
      its last request filed in the particular case. For the purposes
      of this subdivision - 
          (A) a proof of claim filed by a creditor or indenture trustee
        that designates a mailing address constitutes a filed request
        to mail notices to that address, unless a notice of no dividend
        has been given under Rule 2002(e) and a later notice of
        possible dividend under Rule 3002(c)(5) has not been given; and
          (B) a proof of interest filed by an equity security holder
        that designates a mailing address constitutes a filed request
        to mail notices to that address.

        (2) Except as provided in Sec. 342(f) of the Code, if a
      creditor or indenture trustee has not filed a request designating
      a mailing address under Rule 2002(g)(1) or Rule 5003(e), the
      notices shall be mailed to the address shown on the list of
      creditors or schedule of liabilities, whichever is filed later.
      If an equity security holder has not filed a request designating
      a mailing address under Rule 2002(g)(1) or Rule 5003(e), the
      notices shall be mailed to the address shown on the list of
      equity security holders.
        (3) If a list or schedule filed under Rule 1007 includes the
      name and address of a legal representative of an infant or
      incompetent person, and a person other than that representative
      files a request or proof of claim designating a name and mailing
      address that differs from the name and address of the
      representative included in the list or schedule, unless the court
      orders otherwise, notices under Rule 2002 shall be mailed to the
      representative included in the list or schedules and to the name
      and address designated in the request or proof of claim.
        (4) Notwithstanding Rule 2002(g)(1)-(3), an entity and a notice
      provider may agree that when the notice provider is directed by
      the court to give a notice, the notice provider shall give the
      notice to the entity in the manner agreed to and at the address
      or addresses the entity supplies to the notice provider. That
      address is conclusively presumed to be a proper address for the
      notice. The notice provider's failure to use the supplied address
      does not invalidate any notice that is otherwise effective under
      applicable law.
        (5) A creditor may treat a notice as not having been brought to
      the creditor's attention under Sec. 342(g)(1) only if, prior to
      issuance of the notice, the creditor has filed a statement that
      designates the name and address of the person or organizational
      subdivision of the creditor responsible for receiving notices
      under the Code, and that describes the procedures established by
      the creditor to cause such notices to be delivered to the
      designated person or subdivision.

      (h) Notices to Creditors Whose Claims are Filed. In a chapter 7
    case, after 90 days following the first date set for the meeting of
    creditors under Sec. 341 of the Code, the court may direct that all
    notices required by subdivision (a) of this rule be mailed only to
    the debtor, the trustee, all indenture trustees, creditors that
    hold claims for which proofs of claim have been filed, and
    creditors, if any, that are still permitted to file claims by
    reason of an extension granted pursuant to Rule 3002(c)(1) or
    (c)(2). In a case where notice of insufficient assets to pay a
    dividend has been given to creditors pursuant to subdivision (e) of
    this rule, after 90 days following the mailing of a notice of the
    time for filing claims pursuant to Rule 3002(c)(5), the court may
    direct that notices be mailed only to the entities specified in the
    preceding sentence.
      (i) Notices to Committees. Copies of all notices required to be
    mailed pursuant to this rule shall be mailed to the committees
    elected under Sec. 705 or appointed under Sec. 1102 of the Code or
    to their authorized agents. Notwithstanding the foregoing
    subdivisions, the court may order that notices required by
    subdivision (a)(2), (3) and (6) of this rule be transmitted to the
    United States trustee and be mailed only to the committees elected
    under Sec. 705 or appointed under Sec. 1102 of the Code or to their
    authorized agents and to the creditors and equity security holders
    who serve on the trustee or debtor in possession and file a request
    that all notices be mailed to them. A committee appointed under
    Sec. 1114 shall receive copies of all notices required by
    subdivisions (a)(1), (a)(5), (b), (f)(2), and (f)(7), and such
    other notices as the court may direct.
      (j) Notices to the United States. Copies of notices required to
    be mailed to all creditors under this rule shall be mailed (1) in a
    chapter 11 reorganization case, to the Securities and Exchange
    Commission at any place the Commission designates, if the
    Commission has filed either a notice of appearance in the case or a
    written request to receive notices; (2) in a commodity broker case,
    to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission at Washington, D.C.;
    (3) in a chapter 11 case, to the Internal Revenue Service at its
    address set out in the register maintained under Rule 5003(e) for
    the district in which the case is pending; (4) if the papers in the
    case disclose a debt to the United States other than for taxes, to
    the United States attorney for the district in which the case is
    pending and to the department, agency, or instrumentality of the
    United States through which the debtor became indebted; or (5) if
    the filed papers disclose a stock interest of the United States, to
    the Secretary of the Treasury at Washington, D.C.
      (k) Notices to United States Trustee. Unless the case is a
    chapter 9 municipality case or unless the United States trustee
    requests otherwise, the clerk, or some other person as the court
    may direct, shall transmit to the United States trustee notice of
    the matters described in subdivisions (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4),
    (a)(8), (b), (f)(1), (f)(2), (f)(4), (f)(6), (f)(7), (f)(8), and
    (q) of this rule and notice of hearings on all applications for
    compensation or reimbursement of expenses. Notices to the United
    States trustee shall be transmitted within the time prescribed in
    subdivision (a) or (b) of this rule. The United States trustee
    shall also receive notice of any other matter if such notice is
    requested by the United States trustee or ordered by the court.
    Nothing in these rules requires the clerk or any other person to
    transmit to the United States trustee any notice, schedule, report,
    application or other document in a case under the Securities
    Investor Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78aaa et. seq.
      (l) Notice by Publication. The court may order notice by
    publication if it finds that notice by mail is impracticable or
    that it is desirable to supplement the notice.
      (m) Orders Designating Matter of Notices. The court may from time
    to time enter orders designating the matters in respect to which,
    the entity to whom, and the form and manner in which notices shall
    be sent except as otherwise provided by these rules.
      (n) Caption. The caption of every notice given under this rule
    shall comply with Rule 1005. The caption of every notice required
    to be given by the debtor to a creditor shall include the
    information required to be in the notice by Sec. 342(c) of the
    Code.
      (o) Notice of Order for Relief in Consumer Case. In a voluntary
    case commenced by an individual debtor whose debts are primarily
    consumer debts, the clerk or some other person as the court may
    direct shall give the trustee and all creditors notice by mail of
    the order for relief within 21 days from the date thereof.
      (p) Notice to a Creditor With a Foreign Address.
        (1) If, at the request of the United States trustee or a party
      in interest, or on its own initiative, the court finds that a
      notice mailed within the time prescribed by these rules would not
      be sufficient to give a creditor with a foreign address to which
      notices under these rules are mailed reasonable notice under the
      circumstances, the court may order that the notice be
      supplemented with notice by other means or that the time
      prescribed for the notice by mail be enlarged.
        (2) Unless the court for cause orders otherwise, a creditor
      with a foreign address to which notices under this rule are
      mailed shall be given at least 30 days' notice of the time fixed
      for filing a proof of claim under Rule 3002(c) or Rule 3003(c).
        (3) Unless the court for cause orders otherwise, the mailing
      address of a creditor with a foreign address shall be determined
      under Rule 2002(g).

      (q) Notice of Petition for Recognition of Foreign Proceeding and
    of Court's Intention to Communicate With Foreign Courts and Foreign
    Representatives.
        (1) Notice of Petition for Recognition. The clerk, or some
      other person as the court may direct, shall forthwith give the
      debtor, all persons or bodies authorized to administer foreign
      proceedings of the debtor, all entities against whom provisional
      relief is being sought under Sec. 1519 of the Code, all parties
      to litigation pending in the United States in which the debtor is
      a party at the time of the filing of the petition, and such other
      entities as the court may direct, at least 21 days' notice by
      mail of the hearing on the petition for recognition of a foreign
      proceeding. The notice shall state whether the petition seeks
      recognition as a foreign main proceeding or foreign nonmain
      proceeding.
        (2) Notice of Court's Intention to Communicate with Foreign
      Courts and Foreign Representatives. The clerk, or some other
      person as the court may direct, shall give the debtor, all
      persons or bodies authorized to administer foreign proceedings of
      the debtor, all entities against whom provisional relief is being
      sought under Sec. 1519 of the Code, all parties to litigation
      pending in the United States in which the debtor is a party at
      the time of the filing of the petition, and such other entities
      as the court may direct, notice by mail of the court's intention
      to communicate with a foreign court or foreign representative.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Some of the notices required by this rule may be given either by
    the clerk or as the court may otherwise direct. For example, the
    court may order the trustee or debtor in possession to transmit one
    or more of the notices required by this rule, such as, notice of a
    proposed sale of property. See Sec. 363(b) of the Code. When
    publication of notices is required or desirable, reference should
    be made to Rule 9008.
      Notice of the order for relief is required to be given by Sec.
    342 of the Code and by subdivision (f)(1) of this rule. That notice
    may be combined with the notice of the meeting of creditors as
    indicated in Official Form No. 16, the notice and order of the
    meeting of creditors.
      Subdivision (a) sets forth the requirement that 20 days notice be
    given of the significant events in a case under the Bankruptcy
    Code. The former Act and Rules provided a ten day notice in
    bankruptcy and Chapter XI cases, and a 20 day notice in a Chapter X
    case. This rule generally makes uniform the 20 day notice provision
    except that subdivision (b) contains a 25 day period for certain
    events in a chapter 9, 11, or 13 case. Generally, Rule 9006 permits
    reduction of time periods. Since notice by mail is complete on
    mailing, the requirement of subdivision (a) is satisfied if the
    notices are deposited in the mail at least 20 days before the
    event. See Rule 9006(e). The exceptions referred to in the
    introductory phrase include the modifications in the notice
    procedure permitted by subdivision (h) as to non-filing creditors,
    subdivision (i) as to cases where a committee is functioning, and
    subdivision (k) where compliance with subdivision (a) is
    impracticable.
      The notice of a proposed sale affords creditors an opportunity to
    object to the sale and raise a dispute for the court's attention.
    Section 363(b) of the Code permits the trustee or debtor in
    possession to sell property, other than in the ordinary course of
    business, only after notice and hearing. If no objection is raised
    after notice, Sec. 102(1) provides that there need not be an actual
    hearing. Thus, absent objection, there would be no court
    involvement with respect to a trustee's sale. Once an objection is
    raised, only the court may pass on it.
      Prior to the Code the court could shorten the notice period for a
    proposed sale of property or dispense with notice. This subdivision
    (a), permits the 20 day period to be shortened in appropriate
    circumstances but the rule does not contain a provision allowing
    the court to dispense with notice. The rule is thus consistent with
    the Code, Secs. 363(b) and 102(1)(A) of the Code. See 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 2075. It may be necessary, in certain circumstances, however,
    to use a method of notice other than mail. Subdivision (a)(2) vests
    the court with discretion, on cause shown, to order a different
    method. Reference should also be made to Rule 6004 which allows a
    different type of notice of proposed sales when the property is of
    little value.
      Notice of the hearing on an application for compensation or
    reimbursement of expenses totalling $100 or less need not be given.
    In chapter 13 cases relatively small amounts are sometimes allowed
    for post-confirmation services and it would not serve a useful
    purpose to require advance notice.
      Subdivision (b) is similar to subdivision (a) but lengthens the
    notice time to 25 days with respect to those events particularly
    significant in chapter 9, 11 and 13 cases. The additional time may
    be necessary to formulate objections to a disclosure statement or
    confirmation of a plan and preparation for the hearing on approval
    of the disclosure statement or confirmation. The disclosure
    statement and hearing thereon is only applicable in chapter 9 cases
    (Sec. 901(a) of the Code), and chapter 11 cases (Sec. 1125 of the
    Code).
      Subdivision (c) specifies certain matters that should be included
    in the notice of a proposed sale of property and notice of the
    hearing on an application for allowances. Rule 6004 fixes the time
    within which parties in interest may file objections to a proposed
    sale of property.
      Subdivision (d) relates exclusively to the notices given to
    equity security holders in chapter 11 cases. Under chapter 11, a
    plan may impair the interests of the debtor's shareholders or a
    plan may be a relatively simple restructuring of unsecured debt. In
    some cases, it is necessary that equity interest holders receive
    various notices and in other cases there is no purpose to be
    served. This subdivision indicates that the court is not mandated
    to order notices but rather that the matter should be treated with
    some flexibility. The court may decide whether notice is to be
    given and how it is to be given. Under Sec. 341(b) of the Code, a
    meeting of equity security holders is not required in each case,
    only when it is ordered by the court. Thus subdivision (d)(2)
    requires notice only when the court orders a meeting.
      In addition to the notices specified in this subdivision, there
    may be other events or matters arising in a case as to which equity
    security holders should receive notice. These are situations left
    to determination by the court.
      Subdivision (e), authorizing a notice of the apparent
    insufficiency of assets for the payment of any dividend, is
    correlated with Rule 3002(c)(5), which provides for the issuance of
    an additional notice to creditors if the possibility of a payment
    later materializes.
      Subdivision (f) provides for the transmission of other notices to
    which no time period applies. Clause (1) requires notice of the
    order for relief; this complements the mandate of Sec. 342 of the
    Code requiring such notice as is appropriate of the order for
    relief. This notice may be combined with the notice of the meeting
    of creditors to avoid the necessity of more than one mailing. See
    Official Form No. 16, notice of meeting of creditors.
      Subdivision (g) recognizes that an agent authorized to receive
    notices for a creditor may, without a court order, designate where
    notices to the creditor he represents should be addressed. Agent
    includes an officer of a corporation, an attorney at law, or an
    attorney in fact if the requisite authority has been given him. It
    should be noted that Official Forms Nos. 17 and 18 do not include
    an authorization of the holder of a power of attorney to receive
    notices for the creditor. Neither these forms nor this rule carries
    any implication that such an authorization may not be given in a
    power of attorney or that a request for notices to be addressed to
    both the creditor or his duly authorized agent may not be filed.
      Subdivision (h). After the time for filing claims has expired in
    a chapter 7 case, creditors who have not filed their claims in
    accordance with Rule 3002(c) are not entitled to share in the
    estate except as they may come within the special provisions of
    Sec. 726 of the Code or Rule 3002(c)(6). The elimination of notice
    to creditors who have no recognized stake in the estate may permit
    economies in time and expense. Reduction of the list of creditors
    to receive notices under this subdivision is discretionary. This
    subdivision does not apply to the notice of the meeting of
    creditors.
      Subdivision (i) contains a list of matters of which notice may be
    given a creditors' committee or to its authorized agent in lieu of
    notice to the creditors. Such notice may serve every practical
    purpose of a notice to all the creditors and save delay and
    expense. In re Schulte-United, Inc., 59 F.2d 553, 561 (8th Cir.
    1932).
      Subdivision (j). The premise for the requirement that the
    district director of internal revenue receive copies of notices
    that all creditors receive in a chapter 11 case is that every
    debtor is potentially a tax debtor of the United States. Notice to
    the district director alerts him to the possibility that a tax
    debtor's estate is about to be liquidated or reorganized and that
    the debtor may be discharged. When other indebtedness to the United
    States is indicated, the United States attorney is notified as the
    person in the best position to protect the interests of the
    government. In addition, the provision requires notice by mail to
    the head of any department, agency, or instrumentality of the
    United States through whose action the debtor became indebted to
    the United States. This rule is not intended to preclude a local
    rule from requiring a state or local tax authority to receive some
    or all of the notices to creditors under these rules.
      Subdivision (k) specifies two kinds of situations in which notice
    by publication may be appropriate: (1) when notice by mail is
    impracticable; and (2) when notice by mail alone is less than
    adequate. Notice by mail may be impracticable when, for example,
    the debtor has disappeared or his records have been destroyed and
    the names and addresses of his creditors are unavailable, or when
    the number of creditors with nominal claims is very large and the
    estate to be distributed may be insufficient to defray the costs of
    issuing the notices. Supplementing notice by mail is also indicated
    when the debtor's records are incomplete or inaccurate and it is
    reasonable to believe that publication may reach some of the
    creditors who would otherwise be missed. Rule 9008 applies when the
    court directs notice by publication under this rule. Neither clause
    (2) of subdivision (a) nor subdivision (k) of this rule is
    concerned with the publication of advertisement to the general
    public of a sale of property of the estate at public auction under
    Rule 6004(b). See 3 Collier, Bankruptcy 522-23 (14th ed. 1971); 4B
    id. 1165-67 (1967); 2 id. &#182; 363.03 (15th ed. 1981).
      Subdivision (m). Inclusion in notices to creditors of information
    as to other names used by the debtor as required by Rule 1005 will
    assist them in the preparation of their proofs of claim and in
    deciding whether to file a complaint objecting to the debtor's
    discharge. Additional names may be listed by the debtor on his
    statement of affairs when he did not file the petition. The mailing
    of notices should not be postponed to await a delayed filing of the
    statement of financial affairs.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to provide that notice of a hearing on
    an application for compensation must be given only when the amount
    requested is in excess of $500.
      Subdivision (d). A new notice requirement is added as clause (3).
    When a proposed sale is of all or substantially all of the debtor's
    assets, it is appropriate that equity security holders be given
    notice of the proposed sale. The clauses of subdivision (d) are
    renumbered to accommodate this addition.
      Subdivision (f). Clause (7) is eliminated. Mailing of a copy of
    the discharge order is governed by Rule 4004(g).
      Subdivision (g) is amended to relieve the clerk of the duty to
    mail notices to the address shown in a proof of claim when a notice
    of no dividend has been given pursuant to Rule 2002. This amendment
    avoids the necessity of the clerk searching proofs of claim which
    are filed in no dividend cases to ascertain whether a different
    address is shown.
      Subdivision (n) was enacted by Sec. 321 of the 1984 amendments.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a)(3) is amended to exclude compromise or settlement
    agreements concerning adequate protection or which modify or
    terminate the automatic stay, provide for use of cash collateral,
    or create a senior or equal lien on collateral to obtain credit.
    Notice requirements relating to approval of such agreements are
    governed by Rule 4001(d).
      Subdivision (a)(5) is amended to include a hearing on dismissal
    or conversion of a chapter 12 case. This subdivision does not apply
    when a hearing is not required. It is also amended to avoid the
    necessity of giving notice to all creditors of a hearing on the
    dismissal of a consumer debtor's case based on substantial abuse of
    chapter 7. Such hearings on dismissal under Sec. 707(b) of the Code
    are governed by Rule 1017(e).
      Subdivision (a)(9) is added to provide for notice of the time
    fixed for filing objections and the hearing to consider
    confirmation of a plan in a chapter 12 case. Section 1224 of the
    Code requires "expedited notice" of the confirmation hearing in a
    chapter 12 case and requires that the hearing be concluded not
    later than 45 days after the filing of the plan unless the time is
    extended for cause. This amendment establishes 20 days as the
    notice period. The court may shorten this time on its own motion or
    on motion of a party in interest. The notice includes both the date
    of the hearing and the date for filing objections, and must be
    accompanied by a copy of the plan or a summary of the plan in
    accordance with Rule 3015(d).
      Subdivision (b) is amended to delete as unnecessary the
    references to subdivisions (h) and (i).
      Subdivision (d) does not require notice to equity security
    holders in a chapter 12 case. The procedural burden of requiring
    such notice is outweighed by the likelihood that all equity
    security holders of a family farmer will be informed of the
    progress of the case without formal notice. Subdivision (d) is
    amended to recognize that the United States trustee may convene a
    meeting of equity security holders pursuant to Sec. 341(b).
      Subdivision (f)(2) is amended and subdivision (f)(4) is deleted
    to require notice of any conversion of the case, whether the
    conversion is by court order or is effectuated by the debtor filing
    a notice of conversion pursuant to Secs. 1208(a) or 1307(a).
    Subdivision (f)(8), renumbered (f)(7), is amended to include entry
    of an order confirming a chapter 12 plan. Subdivision (f)(9) is
    amended to increase the amount to $1,500.
      Subdivisions (g) and (j) are amended to delete the words "with
    the court" and subdivision (i) is amended to delete the words "with
    the clerk" because these phrases are unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a)
    and 9001(3).
      Subdivision (i) is amended to require that the United States
    trustee receive notices required by subdivision (a)(2), (3) and (7)
    of this rule notwithstanding a court order limiting such notice to
    committees and to creditors and equity security holders who request
    such notices. Subdivision (i) is amended further to include
    committees elected pursuant to Sec. 705 of the Code and to provide
    that committees of retired employees appointed in chapter 11 cases
    receive certain notices.
      Subdivision (k) is derived from Rule X-1008. The administrative
    functions of the United States trustee pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    586(a) and standing to be heard on issues under Sec. 307 and other
    sections of the Code require that the United States trustee be
    informed of developments and issues in every case except chapter 9
    cases. The rule omits those notices described in subdivision (a)(1)
    because a meeting of creditors is convened only by the United
    States trustee, and those notices described in subdivision (a)(4)
    (date fixed for filing claims against a surplus), subdivision
    (a)(6) (time fixed to accept or reject proposed modification of a
    plan), subdivision (a)(8) (time fixed for filing proofs of claims
    in chapter 11 cases), subdivision (f)(3) (time fixed for filing
    claims in chapter 7, 12, and 13 cases), and subdivision (f)(5)
    (time fixed for filing complaint to determine dischargeability of
    debt) because these notices do not relate to matters that generally
    involve the United States trustee. Nonetheless, the omission of
    these notices does not prevent the United States trustee from
    receiving such notices upon request. The United States trustee also
    receives notice of hearings on applications for compensation or
    reimbursement without regard to the $500 limitation contained in
    subdivision (a)(7) of this rule. This rule is intended to be
    flexible in that it permits the United States trustee in a
    particular judicial district to request notices in certain
    categories, and to request not to receive notices in other
    categories, when the practice in that district makes that

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (j) is amended to avoid the necessity of sending an
    additional notice to the Washington, D.C. address of the Securities
    and Exchange Commission if the Commission prefers to have notices
    sent only to a local office. This change also clarifies that
    notices required to be mailed pursuant to this rule must be sent to
    the Securities and Exchange Commission only if it has filed a
    notice of appearance or has filed a written request. Other
    amendments are stylistic and make no substantive change.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1996 AMENDMENT       
      Paragraph (a)(4) is abrogated to conform to the abrogation of
    Rule 3002(c)(6). The remaining paragraphs of subdivision (a) are
    renumbered, and references to these paragraphs contained in other
    subdivisions of this rule are amended accordingly.
      Paragraph (f)(8) is amended so that a summary of the trustee's
    final account, which is prepared after distribution of property,
    does not have to be mailed to the debtor, all creditors, and
    indenture trustees in a chapter 7 case. Parties are sufficiently
    protected by receiving a summary of the trustee's final report that
    informs parties of the proposed distribution of property.
      Subdivision (h) is amended (1) to provide that an order under
    this subdivision may not be issued if a notice of no dividend is
    given pursuant to Rule 2002(e) and the time for filing claims has
    not expired as provided in Rule 3002(c)(5); (2) to clarify that
    notices required to be mailed by subdivision (a) to parties other
    than creditors must be mailed to those entities despite an order
    issued pursuant to subdivision (h); (3) to provide that if the
    court, pursuant to Rule 3002(c)(1) or 3002(c)(2), has granted an
    extension of time to file a proof of claim, the creditor for whom
    the extension has been granted must continue to receive notices
    despite an order issued pursuant to subdivision (h); and (4) to
    delete references to subdivision (a)(4) and Rule 3002(c)(6), which
    have been abrogated.
      Other amendments to this rule are stylistic.
      GAP Report on Rule 2002. No changes since publication, except for
    stylistic changes and the correction of a typographical error in
    the committee note.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       
      Paragraph (a)(1) is amended to include notice of a meeting of
    creditors convened under Sec. 1104(b) of the Code for the purpose
    of electing a trustee in a chapter 11 case. The court for cause
    shown may order the 20-day period reduced pursuant to Rule
    9006(c)(1).
      Subdivision (n) is amended to conform to the 1994 amendment to
    Sec. 342 of the Code. As provided in Sec. 342(c), the failure of a
    notice given by the debtor to a creditor to contain the information
    required by Sec. 342(c) does not invalidate the legal effect of the
    notice.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1999 AMENDMENT             
      Paragraph (a)(4) is amended to conform to the amendments to Rule
    1017. If the United States trustee files a motion to dismiss a case
    for the debtor's failure to file the list of creditors, schedules,
    or the statement of financial affairs within the time specified in
    Sec. 707(a)(3), the amendments to this rule and to Rule 1017
    eliminate the requirement that all creditors receive notice of the
    hearing.
      Paragraph (a)(4) is amended further to conform to Rule 1017(b),
    which requires that notice of the hearing on dismissal of a case
    for failure to pay the filing fee be served on only the debtor and
    the trustee.
      Paragraph (f)(2) is amended to provide for notice of the
    suspension of proceedings under Sec. 305.
      GAP Report on Rule 2002. No changes since publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      Paragraph (a)(6) is amended to increase the dollar amount from
    $500 to $1,000. The amount was last amended in 1987, when it was
    changed from $100 to $500. The amendment also clarifies that the
    notice is required only if a particular entity is requesting more
    than $1,000 as compensation or reimbursement of expenses. If
    several professionals are requesting compensation or reimbursement,
    and only one hearing will be held on all applications, notice under
    paragraph (a)(6) is required only with respect to the entities that
    have requested more than $1,000. If each applicant requests $1,000
    or less, notice under paragraph (a)(6) is not required even though
    the aggregate amount of all applications to be considered at the
    hearing is more than $1,000.
      If a particular entity had filed prior applications or had
    received compensation or reimbursement of expenses at an earlier
    time in the case, the amounts previously requested or awarded are
    not considered when determining whether the present application
    exceeds $1,000 for the purpose of applying this rule.
      GAP Report on Rule 2002(a). No changes since publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2001 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (c)(3) is added to assure that parties given notice
    of a hearing to consider confirmation of a plan under subdivision
    (b) are given adequate notice of an injunction provided for in the
    plan if it would enjoin conduct that is not otherwise enjoined by
    operation of the Code. The validity and effect of any injunction
    provided for in a plan are substantive law matters that are beyond
    the scope of these rules.
      The notice requirement of subdivision (c)(3) is not applicable to
    an injunction contained in a plan if it is substantially the same
    as an injunction provided under the Code. For example, if a plan
    contains an injunction against acts to collect a discharged debt
    from the debtor, Rule 2002(c)(3) would not apply because that
    conduct would be enjoined under Sec. 524(a)(2) upon the debtor's
    discharge. But if a plan provides that creditors will be enjoined
    from asserting claims against persons who are not debtors in the
    case, the notice of the confirmation hearing must include the
    information required under Rule 2002(c)(3) because that conduct
    would not be enjoined by operation of the Code. See Sec. 524(e).
      The requirement that the notice identify the entities that would
    be subject to the injunction requires only reasonable
    identification under the circumstances. If the entities that would
    be subject to the injunction cannot be identified by name, the
    notice may describe them by class or category if reasonable under
    the circumstances. For example, it may be sufficient for the notice
    to identify the entities as "all creditors of the debtor" and for
    the notice to be published in a manner that satisfies due process
    requirements.
      Subdivision (g) has been revised to clarify that where a creditor
    or indenture trustee files both a proof of claim which includes a
    mailing address and a separate request designating a mailing
    address, the last paper filed determines the proper address. The
    amendments also clarify that a request designating a mailing
    address is effective only with respect to a particular case.
      Under Rule 2002(g), a duly filed proof of claim is considered a
    request designating a mailing address if a notice of no dividend
    has been given under Rule 2002(e), but has been superseded by a
    subsequent notice of possible dividend under Rule 3002(c)(5). A
    duly filed proof of interest is considered a request designating a
    mailing address of an equity security holder.
      Rule 2002(g)(3) is added to assure that notices to an infant or
    incompetent person under this rule are mailed to the appropriate
    guardian or other legal representative. Under Rule 1007(m), if the
    debtor knows that a creditor is an infant or incompetent person,
    the debtor is required to include in the list and schedule of
    creditors the name and address of the person upon whom process
    would be served in an adversary proceeding in accordance with Rule
    7004(b)(2). If the infant or incompetent person, or another person,
    files a request or proof of claim designating a different name and
    mailing address, the notices would have to be mailed to both names
    and addresses until the court resolved the issue as to the proper
    mailing address.
      The other amendments to Rule 2002(g) are stylistic.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. In Rule 2002(c)(3),
    the word "highlighted" was replaced with "underlined" because
    highlighted documents are difficult to scan electronically for
    inclusion in the clerks' files. The Committee Note was revised to
    put in a more prominent position the statement that the validity
    and effect of any injunction provided for in a plan are substantive
    matters beyond the scope of the rules.
      In Rule 2002(g), no changes were made.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a)(1) of the rule is amended to direct the clerk or
    other person giving notice of the Sec. 341 or Sec. 1104(b) meeting
    of creditors to include the debtor's full social security number on
    the notice. Official Form 9, the form of the notice of the meeting
    of creditors that will become a part of the court's file in the
    case, will include only the last four digits of the debtor's social
    security number. This rule, however, directs the clerk to include
    the full social security number on the notice that is served on the
    creditors and other identified parties, unless the court orders
    otherwise in a particular case. This will enable creditors and
    other parties in interest who are in possession of the debtor's
    social security number to verify the debtor's identity and proceed
    accordingly. The filed Official Form 9, however, will not include
    the debtor's full social security number. This will prevent the
    full social security number from becoming a part of the court's
    file in the case, and the number will not be included in the
    court's electronic records. Creditors who already have the debtor's
    social security number will be able to verify the existence of a
    case under the debtor's social security number, but any person
    searching the electronic case files without the number will not be
    able to acquire the debtor's social security number.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The rule amendment
    was made in response to concerns of both private creditors and
    taxing authorities that truncating the social security number of a
    debtor to the last four digits would unduly hamper their ability to
    identify the debtor and govern their actions accordingly.
    Therefore, the Advisory Committee amended Rule 2002 to require the
    clerk to include the debtor's full social security number on the
    notice informing creditors of the Sec. 341 meeting and other
    significant deadlines in the case. This is essentially a
    continuation of the practice under the current rules, and the
    amendment is necessary because of the amendment to Rule 1005 that
    restricts publication of the social security number on the caption
    of the petition to the final four digits of the number.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2004 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to reflect that the structure of the Internal
    Revenue Service no longer includes a District Director. Thus,
    rather than sending notice to the District Director, the rule now
    requires that the notices be sent to the location designated by the
    Service and set out in the register of addresses maintained by the
    clerk under Rule 5003(e). The other change is stylistic.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             
      A new paragraph (g)(4) is inserted in the rule. The new paragraph
    authorizes an entity and a notice provider to agree that the notice
    provider will give notices to the entity at the address or
    addresses set out in their agreement. Rule 9001(9) sets out the
    definition of a notice provider.
      The business of many entities is national in scope, and
    technology currently exists to direct the transmission of notice
    (both electronically and in paper form) to those entities in an
    accurate and much more efficient manner than by sending individual
    notices to the same creditor by separate mailings. The rule
    authorizes an entity and a notice provider to determine the manner
    of the service as well as to set the address or addresses to which
    the notices must be sent. For example, they could agree that all
    notices sent by the notice provider to the entity must be sent to a
    single, nationwide electronic or postal address. They could also
    establish local or regional addresses to which notices would be
    sent in matters pending in specific districts. Since the entity and
    notice provider also can agree on the date of the commencement of
    service under the agreement, there is no need to set a date in the
    rule after which notices would have to be sent to the address or
    addresses that the entity establishes. Furthermore, since the
    entity supplies the address to the notice provider, use of that
    address is conclusively presumed to be proper. Nonetheless, if that
    address is not used, the notice still may be effective if the
    notice is otherwise effective under applicable law. This is the
    same treatment given under Rule 5003(e) to notices sent to
    governmental units at addresses other than those set out in that
    register of addresses.
      The remaining subdivisions of Rule 2002(g) continue to govern the
    addressing of a notice that is not sent pursuant to an agreement
    described in Rule 2002(g)(4).
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes since
    publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (b) is amended to provide for 25 days' notice of the
    time for the court to make a final determination whether the plan
    in a small business case can serve as a disclosure statement.
    Conditional approval of a disclosure statement in a small business
    case is governed by Rule 3017.1 and does not require 25 days'
    notice. The court may consider this matter in a hearing combined
    with the confirmation hearing in a small business case.
      Because of the requirements of Rule 6004(g), subdivision (c)(1)
    is amended to require that a trustee leasing or selling personally
    identifiable information under Sec. 363(b)(1)(A) or (B) of the
    Code, as amended in 2005, include in the notice of the lease or
    sale transaction a statement as to whether the lease or sale is
    consistent with a policy prohibiting the transfer of the
    information.
      Subdivisions (f)(9) and (10) are new. They reflect the 2005
    amendments to Secs. 342(d) and 704(b) of the Code. Section 342(d)
    requires the clerk to give notice to creditors shortly after the
    commencement of the case as to whether a presumption of abuse
    exists. Subdivision (f)(9) adds this notice to the list of notices
    that the clerk must give. Subdivision (f)(10) implements the
    amendment to Sec. 704(b), which requires the court to provide a
    copy to all creditors of a statement by the United States trustee
    or bankruptcy administrator as to whether the debtor's case would
    be presumed to be an abuse under Sec. 707(b) not later than five
    days after receiving it.
      Subdivision (f)(11) is also added to provide notice to creditors
    of the debtor's filing of a statement in a chapter 11, 12, or 13
    case that there is no reasonable cause to believe that Sec. 522(q)
    applies in the case. This allows a creditor who disputes that
    assertion to request a delay of the entry of the discharge in the
    case.
      Subdivision (g)(2) of the rule is amended because the 2005
    amendments to Sec. 342(f) of the Code permit creditors in chapter 7
    and 13 individual debtor cases to file a notice with any bankruptcy
    court of the address to which the creditor wishes all notices to be
    sent. The amendment to Rule 2002(g)(2) therefore only limits
    application of the subdivision when a creditor files a notice under
    Sec. 342(f).
      New subdivision (g)(5) implements Sec. 342(g)(1) which was added
    to the Code in 2005. Section 342(g)(1) allows a creditor to treat a
    notice as not having been brought to the creditor's attention, and
    so potentially ineffective, until it is received by a person or
    organizational subdivision that the creditor has designated to
    receive notices under the Bankruptcy Code. Under that section, the
    creditor must have established reasonable procedures for such
    notices to be delivered to the designated person or subdivision.
    The rule provides that, in order to challenge a notice under Sec.
    342(g)(1), a creditor must have filed the name and address of the
    designated notice recipient, as well as a description of the
    procedures for directing notices to that recipient, prior to the
    time that the challenged notice was issued. The filing required by
    the rule may be made as part of a creditor's filing under Sec.
    342(f), which allows a creditor to file a notice of the address to
    be used by all bankruptcy courts or by particular bankruptcy courts
    to provide notice to the creditor in cases under chapters 7 and 13.
    Filing the name and address of the designated notice recipient and
    the procedures for directing notices to that recipient will reduce
    uncertainty as to the proper party for receiving notice and limit
    factual disputes as to whether a notice recipient has been
    designated and as to the nature of procedures adopted to direct
    notices to the recipient.
      Subdivision (k) is amended to add notices given under subdivision
    (q) to the list of notices which must be served on the United
    States trustee.
      Section 1514(d) of the Code, added by the 2005 amendments,
    requires that such additional time as is reasonable under the
    circumstances be given to creditors with foreign addresses with
    respect to notices and the filing of a proof of claim. Thus,
    subdivision (p)(1) is added to this rule to give the court
    flexibility to direct that notice by other means shall supplement
    notice by mail, or to enlarge the notice period, for creditors with
    foreign addresses. If cause exists, such as likely delays in the
    delivery of mailed notices in particular locations, the court may
    order that notice also be given by email, facsimile, or private
    courier. Alternatively, the court may enlarge the notice period for
    a creditor with a foreign address. It is expected that in most
    situations involving foreign creditors, fairness will not require
    any additional notice or extension of the notice period. This rule
    recognizes that the court has discretion to establish procedures to
    determine, on its own initiative, whether relief under subdivision
    (p) is appropriate, but that the court is not required to establish
    such procedures and may decide to act only on request of a party in
    interest.
      Subdivision (p)(2) is added to the rule to grant creditors with a
    foreign address to which notices are mailed at least 30 days'
    notice of the time within which to file proofs of claims if notice
    is mailed to the foreign address, unless the court orders
    otherwise. If cause exists, such as likely delays in the delivery
    of notices in particular locations, the court may extend the notice
    period for creditors with foreign addresses. The court may also
    shorten the additional notice time if circumstances so warrant. For
    example, if the court in a chapter 11 case determines that
    supplementing the notice to a foreign creditor with notice by
    electronic means, such as email or facsimile, would give the
    creditor reasonable notice, the court may order that the creditor
    be given only 20 days' notice in accordance with Rule 2002(a)(7).
      Subdivision (p)(3) is added to provide that the court may, for
    cause, override a creditor's designation of a foreign address under
    Rule 2002(g). For example, if a party in interest believes that a
    creditor has wrongfully designated a foreign address to obtain
    additional time when it has a significant presence in the United
    States, the party can ask the court to order that notices to that
    creditor be sent to an address other than the one designated by the
    foreign creditor.
      Subdivision (q) is added to require that notice of the hearing on
    the petition for recognition of a foreign proceeding be given to
    the debtor, all administrators in foreign proceedings of the
    debtor, entities against whom provisional relief is sought, and
    entities with whom the debtor is engaged in litigation at the time
    of the commencement of the case. There is no need at this stage of
    the proceedings to provide notice to all creditors. If the foreign
    representative should take action to commence a case under another
    chapter of the Code, the rules governing those proceedings will
    operate to provide that notice is given to all creditors.
      The rule also requires notice of the court's intention to
    communicate with a foreign court or foreign representative.
      Changes Made After Publication. Subdivision (g)(2) was amended to
    provide that the designated address of a governmental unit under
    Rule 5003(e) establishes an exception to the rule that a creditor's
    address is to be taken from the debtor's schedules. The fifth and
    sixth paragraphs of the Committee Note were amended to explain that
    change.
      Subdivision (p)(3) was added to the rule to provide that the
    court may override a creditor's designation of a foreign mailing
    address under Rule 2002(g). This will permit a party in interest to
    seek court relief if a creditor has improperly designated a foreign
    address.
      Subdivision (q)(1) and (2) were amended by adopting language from
    Sec. 101(24) to identify foreign representatives as "all persons or
    bodies authorized to administer foreign proceedings of the debtor"
    rather than as "all administrators in foreign proceedings of the
    debtor." References to Rule 5012 in subdivision (q)(2) and in the
    Committee Note were deleted.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to
    substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout
    the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 15-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 20-day periods become 21-day periods

-HEAD-
    Rule 2003. Meeting of Creditors or Equity Security Holders

-STATUTE-
      (a) Date and Place. Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 341(e)
    of the Code, in a chapter 7 liquidation or a chapter 11
    reorganization case, the United States trustee shall call a meeting
    of creditors to be held no fewer than 21 and no more than 40 days
    after the order for relief. In a chapter 12 family farmer debt
    adjustment case, the United States trustee shall call a meeting of
    creditors to be held no fewer than 21 and no more than 35 days
    after the order for relief. In a chapter 13 individual's debt
    adjustment case, the United States trustee shall call a meeting of
    creditors to be held no fewer than 21 and no more than 50 days
    after the order for relief. If there is an appeal from or a motion
    to vacate the order for relief, or if there is a motion to dismiss
    the case, the United States trustee may set a later date for the
    meeting. The meeting may be held at a regular place for holding
    court or at any other place designated by the United States trustee
    within the district convenient for the parties in interest. If the
    United States trustee designates a place for the meeting which is
    not regularly staffed by the United States trustee or an assistant
    who may preside at the meeting, the meeting may be held not more
    than 60 days after the order for relief.
      (b) Order of Meeting.
        (1) Meeting of Creditors. The United States trustee shall
      preside at the meeting of creditors. The business of the meeting
      shall include the examination of the debtor under oath and, in a
      chapter 7 liquidation case, may include the election of a
      creditors' committee and, if the case is not under subchapter V
      of chapter 7, the election of a trustee. The presiding officer
      shall have the authority to administer oaths.
        (2) Meeting of Equity Security Holders. If the United States
      trustee convenes a meeting of equity security holders pursuant to
      Sec. 341(b) of the Code, the United States trustee shall fix a
      date for the meeting and shall preside.
        (3) Right To Vote. In a chapter 7 liquidation case, a creditor
      is entitled to vote at a meeting if, at or before the meeting,
      the creditor has filed a proof of claim or a writing setting
      forth facts evidencing a right to vote pursuant to Sec. 702(a) of
      the Code unless objection is made to the claim or the proof of
      claim is insufficient on its face. A creditor of a partnership
      may file a proof of claim or writing evidencing a right to vote
      for the trustee for the estate of the general partner
      notwithstanding that a trustee for the estate of the partnership
      has previously qualified. In the event of an objection to the
      amount or allowability of a claim for the purpose of voting,
      unless the court orders otherwise, the United States trustee
      shall tabulate the votes for each alternative presented by the
      dispute and, if resolution of such dispute is necessary to
      determine the result of the election, the tabulations for each
      alternative shall be reported to the court.

      (c) Record of Meeting. Any examination under oath at the meeting
    of creditors held pursuant to Sec. 341(a) of the Code shall be
    recorded verbatim by the United States trustee using electronic
    sound recording equipment or other means of recording, and such
    record shall be preserved by the United States trustee and
    available for public access until two years after the conclusion of
    the meeting of creditors. Upon request of any entity, the United
    States trustee shall certify and provide a copy or transcript of
    such recording at the entity's expense.
      (d) Report of Election and Resolution of Disputes in a Chapter 7
    Case.
        (1) Report of Undisputed Election. In a chapter 7 case, if the
      election of a trustee or a member of a creditors' committee is
      not disputed, the United States trustee shall promptly file a
      report of the election, including the name and address of the
      person or entity elected and a statement that the election is
      undisputed.
        (2) Disputed Election. If the election is disputed, the United
      States trustee shall promptly file a report stating that the
      election is disputed, informing the court of the nature of the
      dispute, and listing the name and address of any candidate
      elected under any alternative presented by the dispute. No later
      than the date on which the report is filed, the United States
      trustee shall mail a copy of the report to any party in interest
      that has made a request to receive a copy of the report. Pending
      disposition by the court of a disputed election for trustee, the
      interim trustee shall continue in office. Unless a motion for the
      resolution of the dispute is filed no later than 14 days after
      the United States trustee files a report of a disputed election
      for trustee, the interim trustee shall serve as trustee in the
      case.

      (e) Adjournment. The meeting may be adjourned from time to time
    by announcement at the meeting of the adjourned date and time
    without further written notice.
      (f) Special Meetings. The United States trustee may call a
    special meeting of creditors on request of a party in interest or
    on the United States trustee's own initiative.
      (g) Final Meeting. If the United States trustee calls a final
    meeting of creditors in a case in which the net proceeds realized
    exceed $1,500, the clerk shall mail a summary of the trustee's
    final account to the creditors with a notice of the meeting,
    together with a statement of the amount of the claims allowed. The
    trustee shall attend the final meeting and shall, if requested,
    report on the administration of the estate.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Section 341(a) of the Code requires a meeting of creditors in a
    chapter 7, 11 or 13 case, and Sec. 341(b) permits the court to
    order a meeting of equity security holders. A major change from
    prior law, however, prohibits the judge from attending or presiding
    over the meeting. Section 341(c).
      This rule does not apply either in a case for the reorganization
    of a railroad or for the adjustment of debts of a municipality.
    Sections 1161 and 901 render Secs. 341 and 343 inapplicable in
    these types of cases. Section 341 sets the requirement for a
    meeting of creditors and Sec. 343 provides for the examination of
    the debtor.
      Subdivision (a). The meeting is to be held between 20 and 40 days
    after the date of the order for relief. In a voluntary case, the
    date of the order for relief is the date of the filing of the
    petition (Sec. 301 of the Code); in an involuntary case, it is the
    date of an actual order (Sec. 303(i) of the Code).
      Subdivision (b) provides flexibility as to who will preside at
    the meeting of creditors. The court may designate a person to serve
    as presiding officer, such as the interim trustee appointed under
    Sec. 701 of the Code. If the court does not designate anyone, the
    clerk will preside. In either case, creditors may elect a person of
    their own choosing. In any event, the clerk may remain to record
    the proceedings and take appearances. Use of the clerk is not
    contrary to the legislative policy of Sec. 341(c). The judge
    remains insulated from any information coming forth at the meeting
    and any information obtained by the clerk must not be relayed to
    the judge.
      Although the clerk may preside at the meeting, the clerk is not
    performing any kind of judicial role, nor should the clerk give any
    semblance of performing such a role. It would be pretentious for
    the clerk to ascend the bench, don a robe or be addressed as "your
    honor". The clerk should not appear to parties or others as any
    type of judicial officer.
      In a chapter 11 case, if a committee of unsecured creditors has
    been appointed pursuant to Sec. 1102(a)(1) of the Code and a
    chairman has been selected, the chairman will preside or a person,
    such as the attorney for the committee, may be designated to
    preside by the chairman.
      Since the judge must fix the bond of the trustee but cannot be
    present at the meeting, the rule allows the creditors to recommend
    the amount of the bond. They should be able to obtain relevant
    information concerning the extent of assets of the debtor at the
    meeting.
      Paragraph (1) authorizes the presiding officer to administer
    oaths. This is important because the debtor's examination must be
    under oath.
      Paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) has application only in a
    chapter 7 case. That is the only type of case under the Code that
    permits election of a trustee or committee. In all other cases, no
    vote is taken at the meeting of creditors. If it is necessary for
    the court to make a determination with respect to a claim, the
    meeting may be adjourned until the objection or dispute is
    resolved.
      The second sentence recognizes that partnership creditors may
    vote for a trustee of a partner's estate along with the separate
    creditors of the partner. Although Sec. 723(c) gives the trustee of
    a partnership a claim against a partner's estate for the full
    amount of partnership creditors' claims allowed, the purpose and
    function of this provision are to simplify distribution and prevent
    double proof, not to disfranchise partnership creditors in electing
    a trustee of an estate against which they hold allowable claims.
      Subdivision (c) requires minutes and a record of the meeting to
    be maintained by the presiding officer. A verbatim record must be
    made of the debtor's examination but the rule is flexible as to the
    means used to record the examination.
      Subdivision (d) recognizes that the court must be informed
    immediately about the election or nonelection of a trustee in a
    chapter 7 case. Pursuant to Rule 2008, the clerk officially informs
    the trustee of his election or appointment and how he is to
    qualify. The presiding person has no authority to resolve a
    disputed election.
      For purposes of expediency, the results of the election should be
    obtained for each alternative presented by the dispute and
    immediately reported to the court. Thus, when an interested party
    presents the dispute to the court, its prompt resolution by the
    court will determine the dispute and a new or adjourned meeting to
    conduct the election may be avoided. The clerk is not an interested
    party.
      A creditors' committee may be elected only in a chapter 7 case.
    In chapter 11 cases, a creditors' committee is appointed pursuant
    to Sec. 1102.
      While a final meeting is not required, Rule 2002(f)(10) provides
    for the trustee's final account to be sent to creditors.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). Many courts schedule meetings of creditors at
    various locations in the district. Because the clerk must schedule
    meetings at those locations, an additional 20 days for scheduling
    the meetings is provided under the amended rule.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment to subdivision (a) relating to the calling of the
    meeting of creditors in a chapter 12 case is consistent with the
    expedited procedures of chapter 12. Subdivision (a) is also amended
    to clarify that the United States trustee does not call a meeting
    of creditors in a chapter 9 case. Pursuant to Sec. 901(a) of the
    Code, Sec. 341 is inapplicable in chapter 9 cases. The other
    amendments to subdivisions (a), (b)(1), and (b)(2) and the
    additions of subdivisions (f) and (g) are derived from Rule X-1006
    and conform to the 1986 amendments to Sec. 341 of the Code. The
    second sentence of subdivision (b)(3) is amended because Rule
    2009(e) is abrogated. Although the United States trustee fixes the
    date for the meeting, the clerk of the bankruptcy court transmits
    the notice of the meeting unless the court orders otherwise, as
    prescribed in Rule 2002(a)(1).
      Pursuant to Sec. 702 and Sec. 705 of the Code, creditors may
    elect a trustee and a committee in a chapter 7 case. Subdivision
    (b) of this rule provides that the United States trustee shall
    preside over any election that is held under those sections. The
    deletion of the last sentence of subdivision (b)(1) does not
    preclude creditors from recommending to the United States trustee
    the amount of the trustee's bond when a trustee is elected.
    Trustees and committees are not elected in chapter 11, 12, and 13
    cases.
      If an election is disputed, the United States trustee shall not
    resolve the dispute. For purposes of expediency, the United States
    trustee shall tabulate the results of the election for each
    alternative presented by the dispute. However, if the court finds
    that such tabulation is not feasible under the circumstances, the
    United States trustee need not tabulate the votes. If such
    tabulation is feasible and if the disputed vote or votes would
    affect the result of the election, the tabulations of votes for
    each alternative presented by the dispute shall be reported to the
    court. If a motion is made for resolution of the dispute in
    accordance with subdivision (d) of this rule, the court will
    determine the issue and another meeting to conduct the election may
    not be necessary.
      Subdivisions (f) and (g) are derived from Rule X-1006(d) and (e),
    except that the amount is increased to $1,500 to conform to the
    amendment to Rule 2002(f).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to extend by ten days the time for
    holding the meeting of creditors in a chapter 13 case. This
    extension will provide more flexibility for scheduling the meeting
    of creditors. Other amendments are stylistic and make no
    substantive change.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1999 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (d) is amended to require the United States trustee
    to mail a copy of a report of a disputed election to any party in
    interest that has requested a copy of it. Also, if the election is
    for a trustee, the rule as amended will give a party in interest
    ten days from the filing of the report, rather than from the date
    of the meeting of creditors, to file a motion to resolve the
    dispute.
      The substitution of "United States trustee" for "presiding
    officer" is stylistic. Section 341(a) of the Code provides that the
    United States trustee shall preside at the meeting of creditors.
    Other amendments are designed to conform to the style of Rule
    2007.1(b)(3) regarding the election of a trustee in a chapter 11
    case.
      GAP Report on Rule 2003. No changes since publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to reflect the enactment of subchapter V of
    chapter 7 of the Code governing multilateral clearing organization
    liquidations. Section 782 of the Code provides that the designation
    of a trustee or alternative trustee for the case is made by the
    Federal Reserve Board. Therefore, the meeting of creditors in those
    cases cannot include the election of a trustee.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes since
    publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      If the debtor has solicited acceptances to a plan before
    commencement of the case, Sec. 341(e), which was added to the Code
    by the 2005 amendments, authorizes the court, on request of a party
    in interest and after notice and a hearing, to order that a meeting
    of creditors not be convened. The rule is amended to recognize that
    a meeting of creditors might not be held in those cases.
      Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after
    publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to
    substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout
    the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 15-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 20-day periods become 21-day periods
        -- 25-day periods become 28-day periods

               EXAMINATIONS; ELECTIONS; ATTORNEYS AND ACCOUNTANTS

-HEAD-
    Rule 2004. Examination

-STATUTE-
      (a) Examination on Motion. On motion of any party in interest,
    the court may order the examination of any entity.
      (b) Scope of Examination. The examination of an entity under this
    rule or of the debtor under Sec. 343 of the Code may relate only to
    the acts, conduct, or property or to the liabilities and financial
    condition of the debtor, or to any matter which may affect the
    administration of the debtor's estate, or to the debtor's right to
    a discharge. In a family farmer's debt adjustment case under
    chapter 12, an individual's debt adjustment case under chapter 13,
    or a reorganization case under chapter 11 of the Code, other than
    for the reorganization of a railroad, the examination may also
    relate to the operation of any business and the desirability of its
    continuance, the source of any money or property acquired or to be
    acquired by the debtor for purposes of consummating a plan and the
    consideration given or offered therefor, and any other matter
    relevant to the case or to the formulation of a plan.
      (c) Compelling Attendance and Production of Documents. The
    attendance of an entity for examination and for the production of
    documents, whether the examination is to be conducted within or
    without the district in which the case is pending, may be compelled
    as provided in Rule 9016 for the attendance of a witness at a
    hearing or trial. As an officer of the court, an attorney may issue
    and sign a subpoena on behalf of the court for the district in
    which the examination is to be held if the attorney is admitted to
    practice in that court or in the court in which the case is
    pending.
      (d) Time and Place of Examination of Debtor. The court may for
    cause shown and on terms as it may impose order the debtor to be
    examined under this rule at any time or place it designates,
    whether within or without the district wherein the case is pending.
      (e) Mileage. An entity other than a debtor shall not be required
    to attend as a witness unless lawful mileage and witness fee for
    one day's attendance shall be first tendered. If the debtor resides
    more than 100 miles from the place of examination when required to
    appear for an examination under this rule, the mileage allowed by
    law to a witness shall be tendered for any distance more than 100
    miles from the debtor's residence at the date of the filing of the
    first petition commencing a case under the Code or the residence at
    the time the debtor is required to appear for the examination,
    whichever is the lesser.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Subdivision (a) of this rule is derived from former Bankruptcy
    Rule 205(a). See generally 2 Collier, Bankruptcy &#182;&#182;
    343.02, 343.08, 343.13 (15th ed. 1981). It specifies the manner of
    moving for an examination. The motion may be heard ex parte or it
    may be heard on notice.
      Subdivision (b) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rules 205(d)
    and 11-26.
      Subdivision (c) specifies the mode of compelling attendance of a
    witness or party for an examination and for the production of
    evidence under this rule. The subdivision is substantially
    declaratory of the practice that had developed under Sec. 21a of
    the Act. See 2 Collier, supra &#182; 343.11.
      This subdivision will be applicable for the most part to the
    examination of a person other than the debtor. The debtor is
    required to appear at the meeting of creditors for examination. The
    word "person" includes the debtor and this subdivision may be used
    if necessary to obtain the debtor's attendance for examination.
      Subdivision (d) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 205(f) and
    is not a limitation on subdivision (c). Any person, including the
    debtor, served with a subpoena within the range of a subpoena must
    attend for examination pursuant to subdivision (c). Subdivision (d)
    applies only to the debtor and a subpoena need not be issued. There
    are no territorial limits on the service of an order on the debtor.
    See, e.g., In re Totem Lodge & Country Club, Inc., 134 F. Supp. 158
    (S.D.N.Y. 1955).
      Subdivision (e) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 205(g).
    The lawful mileage and fee for attendance at a United States court
    as a witness are prescribed by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1821.
      Definition of debtor. The word "debtor" as used in this rule
    includes the persons specified in the definition in Rule 9001(5).
      Spousal privilege. The limitation on the spousal privilege
    formerly contained in Sec. 21a of the Act is not carried over in
    the Code. For privileges generally, see Rule 501 of the Federal
    Rules of Evidence made applicable in cases under the Code by Rule
    1101 thereof.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to allow the examination in a chapter 12
    case to cover the same matters that may be covered in an
    examination in a chapter 11 or 13 case.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (c) is amended to clarify that an examination ordered
    under Rule 2004(a) may be held outside the district in which the
    case is pending if the subpoena is issued by the court for the
    district in which the examination is to be held and is served in
    the manner provided in Rule 45 F. R. Civ. P., made applicable by
    Rule 9016.
      The subdivision is amended further to clarify that, in addition
    to the procedures for the issuance of a subpoena set forth in Rule
    45 F. R. Civ. P., an attorney may issue and sign a subpoena on
    behalf of the court for the district in which a Rule 2004
    examination is to be held if the attorney is authorized to
    practice, even if admitted pro hac vice, either in the court in
    which the case is pending or in the court for the district in which
    the examination is to be held. This provision supplements the
    procedures for the issuance of a subpoena set forth in Rule
    45(a)(3)(A) and (B) F. R. Civ. P. and is consistent with one of the
    purposes of the 1991 amendments to Rule 45, to ease the burdens of
    interdistrict law practice.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The typographical
    error was corrected, but no other changes were made.

    Rule 2005. Apprehension and Removal of Debtor to Compel Attendance
      for Examination

-STATUTE-
      (a) Order To Compel Attendance for Examination. On motion of any
    party in interest supported by an affidavit alleging (1) that the
    examination of the debtor is necessary for the proper
    administration of the estate and that there is reasonable cause to
    believe that the debtor is about to leave or has left the debtor's
    residence or principal place of business to avoid examination, or
    (2) that the debtor has evaded service of a subpoena or of an order
    to attend for examination, or (3) that the debtor has willfully
    disobeyed a subpoena or order to attend for examination, duly
    served, the court may issue to the marshal, or some other officer
    authorized by law, an order directing the officer to bring the
    debtor before the court without unnecessary delay. If, after
    hearing, the court finds the allegations to be true, the court
    shall thereupon cause the debtor to be examined forthwith. If
    necessary, the court shall fix conditions for further examination
    and for the debtor's obedience to all orders made in reference
    thereto.
      (b) Removal. Whenever any order to bring the debtor before the
    court is issued under this rule and the debtor is found in a
    district other than that of the court issuing the order, the debtor
    may be taken into custody under the order and removed in accordance
    with the following rules:
        (1) If the debtor is taken into custody under the order at a
      place less than 100 miles from the place of issue of the order,
      the debtor shall be brought forthwith before the court that
      issued the order.
        (2) If the debtor is taken into custody under the order at a
      place 100 miles or more from the place of issue of the order, the
      debtor shall be brought without unnecessary delay before the
      nearest available United States magistrate judge, bankruptcy
      judge, or district judge. If, after hearing, the magistrate
      judge, bankruptcy judge, or district judge finds that an order
      has issued under this rule and that the person in custody is the
      debtor, or if the person in custody waives a hearing, the
      magistrate judge, bankruptcy judge, or district judge shall order
      removal, and the person in custody shall be released on
      conditions ensuring prompt appearance before the court that
      issued the order to compel the attendance.

      (c) Conditions of Release. In determining what conditions will
    reasonably assure attendance or obedience under subdivision (a) of
    this rule or appearance under subdivision (b) of this rule, the
    court shall be governed by the provisions and policies of title 18,
    U.S.C., Sec. 3146(a) and (b).

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 206. The rule
    requires the debtor to be examined as soon as possible if
    allegations of the movant for compulsory examination under this
    rule are found to be true after a hearing. Subdivision (b) includes
    in paragraphs (1) and (2) provisions adapted from subdivisions (a)
    and (b) of Rule 40 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,
    which governs the handling of a person arrested in one district on
    a warrant issued in another. Subdivision (c) incorporates by
    reference the features of subdivisions (a) and (b) of 18 U.S.C.
    Sec. 3146, which prescribe standards, procedures and factors to be
    considered in determining conditions of release of accused persons
    in noncapital cases prior to trial. The word "debtor" as used in
    this rule includes the persons named in Rule 9001(5).
      The affidavit required to be submitted in support of the motion
    may be subscribed by the unsworn declaration provided for in 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 1746.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b)(2) is amended to conform to Sec. 321 of the
    Judicial Improvements Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-650, which
    changed the title of "United States magistrate" to "United States
    magistrate judge." Other amendments are stylistic and make no
    substantive change.

-HEAD-
    Rule 2006. Solicitation and Voting of Proxies in Chapter 7
      Liquidation Cases

-STATUTE-
      (a) Applicability. This rule applies only in a liquidation case
    pending under chapter 7 of the Code.
      (b) Definitions.
        (1) Proxy. A proxy is a written power of attorney authorizing
      any entity to vote the claim or otherwise act as the owner's
      attorney in fact in connection with the administration of the
      estate.
        (2) Solicitation of Proxy. The solicitation of a proxy is any
      communication, other than one from an attorney to a regular
      client who owns a claim or from an attorney to the owner of a
      claim who has requested the attorney to represent the owner, by
      which a creditor is asked, directly or indirectly, to give a
      proxy after or in contemplation of the filing of a petition by or
      against the debtor.

      (c) Authorized Solicitation.
        (1) A proxy may be solicited only by (A) a creditor owning an
      allowable unsecured claim against the estate on the date of the
      filing of the petition; (B) a committee elected pursuant to Sec.
      705 of the Code; (C) a committee of creditors selected by a
      majority in number and amount of claims of creditors (i) whose
      claims are not contingent or unliquidated, (ii) who are not
      disqualified from voting under Sec. 702(a) of the Code and (iii)
      who were present or represented at a meeting of which all
      creditors having claims of over $500 or the 100 creditors having
      the largest claims had at least seven days' notice in writing and
      of which meeting written minutes were kept and are available
      reporting the names of the creditors present or represented and
      voting and the amounts of their claims; or (D) a bona fide trade
      or credit association, but such association may solicit only
      creditors who were its members or subscribers in good standing
      and had allowable unsecured claims on the date of the filing of
      the petition.
        (2) A proxy may be solicited only in writing.

      (d) Solicitation Not Authorized. This rule does not permit
    solicitation (1) in any interest other than that of general
    creditors; (2) by or on behalf of any custodian; (3) by the interim
    trustee or by or on behalf of any entity not qualified to vote
    under Sec. 702(a) of the Code; (4) by or on behalf of an attorney
    at law; or (5) by or on behalf of a transferee of a claim for
    collection only.
      (e) Data Required From Holders of Multiple Proxies. At any time
    before the voting commences at any meeting of creditors pursuant to
    Sec. 341(a) of the Code, or at any other time as the court may
    direct, a holder of two or more proxies shall file and transmit to
    the United States trustee a verified list of the proxies to be
    voted and a verified statement of the pertinent facts and
    circumstances in connection with the execution and delivery of each
    proxy, including:
        (1) a copy of the solicitation;
        (2) identification of the solicitor, the forwarder, if the
      forwarder is neither the solicitor nor the owner of the claim,
      and the proxyholder, including their connections with the debtor
      and with each other. If the solicitor, forwarder, or proxyholder
      is an association, there shall also be included a statement that
      the creditors whose claims have been solicited and the creditors
      whose claims are to be voted were members or subscribers in good
      standing and had allowable unsecured claims on the date of the
      filing of the petition. If the solicitor, forwarder, or
      proxyholder is a committee of creditors, the statement shall also
      set forth the date and place the committee was organized, that
      the committee was organized in accordance with clause (B) or (C)
      of paragraph (c)(1) of this rule, the members of the committee,
      the amounts of their claims, when the claims were acquired, the
      amounts paid therefor, and the extent to which the claims of the
      committee members are secured or entitled to priority;
        (3) a statement that no consideration has been paid or promised
      by the proxyholder for the proxy;
        (4) a statement as to whether there is any agreement and, if
      so, the particulars thereof, between the proxyholder and any
      other entity for the payment of any consideration in connection
      with voting the proxy, or for the sharing of compensation with
      any entity, other than a member or regular associate of the
      proxyholder's law firm, which may be allowed the trustee or any
      entity for services rendered in the case, or for the employment
      of any person as attorney, accountant, appraiser, auctioneer, or
      other employee for the estate;
        (5) if the proxy was solicited by an entity other than the
      proxyholder, or forwarded to the holder by an entity who is
      neither a solicitor of the proxy nor the owner of the claim, a
      statement signed and verified by the solicitor or forwarder that
      no consideration has been paid or promised for the proxy, and
      whether there is any agreement, and, if so, the particulars
      thereof, between the solicitor or forwarder and any other entity
      for the payment of any consideration in connection with voting
      the proxy, or for sharing compensation with any entity other than
      a member or regular associate of the solicitor's or forwarder's
      law firm which may be allowed the trustee or any entity for
      services rendered in the case, or for the employment of any
      person as attorney, accountant, appraiser, auctioneer, or other
      employee for the estate;
        (6) if the solicitor, forwarder, or proxyholder is a committee,
      a statement signed and verified by each member as to the amount
      and source of any consideration paid or to be paid to such member
      in connection with the case other than by way of dividend on the
      member's claim.

      (f) Enforcement of Restrictions on Solicitation. On motion of any
    party in interest or on its own initiative, the court may determine
    whether there has been a failure to comply with the provisions of
    this rule or any other impropriety in connection with the
    solicitation or voting of a proxy. After notice and a hearing the
    court may reject any proxy for cause, vacate any order entered in
    consequence of the voting of any proxy which should have been
    rejected, or take any other appropriate action.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is a comprehensive regulation of solicitation and
    voting of proxies in liquidation cases. It is derived from former
    Bankruptcy Rule 208. The rule applies only in chapter 7 cases
    because no voting occurs, other than on a plan, in a chapter 11
    case. Former Bankruptcy Rule 208 did not apply to solicitations of
    acceptances of plans.
      Creditor control was a basic feature of the Act and is continued,
    in part, by the Code. Creditor democracy is perverted and the
    congressional objective frustrated, however, if control of
    administration falls into the hands of persons whose principal
    interest is not in what the estate can be made to yield to the
    unsecured creditors but in what it can yield to those involved in
    its administration or in other ulterior objectives.
      Subdivision (b). The definition of proxy in the first paragraph
    of subdivision (b) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 208.
      Subdivision (c). The purpose of the rule is to protect creditors
    against loss of control of administration of their debtors' estates
    to holders of proxies having interests that differ from those of
    the creditors. The rule does not prohibit solicitation but
    restricts it to those who were creditors at the commencement of the
    case or their freely and fairly selected representatives. The
    special role occupied by credit and trade associations is
    recognized in the last clause of subdivision (c)(1). On the
    assumption that members or subscribers may have affiliated with an
    association in part for the purpose of obtaining its services as a
    representative in liquidation proceedings, an established
    association is authorized to solicit its own members, or its
    regular customers or clients, who were creditors on the date of the
    filing of the petition. Although the association may not solicit
    nonmembers or nonsubscribers for proxies, it may sponsor a meeting
    of creditors at which a committee entitled to solicit proxies may
    be selected in accordance with clause (C) of subdivision (c)(1).
      Under certain circumstances, the relationship of a creditor,
    creditors' committee, or association to the estate or the case may
    be such as to warrant rejection of any proxy solicited by such a
    person or group. Thus a person who is forbidden by the Code to vote
    his own claim should be equally disabled to solicit proxies from
    creditors. Solicitation by or on behalf of the debtor has been
    uniformly condemned, e.g., In re White, 15 F.2d 371 (9th Cir.
    1926), as has solicitation on behalf of a preferred creditor,
    Matter of Law, 13 Am.B.R. 650 (S.D. Ill. 1905). The prohibition on
    solicitation by a receiver or his attorney made explicit by General
    Order 39 has been collaterally supported by rulings rejecting
    proxies solicited by a receiver in equity, In re Western States
    Bldg.-Loan Ass'n, 54 F.2d 415 (S.D. Cal. 1931), and by an assignee
    for the benefit of creditors, Lines v. Falstaff Brewing Co., 233
    F.2d 927 (9th Cir. 1956).
      Subdivision (d) prohibits solicitation by any person or group
    having a relationship described in the preceding paragraph. It also
    makes no exception for attorneys or transferees of claims for
    collection. The rule does not undertake to regulate communications
    between an attorney and his regular client or between an attorney
    and a creditor who has asked the attorney to represent him in a
    proceeding under the Code, but any other communication by an
    attorney or any other person or group requesting a proxy from the
    owner of a claim constitutes a regulated solicitation. Solicitation
    by an attorney of a proxy from a creditor who was not a client
    prior to the solicitation is objectionable not only as unethical
    conduct as recognized by such cases as In the Matter of Darland
    Company, 184 F. Supp. 760 (S.D. Iowa 1960) but also and more
    importantly because the practice carries a substantial risk that
    administration will fall into the hands of those whose interest is
    in obtaining fees from the estate rather than securing dividends
    for creditors. The same risk attaches to solicitation by the holder
    of a claim for collection only.
      Subdivision (e). The regulation of solicitation and voting of
    proxies is achieved by the rule principally through the imposition
    of requirements of disclosure on the holders of two or more
    proxies. The disclosures must be made to the clerk before the
    meeting at which the proxies are to be voted to afford the clerk or
    a party in interest an opportunity to examine the circumstances
    accompanying the acquisition of the proxies in advance of any
    exercise of the proxies. In the light of the examination the clerk
    or a party in interest should bring to the attention of the judge
    any question that arises and the judge may permit the proxies that
    comply with the rule to be voted and reject those that do not
    unless the holders can effect or establish compliance in such
    manner as the court shall prescribe. The holders of single proxies
    are excused from the disclosure requirements because of the
    insubstantiality of the risk that such proxies have been solicited,
    or will be voted, in an interest other than that of general
    creditors.
      Every holder of two or more proxies must include in the
    submission a verified statement that no consideration has been paid
    or promised for the proxy, either by the proxyholder or the
    solicitor or any forwarder of the proxy. Any payment or promise of
    consideration for a proxy would be conclusive evidence of a purpose
    to acquire control of the administration of an estate for an
    ulterior purpose. The holder of multiple proxies must also include
    in the submission a verified statement as to whether there is any
    agreement by the holder, the solicitor, or any forwarder of the
    proxy for the employment of any person in the administration of an
    estate or for the sharing of any compensation allowed in connection
    with the administration of the estate. The provisions requiring
    these statements implement the policy of the Code expressed in Sec.
    504 as well as the policy of this rule to deter the acquisition of
    proxies for the purpose of obtaining a share in the outlays for
    administration. Finally the facts as to any consideration moving or
    promised to any member of a committee which functions as a
    solicitor, forwarder, or proxyholder must be disclosed by the
    proxyholder. Such information would be of significance to the court
    in evaluating the purpose of the committee in obtaining,
    transmitting, or voting proxies.
      Subdivision (f) has counterparts in the local rules referred to
    in the Advisory Committee's Note to former Bankruptcy Rule 208.
    Courts have been accorded a wide range of discretion in the
    handling of disputes involving proxies. Thus the referee was
    allowed to reject proxies and to proceed forthwith to hold a
    scheduled election at the same meeting. E.g., In re Portage
    Wholesale Co., 183 F.2d 959 (7th Cir. 1950); In re McGill, 106 Fed.
    57 (6th Cir. 1901); In re Deena Woolen Mills, Inc., 114 F. Supp.
    260, 273 (D. Me. 1953); In re Finlay, 3 Am.B.R. 738 (S.D.N.Y.
    1900). The bankruptcy judge may postpone an election to permit a
    determination of issues presented by a dispute as to proxies and to
    afford those creditors whose proxies are rejected an opportunity to
    give new proxies or to attend an adjourned meeting to vote their
    own claims. Cf. In the Matter of Lenrick Sales, Inc., 369 F.2d 439,
    442-43 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 822 (1967); In the Matter
    of Construction Supply Corp. 221 F. Supp. 124, 128 (E.D. Va. 1963).
    This rule is not intended to restrict the scope of the court's
    discretion in the handling of disputes as to proxies.

-HEAD-
    Rule 2007. Review of Appointment of Creditors' Committee Organized
      Before Commencement of the Case

-STATUTE-
      (a) Motion To Review Appointment. If a committee appointed by the
    United States trustee pursuant to Sec. 1102(a) of the Code consists
    of the members of a committee organized by creditors before the
    commencement of a chapter 9 or chapter 11 case, on motion of a
    party in interest and after a hearing on notice to the United
    States trustee and other entities as the court may direct, the
    court may determine whether the appointment of the committee
    satisfies the requirements of Sec. 1102(b)(1) of the Code.
      (b) Selection of Members of Committee. The court may find that a
    committee organized by unsecured creditors before the commencement
    of a chapter 9 or chapter 11 case was fairly chosen if:
        (1) it was selected by a majority in number and amount of
      claims of unsecured creditors who may vote under Sec. 702(a) of
      the Code and were present in person or represented at a meeting
      of which all creditors having unsecured claims of over $1,000 or
      the 100 unsecured creditors having the largest claims had at
      least seven days' notice in writing, and of which meeting written
      minutes reporting the names of the creditors present or
      represented and voting and the amounts of their claims were kept
      and are available for inspection;
        (2) all proxies voted at the meeting for the elected committee
      were solicited pursuant to Rule 2006 and the lists and statements
      required by subdivision (e) thereof have been transmitted to the
      United States trustee; and
        (3) the organization of the committee was in all other respects
      fair and proper.

      (c) Failure To Comply With Requirements for Appointment. After a
    hearing on notice pursuant to subdivision (a) of this rule, the
    court shall direct the United States trustee to vacate the
    appointment of the committee and may order other appropriate action
    if the court finds that such appointment failed to satisfy the
    requirements of Sec. 1102(b)(1) of the Code.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Section 1102(b)(1) of the Code permits the court to appoint as
    the unsecured creditors' committee, the committee that was selected
    by creditors before the order for relief. This provision recognizes
    the propriety of continuing a "prepetition" committee in an
    official capacity. Such a committee, however, must be found to have
    been fairly chosen and representative of the different kinds of
    claims to be represented.
      Subdivision (a) does not necessarily require a hearing but does
    require a party in interest to bring to the court's attention the
    fact that a prepetition committee had been organized and should be
    appointed. An application would suffice for this purpose. Party in
    interest would include the committee, any member of the committee,
    or any of its agents acting for the committee. Whether or not
    notice of the application should be given to any other party is
    left to the discretion of the court.
      Subdivision (b) implements Sec. 1102(b)(1). The Code provision
    allows the court to appoint, as the official Sec. 1102(a)
    committee, a "prepetition" committee if its members were fairly
    chosen and the committee is representative of the different kinds
    of claims. This subdivision of the rule indicates some of the
    factors the court may consider in determining whether the
    requirements of Sec. 1102(b)(1) have been satisfied. In effect, the
    subdivision provides various factors which are similar to those set
    forth in Rule 2006 with respect to the solicitation and voting of
    proxies in a chapter 7 liquidation case.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The rule is amended to conform to the 1984 amendments to Sec.
    1102(b)(1) of the Code.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to conform to the 1986 amendments to Sec.
    1102(a). The United States trustee appoints committees pursuant to
    Sec. 1102 in chapter 11 cases. Section 1102 is applicable in
    chapter 9 cases pursuant to Sec. 901(a).
      Although Sec. 1102(b)(1) of the Code permits the United States
    trustee to appoint a prepetition committee as the statutory
    committee if its members were fairly chosen and it is
    representative of the different kinds of claims to be represented,
    the amendment to this rule provides a procedure for judicial review
    of the appointment. The factors that may be considered by the court
    in determining whether the committee was fairly chosen are not new.
    A finding that a prepetition committee has not been fairly chosen
    does not prohibit the appointment of some or all of its members to
    the creditors' committee. Although this rule deals only with
    judicial review of the appointment of prepetition committees, it
    does not preclude judicial review under Rule 2020 regarding the
    appointment of other committees.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute
    a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules,
    deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 15-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 20-day periods become 21-day periods

    Rule 2007.1. Appointment of Trustee or Examiner in a Chapter 11
      Reorganization Case

-STATUTE-
      (a) Order To Appoint Trustee or Examiner. In a chapter 11
    reorganization case, a motion for an order to appoint a trustee or
    an examiner under Sec. 1104(a) or Sec. 1104(c) of the Code shall be
    made in accordance with Rule 9014.
      (b) Election of Trustee.
        (1) Request for an Election. A request to convene a meeting of
      creditors for the purpose of electing a trustee in a chapter 11
      reorganization case shall be filed and transmitted to the United
      States trustee in accordance with Rule 5005 within the time
      prescribed by Sec. 1104(b) of the Code. Pending court approval of
      the person elected, any person appointed by the United States
      trustee under Sec. 1104(d) and approved in accordance with
      subdivision (c) of this rule shall serve as trustee.
        (2) Manner of Election and Notice. An election of a trustee
      under Sec. 1104(b) of the Code shall be conducted in the manner
      provided in Rules 2003(b)(3) and 2006. Notice of the meeting of
      creditors convened under Sec. 1104(b) shall be given as provided
      in Rule 2002. The United States trustee shall preside at the
      meeting. A proxy for the purpose of voting in the election may be
      solicited only by a committee of creditors appointed under Sec.
      1102 of the Code or by any other party entitled to solicit a
      proxy pursuant to Rule 2006.
        (3) Report of Election and Resolution of Disputes.
          (A) Report of Undisputed Election. If no dispute arises out
        of the election, the United States trustee shall promptly file
        a report certifying the election, including the name and
        address of the person elected and a statement that the election
        is undisputed. The report shall be accompanied by a verified
        statement of the person elected setting forth that person's
        connections with the debtor, creditors, any other party in
        interest, their respective attorneys and accountants, the
        United States trustee, or any person employed in the office of
        the United States trustee.
          (B) Dispute Arising Out of an Election. If a dispute arises
        out of an election, the United States trustee shall promptly
        file a report stating that the election is disputed, informing
        the court of the nature of the dispute, and listing the name
        and address of any candidate elected under any alternative
        presented by the dispute. The report shall be accompanied by a
        verified statement by each candidate elected under each
        alternative presented by the dispute, setting forth the
        person's connections with the debtor, creditors, any other
        party in interest, their respective attorneys and accountants,
        the United States trustee, or any person employed in the office
        of the United States trustee. Not later than the date on which
        the report of the disputed election is filed, the United States
        trustee shall mail a copy of the report and each verified
        statement to any party in interest that has made a request to
        convene a meeting under Sec. 1104(b) or to receive a copy of
        the report, and to any committee appointed under Sec. 1102 of
        the Code.

      (c) Approval of Appointment. An order approving the appointment
    of a trustee or an examiner under Sec. 1104(d) of the Code shall be
    made on application of the United States trustee. The application
    shall state the name of the person appointed and, to the best of
    the applicant's knowledge, all the person's connections with the
    debtor, creditors, any other parties in interest, their respective
    attorneys and accountants, the United States trustee, or persons
    employed in the office of the United States trustee. The
    application shall state the names of the parties in interest with
    whom the United States trustee consulted regarding the appointment.
    The application shall be accompanied by a verified statement of the
    person appointed setting forth the person's connections with the
    debtor, creditors, any other party in interest, their respective
    attorneys and accountants, the United States trustee, or any person
    employed in the office of the United States trustee.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991            
      This rule is added to implement the 1986 amendments to Sec. 1104
    of the Code regarding the appointment of a trustee or examiner in a
    chapter 11 case. A motion for an order to appoint a trustee or
    examiner is a contested matter. Although the court decides whether
    the appointment is warranted under the particular facts of the
    case, it is the United States trustee who makes the appointment
    pursuant to Sec. 1104(c) of the Code. The appointment is subject to
    approval of the court, however, which may be obtained by
    application of the United States trustee. Section 1104(c) of the
    Code requires that the appointment be made after consultation with
    parties in interest and that the person appointed be disinterested.
      The requirement that connections with the United States trustee
    or persons employed in the United States trustee's office be
    revealed is not intended to enlarge the definition of
    "disinterested person" in Sec. 101(13) of the Code, to supersede
    executive regulations or other laws relating to appointments by
    United States trustees, or to otherwise restrict the United States
    trustee's discretion in making appointments. This information is
    required, however, in the interest of full disclosure and
    confidence in the appointment process and to give the court all
    information that may be relevant to the exercise of judicial
    discretion in approving the appointment of a trustee or examiner in
    a chapter 11 case.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to implement the 1994 amendments to Sec.
    1104 of the Code regarding the election of a trustee in a chapter
    11 case.
      Eligibility for voting in an election for a chapter 11 trustee is
    determined in accordance with Rule 2003(b)(3). Creditors whose
    claims are deemed filed under Sec. 1111(a) are treated for voting
    purposes as creditors who have filed proofs of claim.
      Proxies for the purpose of voting in the election may be
    solicited only by a creditors' committee appointed under Sec. 1102
    or by any other party entitled to solicit proxies pursuant to Rule
    2006. Therefore, a trustee or examiner who has served in the case,
    or a committee of equity security holders appointed under Sec.
    1102, may not solicit proxies.
      The procedures for reporting disputes to the court derive from
    similar provisions in Rule 2003(d) applicable to chapter 7 cases.
    An election may be disputed by a party in interest or by the United
    States trustee. For example, if the United States trustee believes
    that the person elected is ineligible to serve as trustee because
    the person is not "disinterested," the United States trustee should
    file a report disputing the election.
      The word "only" is deleted from subdivision (b), redesignated as
    subdivision (c), to avoid any negative inference with respect to
    the availability of procedures for obtaining review of the United
    States trustee's acts or failure to act pursuant to Rule 2020.
      GAP Report on Rule 2017.1. The published draft of proposed new
    subdivision (b)(3) of Rule 2017.1 [2007.1], and the Committee Note,
    was substantially revised to implement Mr. Patchan's
    recommendations (described above), to clarify how a disputed
    election will be reported, and to make stylistic improvements.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      Under Sec. 1104(b)(2) of the Code, as amended in 2005, if an
    eligible, disinterested person is elected to serve as trustee in a
    chapter 11 case, the United States trustee is directed to file a
    report certifying the election. The person elected does not have to
    be appointed to the position. Rather, the filing of the report
    certifying the election itself constitutes the appointment. The
    section further provides that in the event of a dispute in the
    election of a trustee, the court must resolve the matter. The rule
    is amended to be consistent with Sec. 1104(b)(2).
      When the United States trustee files a report certifying the
    election of a trustee, the person elected must provide a verified
    statement, similar to the statement required of professional
    persons under Rule 2014, disclosing connections with parties in
    interest and certain other persons connected with the case.
    Although court approval of the person elected is not required, the
    disclosure of the person's connections will enable parties in
    interest to determine whether the person is disinterested.

-HEAD-
    Rule 2007.2. Appointment of Patient Care Ombudsman in a Health Care
      Business Case

-STATUTE-
      (a) Order to Appoint Patient Care Ombudsman. In a chapter 7,
    chapter 9, or chapter 11 case in which the debtor is a health care
    business, the court shall order the appointment of a patient care
    ombudsman under Sec. 333 of the Code, unless the court, on motion
    of the United States trustee or a party in interest filed no later
    than 21 days after the commencement of the case or within another
    time fixed by the court, finds that the appointment of a patient
    care ombudsman is not necessary under the specific circumstances of
    the case for the protection of patients.
      (b) Motion for Order To Appoint Ombudsman. If the court has found
    that the appointment of an ombudsman is not necessary, or has
    terminated the appointment, the court, on motion of the United
    States trustee or a party in interest, may order the appointment at
    a later time if it finds that the appointment has become necessary
    to protect patients.
      (c) Notice of Appointment. If a patient care ombudsman is
    appointed under Sec. 333, the United States trustee shall promptly
    file a notice of the appointment, including the name and address of
    the person appointed. Unless the person appointed is a State Long-
    Term Care Ombudsman, the notice shall be accompanied by a verified
    statement of the person appointed setting forth the person's
    connections with the debtor, creditors, patients, any other party
    in interest, their respective attorneys and accountants, the United
    States trustee, and any person employed in the office of the United
    States trustee.
      (d) Termination of Appointment. On motion of the United States
    trustee or a party in interest, the court may terminate the
    appointment of a patient care ombudsman if the court finds that the
    appointment is not necessary to protect patients.
      (e) Motion. A motion under this rule shall be governed by Rule
    9014. The motion shall be transmitted to the United States trustee
    and served on: the debtor; the trustee; any committee elected under
    Sec. 705 or appointed under Sec. 1102 of the Code or its authorized
    agent, or, if the case is a chapter 9 municipality case or a
    chapter 11 reorganization case and no committee of unsecured
    creditors has been appointed under Sec. 1102, on the creditors
    included on the list filed under Rule 1007(d); and such other
    entities as the court may direct.

-MISC1-
                      COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008                  
      Section 333 of the Code, added by the 2005 amendments, requires
    the court to order the appointment of a health care ombudsman
    within the first 30 days of a health care business case, unless the
    court finds that the appointment is not necessary for the
    protection of patients. The rule recognizes this requirement and
    provides a procedure by which a party may obtain a court order
    finding that the appointment of a patient care ombudsman is
    unnecessary. In the absence of a timely motion under subdivision
    (a) of this rule, the court will enter an order directing the
    United States trustee to appoint the ombudsman.
      Subdivision (b) recognizes that, despite a previous order finding
    that a patient care ombudsman is not necessary, circumstances of
    the case may change or newly discovered evidence may demonstrate
    the necessity of an ombudsman to protect the interests of patients.
    In that event, a party may move the court for an order directing
    the appointment of an ombudsman.
      When the appointment of a patient care ombudsman is ordered, the
    United States trustee is required to appoint a disinterested person
    to serve in that capacity. Court approval of the appointment is not
    required, but subdivision (c) requires the person appointed, if not
    a State Long-Term Care Ombudsman, to file a verified statement
    similar to the statement filed by professional persons under Rule
    2014 so that parties in interest will have information relevant to
    disinterestedness. If a party believes that the person appointed is
    not disinterested, it may file a motion asking the court to find
    that the person is not eligible to serve.
      Subdivision (d) permits parties in interest to move for the
    termination of the appointment of a patient care ombudsman. If the
    movant can show that there no longer is any need for the ombudsman,
    the court may order the termination of the appointment.
      Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after
    publication.

    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute
    a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules,

-STATUTE-
      The United States trustee shall immediately notify the person
    selected as trustee how to qualify and, if applicable, the amount
    of the trustee's bond. A trustee that has filed a blanket bond
    pursuant to Rule 2010 and has been selected as trustee in a chapter
    7, chapter 12, or chapter 13 case that does not notify the court
    and the United States trustee in writing of rejection of the office
    within seven days after receipt of notice of selection shall be
    deemed to have accepted the office. Any other person selected as
    trustee shall notify the court and the United States trustee in
    writing of acceptance of the office within seven days after receipt
    of notice of selection or shall be deemed to have rejected the
    office.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 209(c). The
    remainder of that rule is inapplicable because its provisions are
    covered by Secs. 701-703, 321 of the Code.
      If the person selected as trustee accepts the office, he must
    qualify within five days after his selection, as required by Sec.
    322(a) of the Code.
      In districts having a standing trustee for chapter 13 cases, a
    blanket acceptance of the appointment would be sufficient for
    compliance by the standing trustee with this rule.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The rule is amended to eliminate the need for a standing chapter
    13 trustee or member of the panel of chapter 7 trustees to accept
    or reject an appointment.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments to this rule relating to the United States trustee
    are derived from Rule X-1004(a) and conform to the 1986 amendments
    to the Code and 28 U.S.C. Sec. 586 which provide that the United
    States trustee appoints and supervises trustees, and in a chapter 7
    case presides over any election of a trustee. This rule applies

    Rule 2009. Trustees for Estates When Joint Administration Ordered

-STATUTE-
      (a) Election of Single Trustee for Estates Being Jointly
    Administered. If the court orders a joint administration of two or
    more estates under Rule 1015(b), creditors may elect a single
    trustee for the estates being jointly administered, unless the case
    is under subchapter V of chapter 7 of the Code.
      (b) Right of Creditors To Elect Separate Trustee. Notwithstanding
    entry of an order for joint administration under Rule 1015(b), the
    creditors of any debtor may elect a separate trustee for the estate
    of the debtor as provided in Sec. 702 of the Code, unless the case
    is under subchapter V of chapter 7.
      (c) Appointment of Trustees for Estates Being Jointly
    Administered.
        (1) Chapter 7 Liquidation Cases. Except in a case governed by
      subchapter V of chapter 7, the United States trustee may appoint
      one or more interim trustees for estates being jointly
      administered in chapter 7 cases.
        (2) Chapter 11 Reorganization Cases. If the appointment of a
      trustee is ordered, the United States trustee may appoint one or
      more trustees for estates being jointly administered in chapter
      11 cases.
        (3) Chapter 12 Family Farmer's Debt Adjustment Cases. The
      United States trustee may appoint one or more trustees for
      estates being jointly administered in chapter 12 cases.
        (4) Chapter 13 Individual's Debt Adjustment Cases. The United
      States trustee may appoint one or more trustees for estates being
      jointly administered in chapter 13 cases.

      (d) Potential Conflicts of Interest. On a showing that creditors
    or equity security holders of the different estates will be
    prejudiced by conflicts of interest of a common trustee who has
    been elected or appointed, the court shall order the selection of
    separate trustees for estates being jointly administered.
      (e) Separate Accounts. The trustee or trustees of estates being
    jointly administered shall keep separate accounts of the property
    and distribution of each estate.

    concerning creditor election of a trustee apply only in a chapter 7
    case because it is only pursuant to Sec. 702 of the Code that
    creditors may elect a trustee. Subdivision (c) of the rule applies
    in chapter 11 and 13 as well as chapter 7 cases; pursuant to Sec.
    1104 of the Code, the court may order the appointment of a trustee
    on application of a party in interest and, pursuant to Sec. 1163 of
    the Code, the court must appoint a trustee in a railroad
    reorganization case. Subdivision (c) should not be taken as an
    indication that more than one trustee may be appointed for a single
    debtor. Section 1104(c) permits only one trustee for each estate.
    In a chapter 13 case, if there is no standing trustee, the court is
    to appoint a person to serve as trustee pursuant to Sec. 1302 of
    the Code. There is no provision for a trustee in a chapter 9 case,
    except for a very limited purpose; see Sec. 926 of the Code.
      This rule recognizes that economical and expeditious
    administration of two or more estates may be facilitated not only
    by the selection of a single trustee for a partnership and its
    partners, but by such selection whenever estates are being jointly
    administered pursuant to Rule 1015. See In the Matter of
    International Oil Co., 427 F.2d 186, 187 (2d Cir. 1970). The rule
    is derived from former Sec. 5c of the Act and former Bankruptcy
    Rule 210. The premise of Sec. 5c of the Act was that
    notwithstanding the potentiality of conflict between the interests
    of the creditors of the partners and those of the creditors of the
    partnership, the conflict is not sufficiently serious or frequent
    in most cases to warrant the selection of separate trustees for the
    firm and the several partners. Even before the proviso was added to
    Sec. 5c of the Act in 1938 to permit the creditors of a general
    partner to elect their separate trustee for his estate, it was held
    that the court had discretion to permit such an election or to make
    a separate appointment when a conflict of interest was recognized.
    In re Wood, 248 Fed. 246, 249-50 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 247 U.S.
    512 (1918); 4 Collier, Bankruptcy &#182; 723.04 (15th ed. 1980).
    The rule retains in subdivision (e) the features of the practice
    respecting the selection of a trustee that was developed under Sec.
    5 of the Act. Subdivisions (a) and (c) permit the court to
    authorize election of a single trustee or to make a single
    appointment when joint administration of estates of other kinds of
    debtors is ordered, but subdivision (d) requires the court to make
    a preliminary evaluation of the risks of conflict of interest. If
    after the election or appointment of a common trustee a conflict of
    interest materializes, the court must take appropriate action to
    deal with it.
      Subdivision (f) is derived from Sec. 5e of the Act and former
    Bankruptcy Rule 210(f) and requires that the common trustee keep a
    separate account for each estate in all cases that are jointly
    administered.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      One or more trustees may be appointed for estates being jointly
    administered in chapter 12 cases.
      The amendments to this rule are derived from Rule X-1005 and are
    necessary because the United States trustee, rather than the court,
    has responsibility for appointing trustees pursuant to Secs. 701,
    1104, 1202, and 1302 of the Code.
      If separate trustees are ordered for chapter 7 estates pursuant
    to subdivision (d), separate and successor trustees should be
    chosen as prescribed in Sec. 703 of the Code. If the occasion for
    another election arises, the United States trustee should call a
    meeting of creditors for this purpose. An order to select separate
    trustees does not disqualify an appointed or elected trustee from
    serving for one of the estates.
      Subdivision (e) is abrogated because the exercise of discretion
    by the United States trustee, who is in the Executive Branch, is
    not subject to advance restriction by rule of court. United States
    v. Cox, 342 F.2d 167 (5th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 365 U.S. 863
    (1965); United States v. Frumento, 409 F.Supp. 136, 141 (E.D.Pa.),
    aff'd, 563 F.2d 1083 (3d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1072
    (1977); see, Smith v. United States, 375 F.2d 243 (5th Cir. 1967);
    House Report No. 95-595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 110 (1977). However,
    a trustee appointed by the United States trustee may be removed by
    the court for cause. See Sec. 324 of the Code. Subdivision (d) of
    this rule, as amended, is consistent with Sec. 324. Subdivision (f)
    is redesignated as subdivision (e).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to reflect the enactment of subchapter V of
    chapter 7 of the Code governing multilateral clearing organization
    liquidations. Section 782 of the Code provides that the designation
    of a trustee or alternative trustee for the case is made by the
    Federal Reserve Board. Therefore, neither the United States trustee
    nor the creditors can appoint or elect a trustee in these cases.
      Other amendments are stylistic.

      (a) Blanket Bond. The United States trustee may authorize a
    blanket bond in favor of the United States conditioned on the
    faithful performance of official duties by the trustee or trustees
    to cover (1) a person who qualifies as trustee in a number of
    cases, and (2) a number of trustees each of whom qualifies in a
    different case.
      (b) Proceeding on Bond. A proceeding on the trustee's bond may be
    brought by any party in interest in the name of the United States
    for the use of the entity injured by the breach of the condition.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Subdivisions (a) and (b). Subdivision (a) gives authority for
    approval by the court of a single bond to cover (1) a person who
    qualifies as trustee in a number of cases, and (2) a number of
    trustees each of whom qualifies in a different case. The cases need
    not be related in any way. Substantial economies can be effected if
    a single bond covering a number of different cases can be issued
    and approved at one time. When a blanket bond is filed, the trustee
    qualifies under subdivision (b) of the rule by filing an acceptance
    of the office.
      Subdivision (c) prescribes the evidentiary effect of a certified
    copy of an order approving the trustee's bond given by a trustee
    under this rule or, when a blanket bond has been authorized, of a
    certified copy of acceptance. This rule supplements the Federal
    Rules of Evidence, which apply in bankruptcy cases. See Rule 1101
    of the Federal Rules of Evidence. The order of approval should
    conform to Official Form No. 25. See, however, Sec. 549(c) of the
    Code which provides only for the filing of the petition in the real
    estate records to serve as constructive notice of the pendency of
    the case. See also Rule 2011 which prescribes the evidentiary
    effect of a certificate that the debtor is a debtor in possession.
      Subdivision (d) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 212(f).
    Reference should be made to Sec. 322(a) and (d) of the Code which
    requires the bond to be filed with the bankruptcy court and places
    a two year limitation for the commencement of a proceeding on the
    bond. A bond filed under this rule should conform to Official Form
    No. 25. A proceeding on the bond of a trustee is governed by the
    rules in Part VII. See the Note accompanying Rule 7001. See also
    Rule 9025.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b) is deleted because of the amendment to Rule 2008.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to conform to the 1986 amendment of Sec. 322
    of the Code. The United States trustee determines the amount and
    sufficiency of the trustee's bond. The amendment to subdivision (a)
    is derived from Rule X-1004(b).
      Subdivision (b) is abrogated because an order approving a bond is
    no longer necessary in view of the 1986 amendments to Sec. 322 of
    the Code. Subdivision (c) is redesignated as subdivision (b).

    certify and the certificate shall constitute conclusive evidence of
    that fact.

      This rule prescribes the evidentiary effect of a certificate
    issued by the clerk that the debtor is a debtor in possession. See
    Official Form No. 26. Only chapter 11 of the Code provides for a
    debtor in possession. See Sec. 1107(a) of the Code. If, however, a
    trustee is appointed in the chapter 11 case, there will not be a
    debtor in possession. See Secs. 1101(1), 1105 of the Code.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to provide a procedure for proving that a
    trustee has qualified in accordance with Sec. 322 of the Code.
    Subdivision (b) is added so that the court and the United States
    trustee will be informed if the person selected as trustee pursuant
    to Secs. 701, 702, 1104, 1202, 1302, or 1163 fails to qualify

    Rule 2012. Substitution of Trustee or Successor Trustee; Accounting

-STATUTE-
      (a) Trustee. If a trustee is appointed in a chapter 11 case or
    the debtor is removed as debtor in possession in a chapter 12 case,
    the trustee is substituted automatically for the debtor in
    possession as a party in any pending action, proceeding, or matter.
      (b) Successor Trustee. When a trustee dies, resigns, is removed,
    or otherwise ceases to hold office during the pendency of a case
    under the Code (1) the successor is automatically substituted as a
    party in any pending action, proceeding, or matter; and (2) the
    successor trustee shall prepare, file, and transmit to the United
    States trustee an accounting of the prior administration of the
    estate.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Paragraph (1) of this rule implements Sec. 325 of the Code. It
    provides that a pending action or proceeding continues without
    abatement and that the trustee's successor is automatically
    substituted as a party whether it be another trustee or the debtor
    returned to possession, as such party.
      Paragraph (2) places it within the responsibility of a successor
    trustee to file an accounting of the prior administration of the
    estate. If an accounting is impossible to obtain from the prior
    trustee because of death or lack of cooperation, prior reports
    submitted in the earlier administration may be updated.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is new. The subdivision provides for the
    substitution of a trustee appointed in a chapter 11 case for the
    debtor in possession in any pending litigation.
      The original provisions of the rule are now in subdivision (b).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to include any chapter 12 case in
    which the debtor is removed as debtor in possession pursuant to
    Sec. 1204(a) of the Code.
      Subdivision (b) is amended to require that the accounting of the
    prior administration which must be filed with the court is also
    transmitted to the United States trustee who is responsible for
    supervising the administration of cases and trustees. See 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 586(a)(3). Because a court order is not required for the
    appointment of a successor trustee, requiring the court to fix a
    time for filing the accounting is inefficient and unnecessary. The
    United States trustee has supervisory powers over trustees and may
    require the successor trustee to file the accounting within a
    certain time period. If the successor trustee fails to file the
    accounting within a reasonable time, the United States trustee or a
    party in interest may take appropriate steps including a request
    for an appropriate court order. See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 586(a)(3)(G).
    The words "with the court" are deleted in subdivision (b)(2) as
    unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).

      (a) Record To Be Kept. The clerk shall maintain a public record
    listing fees awarded by the court (1) to trustees and attorneys,
    accountants, appraisers, auctioneers and other professionals
    employed by trustees, and (2) to examiners. The record shall
    include the name and docket number of the case, the name of the
    individual or firm receiving the fee and the amount of the fee
    awarded. The record shall be maintained chronologically and shall
    be kept current and open to examination by the public without
    charge. "Trustees," as used in this rule, does not include debtors
    in possession.
      (b) Summary of Record. At the close of each annual period, the
    clerk shall prepare a summary of the public record by individual or
    firm name, to reflect total fees awarded during the preceding year.
    The summary shall be open to examination by the public without
    charge. The clerk shall transmit a copy of the summary to the

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is adapted from former Rule 213. The first sentence of
    that rule is omitted because of the provisions in 28 U.S.C. Secs.
    586 and 604(f) creating panels of private trustees.
      The rule is not applicable to standing trustees serving in
    chapter 13 cases. See Sec. 1302 of the Code.
      A basic purpose of the rule is to prevent what Congress has
    defined as "cronyism." Appointment or employment, whether in a
    chapter 7 or 11 case, should not center among a small select group
    of individuals unless the circumstances are such that it would be
    warranted. The public record of appointments to be kept by the
    clerk will provide a means for monitoring the appointment process.
      Subdivision (b) provides a convenient source for public review of
    fees paid from debtors' estates in the bankruptcy courts. Thus,
    public recognition of appointments, fairly distributed and based on
    professional qualifications and expertise, will be promoted and
    notions of improper favor dispelled. This rule is in keeping with
    the findings of the Congressional subcommittees as set forth in the
    House Report of the Committee on the Judiciary, No. 95-595, 95th
    Cong., 1st Sess. 89-99 (1977). These findings included the
    observations that there were frequent appointments of the same
    person, contacts developed between the bankruptcy bar and the
    courts, and an unusually close relationship between the bar and the
    judges developed over the years. A major purpose of the new statute
    is to dilute these practices and instill greater public confidence
    in the system. Rule 2013 implements that laudatory purpose.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      In subdivisions (b) and (c) the word awarded is substituted for
    the word paid. While clerks do not know if fees are paid, they can
    determine what fees are awarded by the court.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is deleted. The matter contained in this
    subdivision is more properly left for regulation by the United
    States trustee. When appointing trustees and examiners and when
    monitoring applications for employment of auctioneers, appraisers
    and other professionals, the United States trustee should be
    sensitive to disproportionate or excessive fees received by any
    person.
      Subdivision (b), redesignated as subdivision (a), is amended to
    reflect the fact that the United States trustee appoints examiners
    subject to court approval.
      Subdivision (c), redesignated as subdivision (b), is amended to
    furnish the United States trustee with a copy of the annual summary
    which may assist that office in the performance of its
    responsibilities under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 586 and the Code.
      The rule is not applicable to standing trustees serving in
    chapter 12 cases. See Sec. 1202 of the Code.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Application for and Order of Employment. An order approving
    the employment of attorneys, accountants, appraisers, auctioneers,
    agents, or other professionals pursuant to Sec. 327, Sec. 1103, or
    Sec. 1114 of the Code shall be made only on application of the
    trustee or committee. The application shall be filed and, unless
    the case is a chapter 9 municipality case, a copy of the
    application shall be transmitted by the applicant to the United
    States trustee. The application shall state the specific facts
    showing the necessity for the employment, the name of the person to
    be employed, the reasons for the selection, the professional
    services to be rendered, any proposed arrangement for compensation,
    and, to the best of the applicant's knowledge, all of the person's
    connections with the debtor, creditors, any other party in
    interest, their respective attorneys and accountants, the United
    States trustee, or any person employed in the office of the United
    States trustee. The application shall be accompanied by a verified
    statement of the person to be employed setting forth the person's
    connections with the debtor, creditors, any other party in
    interest, their respective attorneys and accountants, the United
    States trustee, or any person employed in the office of the United
    States trustee.
      (b) Services Rendered by Member or Associate of Firm of Attorneys
    or Accountants. If, under the Code and this rule, a law partnership
    or corporation is employed as an attorney, or an accounting
    partnership or corporation is employed as an accountant, or if a
    named attorney or accountant is employed, any partner, member, or
    regular associate of the partnership, corporation, or individual
    may act as attorney or accountant so employed, without further
    order of the court.

      Subdivision (a) is adapted from the second sentence of former
    Bankruptcy Rule 215(a). The remainder of that rule is covered by
    Sec. 327 of the Code.
      Subdivision (b) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 215(f).
    The compensation provisions are set forth in Sec. 504 of the Code.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to include retention of professionals by
    committees of retired employees pursuant to Sec. 1114 of the Code.
      The United States trustee monitors applications filed under Sec.
    327 of the Code and may file with the court comments with respect
    to the approval of such applications. See 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    586(a)(3)(H). The United States trustee also monitors creditors'
    committees in accordance with 28 U.S.C. Sec. 586(a)(3)(E). The
    addition of the second sentence of subdivision (a) is designed to
    enable the United States trustee to perform these duties.
      Subdivision (a) is also amended to require disclosure of the
    professional's connections with the United States trustee or
    persons employed in the United States trustee's office. This
    requirement is not intended to prohibit the employment of such
    persons in all cases or to enlarge the definition of "disinterested
    person" in Sec. 101(13) of the Code. However, the court may
    consider a connection with the United States trustee's office as a
    factor when exercising its discretion. Also, this information
    should be revealed in the interest of full disclosure and
    confidence in the bankruptcy system, especially since the United
    States trustee monitors and may be heard on applications for
    compensation and reimbursement of professionals employed under this
    rule.
      The United States trustee appoints committees pursuant to Sec.
    1102 of the Code which is applicable in chapter 9 cases under Sec.
    901. In the interest of full disclosure and confidence in the
    bankruptcy system, a connection between the United States trustee
    and a professional employed by the committee should be revealed in
    every case, including a chapter 9 case. However, since the United
    States trustee does not have any role in the employment of
    professionals in chapter 9 cases, it is not necessary in such cases
    to transmit to the United States trustee a copy of the application
    under subdivision (a) of this rule. See 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    586(a)(3)(H).

-HEAD-
    Rule 2015. Duty to Keep Records, Make Reports, and Give Notice of
      Case or Change of Status

-STATUTE-
      (a) Trustee or Debtor in Possession. A trustee or debtor in
    possession shall:
        (1) in a chapter 7 liquidation case and, if the court directs,
      in a chapter 11 reorganization case file and transmit to the
      United States trustee a complete inventory of the property of the
      debtor within 30 days after qualifying as a trustee or debtor in
      possession, unless such an inventory has already been filed;
        (2) keep a record of receipts and the disposition of money and
      property received;
        (3) file the reports and summaries required by Sec. 704(8) of
      the Code which shall include a statement, if payments are made to
      employees, of the amounts of deductions for all taxes required to
      be withheld or paid for and in behalf of employees and the place
      where these amounts are deposited;
        (4) as soon as possible after the commencement of the case,
      give notice of the case to every entity known to be holding money
      or property subject to withdrawal or order of the debtor,
      including every bank, savings or building and loan association,
      public utility company, and landlord with whom the debtor has a
      deposit, and to every insurance company which has issued a policy
      having a cash surrender value payable to the debtor, except that
      notice need not be given to any entity who has knowledge or has
      previously been notified of the case;
        (5) in a chapter 11 reorganization case, on or before the last
      day of the month after each calendar quarter during which there
      is a duty to pay fees under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1930(a)(6), file and
      transmit to the United States trustee a statement of any
      disbursements made during that quarter and of any fees payable
      under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1930(a)(6) for that quarter; and
        (6) in a chapter 11 small business case, unless the court, for
      cause, sets another reporting interval, file and transmit to the
      United States trustee for each calendar month after the order for
      relief, on the appropriate Official Form, the report required by
      Sec. 308. If the order for relief is within the first 15 days of
      a calendar month, a report shall be filed for the portion of the
      month that follows the order for relief. If the order for relief
      is after the 15th day of a calendar month, the period for the
      remainder of the month shall be included in the report for the
      next calendar month. Each report shall be filed no later than 21
      days after the last day of the calendar month following the month
      covered by the report. The obligation to file reports under this
      subparagraph terminates on the effective date of the plan, or
      conversion or dismissal of the case.

      (b) Chapter 12 Trustee and Debtor in Possession. In a chapter 12
    family farmer's debt adjustment case, the debtor in possession
    shall perform the duties prescribed in clauses (2)-(4) of
    subdivision (a) of this rule and, if the court directs, shall file
    and transmit to the United States trustee a complete inventory of
    the property of the debtor within the time fixed by the court. If
    the debtor is removed as debtor in possession, the trustee shall
    perform the duties of the debtor in possession prescribed in this
    paragraph.
      (c) Chapter 13 Trustee and Debtor.
        (1) Business Cases. In a chapter 13 individual's debt
      adjustment case, when the debtor is engaged in business, the
      debtor shall perform the duties prescribed by clauses (2)-(4) of
      subdivision (a) of this rule and, if the court directs, shall
      file and transmit to the United States trustee a complete
      inventory of the property of the debtor within the time fixed by
      the court.
        (2) Nonbusiness Cases. In a chapter 13 individual's debt
      adjustment case, when the debtor is not engaged in business, the
      trustee shall perform the duties prescribed by clause (2) of
      subdivision (a) of this rule.

      (d) Foreign Representative. In a case in which the court has
    granted recognition of a foreign proceeding under chapter 15, the
    foreign representative shall file any notice required under Sec.
    1518 of the Code within 14 days after the date when the
    representative becomes aware of the subsequent information.
      (e) Transmission of Reports. In a chapter 11 case the court may
    direct that copies or summaries of annual reports and copies or
    summaries of other reports shall be mailed to the creditors, equity
    security holders, and indenture trustees. The court may also direct
    the publication of summaries of any such reports. A copy of every
    report or summary mailed or published pursuant to this subdivision
    shall be transmitted to the United States trustee.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule combines the provisions found in former Rules 218, 10-
    208, 11-30 and 13-208 of the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. It
    specifies various duties which are in addition to those required by
    Secs. 704, 1106, 1302 and 1304 of the Code.
      In subdivision (a) the times permitted to be fixed by the court
    in clause (3) for the filing of reports and summaries may be fixed
    by local rule or order.
      Subdivision (b). This subdivision prescribes duties on either the
    debtor or trustee in chapter 13 cases, depending on whether or not
    the debtor is engaged in business (Sec. 1304 of the Code). The duty
    of giving notice prescribed by subdivision (a)(4) is not included
    in a nonbusiness case because of its impracticability.
      Subdivision (c) is derived from former Chapter X Rule 10-208(c)
    which, in turn, was derived from Sec. 190 of the Act. The equity
    security holders to whom the reports should be sent are those of
    record at the time of transmittal of such reports.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to add as a duty of the trustee or
    debtor in possession the filing of a notice of or a copy of the
    petition. The filing of such notice or a copy of the petition is
    essential to the protection of the estate from unauthorized post-
    petition conveyances of real property. Section 549(c) of the Code
    protects the title of a good faith purchaser for fair equivalent
    value unless the notice or copy of the petition is filed.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to provide the United States trustee with
    information needed to perform supervisory responsibilities in
    accordance with 28 U.S.C. Sec. 586(a)(3) and to exercise the right
    to raise, appear and be heard on issues pursuant to Sec. 307 of the
    Code.
      Subdivision (a)(3) is amended to conform to the 1986 amendments
    to Sec. 704(8) of the Code and the United States trustee system. It
    may not be necessary for the court to fix a time to file reports if
    the United States trustee requests that they be filed within a
    specified time and there is no dispute regarding such time.
      Subdivision (a)(5) is deleted because the filing of a notice of
    or copy of the petition to protect real property against
    unauthorized postpetition transfers in a particular case is within
    the discretion of the trustee.
      The new subdivision (a)(5) was added to enable the United States
    trustee, parties in interest, and the court to determine the
    appropriate quarterly fee required by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1930(a)(6).
    The requirements of subdivision (a)(5) should be satisfied whenever
    possible by including this information in other reports filed by
    the trustee or debtor in possession. Nonpayment of the fee may
    result in dismissal or conversion of the case pursuant to Sec.
    1112(b) of the Code.
      Rule X-1007(b), which provides that the trustee or debtor in
    possession shall cooperate with the United States trustee by
    furnishing information that the United States trustee reasonably
    requires, is deleted as unnecessary. The deletion of Rule X-1007(b)
    should not be construed as a limitation of the powers of the United
    States trustee or of the duty of the trustee or debtor in
    possession to cooperate with the United States trustee in the
    performance of the statutory responsibilities of that office.
      Subdivision (a)(6) is abrogated as unnecessary. See Sec.
    1106(a)(7) of the Code.
      Subdivision (a)(7) is abrogated. The closing of a chapter 11 case
    is governed by Rule 3022.
      New subdivision (b), which prescribes the duties of the debtor in
    possession and trustee in a chapter 12 case, does not prohibit
    additional reporting requirements pursuant to local rule or court
    order.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1996 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a)(1) provides that the trustee in a chapter 7 case
    and, if the court directs, the trustee or debtor in possession in a
    chapter 11 case, is required to file and transmit to the United
    States trustee a complete inventory of the debtor's property within
    30 days after qualifying as trustee or debtor in possession, unless
    such an inventory has already been filed. Subdivisions (b) and (c)
    are amended to clarify that a debtor in possession and trustee in a
    chapter 12 case, and a debtor in a chapter 13 case where the debtor
    is engaged in business, are not required to file and transmit to
    the United States trustee a complete inventory of the property of
    the debtor unless the court so directs. If the court so directs,
    the court also fixes the time limit for filing and transmitting the
    inventory.
      GAP Report on Rule 2015. No changes since publication, except for
    a stylistic change in the first sentence of the committee note.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a)(5) is amended to provide that the duty to file
    quarterly disbursement reports continues only so long as there is
    an obligation to make quarterly payments to the United States
    trustee under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1930(a)(6).
      Other amendments are stylistic.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were
    made.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      Subparagraph (a)(6) implements Sec. 308 of the Code, added by the
    2005 amendments. That section requires small business chapter 11
    debtors to file periodic financial and operating reports, and the
    rule sets the time for filing those reports and requires the use of
    an Official Form for the report. The obligation to file reports
    under this rule does not relieve the trustee or debtor of any other
    obligations to provide information or documents to the United
    States trustee.
      The rule also is amended to fix the time for the filing of
    notices under Sec. 1518, added to the Code in 2005. Former
    subdivision (d) is renumbered as subdivision (e).
      Other changes are stylistic.
      Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after
    publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to
    substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout
    the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 15-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 20-day periods become 21-day periods
        -- 25-day periods become 28-day periods

    Rule 2015.1. Patient Care Ombudsman

-STATUTE-
      (a) Reports. A patient care ombudsman, at least 14 days before
    making a report under Sec. 333(b)(2) of the Code, shall give notice
    that the report will be made to the court, unless the court orders
    otherwise. The notice shall be transmitted to the United States
    trustee, posted conspicuously at the health care facility that is
    the subject of the report, and served on: the debtor; the trustee;
    all patients; and any committee elected under Sec. 705 or appointed
    under Sec. 1102 of the Code or its authorized agent, or, if the
    case is a chapter 9 municipality case or a chapter 11
    reorganization case and no committee of unsecured creditors has
    been appointed under Sec. 1102, on the creditors included on the
    list filed under Rule 1007(d); and such other entities as the court
    may direct. The notice shall state the date and time when the
    report will be made, the manner in which the report will be made,
    and, if the report is in writing, the name, address, telephone
    number, email address, and website, if any, of the person from whom
    a copy of the report may be obtained at the debtor's expense.
      (b) Authorization to Review Confidential Patient Records. A
    motion by a patient care ombudsman under Sec. 333(c) to review
    confidential patient records shall be governed by Rule 9014, served
    on the patient and any family member or other contact person whose
    name and address have been given to the trustee or the debtor for
    the purpose of providing information regarding the patient's health
    care, and transmitted to the United States trustee subject to
    applicable nonbankruptcy law relating to patient privacy. Unless
    the court orders otherwise, a hearing on the motion may not be
    commenced earlier than 14 days after service of the motion.

-MISC1-
                      COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008                  
      This rule is new and implements Sec. 333 of the Code, added by
    the 2005 amendments. Subdivision (a) is designed to give parties in
    interest, including patients or their representatives, sufficient
    notice so that they will be able to review written reports or
    attend hearings at which reports are made. The rule permits a
    notice to relate to a single report or to periodic reports to be
    given during the case. For example, the ombudsman may give notice
    that reports will be made at specified intervals or dates during
    the case.
      Subdivision (a) of the rule also requires that the notice be
    posted conspicuously at the health care facility in a place where
    it will be seen by patients and their families or others visiting
    the patients. This may require posting in common areas and patient
    rooms within the facility. Because health care facilities and the
    patients they serve can vary greatly, the locations of the posted
    notice should be tailored to the specific facility that is the
    subject of the report.
      Subdivision (b) requires the ombudsman to notify the patient and
    the United States trustee that the ombudsman is seeking access to
    confidential patient records so that they will be able to appear
    and be heard on the matter. This procedure should assist the court
    in reaching its decision both as to access to the records and
    appropriate restrictions on that access to ensure continued
    confidentiality. Notices given under this rule are subject to the
    provisions of applicable federal and state law that relate to the
    protection of patients' privacy, such as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-191
    (HIPAA).
      Changes Made After Publication. Two stylistic changes were made
    to the rule. The reference to the court's authority to order
    otherwise was moved from the beginning to the end of the first
    sentence of subdivision (a). On line 19, the word "patient" was
    substituted for "health" to be consistent with the Code.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to
    substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout
    the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods

    Rule 2015.2. Transfer of Patient in Health Care Business Case

-STATUTE-
      Unless the court orders otherwise, if the debtor is a health care
    business, the trustee may not transfer a patient to another health
    care business under Sec. 704(a)(12) of the Code unless the trustee
    gives at least 14 days' notice of the transfer to the patient care
    ombudsman, if any, the patient, and any family member or other
    contact person whose name and address has been given to the trustee
    or the debtor for the purpose of providing information regarding
    the patient's health care. The notice is subject to applicable
    nonbankruptcy law relating to patient privacy.

-SOURCE-

-MISC1-
                      COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008                  
      This rule is new. Section 704(a)(12), added to the Code by the
    2005 amendments, authorizes the trustee to relocate patients when a
    health care business debtor's facility is in the process of being
    closed. The Code permits the trustee to take this action without
    the need for any court order, but the notice required by this rule
    will enable a patient care ombudsman appointed under Sec. 333, or a
    patient who contends that the trustee's actions violate Sec.
    704(a)(12), to have those issues resolved before the patient is
    transferred.
      This rule also permits the court to enter an order dispensing
    with or altering the notice requirement in proper circumstances.
    For example, a facility could be closed immediately, or very
    quickly, such that 10 days' notice would not be possible in some
    instances. In that event, the court may shorten the time required
    for notice.
      Notices given under this rule are subject to the provisions of
    applicable federal and state law that relate to the protection of
    patients' privacy, such as the Health Insurance Portability and
    Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-191 (HIPAA).

    Rule 2015.3. Reports of Financial Information on Entities in Which
      a Chapter 11 Estate Holds a Controlling or Substantial Interest

-STATUTE-
      (a) Reporting Requirement. In a chapter 11 case, the trustee or
    debtor in possession shall file periodic financial reports of the
    value, operations, and profitability of each entity that is not a
    publicly traded corporation or a debtor in a case under title 11,
    and in which the estate holds a substantial or controlling
    interest. The reports shall be prepared as prescribed by the
    appropriate Official Form, and shall be based upon the most recent
    information reasonably available to the trustee or debtor in
    possession.
      (b) Time for Filing; Service. The first report required by this
    rule shall be filed no later than seven days before the first date
    set for the meeting of creditors under Sec. 341 of the Code.
    Subsequent reports shall be filed no less frequently than every six
    months thereafter, until the effective date of a plan or the case
    is dismissed or converted. Copies of the report shall be served on
    the United States trustee, any committee appointed under Sec. 1102
    of the Code, and any other party in interest that has filed a
    request therefor.
      (c) Presumption of Substantial or Controlling Interest; Judicial
    Determination. For purposes of this rule, an entity of which the
    estate controls or owns at least a 20 percent interest, shall be
    presumed to be an entity in which the estate has a substantial or
    controlling interest. An entity in which the estate controls or
    owns less than a 20 percent interest shall be presumed not to be an
    entity in which the estate has a substantial or controlling
    interest. Upon motion, the entity, any holder of an interest
    therein, the United States trustee, or any other party in interest
    may seek to rebut either presumption, and the court shall, after
    notice and a hearing, determine whether the estate's interest in
    the entity is substantial or controlling.
      (d) Modification of Reporting Requirement. The court may, after
    notice and a hearing, vary the reporting requirement established by
    subdivision (a) of this rule for cause, including that the trustee
    or debtor in possession is not able, after a good faith effort, to
    comply with those reporting requirements, or that the information
    required by subdivision (a) is publicly available.
      (e) Notice and Protective Orders. No later than 14 days before
    filing the first report required by this rule, the trustee or
    debtor in possession shall send notice to the entity in which the
    estate has a substantial or controlling interest, and to all
    holders - known to the trustee or debtor in possession - of an
    interest in that entity, that the trustee or debtor in possession
    expects to file and serve financial information relating to the
    entity in accordance with this rule. The entity in which the estate
    has a substantial or controlling interest, or a person holding an
    interest in that entity, may request protection of the information
    under Sec. 107 of the Code.
      (f) Effect of Request. Unless the court orders otherwise, the
    pendency of a request under subdivisions (c), (d), or (e) of this
    rule shall not alter or stay the requirements of subdivision (a).

      This rule implements Sec. 419 of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention
    and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 ("BAPCPA"). Reports are to be
    made on the appropriate Official Form. While Sec. 419 of BAPCPA
    places the obligation to report upon the "debtor," this rule
    extends the obligation to include cases in which a trustee has been
    appointed. The court can order that the reports not be filed in
    appropriate circumstances, such as when the information that would
    be included in these reports is already available to interested
    parties.
      Changes After Publication. In subdivision (e), the 20 day period
    was changed to 14 days. This better reconciles the timing of the
    notice and the scheduling of the Sec. 341 meeting of creditors, and
    it is also consistent with the upcoming time computation
    amendments.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute
    a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules,
    deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 15-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 20-day periods become 21-day periods

-HEAD-
    Rule 2016. Compensation for Services Rendered and Reimbursement of
      Expenses

-STATUTE-
      (a) Application for Compensation or Reimbursement. An entity
    seeking interim or final compensation for services, or
    reimbursement of necessary expenses, from the estate shall file an
    application setting forth a detailed statement of (1) the services
    rendered, time expended and expenses incurred, and (2) the amounts
    requested. An application for compensation shall include a
    statement as to what payments have theretofore been made or
    promised to the applicant for services rendered or to be rendered
    in any capacity whatsoever in connection with the case, the source
    of the compensation so paid or promised, whether any compensation
    previously received has been shared and whether an agreement or
    understanding exists between the applicant and any other entity for
    the sharing of compensation received or to be received for services
    rendered in or in connection with the case, and the particulars of
    any sharing of compensation or agreement or understanding therefor,
    except that details of any agreement by the applicant for the
    sharing of compensation as a member or regular associate of a firm
    of lawyers or accountants shall not be required. The requirements
    of this subdivision shall apply to an application for compensation
    for services rendered by an attorney or accountant even though the
    application is filed by a creditor or other entity. Unless the case
    is a chapter 9 municipality case, the applicant shall transmit to
    the United States trustee a copy of the application.
      (b) Disclosure of Compensation Paid or Promised to Attorney for
    Debtor. Every attorney for a debtor, whether or not the attorney
    applies for compensation, shall file and transmit to the United
    States trustee within 14 days after the order for relief, or at
    another time as the court may direct, the statement required by
    Sec. 329 of the Code including whether the attorney has shared or
    agreed to share the compensation with any other entity. The
    statement shall include the particulars of any such sharing or
    agreement to share by the attorney, but the details of any
    agreement for the sharing of the compensation with a member or
    regular associate of the attorney's law firm shall not be required.
    A supplemental statement shall be filed and transmitted to the
    United States trustee within 14 days after any payment or agreement
    not previously disclosed.
      (c) Disclosure of Compensation Paid or Promised to Bankruptcy
    Petition Preparer. Before a petition is filed, every bankruptcy
    petition preparer for a debtor shall deliver to the debtor, the
    declaration under penalty of perjury required by Sec. 110(h)(2).
    The declaration shall disclose any fee, and the source of any fee,
    received from or on behalf of the debtor within 12 months of the
    filing of the case and all unpaid fees charged to the debtor. The
    declaration shall also describe the services performed and
    documents prepared or caused to be prepared by the bankruptcy
    petition preparer. The declaration shall be filed with the
    petition. The petition preparer shall file a supplemental statement
    within 14 days after any payment or agreement not previously
    disclosed.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is derived from former Rule 219. Many of the former
    rule's requirements are, however, set forth in the Code. Section
    329 requires disclosure by an attorney of transactions with the
    debtor, Sec. 330 sets forth the bases for allowing compensation,
    and Sec. 504 prohibits sharing of compensation. This rule
    implements those various provisions.
      Subdivision (a) includes within its provisions a committee,
    member thereof, agent, attorney or accountant for the committee
    when compensation or reimbursement of expenses is sought from the
    estate.
      Regular associate of a law firm is defined in Rule 9001(9) to
    include any attorney regularly employed by, associated with, or
    counsel to that law firm. Firm is defined in Rule 9001(6) to
    include a partnership or professional corporation.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to change "person" to "entity". There
    are occasions in which a governmental unit may be entitled to file
    an application under this rule. The requirement that the
    application contain a "detailed statement of services rendered,
    time expended and expenses incurred" gives to the court authority
    to ensure that the application is both comprehensive and detailed.
    No amendments are made to delineate further the requirements of the
    application because the amount of detail to be furnished is a
    function of the nature of the services rendered and the complexity
    of the case.
      Subdivision (b) is amended to require that the attorney for the
    debtor file the Sec. 329 statement before the meeting of creditors.
    This will assist the parties in conducting the examination of the
    debtor. In addition, the amended rule requires the attorney to
    supplement the Sec. 329 statement if an undisclosed payment is made
    to the attorney or a new or amended agreement is entered into by
    the debtor and the attorney.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to enable the United States trustee to
    perform the duty to monitor applications for compensation and
    reimbursement filed under Sec. 330 of the Code. See 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    586(a)(3)(A).
      Subdivision (b) is amended to give the United States trustee the
    information needed to determine whether to request appropriate
    relief based on excessive fees under Sec. 329(b) of the Code. See
    Rule 2017.
      The words "with the court" are deleted in subdivisions (a) and
    (b) as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             
      This rule is amended by adding subdivision (c) to implement Sec.
    110(h)(1) of the Code.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes since
    publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute
    a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules,
    deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 15-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 20-day periods become 21-day periods
        -- 25-day periods become 28-day periods
      Subdivision (c) is amended to reflect the 2005 amendment to Sec.
    110(h)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code which now requires that the
    declaration be filed with the petition. The statute previously
    required that the petition preparer file the declaration within 10
    days after the filing of the petition. The amendment to the rule
    also corrects the cross reference to Sec. 110(h)(1), which was
    redesignated as subparagraph (h)(2) of Sec. 110 by the 2005
    amendment to the Code.
      Other changes are stylistic.

    Rule 2017. Examination of Debtor's Transactions with Debtor's
      Attorney

-STATUTE-
      (a) Payment or Transfer to Attorney Before Order for Relief. On
    motion by any party in interest or on the court's own initiative,
    the court after notice and a hearing may determine whether any
    payment of money or any transfer of property by the debtor, made
    directly or indirectly and in contemplation of the filing of a
    petition under the Code by or against the debtor or before entry of
    the order for relief in an involuntary case, to an attorney for
    services rendered or to be rendered is excessive.
      (b) Payment or Transfer to Attorney After Order for Relief. On
    motion by the debtor, the United States trustee, or on the court's
    own initiative, the court after notice and a hearing may determine
    whether any payment of money or any transfer of property, or any
    agreement therefor, by the debtor to an attorney after entry of an
    order for relief in a case under the Code is excessive, whether the
    payment or transfer is made or is to be made directly or
    indirectly, if the payment, transfer, or agreement therefor is for
    services in any way related to the case.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is derived from Sec. 60d of the Act and former
    Bankruptcy Rule 220 and implements Sec. 329 of the Code.
    Information required to be disclosed by the attorney for a debtor
    by Sec. 329 of the Code and by the debtor in his Statement of
    Financial Affairs (Item #15 of Form No. 7, Item #20 of Form No. 8)
    will assist the court in determining whether to proceed under this
    rule. Section 60d was enacted in recognition of "the temptation of
    a failing debtor to deal too liberally with his property in
    employing counsel to protect him in view of financial reverses and
    probable failure." In re Wood & Henderson, 210 U.S. 246, 253
    (1908). This rule, like Sec. 60d of the Act and Sec. 329 of the
    Code, is premised on the need for and appropriateness of judicial
    scrutiny of arrangements between a debtor and his attorney to
    protect the creditors of the estate and the debtor against
    overreaching by an officer of the court who is in a peculiarly
    advantageous position to impose on both the creditors and his
    client. 2 Collier, Bankruptcy &#182; 329.02 (15th ed. 1980);
    MacLachlan, Bankruptcy 318 (1956). Rule 9014 applies to any
    contested matter arising under this rule.
      This rule is not to be construed to permit post-petition payments
    or transfers which may be avoided under other provisions of the
    Code.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to include within subdivision (a) a payment
    or transfer of property by the debtor to an attorney after the
    filing of an involuntary petition but before the order for relief.
    Any party in interest should be able to make a motion for a
    determination of whether such payment or transfer is excessive
    because the funds or property transferred may be property of the
    estate.
      The United States trustee supervises and monitors the
    administration of bankruptcy cases other than chapter 9 cases and
    pursuant to Sec. 307 of the Code may raise, appear and be heard on
    issues relating to fees paid to the debtor's attorney. It is
    consistent with that role to expect the United States trustee to
    review statements filed under Rule 2016(b) and to file motions
    relating to excessive fees pursuant to Sec. 329 of the Code.

    Rule 2018. Intervention; Right to Be Heard

-STATUTE-
      (a) Permissive Intervention. In a case under the Code, after
    hearing on such notice as the court directs and for cause shown,
    the court may permit any interested entity to intervene generally
    or with respect to any specified matter.
      (b) Intervention by Attorney General of a State. In a chapter 7,
    11, 12, or 13 case, the Attorney General of a State may appear and
    be heard on behalf of consumer creditors if the court determines
    the appearance is in the public interest, but the Attorney General
    may not appeal from any judgment, order, or decree in the case.
      (c) Chapter 9 Municipality Case. The Secretary of the Treasury of
    the United States may, or if requested by the court shall,
    intervene in a chapter 9 case. Representatives of the state in
    which the debtor is located may intervene in a chapter 9 case with
    respect to matters specified by the court.
      (d) Labor Unions. In a chapter 9, 11, or 12 case, a labor union
    or employees' association, representative of employees of the
    debtor, shall have the right to be heard on the economic soundness
    of a plan affecting the interests of the employees. A labor union
    or employees' association which exercises its right to be heard
    under this subdivision shall not be entitled to appeal any
    judgment, order, or decree relating to the plan, unless otherwise
    permitted by law.
      (e) Service on Entities Covered by This Rule. The court may enter
    orders governing the service of notice and papers on entities
    permitted to intervene or be heard pursuant to this rule.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is derived from former Rules 8-210, 9-15 and 10-210 and
    it implements Secs. 1109 and 1164 of the Code.
      Pursuant to Sec. 1109 of the Code, parties in interest have a
    right to be heard and the Securities and Exchange Commission may
    raise and be heard on any issue but it may not take an appeal. That
    section is applicable in chapter 9 cases (Sec. 901 of the Code) and
    in chapter 11 cases, including cases under subchapter IV thereof
    for the reorganization of a railroad.
      In a railroad reorganization case under subchapter IV of chapter
    11, Sec. 1164 also gives the right to be heard to the Interstate
    Commerce Commission, the Department of Transportation and any state
    or local regulatory commission with jurisdiction over the debtor,
    but these entities may not appeal.
      This rule does not apply in adversary proceedings. For
    intervention in adversary proceedings, see Rule 7024. The rules do
    not provide any right of compensation to or reimbursement of
    expenses for intervenors or others covered by this rule. Section
    503(b)(3)(D) and (4) is not applicable to the entities covered by
    this rule.
      Subdivision (a) is derived from former Chapter VIII Rule 8-210
    and former Chapter X Rule 10-210. It permits intervention of an
    entity (see Sec. 101(14), (21) of the Code) not otherwise entitled
    to do so under the Code or this rule. Such a party seeking to
    intervene must show cause therefor.
      Subdivision (b) specifically grants the appropriate state's
    Attorney General the right to appear and be heard on behalf of
    consumer creditors when it is in the public interest. See House
    Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977) 189. While "consumer
    creditor" is not defined in the Code or elsewhere, it would include
    the type of individual entitled to priority under Sec. 507(a)(5) of
    the Code, that is, an individual who has deposited money for the
    purchase, lease or rental of property or the purchase of services
    for the personal, family, or household use of the individual. It
    would also include individuals who purchased or leased property for
    such purposes in connection with which there may exist claims for
    breach of warranty.
      This subdivision does not grant the Attorney General the status
    of party in interest. In other contexts, the Attorney General will,
    of course, be a party in interest as for example, in representing a
    state in connection with a tax claim.
      Subdivision (c) recognizes the possible interests of the
    Secretary of the Treasury or of the state of the debtor's locale
    when a municipality is the debtor. It is derived from former
    Chapter IX Rule 9-15 and Sec. 85(d) of the Act.
      Subdivision (d) is derived from former Chapter X Rule 10-210
    which, in turn, was derived from Sec. 206 of the Act. Section 206
    has no counterpart in the Code.
      Subdivision (e) is derived from former Chapter VIII Rule 8-
    210(d). It gives the court flexibility in directing the type of
    future notices to be given intervenors.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (d) is amended to make it clear that the prohibition
    against appeals by labor unions is limited only to their
    participation in connection with the hearings on the plan as
    provided in subdivision (d). If a labor union would otherwise have
    the right to file an appeal or to be a party to an appeal, this
    rule does not preclude the labor union from exercising that right.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT

    Rule 2019. Representation of Creditors and Equity Security Holders
      in Chapter 9 Municipality and Chapter 11 Reorganization Cases

-STATUTE-
      (a) Data Required. In a chapter 9 municipality or chapter 11
    reorganization case, except with respect to a committee appointed
    pursuant to Sec. 1102 or 1114 of the Code, every entity or
    committee representing more than one creditor or equity security
    holder and, unless otherwise directed by the court, every indenture
    trustee, shall file a verified statement setting forth (1) the name
    and address of the creditor or equity security holder; (2) the
    nature and amount of the claim or interest and the time of
    acquisition thereof unless it is alleged to have been acquired more
    than one year prior to the filing of the petition; (3) a recital of
    the pertinent facts and circumstances in connection with the
    employment of the entity or indenture trustee, and, in the case of
    a committee, the name or names of the entity or entities at whose
    instance, directly or indirectly, the employment was arranged or
    the committee was organized or agreed to act; and (4) with
    reference to the time of the employment of the entity, the
    organization or formation of the committee, or the appearance in
    the case of any indenture trustee, the amounts of claims or
    interests owned by the entity, the members of the committee or the
    indenture trustee, the times when acquired, the amounts paid
    therefor, and any sales or other disposition thereof. The statement
    shall include a copy of the instrument, if any, whereby the entity,
    committee, or indenture trustee is empowered to act on behalf of
    creditors or equity security holders. A supplemental statement
    shall be filed promptly, setting forth any material changes in the
    facts contained in the statement filed pursuant to this
    subdivision.
      (b) Failure To Comply; Effect. On motion of any party in interest
    or on its own initiative, the court may (1) determine whether there
    has been a failure to comply with the provisions of subdivision (a)
    of this rule or with any other applicable law regulating the
    activities and personnel of any entity, committee, or indenture
    trustee or any other impropriety in connection with any
    solicitation and, if it so determines, the court may refuse to
    permit that entity, committee, or indenture trustee to be heard
    further or to intervene in the case; (2) examine any representation
    provision of a deposit agreement, proxy, trust mortgage, trust
    indenture, or deed of trust, or committee or other authorization,
    and any claim or interest acquired by any entity or committee in
    contemplation or in the course of a case under the Code and grant
    appropriate relief; and (3) hold invalid any authority, acceptance,
    rejection, or objection given, procured, or received by an entity
    or committee who has not complied with this rule or with Sec.

      This rule is a comprehensive regulation of representation in
    chapter 9 municipality and in chapter 11 reorganization cases. It
    is derived from Secs. 209-213 of the Act and former Chapter X Rule
    10-211.
      Subdivision (b) is derived from Secs. 212, 213 of the Act. As
    used in clause (2), "other authorization" would include a power or
    warrant of attorney which are specifically mentioned in Sec. 212 of
    the Act. This rule deals with representation provisions in
    mortgages, trust deeds, etc. to protect the beneficiaries from
    unfair practices and the like. It does not deal with the validation
    or invalidation of security interests generally. If immediate
    compliance is not possible, the court may permit a representative
    to be heard on a specific matter, but there is no implicit waiver
    of compliance on a permanent basis.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to exclude from the requirements of
    this rule committees of retired employees appointed pursuant to
    Sec. 1114 of the Code. The words "with the clerk" are deleted as
    unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).

      The United States trustee performs administrative functions, such
    as the convening of the meeting of creditors and the appointment of
    trustees and committees. Most of the acts of the United States
    trustee are not controversial and will go unchallenged. However,
    the United States trustee is not a judicial officer and does not
    resolve disputes regarding the propriety of its own actions. This
    rule, which is new, provides a procedure for judicial review of the
    United States trustee's acts or failure to act in connection with
    the administration of the case. For example, if the United States
    trustee schedules a Sec. 341 meeting to be held 90 days after the
    petition is filed, and a party in interest wishes to challenge the
    propriety of that act in view of Sec. 341(a) of the Code and Rule
    2003 which requires that the meeting be held not more than 40 days
    after the order for relief, this rule permits the party to do so by
    motion.
      This rule provides for review of acts already committed by the
    United States trustee, but does not provide for advisory opinions
    in advance of the act. This rule is not intended to limit the
    discretion of the United States trustee, provided that the United
    States trustee's act is authorized by, and in compliance with, the
    Code, title 28, these rules, and other applicable law.

-HEAD-
    Rule 3001. Proof of Claim

-STATUTE-
      (a) Form and Content. A proof of claim is a written statement
    setting forth a creditor's claim. A proof of claim shall conform
    substantially to the appropriate Official Form.
      (b) Who May Execute. A proof of claim shall be executed by the
    creditor or the creditor's authorized agent except as provided in
    Rules 3004 and 3005.
      (c) Claim Based on a Writing. When a claim, or an interest in
    property of the debtor securing the claim, is based on a writing,
    the original or a duplicate shall be filed with the proof of claim.
    If the writing has been lost or destroyed, a statement of the
    circumstances of the loss or destruction shall be filed with the
    claim.
      (d) Evidence of Perfection of Security Interest. If a security
    interest in property of the debtor is claimed, the proof of claim
    shall be accompanied by evidence that the security interest has
    been perfected.
      (e) Transferred Claim.
        (1) Transfer of Claim Other Than for Security Before Proof
      Filed. If a claim has been transferred other than for security
      before proof of the claim has been filed, the proof of claim may
      be filed only by the transferee or an indenture trustee.
        (2) Transfer of Claim Other than for Security after Proof
      Filed. If a claim other than one based on a publicly traded note,
      bond, or debenture has been transferred other than for security
      after the proof of claim has been filed, evidence of the transfer
      shall be filed by the transferee. The clerk shall immediately
      notify the alleged transferor by mail of the filing of the
      evidence of transfer and that objection thereto, if any, must be
      filed within 21 days of the mailing of the notice or within any
      additional time allowed by the court. If the alleged transferor
      files a timely objection and the court finds, after notice and a
      hearing, that the claim has been transferred other than for
      security, it shall enter an order substituting the transferee for
      the transferor. If a timely objection is not filed by the alleged
      transferor, the transferee shall be substituted for the
      transferor.
        (3) Transfer of Claim for Security Before Proof Filed. If a
      claim other than one based on a publicly traded note, bond, or
      debenture has been transferred for security before proof of the
      claim has been filed, the transferor or transferee or both may
      file a proof of claim for the full amount. The proof shall be
      supported by a statement setting forth the terms of the transfer.
      If either the transferor or the transferee files a proof of
      claim, the clerk shall immediately notify the other by mail of
      the right to join in the filed claim. If both transferor and
      transferee file proofs of the same claim, the proofs shall be
      consolidated. If the transferor or transferee does not file an
      agreement regarding its relative rights respecting voting of the
      claim, payment of dividends thereon, or participation in the
      administration of the estate, on motion by a party in interest
      and after notice and a hearing, the court shall enter such orders
      respecting these matters as may be appropriate.
        (4) Transfer of Claim for Security after Proof Filed. If a
      claim other than one based on a publicly traded note, bond, or
      debenture has been transferred for security after the proof of
      claim has been filed, evidence of the terms of the transfer shall
      be filed by the transferee. The clerk shall immediately notify
      the alleged transferor by mail of the filing of the evidence of
      transfer and that objection thereto, if any, must be filed within
      21 days of the mailing of the notice or within any additional
      time allowed by the court. If a timely objection is filed by the
      alleged transferor, the court, after notice and a hearing, shall
      determine whether the claim has been transferred for security. If
      the transferor or transferee does not file an agreement regarding
      its relative rights respecting voting of the claim, payment of
      dividends thereon, or participation in the administration of the
      estate, on motion by a party in interest and after notice and a
      hearing, the court shall enter such orders respecting these
      matters as may be appropriate.
        (5) Service of Objection or Motion; Notice of Hearing. A copy
      of an objection filed pursuant to paragraph (2) or (4) or a
      motion filed pursuant to paragraph (3) or (4) of this subdivision
      together with a notice of a hearing shall be mailed or otherwise
      delivered to the transferor or transferee, whichever is
      appropriate, at least 30 days prior to the hearing.

      (f) Evidentiary Effect. A proof of claim executed and filed in
    accordance with these rules shall constitute prima facie evidence
    of the validity and amount of the claim.
      (g) (!1) To the extent not inconsistent with the United States
    Warehouse Act or applicable State law, a warehouse receipt, scale
    ticket, or similar document of the type routinely issued as
    evidence of title by a grain storage facility, as defined in
    section 557 of title 11, shall constitute prima facie evidence of
    the validity and amount of a claim of ownership of a quantity of
    grain.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rules 301 and 302.
    The Federal Rules of Evidence, made applicable to cases under the
    Code by Rule 1101, do not prescribe the evidentiary effect to be
    accorded particular documents. Subdivision (f) of this rule
    supplements the Federal Rules of Evidence as they apply to cases
    under the Code.
      Subdivision (c). This subdivision is similar to former Bankruptcy
    Rule 302(c) and continues the requirement for the filing of any
    written security agreement and provides that the filing of a
    duplicate of a writing underlying a claim authenticates the claim
    with the same effect as the filing of the original writing. Cf.
    Rules 1001(4) and 1003 of F.R. of Evid. Subdivision (d) together
    with the requirement in the first sentence of subdivision (c) for
    the filing of any written security agreement, is designed to
    facilitate the determination whether the claim is secured and
    properly perfected so as to be valid against the trustee.
      Subdivision (d). "Satisfactory evidence" of perfection, which is
    to accompany the proof of claim, would include a duplicate of an
    instrument filed or recorded, a duplicate of a certificate of title
    when a security interest is perfected by notation on such a
    certificate, a statement that pledged property has been in
    possession of the secured party since a specified date, or a
    statement of the reasons why no action was necessary for
    perfection. The secured creditor may not be required to file a
    proof of claim under this rule if he is not seeking allowance of a
    claim for a deficiency. But see Sec. 506(d) of the Code.
      Subdivision (e). The rule recognizes the differences between an
    unconditional transfer of a claim and a transfer for the purpose of
    security and prescribes a procedure for dealing with the rights of
    the transferor and transferee when the transfer is for security.
    The rule clarifies the procedure to be followed when a transfer
    precedes or follows the filing of the petition. The interests of
    sound administration are served by requiring the post-petition
    transferee to file with the proof of claim a statement of the
    transferor acknowledging the transfer and the consideration for the
    transfer. Such a disclosure will assist the court in dealing with
    evils that may arise out of post-bankruptcy traffic in claims
    against an estate. Monroe v. Scofield, 135 F.2d 725 (10th Cir.
    1943); In re Philadelphia & Western Ry., 64 F. Supp. 738 (E.D. Pa.
    1946); cf. In re Latham Lithographic Corp., 107 F.2d 749 (2d Cir.
    1939). Both paragraphs (1) and (3) of this subdivision, which deal
    with a transfer before the filing of a proof of claim, recognize
    that the transferee may be unable to obtain the required statement
    from the transferor, but in that event a sound reason for such
    inability must accompany the proof of claim filed by the
    transferee.
      Paragraphs (3) and (4) clarify the status of a claim transferred
    for the purpose of security. An assignee for security has been
    recognized as a rightful claimant in bankruptcy. Feder v. John
    Engelhorn & Sons, 202 F.2d 411 (2d Cir. 1953). An assignor's right
    to file a claim notwithstanding the assignment was sustained in In
    re R & L Engineering Co., 182 F. Supp. 317 (S.D. Cal. 1960).
    Facilitation of the filing of proofs by both claimants as holders
    of interests in a single claim is consonant with equitable
    treatment of the parties and sound administration. See In re Latham
    Lithographic Corp., 107 F.2d 749 (2d Cir. 1939).
      Paragraphs (2) and (4) of subdivision (e) deal with the transfer
    of a claim after proof has been filed. Evidence of the terms of the
    transfer required to be disclosed to the court will facilitate the
    court's determination of the appropriate order to be entered
    because of the transfer.
      Paragraph (5) describes the procedure to be followed when an
    objection is made by the transferor to the transferee's filed
    evidence of transfer.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987            
      Subdivision (g) was added by Sec. 354 of the 1984 amendments.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended in anticipation of future revision and
    renumbering of the Official Forms.
      Subdivision (e) is amended to limit the court's role to the
    adjudication of disputes regarding transfers of claims. If a claim
    has been transferred prior to the filing of a proof of claim, there
    is no need to state the consideration for the transfer or to submit
    other evidence of the transfer. If a claim has been transferred
    other than for security after a proof of claim has been filed, the
    transferee is substituted for the transferor in the absence of a
    timely objection by the alleged transferor. In that event, the
    clerk should note the transfer without the need for court approval.
    If a timely objection is filed, the court's role is to determine
    whether a transfer has been made that is enforceable under
    nonbankruptcy law. This rule is not intended either to encourage or
    discourage postpetition transfers of claims or to affect any
    remedies otherwise available under nonbankruptcy law to a
    transferor or transferee such as for misrepresentation in
    connection with the transfer of a claim. "After notice and a
    hearing" as used in subdivision (e) shall be construed in
    accordance with paragraph (5).
      The words "with the clerk" in subdivision (e)(2) and (e)(4) are
    deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to
    substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout
    the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 15-day periods become 14-day periods

-HEAD-
    Rule 3002. Filing Proof of Claim or Interest

-STATUTE-
      (a) Necessity for Filing. An unsecured creditor or an equity
    security holder must file a proof of claim or interest for the
    claim or interest to be allowed, except as provided in Rules
    1019(3), 3003, 3004, and 3005.
      (b) Place of Filing. A proof of claim or interest shall be filed
    in accordance with Rule 5005.
      (c) Time for Filing. In a chapter 7 liquidation, chapter 12
    family farmer's debt adjustment, or chapter 13 individual's debt
    adjustment case, a proof of claim is timely filed if it is filed
    not later than 90 days after the first date set for the meeting of
    creditors called under Sec. 341(a) of the Code, except as follows:
        (1) A proof of claim filed by a governmental unit, other than
      for a claim resulting from a tax return filed under Sec. 1308, is
      timely filed if it is filed not later than 180 days after the
      date of the order for relief. A proof of claim filed by a
      governmental unit for a claim resulting from a tax return filed
      under Sec. 1308 is timely filed if it is filed no later than 180
      days after the date of the order for relief or 60 days after the
      date of the filing of the tax return. The court may, for cause,
      enlarge the time for a governmental unit to file a proof of claim
      only upon motion of the governmental unit made before expiration
      of the period for filing a timely proof of claim.
        (2) In the interest of justice and if it will not unduly delay
      the administration of the case, the court may extend the time for
      filing a proof of claim by an infant or incompetent person or the
      representative of either.
        (3) An unsecured claim which arises in favor of an entity or
      becomes allowable as a result of a judgment may be filed within
      30 days after the judgment becomes final if the judgment is for
      the recovery of money or property from that entity or denies or
      avoids the entity's interest in property. If the judgment imposes
      a liability which is not satisfied, or a duty which is not
      performed within such period or such further time as the court
      may permit, the claim shall not be allowed.
        (4) A claim arising from the rejection of an executory contract
      or unexpired lease of the debtor may be filed within such time as
      the court may direct.
        (5) If notice of insufficient assets to pay a dividend was
      given to creditors under Rule 2002(e), and subsequently the
      trustee notifies the court that payment of a dividend appears
      possible, the clerk shall give at least 90 days' notice by mail
      to creditors of that fact and of the date by which proofs of
      claim must be filed.
        (6) If notice of the time to file a proof of claim has been
      mailed to a creditor at a foreign address, on motion filed by the
      creditor before or after the expiration of the time, the court
      may extend the time by not more than 60 days if the court finds
      that the notice was insufficient under the circumstances to give
      the creditor a reasonable time to file a proof of claim.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Subdivision (a) of this rule is substantially a restatement of
    the general requirement that claims be proved and filed. The
    exceptions refer to Rule 3003 providing for the filing of claims in
    chapter 9 and 11 cases, and to Rules 3004 and 3005 authorizing
    claims to be filed by the debtor or trustee and the filing of a
    claim by a contingent creditor of the debtor.
      A secured claim need not be filed or allowed under Sec. 502 or
    Sec. 506(d) unless a party in interest has requested a
    determination and allowance or disallowance under Sec. 502.
      Subdivision (c) is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 302(e) but
    changes the time limits on the filing of claims in chapter 7 and 13
    cases from six months to 90 days after the first date set for the
    meeting of creditors. The special rule for early filing by a
    secured creditor in a chapter 13 case, in former Rule 13-302(e)(1)
    is not continued.
      Although the claim of a secured creditor may have arisen before
    the petition, a judgment avoiding the security interest may not
    have been entered until after the time for filing claims has
    expired. Under Rule 3002(c)(3) the creditor who did not file a
    secured claim may nevertheless file an unsecured claim within the
    time prescribed. A judgment does not become final for the purpose
    of starting the 30 day period provided for by paragraph (3) until
    the time for appeal has expired or, if an appeal is taken, until
    the appeal has been disposed of. In re Tapp, 61 F. Supp. 594 (W.D.
    Ky. 1945).
      Paragraph (1) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 302(e). The
    governmental unit may move for an extension of the 90 day period.
    Pursuant to Sec. 501(c) of the Code, if the government does not
    file its claim within the proper time period, the debtor or trustee
    may file on its behalf. An extension is not needed by the debtor or
    trustee because the right to file does not arise until the
    government's time has expired.
      Paragraph (4) is derived from former chapter rules. (See, e.g.,
    Rule 11-33(a)(2)(B). In light of the reduced time it is necessary
    that a party with a claim arising from the rejection of an
    executory contract have sufficient time to file that claim. This
    clause allows the court to fix an appropriate time.
      Paragraph (5) of subdivision (c) is correlated with the provision
    in Rule 2002(e) authorizing notification to creditors of estates
    from which no dividends are anticipated. The clause permits
    creditors who have refrained from filing claims after receiving
    notification to be given an opportunity to file when subsequent
    developments indicate the possibility of a dividend. The notice
    required by this clause must be given in the manner provided in
    Rule 2002. The information relating to the discovery of assets will
    usually be obtained by the clerk from the trustee's interim reports
    or special notification by the trustee.
      Provision is made in Rule 2002(a) and (h) for notifying all
    creditors of the fixing of a time for filing claims against a
    surplus under paragraph (6). This paragraph does not deal with the
    distribution of the surplus. Reference must also be made to Sec.
    726(a)(2)(C) and (3) which permits distribution on late filed
    claims.
      Paragraph (6) is only operative in a chapter 7 case. In chapter
    13 cases, the plan itself provides the distribution to creditors
    which is not necessarily dependent on the size of the estate.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended by adding a reference to Rule 1019(4).
    Rule 1019(4) provides that claims actually filed by a creditor in a
    chapter 11 or 13 case shall be treated as filed in a superseding
    chapter 7 case. Claims deemed filed in a chapter 11 case pursuant
    to Sec. 1111(a) of the Code are not considered as filed in a
    superseding chapter 7 case. The creditor must file a claim in the
    superseding chapter 7 case.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to conform to the renumbering of
    subdivisions of Rule 1019. Subdivision (c) is amended to include
    chapter 12 cases. Subdivision (c)(4) is amended to clarify that it
    includes a claim arising from the rejection of an unexpired lease.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1996 AMENDMENT       
      The amendments are designed to conform to Secs. 502(b)(9) and
    726(a) of the Code as amended by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994.
      The Reform Act amended Sec. 726(a)(1) and added Sec. 502(b)(9) to
    the Code to govern the effects of a tardily filed claim. Under Sec.
    502(b)(9), a tardily filed claim must be disallowed if an objection
    to the proof of claim is filed, except to the extent that a holder
    of a tardily filed claim is entitled to distribution under Sec.
    726(a)(1), (2), or (3).
      The phrase "in accordance with this rule" is deleted from Rule
    3002(a) to clarify that the effect of filing a proof of claim after
    the expiration of the time prescribed in Rule 3002(c) is governed
    by Sec. 502(b)(9) of the Code, rather than by this rule.
      Section 502(b)(9) of the Code provides that a claim of a
    governmental unit shall be timely filed if it is filed "before 180
    days after the date of the order for relief" or such later time as
    the Bankruptcy Rules provide. To avoid any confusion as to whether
    a governmental unit's proof of claim is timely filed under Sec.
    502(b)(9) if it is filed on the 180th day after the order for
    relief, paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) provides that a
    governmental unit's claim is timely if it is filed not later than
    180 days after the order for relief.
      References to "the United States, a state, or subdivision
    thereof" in paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) are changed to
    "governmental unit" to avoid different treatment among foreign and
    domestic governments.
      GAP Report on Rule 3002. After publication of the proposed
    amendments, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 amended sections 726
    and 502(b) of the Code to clarify the rights of creditors who
    tardily file a proof of claim. In view of the Reform Act, proposed
    new subdivision (d) of Rule 3002 has been deleted from the proposed
    amendments because it is no longer necessary. In addition,
    subdivisions (a) and (c) have been changed after publication to
    clarify that the effect of tardily filing a proof of claim is
    governed by Sec. 502(b)(9) of the Code, rather than by this rule.
      The amendments to Sec. 502(b) also provide that a governmental
    unit's proof of claim is timely filed if it is filed before 180
    days after the order for relief. Proposed amendments to Rule
    3002(c)(1) were added to the published amendments to conform to
    this statutory change and to avoid any confusion as to whether a
    claim by a governmental unit is timely if it is filed on the 180th
    day.
      The committee note has been re-written to explain the rule
    changes designed to conform to the Reform Act.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (c)(1) is amended to reflect the addition of Sec.
    1308 to the Bankruptcy Code in 2005. This provision requires that
    chapter 13 debtors file tax returns during the pendency of the
    case, and imposes bankruptcy-related consequences if debtors fail
    to do so. Subdivision (c)(1) provides additional time for
    governmental units to file a proof of claim for tax obligations
    with respect to tax returns filed during the pendency of a chapter
    13 case. The amendment also allows the governmental unit to move
    for additional time to file a proof of claim prior to expiration of
    the applicable filing period.
      Subdivision (c)(5) of the rule is amended to set a new period for
    providing notice to creditors that they may file a proof of claim
    in a case in which they were previously informed that there was no
    need to file a claim. Under Rule 2002(e), if it appears that there
    will be no distribution to creditors, the creditors are notified of
    this fact and are informed that if assets are later discovered and
    a distribution is likely that a new notice will be given to the
    creditors. This second notice is prescribed by Rule 3002(c)(5). The
    rule is amended to direct the clerk to give at least 90 days'
    notice of the time within which creditors may file a proof of
    claim. Setting the deadline in this manner allows the notices being
    sent to creditors to be more accurate regarding the deadline than
    was possible under the prior rule. The rule previously began the 90
    day notice period from the time of the mailing of the notice, a
    date that could vary and generally would not even be known to the
    creditor. Under the amended rule, the notice will identify a
    specific bar date for filing proofs of claim thereby being more
    helpful to the creditors.
      Subdivision (c)(6) is added to give the court discretion to
    extend the time for filing a proof of claim for a creditor who
    received notice of the time to file the claim at a foreign address,
    if the court finds that the notice was not sufficient, under the
    particular circumstances, to give the foreign creditor a reasonable
    time to file a proof of claim. This amendment is designed to comply
    with Sec. 1514(d), added to the Code by the 2005 amendments, and
    requires that the rules and orders of the court provide such
    additional time as is reasonable under the circumstances for
    foreign creditors to file claims in cases under all chapters of the
    Code.
      Other changes are stylistic.
      Changes Made After Publication. Subdivision (c)(1) was amended to
    allow governmental units to move for an enlargement of the time to
    file a proof of claim. The Committee Note was amended to describe
    this addition to the rule.

-HEAD-
    Rule 3003. Filing Proof of Claim or Equity Security Interest in
      Chapter 9 Municipality or Chapter 11 Reorganization Cases

-STATUTE-
      (a) Applicability of Rule. This rule applies in chapter 9 and 11
    cases.
      (b) Schedule of Liabilities and List of Equity Security Holders.
        (1) Schedule of Liabilities. The schedule of liabilities filed
      pursuant to Sec. 521(l) of the Code shall constitute prima facie
      evidence of the validity and amount of the claims of creditors,
      unless they are scheduled as disputed, contingent, or
      unliquidated. It shall not be necessary for a creditor or equity
      security holder to file a proof of claim or interest except as
      provided in subdivision (c)(2) of this rule.
        (2) List of Equity Security Holders. The list of equity
      security holders filed pursuant to Rule 1007(a)(3) shall
      constitute prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the
      equity security interests and it shall not be necessary for the
      holders of such interests to file a proof of interest.

      (c) Filing Proof of Claim.
        (1) Who May File. Any creditor or indenture trustee may file a
      proof of claim within the time prescribed by subdivision (c)(3)
      of this rule.
        (2) Who Must File. Any creditor or equity security holder whose
      claim or interest is not scheduled or scheduled as disputed,
      contingent, or unliquidated shall file a proof of claim or
      interest within the time prescribed by subdivision (c)(3) of this
      rule; any creditor who fails to do so shall not be treated as a
      creditor with respect to such claim for the purposes of voting
      and distribution.
        (3) Time for Filing. The court shall fix and for cause shown
      may extend the time within which proofs of claim or interest may
      be filed. Notwithstanding the expiration of such time, a proof of
      claim may be filed to the extent and under the conditions stated
      in Rule 3002(c)(2), (c)(3), (c)(4), and (c)(6).
        (4) Effect of Filing Claim or Interest. A proof of claim or
      interest executed and filed in accordance with this subdivision
      shall supersede any scheduling of that claim or interest pursuant
      to Sec. 521(a)(1) of the Code.
        (5) Filing by Indenture Trustee. An indenture trustee may file
      a claim on behalf of all known or unknown holders of securities
      issued pursuant to the trust instrument under which it is
      trustee.

      (d) Proof of Right to Record Status. For the purposes of Rules
    3017, 3018 and 3021 and for receiving notices, an entity who is not
    the record holder of a security may file a statement setting forth
    facts which entitle that entity to be treated as the record holder.
    An objection to the statement may be filed by any party in
    interest.

      Subdivision (a). This rule applies only in chapter 9 and chapter
    11 cases. It is adapted from former Chapter X Rule 10-401 and
    provides an exception to the requirement for filing proofs of claim
    and interest as expressed in Secs. 925 and 1111(a) of the Code.
      Subdivision (b). This general statement implements Secs. 925 and
    1111(a) of the Code.
      Subdivision (c). This subdivision permits, in paragraph (1), the
    filing of a proof of claim but does not make it mandatory.
    Paragraph (2) requires, as does the Code, filing when a claim is
    scheduled as disputed, contingent, or unliquidated as to amount. It
    is the creditor's responsibility to determine if the claim is
    accurately listed. Notice of the provision of this rule is provided
    for in Official Form No. 16, the order for the meeting of
    creditors. In an appropriate case the court may order creditors
    whose claims are scheduled as disputed, contingent, or unliquidated
    be notified of that fact but the procedure is left to the
    discretion of the court.
      Subdivision (d) is derived from former Chapter X Rule 10-401(f).
      Except with respect to the need and time for filing claims, the
    other aspects concerning claims covered by Rules 3001 and 3002 are
    applicable in chapter 9 and 11 cases.
      Holders of equity security interests need not file proofs of
    interest. Voting and distribution participation is dependent on
    ownership as disclosed by the appropriate records of a transfer
    agent or the corporate or other business records at the time
    prescribed in Rules 3017 and 3021.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Paragraph (3) of subdivision (c) is amended to permit the late
    filing of claims by infants or incompetent persons under the same
    circumstances that permit late filings in cases under chapter 7,
    12, or 13. The amendment also provides sufficient time in which to
    file a claim that arises from a postpetition judgment against the
    claimant for the recovery of money or property or the avoidance of
    a lien. It also provides for purposes of clarification that upon
    rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease, the court
    shall set a time for filing a claim arising therefrom despite prior
    expiration of the time set for filing proofs of claim.
      The caption of paragraph (4) of subdivision (c) is amended to
    indicate that it applies to a proof of claim.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (c)(3) is amended to implement Sec. 1514(d) of the
    Code, which was added by the 2005 amendments. It makes the new Rule
    3002(c)(6) applicable in chapter 9 and chapter 11 cases. This
    change was necessary so that creditors with foreign addresses be
    provided such additional time as is reasonable under the
    circumstances to file proofs of claims.
      Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after
    publication.

    Rule 3004. Filing of Claims by Debtor or Trustee

-STATUTE-
      If a creditor does not timely file a proof of claim under Rule
    3002(c) or 3003(c), the debtor or trustee may file a proof of the
    claim within 30 days after the expiration of the time for filing
    claims prescribed by Rule 3002(c) or 3003(c), whichever is
    applicable. The clerk shall forthwith give notice of the filing to
    the creditor, the debtor and the trustee.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 303 but conforms
    with the changes made by Sec. 501(c) of the Code. Rule 303
    permitted only the filing of tax and wage claims by the debtor.
    Section 501(c) of the Code, however, permits the filing by the
    debtor or trustee on behalf of any creditor.
      It is the policy of the Code that debtors' estates should be
    administered for the benefit of creditors without regard to the
    dischargeability of their claims. After their estates have been
    closed, however, discharged debtors may find themselves saddled
    with liabilities, particularly for taxes, which remain unpaid
    because of the failure of creditors holding nondischargeable claims
    to file proofs of claim and receive distributions thereon. The
    result is that the debtor is deprived of an important benefit of
    the Code without any fault or omission on the debtor's part and
    without any objective of the Code being served thereby.
      Section 501(c) of the Code authorizes a debtor or trustee to file
    a proof of claim for any holder of a claim. Although all claims may
    not be nondischargeable, it may be difficult to determine, in
    particular, whether tax claims survive discharge. See Plumb,
    Federal Tax Liens and Priorities in Bankruptcy, 43 Ref. J. 37, 43-
    44 (1969); 1 Collier, Bankruptcy &#182;17.14 (14th ed. 1967); 3
    id. &#182; 523.06 (15th ed. 1979). To eliminate the necessity of
    the resolution of this troublesome issue, the option accorded the
    debtor by the Code does not depend on the nondischargeability of
    the claim. No serious administrative problems and no unfairness to
    creditors seemed to develop from adoption of Rule 303, the
    forerunner to Sec. 501(c). The authority to file is conditioned on
    the creditor's failure to file the proof of claim on or before the
    first date set for the meeting of creditors, which is the date a
    claim must ordinarily be filed in order to be voted in a chapter 7
    case. Notice to the creditor is provided to enable him to file a
    proof of claim pursuant to Rule 3002, which proof, when filed,
    would supersede the proof filed by the debtor or trustee. Notice to
    the trustee would serve to alert the trustee to the special
    character of the proof and the possible need for supplementary
    evidence of the validity and amount of the claim. If the trustee
    does not qualify until after a proof of claim is filed by the
    debtor pursuant to this rule, he should be notified as soon as
    practicable thereafter.
      To the extent the claim is allowed and dividends paid thereon, it
    will be reduced or perhaps paid in full. If the claim is also filed
    pursuant to Rule 3005, only one distribution thereon may be made.
    As expressly required by Rule 3005 and by the purpose of this rule
    such distribution must diminish the claim.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Under the rule as amended, the debtor or trustee in a chapter 7
    or 13 case has 120 days from the first date set for the meeting of
    creditors to file a claim for the creditor. During the first 90
    days of that period the creditor in a chapter 7 or 13 case may file
    a claim as provided by Rule 3002(c). If the creditor fails to file
    a claim, the debtor or trustee shall have an additional 30 days
    thereafter to file the claim. A proof of claim filed by a creditor
    supersedes a claim filed by the debtor or trustee only if it is
    timely filed within the 90 days allowed under Rule 3002(c).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to conform to Sec. 501(c) of the Code. Under
    that provision, the debtor or trustee may file proof of a claim if
    the creditor fails to do so in a timely fashion. The rule
    previously authorized the debtor and the trustee to file a claim as
    early as the day after the first date set for the meeting of
    creditors under Sec. 341(a). Under the amended rule, the debtor and
    trustee must wait until the creditor's opportunity to file a claim
    has expired. Providing the debtor and the trustee with the
    opportunity to file a claim ensures that the claim will participate
    in any distribution in the case. This is particularly important for
    claims that are nondischargeable.
      Since the debtor and trustee cannot file a proof of claim until
    after the creditor's time to file has expired, the rule no longer
    permits the creditor to file a proof of claim that will supersede
    the claim filed by the debtor or trustee. The rule leaves to the
    courts the issue of whether to permit subsequent amendment of such
    proof of claim.
      Other changes are stylistic.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made
    after publication. The Advisory Committee concluded that Mr. Van
    Allsburg's suggestion goes beyond the scope of the published
    proposal. Consequently, the Committee declined to adopt the
    suggestion but may consider it in greater detail at a future
    meeting.

    of claim under Rule 3002(c) or 3003(c), any entity that is or may
    be liable with the debtor to that creditor, or who has secured that
    creditor, may file a proof of the claim within 30 days after the
    expiration of the time for filing claims prescribed by Rule 3002(c)
    or Rule 3003(c) whichever is applicable. No distribution shall be
    made on the claim except on satisfactory proof that the original
    debt will be diminished by the amount of distribution.
      (b) Filing of Acceptance or Rejection; Substitution of Creditor.
    An entity which has filed a claim pursuant to the first sentence of
    subdivision (a) of this rule may file an acceptance or rejection of
    a plan in the name of the creditor, if known, or if unknown, in the
    entity's own name but if the creditor files a proof of claim within
    the time permitted by Rule 3003(c) or files a notice prior to
    confirmation of a plan of the creditor's intention to act in the
    creditor's own behalf, the creditor shall be substituted for the
    obligor with respect to that claim.

      This rule is adapted from former Rules 304 and 10-402. Together
    with Sec. 501(b) of the Code, the rule makes clear that anyone who
    may be liable on a debt of the debtor, including a surety,
    guarantor, indorser, or other codebtor, is authorized to file in
    the name of the creditor of the debtor.
      Subdivision (a). Rule 3002(c) provides the time period for filing
    proofs of claim in chapter 7 and 13 cases; Rule 3003(c) provides
    the time, when necessary, for filing claims in a chapter 9 or 11
    case.
      Subdivision (b). This subdivision applies in chapter 9 and 11
    cases as distinguished from chapter 7 cases. It permits voting for
    or against a plan by an obligor who files a claim in place of the
    creditor.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to delete the last sentence of subdivision
    (a). The sentence is unnecessary because if a creditor has filed a
    timely claim under Rule 3002 or 3003(c), the codebtor cannot file a
    proof of such claim. The codebtor, consistent with Sec. 501(b) of
    the Code, may file a proof of such claim only after the creditor's
    time to file has expired. Therefore, the rule no longer permits the
    creditor to file a superseding claim. The rule leaves to the courts
    the issue of whether to permit subsequent amendment of the proof of
    claim.
      The amendment conforms the rule to Sec. 501(b) by deleting
    language providing that the codebtor files proof of the claim in
    the name of the creditor.
      Other amendments are stylistic.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment:
      (a) The reference on line 2 of Rule 3005 to "Rule 3002 or
    3003(c)" was changed to read "Rule 3002(c) or 3003(c)" to make it
    parallel to the language in Rule 3004.
      (b) The phrase "file a proof of the claim" from line 7 of the
    proposed rule was moved up to line 4 of the proposed amendment
    immediately after the word "may". This makes the structure of Rules
    3004 and 3005 more consistent.

    Rule 3006. Withdrawal of Claim; Effect on Acceptance or Rejection
      of Plan

-STATUTE-
      A creditor may withdraw a claim as of right by filing a notice of
    withdrawal, except as provided in this rule. If after a creditor
    has filed a proof of claim an objection is filed thereto or a
    complaint is filed against that creditor in an adversary
    proceeding, or the creditor has accepted or rejected the plan or
    otherwise has participated significantly in the case, the creditor
    may not withdraw the claim except on order of the court after a
    hearing on notice to the trustee or debtor in possession, and any
    creditors' committee elected pursuant to Sec. 705(a) or appointed
    pursuant to Sec. 1102 of the Code. The order of the court shall
    contain such terms and conditions as the court deems proper. Unless
    the court orders otherwise, an authorized withdrawal of a claim
    shall constitute withdrawal of any related acceptance or rejection
    of a plan.

      This rule is derived from former Rules 305 and 10-404.
      Since 1938 it has generally been held that Rule 41 F.R.Civ.P.
    governs the withdrawal of a proof of claim. In re Empire Coal Sales
    Corp., 45 F. Supp. 974, 976 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd sub nom. Kleid v.
    Ruthbell Coal Co., 131 F.2d 372, 373 (2d Cir. 1942); Kelso v.
    MacLaren, 122 F.2d 867, 870 (8th Cir. 1941); In re Hills, 35 F.
    Supp. 532, 533 (W.D. Wash. 1940). Accordingly, the cited cases held
    that after an objection has been filed a proof of claim may be
    withdrawn only subject to approval by the court. This constitutes a
    restriction of the right of withdrawal as recognized by some though
    by no means all of the cases antedating the promulgation of the
    Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See 3 Collier Bankruptcy, &#182;
    57.12 (14th ed. 1961); Note, 20 Bost. U. L. Rev. 121 (1940).
      The filing of a claim does not commence an adversary proceeding
    but the filing of an objection to the claim initiates a contest
    that must be disposed of by the court. This rule recognizes the
    applicability of the considerations underlying Rule 41(a)
    F.R.Civ.P. to the withdrawal of a claim after it has been put in
    issue by an objection. Rule 41(a)(2) F.R.Civ.P. requires leave of
    court to obtain dismissal over the objection of a defendant who has
    pleaded a counterclaim prior to the service of the plaintiff's
    motion to dismiss. Although the applicability of this provision to
    the withdrawal of a claim was assumed in Conway v. Union Bank of
    Switzerland, 204 F.2d 603, 608 (2d Cir. 1953), Kleid v. Ruthbell
    Coal Co., supra, Kelso v. MacLaren, supra, and In re Hills, supra,
    this rule vests discretion in the court to grant, deny, or
    condition the request of a creditor to withdraw, without regard to
    whether the trustee has filed a merely defensive objection or a
    complaint seeking an affirmative recovery of money or property from
    the creditor.
      A number of pre-1938 cases sustained denial of a creditor's
    request to withdraw proof of claim on the ground of estoppel or
    election of remedies. 2 Remington, Bankruptcy 186 (Henderson ed.
    1956); cf. 3 Collier, supra &#182; 57.12, at 201 (1964). Voting a
    claim for a trustee was an important factor in the denial of a
    request to withdraw in Standard Varnish Works v. Haydock, 143 Fed.
    318, 319-20 (6th Cir. 1906), and In re Cann, 47 F.2d 661, 662 (W.D.
    Pa. 1931). And it has frequently been recognized that a creditor
    should not be allowed to withdraw a claim after accepting a
    dividend. In re Friedmann, 1 Am. B. R. 510, 512 (Ref., S.D.N.Y.
    1899); 3 Collier 205 (1964); cf. In re O'Gara Coal Co., 12 F.2d
    426, 429 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 271 U.S. 683 (1926). It was held
    in Industrial Credit Co. v. Hazen, 222 F.2d 225 (8th Cir. 1955),
    however, that although a claimant had participated in the first
    meeting of creditors and in the examination of witnesses, the
    creditor was entitled under Rule 41(a)(1) F.R.Civ.P. to withdraw
    the claim as of right by filing a notice of withdrawal before the
    trustee filed an objection under Sec. 57g of the Act. While this
    rule incorporates the post-1938 case law referred to in the first
    paragraph of this note, it rejects the inference drawn in the Hazen
    case that Rule 41(a) F.R.Civ.P. supersedes the pre-1938 case law
    that vests discretion in the court to deny or restrict withdrawal
    of a claim by a creditor on the ground of estoppel or election of
    remedies. While purely formal or technical participation in a case
    by a creditor who has filed a claim should not deprive the creditor
    of the right to withdraw the claim, a creditor who has accepted a
    dividend or who has voted in the election of a trustee or otherwise
    participated actively in proceedings in a case should be permitted
    to withdraw only with the approval of the court on terms it deems
    appropriate after notice to the trustee. 3 Collier 205-06 (1964).

-HEAD-
    Rule 3007. Objections to Claims

-STATUTE-
      (a) Objections to Claims. An objection to the allowance of a
    claim shall be in writing and filed. A copy of the objection with
    notice of the hearing thereon shall be mailed or otherwise
    delivered to the claimant, the debtor or debtor in possession, and
    the trustee at least 30 days prior to the hearing.
      (b) Demand for Relief Requiring an Adversary Proceeding. A party
    in interest shall not include a demand for relief of a kind
    specified in Rule 7001 in an objection to the allowance of a claim,
    but may include the objection in an adversary proceeding.
      (c) Limitation on Joinder of Claims Objections. Unless otherwise
    ordered by the court or permitted by subdivision (d), objections to
    more than one claim shall not be joined in a single objection.
      (d) Omnibus Objection. Subject to subdivision (e), objections to
    more than one claim may be joined in an omnibus objection if all
    the claims were filed by the same entity, or the objections are
    based solely on the grounds that the claims should be disallowed,
    in whole or in part, because:
        (1) they duplicate other claims;
        (2) they have been filed in the wrong case;
        (3) they have been amended by subsequently filed proofs of
      claim;
        (4) they were not timely filed;
        (5) they have been satisfied or released during the case in
      accordance with the Code, applicable rules, or a court order;
        (6) they were presented in a form that does not comply with
      applicable rules, and the objection states that the objector is
      unable to determine the validity of the claim because of the
      noncompliance;
        (7) they are interests, rather than claims; or
        (8) they assert priority in an amount that exceeds the maximum
      amount under Sec. 507 of the Code.

      (e) Requirements for Omnibus Objection. An omnibus objection
    shall:
        (1) state in a conspicuous place that claimants receiving the
      objection should locate their names and claims in the objection;
        (2) list claimants alphabetically, provide a cross-reference to
      claim numbers, and, if appropriate, list claimants by category of
      claims;
        (3) state the grounds of the objection to each claim and
      provide a cross-reference to the pages in the omnibus objection
      pertinent to the stated grounds;
        (4) state in the title the identity of the objector and the
      grounds for the objections;
        (5) be numbered consecutively with other omnibus objections
      filed by the same objector; and
        (6) contain objections to no more than 100 claims.

      (f) Finality of Objection. The finality of any order regarding a
    claim objection included in an omnibus objection shall be
    determined as though the claim had been subject to an individual
    objection.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is derived from Sec. 47a(8) of the Act and former
    Bankruptcy Rule 306. It prescribes the manner in which an objection
    to a claim shall be made and notice of the hearing thereon given to
    the claimant. The requirement of a writing does not apply to an
    objection to the allowance of a claim for the purpose of voting for
    a trustee or creditors' committee in a chapter 7 case. See Rule
    2003.
      The contested matter initiated by an objection to a claim is
    governed by rule 9014, unless a counterclaim by the trustee is
    joined with the objection to the claim. The filing of a
    counterclaim ordinarily commences an adversary proceeding subject
    to the rules in Part VII.
      While the debtor's other creditors may make objections to the
    allowance of a claim, the demands of orderly and expeditious
    administration have led to a recognition that the right to object
    is generally exercised by the trustee. Pursuant to Sec. 502(a) of
    the Code, however, any party in interest may object to a claim. But
    under Sec. 704 the trustee, if any purpose would be served thereby,
    has the duty to examine proofs of claim and object to improper
    claims.
      By virtue of the automatic allowance of a claim not objected to,
    a dividend may be paid on a claim which may thereafter be
    disallowed on objection made pursuant to this rule. The amount of
    the dividend paid before the disallowance in such event would be
    recoverable by the trustee in an adversary proceeding.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      The words "with the court" are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules
    5005(a) and 9001(3).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended in a number of ways. First, the amendment
    prohibits a party in interest from including in a claim objection a
    request for relief that requires an adversary proceeding. A party
    in interest may, however, include an objection to the allowance of
    a claim in an adversary proceeding. Unlike a contested matter, an
    adversary proceeding requires the service of a summons and
    complaint, which puts the defendant on notice of the potential for
    an affirmative recovery. Permitting the plaintiff in the adversary
    proceeding to include an objection to a claim would not unfairly
    surprise the defendant as might be the case if the action were
    brought as a contested matter that included an action to obtain
    relief of a kind specified in Rule 7001.
      The rule as amended does not require that a party include an
    objection to the allowance of a claim in an adversary proceeding.
    If a claim objection is filed separately from a related adversary
    proceeding, the court may consolidate the objection with the
    adversary proceeding under Rule 7042.
      The rule also is amended to authorize the filing of a pleading
    that joins objections to more than one claim. Such filings present
    a significant opportunity for the efficient administration of large
    cases, but the rule includes restrictions on the use of these
    omnibus objections to ensure the protection of the due process
    rights of the claimants.
      Unless the court orders otherwise, objections to more than one
    claim may be joined in a single pleading only if all of the claims
    were filed by the same entity, or if the objections are based
    solely on the grounds set out in subdivision (d) of the rule.
    Objections of the type listed in subdivision (d) often can be
    resolved without material factual or legal disputes. Objections to
    multiple claims permitted under the rule must comply with the
    procedural requirements set forth in subdivision (e). Among those
    requirements is the requirement in subdivision (e)(5) that these
    omnibus objections be consecutively numbered. Since these
    objections may not join more than 100 objections in any one omnibus
    objection, there may be a need for several omnibus objections to be
    filed in a particular case. Consecutive numbering of each omnibus
    objection and the identification of the objector in the title of
    the objection is essential to keep track of the objections on the
    court's docket. For example, the objections could be titled Debtor
    in Possession's First Omnibus Objection to Claims, Debtor in
    Possession's Second Omnibus Objection to Claims, Creditors'
    Committee's First Omnibus Objection to Claims, and so on. Titling
    the objections in this manner should avoid confusion and aid in
    tracking the objections on the docket.
      Subdivision (f) provides that an order resolving an objection to
    any particular claim is treated, for purposes of finality, as if
    the claim had been the subject of an individual objection. A party
    seeking to appeal any such order is neither required, nor
    permitted, to await the court's resolution of all other joined
    objections. The rule permits the joinder of objections for
    convenience, and that convenience should not impede timely review
    of a court's decision with respect to each claim. Whether the
    court's action as to a particular objection is final, and the
    consequences of that finality, are not addressed by this amendment.
    Moreover, use of an omnibus objection generally does not preclude
    the objecting party from raising a subsequent objection to the
    claim on other grounds. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments Sec.
    26(1)(d) (1982) (generally applicable rule barring multiple actions
    based on same transaction or series of transactions is overridden
    when a statutory scheme permits splitting of claims).
      Changes Made After Publication. There were several changes made
    to the rule after its publication. The Advisory Committee declined
    to follow Mr. Sabino's suggestion, concluding that the rule as
    proposed includes sufficient flexibility, and that expanding the
    flexibility might lead to excessive deviation from the appropriate
    format for omnibus claims objections. The Advisory Committee also
    declined to follow Mr. Horsley's suggestion because the deadline
    for filing a proof of claim varies based on the nature of the
    creditor (governmental units have different deadlines from other
    creditors) as well as on the chapter under which the case is
    pending. The Advisory Committee rejected Judge Grant's suggestion
    that a party proposing an omnibus claims objection be required to
    demonstrate some special cause to allow the joinder of the
    objections. The Advisory Committee concluded that the rule includes
    sufficient protections for claimants such that omnibus objections
    should be allowed without the need for a special showing by the
    claims objector that joinder is proper.
      The Advisory Committee did accept several of Judge Grant's
    suggestions, and the rule was amended by deleting the grounds for
    objection to claims based on the filing of a superceding proof of
    claim under proposed subdivision (d)(3) and the transfer of claims
    under proposed subdivision (d)(4). Subdivision (d)(3) now permits
    objections to claims that have been amended by a subsequently filed
    proof of claim and the paragraphs within subdivision (d) have been
    renumbered to reflect the deletion. The Committee Note also no
    longer includes any reliance on Sec. 502(j) for the statement
    indicating that a subsequent claim objection can be filed to a
    claim that was previously included in an omnibus claim objection.

-HEAD-
    Rule 3008. Reconsideration of Claims

-STATUTE-
      A party in interest may move for reconsideration of an order
    allowing or disallowing a claim against the estate. The court after
    a hearing on notice shall enter an appropriate order.


-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Section 502(j) of the Code deals only with the reconsideration of
    allowed claims as did former Sec. 57k of the Act and General Order
    21(b). It had sometimes been held that a referee had no
    jurisdiction to reconsider a disallowed claim, or the amount or
    priority of an allowed claim, at the instance of the claimant. See,
    e.g., In re Gouse, 7 F. Supp. 106 (M.D. Pa. 1934); In re Tomlinson
    & Dye, Inc., 3 F. Supp. 800 (N.D. Okla. 1933). This view
    disregarded Sec. 2a(2) of the Act and the "ancient and elementary
    power" of a referee as a court to reconsider orders. In re Pottasch
    Brow. Co., Inc., 79 F.2d 613, 616 (2d Cir. 1935); Castaner v. Mora,
    234 F.2d 710 (1st Cir. 1956). This rule recognizes, as did former
    Bankruptcy Rule 307, the power of the court to reconsider an order
    of disallowance on appropriate motion.
      Reconsideration of a claim that has been previously allowed or
    disallowed after objection is discretionary with the court. The
    right to seek reconsideration of an allowed claim, like the right
    to object to its allowance, is generally exercised by the trustee
    if one has qualified and is performing the duties of that office
    with reasonable diligence and fidelity. A request for
    reconsideration of a disallowance would, on the other hand,
    ordinarily come from the claimant.
      A proof of claim executed and filed in accordance with the rules
    in this Part III is prima facie evidence of the validity and the
    amount of the claim notwithstanding a motion for reconsideration of
    an order of allowance. Failure to respond does not constitute an
    admission, though it may be deemed a consent to a reconsideration.
    In re Goble Boat Co., 190 Fed. 92 (N.D.N.Y. 1911). The court may
    decline to reconsider an order of allowance or disallowance without
    notice to any adverse party and without affording any hearing to
    the movant. If a motion to reconsider is granted, notice and
    hearing must be afforded to parties in interest before the previous
    action in the claim taken in respect to the claim may be vacated or
    modified. After reconsideration, the court may allow or disallow
    the claim, increase or decrease the amount of a prior allowance,
    accord the claim a priority different from that originally assigned
    it, or enter any other appropriate order.
      The rule expands Sec. 502(j) which provides for reconsideration
    of an allowance only before the case is closed. Authorities have
    disagreed as to whether reconsideration may be had after a case has
    been reopened. Compare 3 Collier Bankruptcy &#182;57.23[4] (14th
    ed. 1964), see generally 3 id. &#182;502.10 (15th ed. 1979), with 2
    Remington, Bankruptcy 498 (Henderson ed. 1956). If a case is
    reopened as provided in Sec. 350(b) of the Code, reconsideration of
    the allowance or disallowance of a claim may be sought and granted
    in accordance with this rule.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is derived from former Rules 308 and 11-35(a). The
    preparation of records showing dividends declared and to whom
    payable is subject to prescription by the Director of the
    Administrative Office pursuant to Rule 5003(e). The rule governs
    distributions to creditors having priority as well as to general
    unsecured creditors. Notwithstanding the detailed statutory
    provisions regulating the declaration of dividends, a necessarily
    wide discretion over this matter has been recognized to reside in
    the court. See 3A Collier, Bankruptcy &#182;65.03 (14th ed. 1975):
    1 Proceedings of Seminar for Newly Appointed Referees in Bankruptcy
    173 (1964). Although the rule leaves to the discretion of the court
    the amount and the times of dividend payments, it recognizes the
    creditors' right to as prompt payment as practicable.
      The second and third sentences of the rule make explicit the
    method of payment of dividends and afford protection of the
    interests of the creditor and the holder of a power of attorney
    authorized to receive payment.
      The rule does not permit variance at local option. This
    represents a marked change from former Bankruptcy Rule 308.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to delete the requirement that the court
    approve the amounts and times of distributions in chapter 7 cases.
    This change recognizes the role of the United States trustee in
    supervising trustees. Other amendments are stylistic and make no
    substantive change.

      (a) Chapter 7 Cases. In a chapter 7 case no dividend in an amount
    less than $5 shall be distributed by the trustee to any creditor
    unless authorized by local rule or order of the court. Any dividend
    not distributed to a creditor shall be treated in the same manner

    13 case no payment in an amount less than $15 shall be distributed
    by the trustee to any creditor unless authorized by local rule or
    order of the court. Funds not distributed because of this

    accumulation aggregates $15. Any funds remaining shall be

      This rule permits a court to eliminate the disproportionate
    expense and inconvenience incurred by the issuance of a dividend
    check of less than $5 (or $15 in a chapter 13 case). Creditors are
    more irritated than pleased to receive such small dividends, but
    the money is held subject to their specific request as are
    unclaimed dividends under Sec. 347(a) of the Code. When the trustee
    deposits undistributed dividends pursuant to a direction in
    accordance with this rule the trustee should file with the clerk a
    list of the names and addresses, so far as known, of the persons
    entitled to the money so deposited and the respective amounts
    payable to them pursuant to Rule 3011. In a chapter 13 case, the
    small dividend will accumulate and will be payable at the latest,
    with the final dividend. Local rule or order may change the
    practice permitted in this rule and, in that connection, the order
    may be incorporated in the order confirming a chapter 13 plan.

    operative provisions of that rule, however, are contained in Sec.
    347(a) of the Code, requiring the trustee to stop payment of checks
    remaining unpaid 90 days after distribution. The rule adds the
    requirement of filing a list of the names and addresses of the
    persons entitled to these dividends. This rule applies in a chapter
    7 or 13 case but not in a chapter 9 or 11 case. The latter cases
    are governed by Sec. 347(b) of the Code which provides for
    unclaimed distributions to be returned to the debtor or other

-STATUTE-
      The court may determine the value of a claim secured by a lien on

    in interest and after a hearing on notice to the holder of the
    secured claim and any other entity as the court may direct.

      Pursuant to Sec. 506(a) of the Code, secured claims are to be
    valued and allowed as secured to the extent of the value of the
    collateral and unsecured, to the extent it is enforceable, for the
    excess over such value. The valuation of secured claims may become
    important in different contexts e.g., to determine the issue of
    adequate protection under Sec. 361, impairment under Sec. 1124, or
    treatment of the claim in a plan pursuant to Sec. 1129(b) of the
    Code. This rule permits the issue to be raised on motion by a party
    in interest. The secured creditor is entitled to notice of the
    hearing on the motion and the court may direct that others in the
    case also receive such notice.
      An adversary proceeding is commenced when the validity, priority,
    or extent of a lien is at issue as prescribed by Rule 7001. That
    proceeding is relevant to the basis of the lien itself while
    valuation under Rule 3012 would be for the purposes indicated
    above.

    not later than the date fixed pursuant to Rule 3017.1(a)(2) or
    another date the court may fix. The election shall be in writing
    and signed unless made at the hearing on the disclosure statement.

    1111(b)(1)(A)(i), shall be binding on all members of the class with
    respect to the plan.

      Pursuant to Sec. 1111(b)(1) of the Code, a nonrecourse secured
    loan is converted, automatically, into a recourse loan thereby
    entitling the creditor to an unsecured deficiency claim if the
    value of the collateral is less than the debt. The class, however,
    may retain the loan as a nonrecourse loan by electing application
    of Sec. 1111(b)(2) by the majorities stated in Sec.
    1111(b)(1)(A)(i). That section does not specify any time periods
    for making the election.
      Rule 3014 provides that if no agreement is negotiated, the
    election of Sec. 1111(b)(2) of the Code may be made at any time
    prior to conclusion of the hearing on the disclosure statement.
    Once the hearing has been concluded, it would be too late for a
    secured creditor class to demand different treatment unless the
    court has fixed a later time. This would be the case if, for
    example, a public class of secured creditors should have an
    approved disclosure statement prior to electing under Sec. 1111(b).
      Generally it is important that the proponent of a plan ascertain
    the position of the secured creditor class before a plan is
    proposed. The secured creditor class must know the prospects of its
    treatment under the plan before it can intelligently determine its
    rights under Sec. 1111(b). The rule recognizes that there may be
    negotiations between the proponent of the plan and the secured
    creditor leading to a representation of desired treatment under
    Sec. 1111(b). If that treatment is approved by the requisite
    majorities of the class and culminates in a written, signed
    statement filed with the court, that statement becomes binding and
    the class may not thereafter demand different treatment under Sec.
    1111(b) with respect to that plan. The proponent of the plan is
    thus enabled to seek approval of the disclosure statement and
    transmit the plan for voting in anticipation of confirmation. Only
    if that plan is not confirmed may the class of secured creditors
    thereafter change its prior election.
      While this rule and the Code refer to a class of secured
    creditors it should be noted that ordinarily each secured creditor
    is in a separate and distinct class. In that event, the secured
    creditor has the sole power to determine application of Sec.
    1111(b) with respect to that claim.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       
      This amendment provides a deadline for electing application of
    Sec. 1111(b)(2) in a small business case in which a conditionally
    approved disclosure statement is finally approved without a
    hearing.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Chapter 12 Plan. The debtor may file a chapter 12 plan with
    the petition. If a plan is not filed with the petition, it shall be
    filed within the time prescribed by Sec. 1221 of the Code.
      (b) Chapter 13 Plan. The debtor may file a chapter 13 plan with
    the petition. If a plan is not filed with the petition, it shall be
    filed within 14 days thereafter, and such time may not be further
    extended except for cause shown and on notice as the court may
    direct. If a case is converted to chapter 13, a plan shall be filed
    within 14 days thereafter, and such time may not be further
    extended except for cause shown and on notice as the court may
    direct.
      (c) Dating. Every proposed plan and any modification thereof
    shall be dated.
      (d) Notice and Copies. The plan or a summary of the plan shall be
    included with each notice of the hearing on confirmation mailed
    pursuant to Rule 2002. If required by the court, the debtor shall
    furnish a sufficient number of copies to enable the clerk to
    include a copy of the plan with the notice of the hearing.
      (e) Transmission to United States Trustee. The clerk shall
    forthwith transmit to the United States trustee a copy of the plan
    and any modification thereof filed pursuant to subdivision (a) or
    (b) of this rule.
      (f) Objection to Confirmation; Determination of Good Faith in the
    Absence of an Objection. An objection to confirmation of a plan
    shall be filed and served on the debtor, the trustee, and any other
    entity designated by the court, and shall be transmitted to the
    United States trustee, before confirmation of the plan. An
    objection to confirmation is governed by Rule 9014. If no objection
    is timely filed, the court may determine that the plan has been
    proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law
    without receiving evidence on such issues.
      (g) Modification of Plan After Confirmation. A request to modify
    a plan pursuant to Sec. 1229 or Sec. 1329 of the Code shall
    identify the proponent and shall be filed together with the
    proposed modification. The clerk, or some other person as the court
    may direct, shall give the debtor, the trustee, and all creditors
    not less than 21 days' notice by mail of the time fixed for filing
    objections and, if an objection is filed, the hearing to consider
    the proposed modification, unless the court orders otherwise with
    respect to creditors who are not affected by the proposed
    modification. A copy of the notice shall be transmitted to the
    United States trustee. A copy of the proposed modification, or a
    summary thereof, shall be included with the notice. If required by
    the court, the proponent shall furnish a sufficient number of
    copies of the proposed modification, or a summary thereof, to
    enable the clerk to include a copy with each notice. Any objection
    to the proposed modification shall be filed and served on the
    debtor, the trustee, and any other entity designated by the court,
    and shall be transmitted to the United States trustee. An objection
    to a proposed modification is governed by Rule 9014.

      Section 1321 provides only that the "debtor shall file a plan."
    No time periods are specified, nor is any other detail provided.
    The rule requires a chapter 13 plan to be filed either with the
    petition or within 15 days thereafter. The court may, for cause,
    extend the time. The rule permits a summary of the plan to be
    transmitted with the notice of the hearing on confirmation. The
    court may, however, require the plan itself to be transmitted and
    the debtor to supply enough copies for this purpose. In the former
    rules under Chapter XIII the plan would accompany the notice of the
    first meeting of creditors. It is more important for the plan or a
    summary of its terms to be sent with the notice of the confirmation
    hearing. At that hearing objections to the plan will be heard by
    the court.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to include chapter 12 plans. Section 1221 of
    the Code requires the debtor to file a chapter 12 plan not later
    than 90 days after the order for relief, except that the court may
    extend the period if an extension is "substantially justified."
      Subdivision (e) enables the United States trustee to monitor
    chapter 12 and chapter 13 plans pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    586(a)(3)(C).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b) is amended to provide a time limit for filing a
    plan after a case has been converted to chapter 13. The
    substitution of "may" for "shall" is stylistic and makes no
    substantive change.
      Subdivision (d) is amended to clarify that the plan or a summary
    of the plan must be included with each notice of the confirmation
    hearing in a chapter 12 case pursuant to Rule 2002(a).
      Subdivision (f) is added to expand the scope of the rule to
    govern objections to confirmation in chapter 12 and chapter 13
    cases. The subdivision also is amended to include a provision that
    permits the court, in the absence of an objection, to determine
    that the plan has been proposed in good faith and and not by any
    means forbidden by law without the need to receive evidence on
    these issues. These matters are now governed by Rule 3020.
      Subdivision (g) is added to provide a procedure for post-
    confirmation modification of chapter 12 and chapter 13 plans.
    These procedures are designed to be similar to the procedures for
    confirmation of plans. However, if no objection is filed with
    respect to a proposed modification of a plan after confirmation,
    the court is not required to hold a hearing. See Sec. 1229(b)(2)
    and Sec. 1329(b)(2) which provide that the plan as modified becomes
    the plan unless, after notice and a hearing, such modification is
    disapproved. See Sec. 102(1). The notice of the time fixed for
    filing objections to the proposed modification should set a date
    for a hearing to be held in the event that an objection is filed.
      Amendments to the title of this rule are stylistic and make no
    substantive change.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to
    substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout

      (b) Disclosure Statement. In a chapter 9 or 11 case, a disclosure
    statement under Sec. 1125 of the Code or evidence showing

    a time fixed by the court, unless the plan is intended to provide
    adequate information under Sec. 1125(f)(1). If the plan is intended
    to provide adequate information under Sec. 1125(f)(1), it shall be

    and identify the entities that would be subject to the injunction.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule implements the Code provisions concerning the filing of
    plans in chapters 9 and 11.
      Chapter 9 Cases. Section 941 provides that the debtor may file a
    plan with the petition or thereafter but within a time fixed by the
    court. A rule, therefore, is unnecessary to specify the time for
    filing chapter 9 plans.
      Chapter 11 Nonrailroad Cases. Section 1121 contains detailed
    provisions with respect to who may file a chapter 11 plan and, in
    part, the time period. Section 1121(a) permits a debtor to file a
    plan with the petition or at any time during the case. Section
    1121(b) and (c) grants exclusive periods of 120 days and 180 days
    for the debtor to file and obtain acceptance of a plan. Failure to
    take advantage of these periods or the appointment of a trustee
    would permit other parties in interest to file a plan. These
    statutory provisions are not repeated in the rules.
      Chapter 11 Railroad Cases. Pursuant to subchapter IV of chapter
    11, Sec. 1121 of the Code is applicable in railroad cases; see
    Secs. 1161, 103(g). A trustee, however, is to be appointed in every
    case; thus, pursuant to Sec. 1121(c), any party in interest may
    file a plan. See discussion of subdivision (a) of this rule, infra.
      Subdivision (a). Section 1121(c), while permitting parties in
    interest a limited right to file plans, does not provide any time
    limitation. This subdivision sets as the deadline, the conclusion
    of the hearing on the disclosure statement. The court may, however,
    grant additional time. It is derived from former Chapter X Rule 10-
    301(c)(2) which used, as the cut-off time, the conclusion of the
    hearing on approval of a plan. As indicated, supra, Sec. 1121(a)
    permits a debtor to file a plan at any time during the chapter 11
    case. Under Sec. 1121(c), parties other than a debtor may file a
    plan only after a trustee is appointed or the debtor's exclusive
    time expires.
      Subdivision (b) requires plans to be properly identified.
      Subdivision (c). This provision is new. In chapter 9 and 11 cases
    (including railroad reorganization cases) postpetition solicitation
    of votes on a plan requires transmittal of a disclosure statement,
    the contents of which have been approved by the court. See Sec.
    1125 of the Code. A prepetition solicitation must either have been
    in conformity with applicable nonbankruptcy law or, if none, the
    disclosure must have been of adequate information as set forth in
    Sec. 1125 of the Code. See Sec. 1126(b). Subdivision (c) of this
    rule provides the time for filing the disclosure statement or
    evidence of compliance with Sec. 1126(b) which ordinarily will be
    with the plan but the court may allow a later time or the court
    may, pursuant to the last sentence, fix a time certain. Rule 3017
    deals with the hearing on the disclosure statement. The disclosure
    statement, pursuant to Sec. 1125 is to contain adequate
    information. "Adequate information" is defined in Sec. 1125(a) as
    information that would permit a reasonable creditor or equity
    security holder to make an informed judgment on the plan.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to enlarge the time for filing
    competing plans. A party in interest may not file a plan without
    leave of court only if an order approving a disclosure statement
    relating to another plan has been entered and a decision on
    confirmation of the plan has not been entered. This subdivision
    does not fix a deadline beyond which a debtor may not file a plan.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1996 AMENDMENT       
      Section 1121(c) gives a party in interest the right to file a
    chapter 11 plan after expiration of the period when only the debtor
    may file a plan. Under Sec. 1121(d), the exclusive period in which
    only the debtor may file a plan may be extended, but only if a
    party in interest so requests and the court, after notice and a
    hearing, finds cause for an extension. Subdivision (a) is abrogated
    because it could have the effect of extending the debtor's
    exclusive period for filing a plan without satisfying the
    requirements of Sec. 1121(d). The abrogation of subdivision (a)
    does not affect the court's discretion with respect to the
    scheduling of hearings on the approval of disclosure statements
    when more than one plan has been filed.
      The amendment to subdivision (c), redesignated as subdivision
    (b), is stylistic.
      GAP Report on Rule 3016. No changes since publication, except for
    a stylistic change.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2001 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (c) is added to assure that entities whose conduct
    would be enjoined under a plan, rather than by operation of the
    Code, are given adequate notice of the proposed injunction. The
    validity and effect of any injunction are substantive law matters
    that are beyond the scope of these rules.
      Specific and conspicuous language is not necessary if the
    injunction contained in the plan is substantially the same as an
    injunction provided under the Code. For example, if a plan contains
    an injunction against acts to collect a discharged debt from the
    debtor, Rule 3016(c) would not apply because that conduct would be
    enjoined nonetheless under Sec. 524(a)(2). But if a plan provides
    that creditors will be permanently enjoined from asserting claims
    against persons who are not debtors in the case, the plan and
    disclosure statement must highlight the injunctive language and
    comply with the requirements of Rule 3016(c). See Sec. 524(e).
      The requirement in this rule that the plan and disclosure
    statement identify the entities that would be subject to the
    injunction requires reasonable identification under the
    circumstances. If the entities that would be subject to the
    injunction cannot be identified by name, the plan and disclosure
    statement may describe them by class or category. For example, it
    may be sufficient to identify the subjects of the injunction as
    "all creditors of the debtor."
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The word
    "highlighted" in the parenthesis was replaced with "underlined"
    because highlighted documents are difficult to scan electronically
    for inclusion in the clerks' files. The Committee Note was revised
    to put in a more prominent position the statement that the validity
    and effect of any injunction provided for in a plan are substantive
    matters beyond the scope of the rules. Other stylistic changes were
    made to the Committee Note.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (b) is amended to recognize that, in 2005, Sec.
    1125(f)(1) was added to the Code to provide that the plan proponent
    in a small business case need not file a disclosure statement if
    the plan itself includes adequate information and the court finds
    that a separate disclosure statement is unnecessary. If the plan is
    intended to provide adequate information in a small business case,
    it may be conditionally approved as a disclosure statement under
    Rule 3017.1 and is subject to all other rules applicable to
    disclosure statements in small business cases.
      Subdivision (d) is added to the rule to implement Sec. 433 of the
    Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005
    which requires the promulgation of Official Forms for plans and
    disclosure statements in small business cases. Section 1125(f)(2)
    of the Code provides that the court may approve a disclosure
    statement submitted on the appropriate Official Form or on a
    standard form approved by the court. The rule takes no position on
    whether a court may require a local standard form disclosure
    statement or plan of reorganization in lieu of the Official Forms.
      Other amendments are stylistic.
      Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after
    publication.

-HEAD-
    Rule 3017. Court Consideration of Disclosure Statement in a Chapter
      9 Municipality or Chapter 11 Reorganization Case

-STATUTE-
      (a) Hearing on Disclosure Statement and Objections. Except as
    provided in Rule 3017.1, after a disclosure statement is filed in
    accordance with Rule 3016(b), the court shall hold a hearing on at
    least 28 days' notice to the debtor, creditors, equity security
    holders and other parties in interest as provided in Rule 2002 to
    consider the disclosure statement and any objections or
    modifications thereto. The plan and the disclosure statement shall
    be mailed with the notice of the hearing only to the debtor, any
    trustee or committee appointed under the Code, the Securities and
    Exchange Commission and any party in interest who requests in
    writing a copy of the statement or plan. Objections to the
    disclosure statement shall be filed and served on the debtor, the
    trustee, any committee appointed under the Code, and any other
    entity designated by the court, at any time before the disclosure
    statement is approved or by an earlier date as the court may fix.
    In a chapter 11 reorganization case, every notice, plan, disclosure
    statement, and objection required to be served or mailed pursuant
    to this subdivision shall be transmitted to the United States
    trustee within the time provided in this subdivision.
      (b) Determination on Disclosure Statement. Following the hearing
    the court shall determine whether the disclosure statement should
    be approved.
      (c) Dates Fixed for Voting on Plan and Confirmation. On or before
    approval of the disclosure statement, the court shall fix a time
    within which the holders of claims and interests may accept or
    reject the plan and may fix a date for the hearing on confirmation.
      (d) Transmission and Notice to United States Trustee, Creditors,
    and Equity Security Holders. Upon approval of a disclosure
    statement, -  (!1) except to the extent that the court orders
    otherwise with respect to one or more unimpaired classes of
    creditors or equity security holders - the debtor in possession,
    trustee, proponent of the plan, or clerk as the court orders shall
    mail to all creditors and equity security holders, and in a chapter
    11 reorganization case shall transmit to the United States trustee,

        (1) the plan or a court-approved summary of the plan;
        (2) the disclosure statement approved by the court;
        (3) notice of the time within which acceptances and rejections
      of the plan may be filed; and
        (4) any other information as the court may direct, including
      any court opinion approving the disclosure statement or a court-
      approved summary of the opinion.

    In addition, notice of the time fixed for filing objections and the
    hearing on confirmation shall be mailed to all creditors and equity
    security holders in accordance with Rule 2002(b), and a form of
    ballot conforming to the appropriate Official Form shall be mailed
    to creditors and equity security holders entitled to vote on the
    plan. If the court opinion is not transmitted or only a summary of
    the plan is transmitted, the court opinion or the plan shall be
    provided on request of a party in interest at the plan proponent's
    expense. If the court orders that the disclosure statement and the
    plan or a summary of the plan shall not be mailed to any unimpaired
    class, notice that the class is designated in the plan as
    unimpaired and notice of the name and address of the person from
    whom the plan or summary of the plan and disclosure statement may
    be obtained upon request and at the plan proponent's expense, shall
    be mailed to members of the unimpaired class together with the
    notice of the time fixed for filing objections to and the hearing
    on confirmation. For the purposes of this subdivision, creditors
    and equity security holders shall include holders of stock, bonds,
    debentures, notes, and other securities of record on the date the
    order approving the disclosure statement is entered or another date
    fixed by the court, for cause, after notice and a hearing.
      (e) Transmission to Beneficial Holders of Securities. At the
    hearing held pursuant to subdivision (a) of this rule, the court
    shall consider the procedures for transmitting the documents and
    information required by subdivision (d) of this rule to beneficial
    holders of stock, bonds, debentures, notes, and other securities,
    determine the adequacy of the procedures, and enter any orders the
    court deems appropriate.
      (f) Notice and Transmission of Documents to Entities Subject to
    an Injunction Under a Plan. If a plan provides for an injunction
    against conduct not otherwise enjoined under the Code and an entity
    that would be subject to the injunction is not a creditor or equity
    security holder, at the hearing held under Rule 3017(a), the court
    shall consider procedures for providing the entity with:
        (1) at least 28 days' notice of the time fixed for filing
      objections and the hearing on confirmation of the plan containing
      the information described in Rule 2002(c)(3); and
        (2) to the extent feasible, a copy of the plan and disclosure
      statement.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is adapted from former Rule 10-303 which dealt with the
    approval of a Chapter X plan by the court. There is no requirement
    for plan approval in a chapter 9 or 11 case under the Code but
    there is the requirement that a disclosure statement containing
    adequate financial information be approved by the court after
    notice and a hearing before votes on a plan are solicited. Section
    1125(b) of the Code is made applicable in chapter 9 cases by Sec.
    901(a). It is also applicable in railroad reorganization cases
    under subchapter IV of chapter 11; see Sec. 1161 of the Code.
      Subdivision (a) of this rule provides for the hearing on the
    disclosure statement. Thus, a hearing would be required in all
    cases; whether it may be ex parte would depend on the circumstances
    of the case, but a mere absence of objections would not eliminate
    the need for a hearing; see Sec. 102(1) of the Code.
      No provision similar to former Rule 10-303(f) is included. That
    subdivision together with former Rule 10-304 prohibited
    solicitation of votes until after entry of an order approving the
    plan. Section 1125(b) of the Code explicitly provides that votes on
    a plan may not be solicited until a disclosure statement approved
    by the court is transmitted. Pursuant to the change in rulemaking
    power, a comparable provision in this rule is unnecessary. 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 2075.
      Copies of the disclosure statement and plan need not be mailed
    with the notice of the hearing or otherwise transmitted prior to
    the hearing except with respect to the parties explicitly set forth
    in the subdivision.
      It should be noted that, by construction, the singular includes
    the plural. Therefore, the phrase "plan or plans" or "disclosure
    statement or statements" has not been used although the possibility
    of multiple plans and statements is recognized.
      Subdivision (d) permits the court to require a party other than
    the clerk of the bankruptcy court to bear the responsibility for
    transmitting the notices and documents specified in the rule when
    votes on the plan are solicited. Ordinarily the person responsible
    for such mailing will be the proponent of the plan. In rare cases
    the clerk may be directed to mail these documents, particularly
    when the trustee would have the responsibility but there is
    insufficient money in the estate to enable the trustee to perform
    this task.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (d). Section 1125(c) of the Code requires that the
    entire approved disclosure statement be provided in connection with
    voting on a plan. The court is authorized by Sec. 1125(c) to
    approve different disclosure statements for different classes.
    Although the rule does not permit the mailing of a summary of the
    disclosure statement in place of the approved disclosure statement,
    the court may approve a summary of the disclosure statement to be
    mailed with the complete disclosure statement to those voting on
    the plan.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to enable the United States trustee to
    monitor and comment with regard to chapter 11 disclosure statements
    and plans. The United States trustee does not perform these
    functions in a chapter 9 municipal debt adjustment case. See 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 586(a)(3)(B).
      Subdivision (d) is amended to give the court the discretion to
    direct that one or more unimpaired classes shall not receive
    disclosure statements, plans, or summaries of plans. Members of
    unimpaired classes are not entitled to vote on the plan. Although
    disclosure statements enable members of unimpaired classes to make
    informed judgments as to whether to object to confirmation because
    of lack of feasibility or other grounds, in an unusual case the
    court may direct that disclosure statements shall not be sent to
    such classes if to do so would not be feasible considering the size
    of the unimpaired classes and the expense of printing and mailing.
    In any event, all creditors are entitled to notice of the time
    fixed for filing objections and notice of the hearing to consider
    confirmation of the plan pursuant to Rule 2002(b) and the
    requirement of such notice may not be excused with respect to
    unimpaired classes. The amendment to subdivision (d) also ensures
    that the members of unimpaired classes who do not receive such
    documents will have sufficient information so that they may request
    these documents in advance of the hearing on confirmation. The
    amendment to subdivision (d) is not intended to give the court the
    discretion to dispense with the mailing of the plan and disclosure
    statement to governmental units holding claims entitled to priority
    under Sec. 507(a)(7) because they may not be classified. See Sec.
    1123(a)(1).
      The words "with the court" in subdivision (a) are deleted as
    unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3). Reference to the
    Official Form number in subdivision (d) is deleted in anticipation
    of future revision and renumbering of the Official Forms.
      Subdivision (e) is designed to ensure that appropriate measures
    are taken for the plan, disclosure statement, ballot and other
    materials which are required to be transmitted to creditors and
    equity security holders under this rule to reach the beneficial
    holders of securities held in nominee name. Such measures may
    include orders directing the trustee or debtor in possession to
    reimburse the nominees out of the funds of the estate for the
    expenses incurred by them in distributing materials to beneficial
    holders. In most cases, the plan proponent will not know the
    identities of the beneficial holders and therefore it will be
    necessary to rely on the nominal holders of the securities to
    distribute the plan materials to the beneficial owners.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to provide that it does not apply to
    the extent provided in new Rule 3017.1, which applies in small
    business cases.
      Subdivision (d) is amended to provide flexibility in fixing the
    record date for the purpose of determining the holders of
    securities who are entitled to receive documents pursuant to this
    subdivision. For example, if there may be a delay between the oral
    announcement of the judge's order approving the disclosure
    statement and entry of the order on the court docket, the court may
    fix the date on which the judge orally approves the disclosure
    statement as the record date so that the parties may expedite
    preparation of the lists necessary to facilitate the distribution
    of the plan, disclosure statement, ballots, and other related
    documents.
      The court may set a record date pursuant to subdivision (d) only
    after notice and a hearing as provided in Sec. 102(1) of the Code.
    Notice of a request for an order fixing the record date may be
    included in the notice of the hearing to consider approval of the
    disclosure statement mailed pursuant to Rule 2002(b).
      If the court fixes a record date pursuant to subdivision (d) with
    respect to the holders of securities, and the holders are impaired
    by the plan, the judge also should order that the same record date
    applies for the purpose of determining eligibility for voting
    pursuant to Rule 3018(a).
      Other amendments to this rule are stylistic.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2001 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (f) is added to assure that entities whose conduct
    would be enjoined under a plan, rather than by operation of the
    Code, and who will not receive the documents listed in subdivision
    (d) because they are neither creditors nor equity security holders,
    are provided with adequate notice of the proposed injunction. It
    does not address any substantive law issues relating to the
    validity or effect of any injunction provided under a plan, or any
    due process or other constitutional issues relating to notice.
    These issues are beyond the scope of these rules and are left for
    judicial determination.
      This rule recognizes the need for adequate notice to subjects of
    an injunction, but that reasonable flexibility under the
    circumstances may be required. If a known and identifiable entity
    would be subject to the injunction, and the notice, plan, and
    disclosure statement could be mailed to that entity, the court
    should require that they be mailed at the same time that the plan,
    disclosure statement and related documents are mailed to creditors
    under Rule 3017(d). If mailing notices and other documents is not
    feasible because the entities subject to the injunction are
    described in the plan and disclosure statement by class or category
    and they cannot be identified individually by name and address, the
    court may require that notice under Rule 3017(f)(1) be published.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    in the text of the proposed amendments since publication. The
    Committee Note was revised to put in a more prominent position the
    statement that the rule does not address related substantive law
    issues which are beyond the scope of the rules.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to
    substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout
    the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 15-day periods become 14-day periods

    or on its own initiative, conditionally approve a disclosure
    statement filed in accordance with Rule 3016. On or before
    conditional approval of the disclosure statement, the court shall:
        (1) fix a time within which the holders of claims and interests
      may accept or reject the plan;
        (2) fix a time for filing objections to the disclosure
      statement;
        (3) fix a date for the hearing on final approval of the
      disclosure statement to be held if a timely objection is filed;
      and

      (b) Application of Rule 3017. Rule 3017(a), (b), (c), and (e) do
    not apply to a conditionally approved disclosure statement. Rule
    3017(d) applies to a conditionally approved disclosure statement,
    except that conditional approval is considered approval of the
    disclosure statement for the purpose of applying Rule 3017(d).
      (c) Final Approval.
        (1) Notice. Notice of the time fixed for filing objections and
      the hearing to consider final approval of the disclosure
      statement shall be given in accordance with Rule 2002 and may be
      combined with notice of the hearing on confirmation of the plan.
        (2) Objections. Objections to the disclosure statement shall be
      filed, transmitted to the United States trustee, and served on
      the debtor, the trustee, any committee appointed under the Code
      and any other entity designated by the court at any time before
      final approval of the disclosure statement or by an earlier date
      as the court may fix.
        (3) Hearing. If a timely objection to the disclosure statement
      is filed, the court shall hold a hearing to consider final
      approval before or combined with the hearing on confirmation of
      the plan.

      This rule is added to implement Sec. 1125(f) that was added to
    the Code by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994.
      The procedures for electing to be considered a small business are
    set forth in Rule 1020. If the debtor is a small business and has
    elected to be considered a small business, Sec. 1125(f) permits the
    court to conditionally approve a disclosure statement subject to
    final approval after notice and a hearing. If a disclosure
    statement is conditionally approved, and no timely objection to the
    disclosure statement is filed, it is not necessary for the court to
    hold a hearing on final approval.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      Section 101 of the Code, as amended in 2005, defines a "small
    business case" and "small business debtor," and eliminates any need
    to elect that status. Therefore, the reference in the rule to an
    election is deleted.
      As provided in the amendment to Rule 3016(b), a plan intended to
    provide adequate information in a small business case under Sec.
    1125(f)(1) may be conditionally approved and is otherwise treated
    as a disclosure statement under this rule.

-HEAD-
    Rule 3018. Acceptance or Rejection of Plan in a Chapter 9
      Municipality or a Chapter 11 Reorganization Case

-STATUTE-
      (a) Entities Entitled To Accept or Reject Plan; Time for
    Acceptance or Rejection. A plan may be accepted or rejected in
    accordance with Sec. 1126 of the Code within the time fixed by the
    court pursuant to Rule 3017. Subject to subdivision (b) of this
    rule, an equity security holder or creditor whose claim is based on
    a security of record shall not be entitled to accept or reject a
    plan unless the equity security holder or creditor is the holder of
    record of the security on the date the order approving the
    disclosure statement is entered or on another date fixed by the
    court, for cause, after notice and a hearing. For cause shown, the
    court after notice and hearing may permit a creditor or equity
    security holder to change or withdraw an acceptance or rejection.
    Notwithstanding objection to a claim or interest, the court after
    notice and hearing may temporarily allow the claim or interest in
    an amount which the court deems proper for the purpose of accepting
    or rejecting a plan.
      (b) Acceptances or Rejections Obtained Before Petition. An equity
    security holder or creditor whose claim is based on a security of
    record who accepted or rejected the plan before the commencement of
    the case shall not be deemed to have accepted or rejected the plan
    pursuant to Sec. 1126(b) of the Code unless the equity security
    holder or creditor was the holder of record of the security on the
    date specified in the solicitation of such acceptance or rejection
    for the purposes of such solicitation. A holder of a claim or
    interest who has accepted or rejected a plan before the
    commencement of the case under the Code shall not be deemed to have
    accepted or rejected the plan if the court finds after notice and
    hearing that the plan was not transmitted to substantially all
    creditors and equity security holders of the same class, that an
    unreasonably short time was prescribed for such creditors and
    equity security holders to accept or reject the plan, or that the
    solicitation was not in compliance with Sec. 1126(b) of the Code.
      (c) Form of Acceptance or Rejection. An acceptance or rejection
    shall be in writing, identify the plan or plans accepted or
    rejected, be signed by the creditor or equity security holder or an
    authorized agent, and conform to the appropriate Official Form. If
    more than one plan is transmitted pursuant to Rule 3017, an
    acceptance or rejection may be filed by each creditor or equity
    security holder for any number of plans transmitted and if
    acceptances are filed for more than one plan, the creditor or
    equity security holder may indicate a preference or preferences
    among the plans so accepted.
      (d) Acceptance or Rejection by Partially Secured Creditor. A
    creditor whose claim has been allowed in part as a secured claim
    and in part as an unsecured claim shall be entitled to accept or
    reject a plan in both capacities.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule applies in chapter 9, 11 and 13 cases under the Code.
    The references in the rule to equity security holders will not,
    however, be relevant in chapter 9 or 13 cases. The rule will be of
    little utility in a chapter 13 case because only secured creditors
    may be requested to vote on a plan; unsecured creditors are not
    entitled to vote; see Sec. 1325(a)(4), (5) of the Code.
      Subdivision (a) is derived from former Rule 10-305(a). It
    substitutes, in a reorganization case, entry of the order approving
    the disclosure statement for the order approving a plan in
    conformity with the differences between Chapter X and chapter 11.
    In keeping with the underlying theory it continues to recognize
    that the lapse of time between the filing of the petition and entry
    of such order will normally be significant and, during that
    interim, bonds and equity interests can change ownership.
      Subdivision (b) recognizes the former Chapter XI practice
    permitting a plan and acceptances to be filed with the petition, as
    does Sec. 1126(b) of the Code. However, because a plan under
    chapter 11 may affect shareholder interests, there should be
    reference to a record date of ownership. In this instance the
    appropriate record date is that used in the prepetition
    solicitation materials because it is those acceptances or
    rejections which are being submitted to the court.
      While Sec. 1126(c), (d), and (e) prohibits use of an acceptance
    or rejection not procured in good faith, the added provision in
    subdivision (b) of the rule is somewhat more detailed. It would
    prohibit use of prepetition acceptances or rejections when some but
    not all impaired creditors or equity security holders are solicited
    or when they are not given a reasonable opportunity to submit their
    acceptances or rejections. This provision together with Sec.
    1126(e) gives the court the power to nullify abusive solicitation
    procedures.
      Subdivision (c). It is possible that multiple plans may be before
    the court for confirmation. Pursuant to Sec. 1129(c) of the Code,
    the court may confirm only one plan but is required to consider the
    preferences expressed by those accepting the plans in determining
    which one to confirm.
      Subdivisions (d) and (e) of former Rule 10-305 are not continued
    since comparable provisions are contained in the statute; see Sec.
    1126(c), (d), (e).
      It should be noted that while the singular "plan" is used
    throughout, by construction the plural is included; see Sec.
    102(7).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivisions (a) and (b) are amended to delete provisions that
    duplicate Sec. 1126 of the Code. An entity who is not a record
    holder of a security, but who claims that it is entitled to be
    treated as a record holder, may file a statement pursuant to Rule
    3003(d).
      Subdivision (a) is amended further to allow the court to permit a
    creditor or equity security holder to change or withdraw an
    acceptance or rejection for cause shown whether or not the time
    fixed for voting has expired.
      Subdivision (b) is also amended to give effect to a prepetition
    acceptance or rejection if solicitation requirements were satisfied
    with respect to substantially all members of the same class,
    instead of requiring proper solicitation with respect to
    substantially all members of all classes.
      Subdivision (c) is amended to delete the Official Form number in
    anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the Official
    Forms.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      The title of this rule is amended to indicate that it applies
    only in a chapter 9 or a chapter 11 case. The amendment of the word
    "Plans" to "Plan" is stylistic.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to provide flexibility in fixing the
    record date for the purpose of determining the holders of
    securities who are entitled to vote on the plan. For example, if
    there may be a delay between the oral announcement of the judge's
    decision approving the disclosure statement and entry of the order
    on the court docket, the court may fix the date on which the judge
    orally approves the disclosure statement as the record date for
    voting purposes so that the parties may expedite preparation of the
    lists necessary to facilitate the distribution of the plan,
    disclosure statement, ballots, and other related documents in
    connection with the solicitation of votes.
      The court may set a record date pursuant to subdivision (a) only
    after notice and a hearing as provided in Sec. 102(1) of the Code.
    Notice of a request for an order fixing the record date may be
    included in the notice of the hearing to consider approval of the
    disclosure statement mailed pursuant to Rule 2002(b).
      If the court fixes the record date for voting purposes, the judge
    also should order that the same record date shall apply for the
    purpose of distributing the documents required to be distributed
    pursuant to Rule 3017(d).

-HEAD-
    Rule 3019. Modification of Accepted Plan in a Chapter 9
      Municipality or a Chapter 11 Reorganization Case

-STATUTE-
      (a) Modification of Plan Before Confirmation. In a chapter 9 or
    chapter 11 case, after a plan has been accepted and before its
    confirmation, the proponent may file a modification of the plan. If
    the court finds after hearing on notice to the trustee, any
    committee appointed under the Code, and any other entity designated
    by the court that the proposed modification does not adversely
    change the treatment of the claim of any creditor or the interest
    of any equity security holder who has not accepted in writing the
    modification, it shall be deemed accepted by all creditors and
    equity security holders who have previously accepted the plan.
      (b) Modification of Plan After Confirmation in Individual Debtor
    Case. If the debtor is an individual, a request to modify the plan
    under Sec. 1127(e) of the Code is governed by Rule 9014. The
    request shall identify the proponent and shall be filed together
    with the proposed modification. The clerk, or some other person as
    the court may direct, shall give the debtor, the trustee, and all
    creditors not less than 21 days' notice by mail of the time fixed
    to file objections and, if an objection is filed, the hearing to
    consider the proposed modification, unless the court orders
    otherwise with respect to creditors who are not affected by the
    proposed modification. A copy of the notice shall be transmitted to
    the United States trustee, together with a copy of the proposed
    modification. Any objection to the proposed modification shall be
    filed and served on the debtor, the proponent of the modification,
    the trustee, and any other entity designated by the court, and
    shall be transmitted to the United States trustee.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule implements Secs. 942, 1127 and 1323 of the Code. For
    example, Sec. 1127 provides for modification before and after
    confirmation but does not deal with the minor modifications that do
    not adversely change any rights. The rule makes clear that a
    modification may be made, after acceptance of the plan without
    submission to creditors and equity security holders if their
    interests are not affected. To come within this rule, the
    modification should be one that does not change the rights of a
    creditor or equity security holder as fixed in the plan before
    modification.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to limit its application to chapter 9 and
    chapter 11 cases. Modification of plans after confirmation in
    chapter 12 and chapter 13 cases is governed by Rule 3015. The
    addition of the comma in the second sentence is stylistic and makes
    no substantive change.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      The 2005 amendments to Sec. 1127 of the Code provide for
    modification of a confirmed plan in an individual debtor chapter 11
    case. Therefore, the rule is amended to establish the procedure for
    filing and objecting to a proposed modification of a confirmed
    plan.
      Changes Made After Publication. The last sentence of the
    published rule provided that an objection to modification of a plan
    is governed by Rule 9014. The sentence is deleted and the reference
    to Rule 9014 is moved to the first sentence of subdivision (b) of
    the rule. The Committee Note was revised to make the reference to
    the 2005 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code consistent with their
    identification in other Committee Notes.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute
    a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules,
    deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods

    Rule 3020. Deposit; Confirmation of Plan in a Chapter 9
      Municipality or Chapter 11 Reorganization Case

-STATUTE-
      (a) Deposit. In a chapter 11 case, prior to entry of the order
    confirming the plan, the court may order the deposit with the
    trustee or debtor in possession of the consideration required by
    the plan to be distributed on confirmation. Any money deposited
    shall be kept in a special account established for the exclusive
    purpose of making the distribution.
      (b) Objection to and Hearing on Confirmation in a Chapter 9 or
    Chapter 11 Case.
        (1) Objection. An objection to confirmation of the plan shall
      be filed and served on the debtor, the trustee, the proponent of
      the plan, any committee appointed under the Code, and any other
      entity designated by the court, within a time fixed by the court.
      Unless the case is a chapter 9 municipality case, a copy of every
      objection to confirmation shall be transmitted by the objecting
      party to the United States trustee within the time fixed for
      filing objections. An objection to confirmation is governed by
      Rule 9014.
        (2) Hearing. The court shall rule on confirmation of the plan
      after notice and hearing as provided in Rule 2002. If no
      objection is timely filed, the court may determine that the plan
      has been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by
      law without receiving evidence on such issues.

      (c) Order of Confirmation.
        (1) The order of confirmation shall conform to the appropriate
      Official Form. If the plan provides for an injunction against
      conduct not otherwise enjoined under the Code, the order of
      confirmation shall (1) describe in reasonable detail all acts
      enjoined; (2) be specific in its terms regarding the injunction;
      and (3) identify the entities subject to the injunction.
        (2) Notice of entry of the order of confirmation shall be
      mailed promptly to the debtor, the trustee, creditors, equity
      security holders, other parties in interest, and, if known, to
      any identified entity subject to an injunction provided for in
      the plan against conduct not otherwise enjoined under the Code.
        (3) Except in a chapter 9 municipality case, notice of entry of
      the order of confirmation shall be transmitted to the United
      States trustee as provided in Rule 2002(k).

      (d) Retained Power. Notwithstanding the entry of the order of
    confirmation, the court may issue any other order necessary to
    administer the estate.
      (e) Stay of Confirmation Order. An order confirming a plan is
    stayed until the expiration of 14 days after the entry of the
    order, unless the court orders otherwise.

      This rule is adapted from former Rules 10-307, 11-38, and 13-213.
    It applies to cases filed under chapters 9, 11 and 13. Certain
    subdivisions of the earlier rules have not been included, such as,
    a subdivision revesting title in the debtor because Sec. 541 of the
    Code does not transfer title out of the debtor as did Sec. 70a of
    the Bankruptcy Act; see also Secs. 1141(b), 1327(b). Subdivision
    (b) of former Rule 13-213 is not included because its provisions
    are contained in the statute; see Secs. 1322, 1325(b), 105.
      Subdivision (a) gives discretion to the court to require in
    chapter 11 cases the deposit of any consideration to be distributed
    on confirmation. If money is to be distributed, it is to be
    deposited in a special account to assure that it will not be used
    for any other purpose. The Code is silent in chapter 11 with
    respect to the need to make a deposit or the person with whom any
    deposit is to be made. Consequently, there is no statutory
    authority for any person to act in a capacity similar to the
    disbursing agent under former Chapter XI practice. This rule
    provides that only the debtor in possession or trustee should be
    appointed as the recipient of the deposit. Any consideration other
    than money, e.g., notes or stock may be given directly to the
    debtor in possession or trustee and need not be left in any kind of
    special account. In chapter 9 cases, Sec. 944(b) provides for
    deposit with a disbursing agent appointed by the court of any
    consideration to be distributed under the plan.
      Subdivision (d) clarifies the authority of the court to conclude
    matters pending before it prior to confirmation and to continue to
    administer the estate as necessary, e.g., resolving objections to
    claims.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      The United States trustee monitors chapter 11, chapter 12, and
    chapter 13 plans and has standing to be heard regarding
    confirmation of a plan. See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 586(a)(3). The
    amendments to subdivisions (b)(1) and (c) of this rule facilitate
    that role of the United States trustee. Subdivision (b)(1) is also
    amended to require service on the proponent of the plan of
    objections to confirmation. The words "with the court" in
    subdivision (b)(1) are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a)
    and 9001(3).
      In a chapter 12 case, the court is required to conduct and
    conclude the hearing on confirmation of the plan within the time
    prescribed in Sec. 1224 of the Code.
      Subdivision (c) is also amended to require that the confirmation
    order be mailed to the trustee. Reference to the Official Form
    number is deleted in anticipation of future revision and
    renumbering of the Official Forms.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to limit its application to chapter 9 and
    chapter 11 cases. The procedures relating to confirmation of plans
    in chapter 12 and chapter 13 cases are provided in Rule 3015. Other
    amendments are stylistic and make no substantive change.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1999 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (e) is added to provide sufficient time for a party
    to request a stay pending appeal of an order confirming a plan
    under chapter 9 or chapter 11 of the Code before the plan is
    implemented and an appeal becomes moot. Unless the court orders
    otherwise, any transfer of assets, issuance of securities, and cash
    distributions provided for in the plan may not be made before the
    expiration of the 10-day period. The stay of the confirmation order
    under subdivision (e) does not affect the time for filing a notice
    of appeal from the confirmation order in accordance with Rule 8002.
      The court may, in its discretion, order that Rule 3020(e) is not
    applicable so that the plan may be implemented and distributions
    may be made immediately. Alternatively, the court may order that
    the stay under Rule 3020(e) is for a fixed period less than 10
    days.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2001 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (c) is amended to provide notice to an entity subject
    to an injunction provided for in a plan against conduct not
    otherwise enjoined by operation of the Code. This requirement is
    not applicable to an injunction contained in a plan if it is
    substantially the same as an injunction provided under the Code.
    The validity and effect of any injunction provided for in a plan
    are substantive law matters that are beyond the scope of these
    rules.
      The requirement that the order of confirmation identify the
    entities subject to the injunction requires only reasonable
    identification under the circumstances. If the entities that would
    be subject to the injunction cannot be identified by name, the
    order may describe them by class or category if reasonable under
    the circumstances. For example, it may be sufficient to identify
    the entities as "all creditors of the debtor."
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    in the text of the proposed amendments. The Committee Note was
    revised to put in a more prominent position the statement that the
    validity and effect of injunctions provided for in plans is beyond
    the scope of the rules.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute
    a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules,
    deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 15-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 20-day periods become 21-day periods
        -- 25-day periods become 28-day periods

    Rule 3021. Distribution Under Plan

-STATUTE-
      Except as provided in Rule 3020(e), after a plan is confirmed,
    distribution shall be made to creditors whose claims have been
    allowed, to interest holders whose interests have not been
    disallowed, and to indenture trustees who have filed claims under
    Rule 3003(c)(5) that have been allowed. For purposes of this rule,
    creditors include holders of bonds, debentures, notes, and other
    debt securities, and interest holders include the holders of stock
    and other equity securities, of record at the time of commencement
    of distribution, unless a different time is fixed by the plan or
    the order confirming the plan.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is derived from former Chapter X Rule 10-405(a).
    Subdivision (b) of that rule is covered by Sec. 1143 of the Code.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to provide flexibility in fixing the record
    date for the purpose of making distributions to holders of
    securities of record. In a large case, it may be impractical for
    the debtor to determine the holders of record with respect to
    publicly held securities and also to make distributions to those
    holders at the same time. Under this amendment, the plan or the
    order confirming the plan may fix a record date for distributions
    that is earlier than the date on which distributions commence.
      This rule also is amended to treat holders of bonds, debentures,
    notes, and other debt securities the same as any other creditors by
    providing that they shall receive a distribution only if their
    claims have been allowed. Finally, the amendments clarify that
    distributions are to be made to all interest holders - not only
    those that are within the definition of "equity security holders"
    under Sec. 101 of the Code - whose interests have not been
    disallowed.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1999 AMENDMENT             
      This amendment is to conform to the amendments to Rule 3020
    regarding the ten-day stay of an order confirming a plan in a
    chapter 9 or chapter 11 case. The other amendments are stylistic.

-HEAD-
    Rule 3022. Final Decree in Chapter 11 Reorganization Case

-STATUTE-
      After an estate is fully administered in a chapter 11
    reorganization case, the court, on its own motion or on motion of a
    party in interest, shall enter a final decree closing the case.

-SOURCE-
    (As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Section 350 of the Code requires the court to close the case
    after the estate is fully administered and the trustee has been
    discharged. Section 1143 places a five year limitation on the
    surrender of securities when required for participation under a
    plan but this provision should not delay entry of the final decree.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Entry of a final decree closing a chapter 11 case should not be
    delayed solely because the payments required by the plan have not
    been completed. Factors that the court should consider in
    determining whether the estate has been fully administered include
    (1) whether the order confirming the plan has become final, (2)
    whether deposits required by the plan have been distributed, (3)
    whether the property proposed by the plan to be transferred has
    been transferred, (4) whether the debtor or the successor of the
    debtor under the plan has assumed the business or the management of
    the property dealt with by the plan, (5) whether payments under the
    plan have commenced, and (6) whether all motions, contested
    matters, and adversary proceedings have been finally resolved.
      The court should not keep the case open only because of the
    possibility that the court's jurisdiction may be invoked in the
    future. A final decree closing the case after the estate is fully
    administered does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to enforce
    or interpret its own orders and does not prevent the court from
    reopening the case for cause pursuant to Sec. 350(b) of the Code.
    For example, on motion of a party in interest, the court may reopen
    the case to revoke an order of confirmation procured by fraud under
    Sec. 1144 of the Code. If the plan or confirmation order provides
    that the case shall remain open until a certain date or event
    because of the likelihood that the court's jurisdiction may be
    required for specific purposes prior thereto, the case should
    remain open until that date or event.

    Rule 4001. Relief from Automatic Stay; Prohibiting or Conditioning
      the Use, Sale, or Lease of Property; Use of Cash Collateral;
      Obtaining Credit; Agreements

-STATUTE-
      (a) Relief From Stay; Prohibiting or Conditioning the Use, Sale,
    or Lease of Property.
        (1) Motion. A motion for relief from an automatic stay provided
      by the Code or a motion to prohibit or condition the use, sale,
      or lease of property pursuant to Sec. 363(e) shall be made in
      accordance with Rule 9014 and shall be served on any committee
      elected pursuant to Sec. 705 or appointed pursuant to Sec. 1102
      of the Code or its authorized agent, or, if the case is a chapter
      9 municipality case or a chapter 11 reorganization case and no
      committee of unsecured creditors has been appointed pursuant to
      Sec. 1102, on the creditors included on the list filed pursuant
      to Rule 1007(d), and on such other entities as the court may
      direct.
        (2) Ex Parte Relief. Relief from a stay under Sec. 362(a) or a
      request to prohibit or condition the use, sale, or lease of
      property pursuant to Sec. 363(e) may be granted without prior
      notice only if (A) it clearly appears from specific facts shown
      by affidavit or by a verified motion that immediate and
      irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the movant
      before the adverse party or the attorney for the adverse party
      can be heard in opposition, and (B) the movant's attorney
      certifies to the court in writing the efforts, if any, which have
      been made to give notice and the reasons why notice should not be
      required. The party obtaining relief under this subdivision and
      Sec. 362(f) or Sec. 363(e) shall immediately give oral notice
      thereof to the trustee or debtor in possession and to the debtor
      and forthwith mail or otherwise transmit to such adverse party or
      parties a copy of the order granting relief. On two days notice
      to the party who obtained relief from the stay without notice or
      on shorter notice to that party as the court may prescribe, the
      adverse party may appear and move reinstatement of the stay or
      reconsideration of the order prohibiting or conditioning the use,
      sale, or lease of property. In that event, the court shall
      proceed expeditiously to hear and determine the motion.
        (3) Stay of Order. An order granting a motion for relief from
      an automatic stay made in accordance with Rule 4001(a)(1) is
      stayed until the expiration of 14 days after the entry of the
      order, unless the court orders otherwise.

          (A) Motion. A motion for authority to use cash collateral
        shall be made in accordance with Rule 9014 and shall be
        accompanied by a proposed form of order.
          (B) Contents. The motion shall consist of or (if the motion
        is more than five pages in length) begin with a concise
        statement of the relief requested, not to exceed five pages,
        that lists or summarizes, and sets out the location within the
        relevant documents of, all material provisions, including:
            (i) the name of each entity with an interest in the cash
          collateral;
            (ii) the purposes for the use of the cash collateral;
            (iii) the material terms, including duration, of the use of
          the cash collateral; and
            (iv) any liens, cash payments, or other adequate protection
          that will be provided to each entity with an interest in the
          cash collateral or, if no additional adequate protection is
          proposed, an explanation of why each entity's interest is
          adequately protected.

          (C) Service. The motion shall be served on: (1) any entity
        with an interest in the cash collateral; (2) any committee
        elected under Sec. 705 or appointed under Sec. 1102 of the
        Code, or its authorized agent, or, if the case is a chapter 9
        municipality case or a chapter 11 reorganization case and no
        committee of unsecured creditors has been appointed under Sec.
        1102, the creditors included on the list filed under Rule
        1007(d); and (3) any other entity that the court directs.

        (2) Hearing. The court may commence a final hearing on a motion
      for authorization to use cash collateral no earlier than 14 days
      after service of the motion. If the motion so requests, the court
      may conduct a preliminary hearing before such 14-day period
      expires, but the court may authorize the use of only that amount
      of cash collateral as is necessary to avoid immediate and
      irreparable harm to the estate pending a final hearing.
        (3) Notice. Notice of hearing pursuant to this subdivision
      shall be given to the parties on whom service of the motion is

        concise statement shall also: briefly list or summarize each
        one; identify its specific location in the proposed agreement
        and form of order; and identify any such provision that is
        proposed to remain in effect if interim approval is granted,
        but final relief is denied, as provided under Rule 4001(c)(2).
        In addition, the motion shall describe the nature and extent of
        each provision listed below:

            (iv) a waiver or modification of Code provisions or
          applicable rules relating to the automatic stay;
            (v) a waiver or modification of any entity's authority or
          right to file a plan, seek an extension of time in which the
          debtor has the exclusive right to file a plan, request the
          use of cash collateral under Sec. 363(c), or request
          authority to obtain credit under Sec. 364;
            (vi) the establishment of deadlines for filing a plan of
          reorganization, for approval of a disclosure statement, for a

        shall be accompanied by a copy of the agreement and a proposed
        form of order:
            (i) an agreement to provide adequate protection;

          or lease of property;
            (iii) an agreement to modify or terminate the stay provided
          for in Sec. 362;
            (iv) an agreement to use cash collateral; or
            (v) an agreement between the debtor and an entity that has
          a lien or interest in property of the estate pursuant to
          which the entity consents to the creation of a lien senior or
          equal to the entity's lien or interest in such property.

          (C) Service. The motion shall be served on: (1) any committee
        elected under Sec. 705 or appointed under Sec. 1102 of the
        Code, or its authorized agent, or, if the case is a chapter 9
        municipality case or a chapter 11 reorganization case and no
        committee of unsecured creditors has been appointed under Sec.
        1102, on the creditors included on the list filed under Rule
        1007(d); and (2) on any other entity the court directs.

      objections may be filed and served on the debtor in possession or
      trustee shall be mailed to the parties on whom service is

      mailing of notice.
        (3) Disposition; Hearing. If no objection is filed, the court
      may enter an order approving or disapproving the agreement
      without conducting a hearing. If an objection is filed or if the
      court determines a hearing is appropriate, the court shall hold a
      hearing on no less than five days' notice to the objector, the
      movant, the parties on whom service is required by paragraph (1)
      of this subdivision and such other entities as the court may
      direct.
        (4) Agreement in Settlement of Motion. The court may direct
      that the procedures prescribed in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of
      this subdivision shall not apply and the agreement may be
      approved without further notice if the court determines that a
      motion made pursuant to subdivisions (a), (b), or (c) of this
      rule was sufficient to afford reasonable notice of the material
      provisions of the agreement and opportunity for a hearing.

    provisions regarding the automatic stay that arises on the filing
    of a petition. That section and this rule are applicable in
    chapters 7, 9, 11 and 13 cases. It also implements Sec. 363(c)(2)
    concerning use of cash collateral.
      Subdivision (a) transforms with respect to the automatic stay
    what was an adversary proceeding under the former rules to motion
    practice. The Code provides automatic stays in several sections,
    e.g., Secs. 362(a), 1301(a), and in Sec. 362(d) provides some
    grounds for relief from the stay. This rule specifies that the
    pleading seeking relief is by means of a motion. Thus the time
    period in Rule 7012 to answer a complaint would not be applicable
    and shorter periods may be fixed. Section 362(e) requires the
    preliminary hearing to be concluded within 30 days of it inception,
    rendering ordinary complaint and answer practice inappropriate.
      This subdivision also makes clear that a motion under Rule 9014
    is the proper procedure for a debtor to seek court permission to
    use cash collateral. See Sec. 363(c)(2). Pursuant to Rule 5005, the
    motion should be filed in the court in which the case in pending.
    The court or local rule may specify the persons to be served with
    the motion for relief from the stay; see Rule 9013.
      Subdivision (b) of the rule fills a procedural void left by Sec.
    362. Pursuant to Sec. 362(e), the automatic stay is terminated 30
    days after a motion for relief is made unless the court continues
    the stay as a result of a final hearing or, pending final hearing,
    after a preliminary hearing. If a preliminary hearing is held, Sec.
    362(e) requires the final hearing to be commenced within 30 days
    after the preliminary hearing. Although the expressed legislative
    intent is to require expeditious resolution of a secured party's
    motion for relief, Sec. 362 is silent as to the time within which
    the final hearing must be concluded. Subdivision (b) imposes a 30
    day deadline on the court to resolve the dispute.
      At the final hearing, the stay is to be terminated, modified,
    annulled, or conditioned for cause, which includes, inter alia,
    lack of adequate protection; Sec. 362(d). The burden of proving
    adequate protection is on the party opposing relief from the stay;
    Sec. 362(g)(2). Adequate protection is exemplified in Sec. 361.
      Subdivision (c) implements Sec. 362(f) which permits ex parte
    relief from the stay when there will be irreparable damage. This
    subdivision sets forth the procedure to be followed when relief is
    sought under Sec. 362(f). It is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule
    601(d).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The scope of this rule is expanded and the former subdivisions
    (a), (b) and (c) are now combined in subdivision (a). The new
    subdivision (a)(2) is amended to conform to the 1984 amendments to
    Sec. 362(e) of the Code.
      Subdivision (b) deals explicitly with the procedures which follow
    after a motion to use cash collateral is made and served. Filing
    shall be pursuant to Rule 5005. Service of the motion may be made
    by any method authorized by Rule 7004 and, if service is by mail,
    service is complete on mailing. Rule 9006(e). Under subdivision
    (b)(2), the court may commence a final hearing on the motion within
    15 days of service. Rule 9006(f) does not extend this 15 day period
    when service of the motion is by mail because the party served is
    not required to act within the 15 day period. In addition to
    service of the motion, notice of the hearing must be given. Rule
    9007 authorizes the court to direct the form and manner of giving
    notice that is appropriate to the circumstances.
      Section 363(c)(3) authorizes the court to conduct a preliminary
    hearing and to authorize the use of cash collateral "if there is a
    reasonable likelihood that the trustee will prevail at a final
    hearing." Subdivision (b)(2) of the rule permits a preliminary
    hearing to be held earlier than 15 days after service. Any order
    authorizing the use of cash collateral shall be limited to the
    amount necessary to protect the estate until a final hearing is
    held.
      The objective of subdivision (b) is to accommodate both the
    immediate need of the debtor and the interest of the secured
    creditor in the cash collateral. The time for holding the final
    hearing may be enlarged beyond the 15 days prescribed when required
    by the circumstances.
      The motion for authority to use cash collateral shall include (1)
    the amount of cash collateral sought to be used; (2) the name and
    address of each entity having an interest in the cash collateral;
    (3) the name and address of the entity in control or having
    possession of the cash collateral; (4) the facts demonstrating the
    need to use the cash collateral; and (5) the nature of the
    protection to be provided those having an interest in the cash
    collateral. If a preliminary hearing is requested, the motion shall
    also include the amount of cash collateral sought to be used
    pending final hearing and the protection to be provided.
      Notice of the preliminary and final hearings may be combined.
    This rule does not limit the authority of the court under Sec.
    363(c)(2)(B) and Sec. 102(1).
      Subdivision (c) is new. The service, hearing, and notice
    requirements are similar to those imposed by subdivision (b). The
    motion to obtain credit shall include the amount and type of the
    credit to be extended, the name and address of the lender, the
    terms of the agreement, the need to obtain the credit, and the
    efforts made to obtain credit from other sources. If the motion is
    to obtain credit pursuant to Sec. 364(c) or (d), the motion shall
    describe the collateral, if any, and the protection for any
    existing interest in the collateral which may be affected by the
    proposed agreement.
      Subdivision (d) is new. In the event the 15 day period for filing
    objections to the approval of an agreement of the parties described
    in this subdivision is too long, the parties either may move for a
    reduction of the period under Rule 9006(c)(1) or proceed under
    subdivision (b) or (c), if applicable. Rule 9006(c)(1) requires
    that cause be shown for the reduction of the period in which to
    object. In applying this criterion the court may consider the
    option of proceeding under subdivision (b) or (c) and grant a
    preliminary hearing and relief pending final hearing.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is expanded to include a request to prohibit or
    condition the use, sale, or lease of property as is necessary to
    provide adequate protection of a property interest pursuant to Sec.
    363(e) of the Code.
      Notice of the motion for relief from the automatic stay or to
    prohibit or condition the use, sale, or lease of property must be
    served on the entities entitled to receive notice of a motion to
    approve an agreement pursuant to subdivision (d). If the movant and
    the adverse party agree to settle the motion and the terms of the
    agreement do not materially differ from the terms set forth in the
    movant's motion papers, the court may approve the agreement without
    further notice pursuant to subdivision (d)(4).
      Subdivision (a)(2) is deleted as unnecessary because of Sec.
    362(e) of the Code.
      Subdivisions (b)(1), (c)(1), and (d)(1) are amended to require
    service on committees that are elected in chapter 7 cases. Service
    on committees of retired employees appointed under Sec. 1114 of the
    Code is not required. These subdivisions are amended further to
    clarify that, in the absence of a creditors' committee, service on
    the creditors included on the list filed pursuant to Rule 1007(d)
    is required only in chapter 9 and chapter 11 cases. The other
    amendments to subdivision (d)(1) are for consistency of style and
    are not substantive.
      Subdivision (d)(4) is added to avoid the necessity of further
    notice and delay for the approval of an agreement in settlement of
    a motion for relief from an automatic stay, to prohibit or
    condition the use, sale, or lease of property, for use of cash
    collateral, or for authority to obtain credit if the entities
    entitled to notice have already received sufficient notice of the
    scope of the proposed agreement in the motion papers and have had
    an opportunity to be heard. For example, if a trustee makes a
    motion to use cash collateral and proposes in the original motion
    papers to provide adequate protection of the interest of the
    secured party by granting a lien on certain equipment, and the
    secured creditor subsequently agrees to terms that are within the
    scope of those proposed in the motion, the court may enter an order
    approving the agreement without further notice if the entities that
    received the original motion papers have had a reasonable
    opportunity to object to the granting of the motion to use cash
    collateral.
      If the motion papers served under subdivision (a), (b), or (c) do
    not afford notice sufficient to inform the recipients of the
    material provisions of the proposed agreement and opportunity for a
    hearing, approval of the settlement agreement may not be obtained
    unless the procedural requirements of subdivision (d)(1), (d)(2),
    and (d)(3) are satisfied. If the 15 day period for filing
    objections to the approval of the settlement agreement is too long
    under the particular circumstances of the case, the court may
    shorten the time for cause under Rule 9006(c)(1).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1999 AMENDMENT             
      Paragraph (a)(3) is added to provide sufficient time for a party
    to request a stay pending appeal of an order granting relief from
    an automatic stay before the order is enforced or implemented. The
    stay under paragraph (a)(3) is not applicable to orders granted ex
    parte in accordance with Rule 4001(a)(2).
      The stay of the order does not affect the time for filing a
    notice of appeal in accordance with Rule 8002. While the
    enforcement and implementation of an order granting relief from the
    automatic stay is temporarily stayed under paragraph (a)(3), the
    automatic stay continues to protect the debtor, and the moving
    party may not foreclose on collateral or take any other steps that
    would violate the automatic stay.
      The court may, in its discretion, order that Rule 4001(a)(3) is
    not applicable so that the prevailing party may immediately enforce
    and implement the order granting relief from the automatic stay.
    Alternatively, the court may order that the stay under Rule
    4001(a)(3) is for a fixed period less than 10 days.
      GAP Report on Rule 4001. No changes since publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to require that parties seeking authority to
    use cash collateral, to obtain credit, and to obtain approval of
    agreements to provide adequate protection, modify or terminate the
    stay, or to grant a senior or equal lien on property, submit with
    those requests a proposed order granting the relief, and that they
    provide more extensive notice to interested parties of a number of
    specified terms. The motion must either not exceed five pages in
    length, or, if it is longer, begin with a concise statement of five
    pages or less, that summarizes or lists the material provisions and
    which will assist the court and interested parties in understanding
    the nature of the relief requested. The concise statement must also
    set out the location within the documents of the summarized or
    listed provisions. The parties to agreements and lending offers
    frequently have concise summaries of their transactions that
    contain a list of the material provisions of the agreements, even
    if the agreements themselves are very lengthy. A similar summary
    should allow the court and interested parties to understand the
    relief requested.
      In addition to the concise statement, the rule requires that
    motions under subdivisions (c) and (d) state whether the movant is
    seeking approval of any of the provisions listed in subdivision
    (c)(1)(B), and where those provisions are located in the documents.
    The rule is intended to enhance the ability of the court and
    interested parties to find and evaluate those provisions.
      The rule also provides that any motion for authority to obtain
    credit must identify any provision listed in subdivision
    (c)(1)(B)(i)-(xi) that is proposed to remain effective if the court
    grants the motion on an interim basis under Rule 4001(c)(2), but
    later denies final relief.
      Other amendments are stylistic.
      Changes Made After Publication.
        1. The introductory language in subdivisions (b)(1)(B),
      (c)(1)(B), and (d)(1)(B) was revised to clarify that the motions
      filed under the rule can be either no more than five pages long
      or begin with a concise statement of that length. This permits
      the continued use of forms that have been effective in smaller
      cases. Subdivision (c)(1)(B) also is amended to require that the
      motion identify any provisionally approved term that would remain
      in effect even if the court denies the permanent relief
      requested.
        2. A new subparagraph (c)(1)(B)(vi) was inserted into the rule
      and the remaining subparagraphs were renumbered accordingly. The
      new subparagraph requires that the motion identify any provisions
      setting deadlines for filing and confirming reorganization plans
      and disclosure statements.
        3. Subdivisions (c)(1)(C) and (d)(1)(C) of the proposed rule
      were deleted as unnecessary. The court has whatever authority
      Rule 9024 provides, and making an explicit reference to that rule
      in these subdivisions brings unnecessary attention to Rule 9024
      and could create a different standard of review under that rule
      than would apply in other instances. The Advisory Committee did
      not intend either consequence, so the subdivisions were deleted.
        4. Subdivision (d)(1)(A) was restyled to form a vertical list
      of the motions subject to that provision.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to
    substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout
    the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 15-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 20-day periods become 21-day periods
        -- 25-day periods become 28-day periods

    FEDERAL RULES OF BANKRUPTCY PROCEDURE AND OFFICIAL BANKRUPTCY FORMS
    PART IV - THE DEBTOR: DUTIES AND BENEFITS

-HEAD-
    Rule 4002. Duties of Debtor

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. In addition to performing other duties prescribed
    by the Code and rules, the debtor shall:
        (1) attend and submit to an examination at the times ordered by
      the court;
        (2) attend the hearing on a complaint objecting to discharge
      and testify, if called as a witness;
        (3) inform the trustee immediately in writing as to the
      location of real property in which the debtor has an interest and
      the name and address of every person holding money or property
      subject to the debtor's withdrawal or order if a schedule of
      property has not yet been filed pursuant to Rule 1007;
        (4) cooperate with the trustee in the preparation of an
      inventory, the examination of proofs of claim, and the
      administration of the estate; and
        (5) file a statement of any change of the debtor's address.

      (b) Individual Debtor's Duty To Provide Documentation.
        (1) Personal Identification. Every individual debtor shall
      bring to the meeting of creditors under Sec. 341:
          (A) a picture identification issued by a governmental unit,
        or other personal identifying information that establishes the
        debtor's identity; and
          (B) evidence of social-security number(s), or a written
        statement that such documentation does not exist.

        (2) Financial Information. Every individual debtor shall bring
      to the meeting of creditors under Sec. 341, and make available to
      the trustee, the following documents or copies of them, or
      provide a written statement that the documentation does not exist
      or is not in the debtor's possession:
          (A) evidence of current income such as the most recent
        payment advice;
          (B) unless the trustee or the United States trustee instructs
        otherwise, statements for each of the debtor's depository and
        investment accounts, including checking, savings, and money
        market accounts, mutual funds and brokerage accounts for the
        time period that includes the date of the filing of the
        petition; and
          (C) documentation of monthly expenses claimed by the debtor
        if required by Sec. 707(b)(2)(A) or (B).

        (3) Tax Return. At least 7 days before the first date set for
      the meeting of creditors under Sec. 341, the debtor shall provide
      to the trustee a copy of the debtor's federal income tax return
      for the most recent tax year ending immediately before the
      commencement of the case and for which a return was filed,
      including any attachments, or a transcript of the tax return, or
      provide a written statement that the documentation does not
      exist.
        (4) Tax Returns Provided to Creditors. If a creditor, at least
      14 days before the first date set for the meeting of creditors
      under Sec. 341, requests a copy of the debtor's tax return that
      is to be provided to the trustee under subdivision (b)(3), the
      debtor, at least 7 days before the first date set for the meeting
      of creditors under Sec. 341, shall provide to the requesting
      creditor a copy of the return, including any attachments, or a
      transcript of the tax return, or provide a written statement that
      the documentation does not exist.
        (5) Confidentiality of Tax Information. The debtor's obligation
      to provide tax returns under Rule 4002(b)(3) and (b)(4) is
      subject to procedures for safeguarding the confidentiality of tax
      information established by the Director of the Administrative
      Office of the United States Courts.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule should be read together with Secs. 343 and 521 of the
    Code and Rule 1007, all of which impose duties on the debtor.
    Clause (3) of this rule implements the provisions of Rule 2015(a).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      New clause (5) of the rule imposes on the debtor the duty to
    advise the clerk of any change of the debtor's address.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      This rule is amended to implement Sec. 521(a)(1)(B)(iv) and
    (e)(2), added to the Code by the 2005 amendments. These Code
    amendments expressly require the debtor to file with the court, or
    provide to the trustee, specific documents. The amendments to the
    rule implement these obligations and establish a time frame for
    creditors to make requests for a copy of the debtor's Federal
    income tax return. The rule also requires the debtor to provide
    documentation in support of claimed expenses under Sec.
    707(b)(2)(A) and (B).
      Subdivision (b) of the rule is also amended to require the debtor
    to cooperate with the trustee by providing materials and documents
    necessary to assist the trustee in the performance of the trustee's
    duties. Nothing in the rule, however, is intended to limit or
    restrict the debtor's duties under Sec. 521, or to limit the access
    of the Attorney General to any information provided by the debtor
    in the case. Subdivision (b)(2) does not require that the debtor
    create documents or obtain documents from third parties; rather,
    the debtor's obligation is to bring to the meeting of creditors
    under Sec. 341 the documents which the debtor possesses. Under
    subdivision (b)(2)(B), the trustee or the United States trustee can
    instruct debtors that they need not provide the documents described
    in that subdivision. Under subdivisions (b)(3) and (b)(4), the
    debtor must obtain and provide copies of tax returns or tax
    transcripts to the appropriate person, unless no such documents
    exist. Any written statement that the debtor provides indicating
    either that documents do not exist or are not in the debtor's
    possession must be verified or contain an unsworn declaration as
    required under Rule 1008.
      Because the amendment implements the debtor's duty to cooperate
    with the trustee, the materials provided to the trustee would not
    be made available to any other party in interest at the Sec. 341
    meeting of creditors other than the Attorney General. Some of the
    documents may contain otherwise private information that should not
    be disseminated. For example, pay stubs and financial account
    statements might include the social-security numbers of the debtor
    and the debtor's spouse and dependents, as well as the names of the
    debtor's children. The debtor should redact all but the last four
    digits of all social-security numbers and the names of any minors
    when they appear in these documents. This type of information would
    not usually be needed by creditors and others who may be attending
    the meeting. If a creditor perceives a need to review specific
    documents or other evidence, the creditor may proceed under Rule
    2004.
      Tax information produced under this rule is subject to procedures
    for safeguarding confidentiality established by the Director of the
    Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
      Changes Made After Publication. The second paragraph of the
    Committee Note was amended to clarify that the debtor's duty to
    provide copies of tax returns or tax transcripts are governed by a
    different standard than the debtor's duty to provide other
    financial information.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute
    a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules,
    deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 15-day periods become 14-day periods

-HEAD-
    Rule 4003. Exemptions

-STATUTE-
      (a) Claim of Exemptions. A debtor shall list the property claimed
    as exempt under Sec. 522 of the Code on the schedule of assets
    required to be filed by Rule 1007. If the debtor fails to claim
    exemptions or file the schedule within the time specified in Rule
    1007, a dependent of the debtor may file the list within 30 days
    thereafter.
      (b) Objecting to a Claim of Exemptions.
        (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), a party in
      interest may file an objection to the list of property claimed as
      exempt within 30 days after the meeting of creditors held under
      Sec. 341(a) is concluded or within 30 days after any amendment to
      the list or supplemental schedules is filed, whichever is later.
      The court may, for cause, extend the time for filing objections
      if, before the time to object expires, a party in interest files
      a request for an extension.
        (2) The trustee may file an objection to a claim of exemption
      at any time prior to one year after the closing of the case if
      the debtor fraudulently asserted the claim of exemption. The
      trustee shall deliver or mail the objection to the debtor and the
      debtor's attorney, and to any person filing the list of exempt
      property and that person's attorney.
        (3) An objection to a claim of exemption based on Sec. 522(q)
      shall be filed before the closing of the case. If an exemption is
      first claimed after a case is reopened, an objection shall be
      filed before the reopened case is closed.
        (4) A copy of any objection shall be delivered or mailed to the
      trustee, the debtor and the debtor's attorney, and the person
      filing the list and that person's attorney.

      (c) Burden of Proof. In any hearing under this rule, the
    objecting party has the burden of proving that the exemptions are
    not properly claimed. After hearing on notice, the court shall
    determine the issues presented by the objections.
      (d) Avoidance by Debtor of Transfers of Exempt Property. A
    proceeding by the debtor to avoid a lien or other transfer of
    property exempt under Sec. 522(f) of the Code shall be by motion in
    accordance with Rule 9014. Notwithstanding the provisions of
    subdivision (b), a creditor may object to a motion filed under Sec.
    522(f) by challenging the validity of the exemption asserted to be
    impaired by the lien.

      This rule is derived from Sec. 522(1) of the Code and, in part,
    former Bankruptcy Rule 403. The Code changes the thrust of that
    rule by making it the burden of the debtor to list his exemptions
    and the burden of parties in interest to raise objections in the
    absence of which "the property claimed as exempt on such list is
    exempt;" Sec. 522(1).
      Subdivision (a). While Sec. 522(1) refers to a list of property
    claimed as exempt, the rule incorporates such a list as part of
    Official Form No. 6, the schedule of the debtor's assets, rather
    than requiring a separate list and filing. Rule 1007, to which
    subdivision (a) refers, requires that schedule to be filed within
    15 days after the order for relief, unless the court extends the
    time.
      Section 522(1) also provides that a dependent of the debtor may
    file the list if the debtor fails to do so. Subdivision (a) of the
    rule allows such filing from the expiration of the debtor's time
    until 30 days thereafter. Dependent is defined in Sec. 522(a)(1).
      Subdivision (d) provides that a proceeding by the debtor,
    permitted by Sec. 522(f) of the Code, is a contested matter rather
    than the more formal adversary proceeding. Proceedings within the
    scope of this subdivision are distinguished from proceedings
    brought by the trustee to avoid transfers. The latter are
    classified as adversary proceedings by Rule 7001.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b) is amended to facilitate the filing of objections
    to exemptions claimed on a supplemental schedule filed under Rule
    1007(h).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      This rule is amended to permit the court to grant a timely
    request for an extension of time to file objections to the list of
    claimed exemptions, whether the court rules on the request before
    or after the expiration of the 30-day period. The purpose of this
    amendment is to avoid the harshness of the present rule which has
    been construed to deprive a bankruptcy court of jurisdiction to
    grant a timely request for an extension if it has failed to rule on
    the request within the 30-day period. See In re Laurain, 113 F.3d
    595 (6th Cir. 1997), Matter of Stoulig, 45 F.3d 957 (5th Cir.
    1995), In re Brayshaw, 912 F.2d 1255 (10th Cir. 1990). The
    amendments clarify that the extension may be granted only for
    cause. The amendments also conform the rule to Sec. 522(l) of the
    Code by recognizing that any party in interest may file an
    objection or request for an extension of time under this rule.
    Other amendments are stylistic.
      GAP Report on Rule 4003(b). The words "trustee or creditor" were
    replaced by "party in interest" to conform to Sec. 522(l) of the
    Bankruptcy Code which permits any party in interest to object to
    claimed exemptions. Style revisions also were made to the published
    draft.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (b) is rewritten to include four paragraphs.
      Subdivision (b)(2) is added to the rule to permit the trustee to
    object to an exemption at any time up to one year after the closing
    of the case if the debtor fraudulently claimed the exemption.
    Extending the deadline for trustees to object to an exemption when
    the exemption claim has been fraudulently made will permit the
    court to review and, in proper circumstances, deny improperly
    claimed exemptions, thereby protecting the legitimate interests of
    creditors and the bankruptcy estate. However, similar to the
    deadline set in Sec. 727(e) of the Code for revoking a discharge
    which was fraudulently obtained, an objection to an exemption that
    was fraudulently claimed must be filed within one year after the
    closing of the case. Subdivision (b)(2) extends the objection
    deadline only for trustees.
      Subdivision (b)(3) is added to the rule to reflect the addition
    of subsection (q) to Sec. 522 of the Code by the 2005 Act. Section
    522(q) imposes a $136,875 limit on a state homestead exemption if
    the debtor has been convicted of a felony or owes a debt arising
    from certain causes of action. Other revised provisions of the
    Code, such as Sec. 727(a)(12) and Sec. 1328(h), suggest that the
    court may consider issues relating to Sec. 522(q) late in the case,
    and the 30-day period for objections would not be appropriate for
    this provision.
      Subdivision (d) is amended to clarify that a creditor with a lien
    on property that the debtor is attempting to avoid on the grounds
    that the lien impairs an exemption may raise in defense to the lien
    avoidance action any objection to the debtor's claimed exemption.
    The right to object is limited to an objection to the exemption of
    the property subject to the lien and for purposes of the lien
    avoidance action only. The creditor may not object to other
    exemption claims made by the debtor. Those objections, if any, are
    governed by Rule 4003(b).
      Other changes are stylistic.
      Changes Made After Publication. The deadline for filing
    objections to exemptions under subdivision (b)(1) was returned to
    30 days after the conclusion of the Sec. 341 meeting of creditors
    rather than the 60 day period proposed in the published rule. The
    second paragraph of the Committee Note which discussed this change
    was therefore deleted. Subdivisions (b)(2) and (b)(3) were amended
    to add the debtor and the debtor's attorney to the list of persons
    to whom objections to exemptions must be delivered.

    Rule 4004. Grant or Denial of Discharge

-STATUTE-
      (a) Time for Filing Complaint Objecting to Discharge; Notice of
    Time Fixed. In a chapter 7 liquidation case a complaint objecting
    to the debtor's discharge under Sec. 727(a) of the Code shall be
    filed no later than 60 days after the first date set for the
    meeting of creditors under Sec. 341(a). In a chapter 11
    reorganization case, the complaint shall be filed no later than the
    first date set for the hearing on confirmation. At least 28 days'
    notice of the time so fixed shall be given to the United States
    trustee and all creditors as provided in Rule 2002(f) and (k) and
    to the trustee and the trustee's attorney.
      (b) Extension of Time. On motion of any party in interest, after
    hearing on notice, the court may for cause extend the time to file
    a complaint objecting to discharge. The motion shall be filed
    before the time has expired.
      (c) Grant of Discharge.
        (1) In a chapter 7 case, on expiration of the time fixed for
      filing a complaint objecting to discharge and the time fixed for
      filing a motion to dismiss the case under Rule 1017(e), the court
      shall forthwith grant the discharge unless:
          (A) the debtor is not an individual;
          (B) a complaint objecting to the discharge has been filed;
          (C) the debtor has filed a waiver under Sec. 727(a)(10);
          (D) a motion to dismiss the case under Sec. 707 is pending;
          (E) a motion to extend the time for filing a complaint
        objecting to the discharge is pending;
          (F) a motion to extend the time for filing a motion to
        dismiss the case under Rule 1017(e)(1) is pending;
          (G) the debtor has not paid in full the filing fee prescribed
        by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1930(a) and any other fee prescribed by the
        Judicial Conference of the United States under 28 U.S.C. Sec.
        1930(b) that is payable to the clerk upon the commencement of a
        case under the Code, unless the court has waived the fees under
        28 U.S.C. Sec. 1930(f);
          (H) the debtor has not filed with the court a statement of
        completion of a course concerning personal financial management
        as required by Rule 1007(b)(7);
          (I) a motion to delay or postpone discharge under Sec.
        727(a)(12) is pending;
          (J) a motion to enlarge the time to file a reaffirmation
        agreement under Rule 4008(a) is pending;
          (K) a presumption has arisen under Sec. 524(m) that a
        reaffirmation agreement is an undue hardship; or
          (L) a motion is pending to delay discharge, because the
        debtor has not filed with the court all tax documents required
        to be filed under Sec. 521(f).

        (2) Notwithstanding Rule 4004(c)(1), on motion of the debtor,
      the court may defer the entry of an order granting a discharge
      for 30 days and, on motion within that period, the court may
      defer entry of the order to a date certain.
        (3) If the debtor is required to file a statement under Rule
      1007(b)(8), the court shall not grant a discharge earlier than 30
      days after the statement is filed.

      (d) Applicability of Rules in Part VII. A proceeding commenced by
    a complaint objecting to discharge is governed by Part VII of these
    rules.
      (e) Order of Discharge. An order of discharge shall conform to
    the appropriate Official Form.
      (f) Registration in Other Districts. An order of discharge that
    has become final may be registered in any other district by filing
    a certified copy of the order in the office of the clerk of that
    district. When so registered the order of discharge shall have the
    same effect as an order of the court of the district where
    registered.
      (g) Notice of Discharge. The clerk shall promptly mail a copy of
    the final order of discharge to those specified in subdivision (a)
    of this rule.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 404.
      Subdivisions (a) and (b) of this rule prescribe the procedure for
    determining whether a discharge will be granted pursuant to Sec.
    727 of the Code. The time fixed by subdivision (a) may be enlarged
    as provided in subdivision (b).
      The notice referred to in subdivision (a) is required to be given
    by mail and addressed to creditors as provided in Rule 2002.
      An extension granted on a motion pursuant to subdivision (b) of
    the rule would ordinarily benefit only the movant, but its scope
    and effect would depend on the terms of the extension.
      Subdivision (c). If a complaint objecting to discharge is filed,
    the court's grant or denial of the discharge will be entered at the
    conclusion of the proceeding as a judgment in accordance with Rule
    9021. The inclusion of the clause in subdivision (c) qualifying the
    duty of the court to grant a discharge when a waiver has been filed
    is in accord with the construction of the Code. 4 Collier,
    Bankruptcy &#182; 727.12 (15th ed. 1979).
      The last sentence of subdivision (c) takes cognizance of Sec.
    524(c) of the Code which authorizes a debtor to enter into
    enforceable reaffirmation agreements only prior to entry of the
    order of discharge. Immediate entry of that order after expiration
    of the time fixed for filing complaints objecting to discharge may
    render it more difficult for a debtor to settle pending litigation
    to determine the dischargeability of a debt and execute a
    reaffirmation agreement as part of a settlement.
      Subdivision (d). An objection to discharge is required to be made
    by a complaint, which initiates an adversary proceeding as provided
    in Rule 7003. Pursuant to Rule 5005, the complaint should be filed
    in the court in which the case is pending.
      Subdivision (e). Official Form No. 27 to which subdivision (e)
    refers, includes notice of the effects of a discharge specified in
    Sec. 524(a) of the Code.
      Subdivision (f). Registration may facilitate the enforcement of
    the order of discharge in a district other than that in which it
    was entered. See 2 Moore's Federal Practice &#182; 1.04[2] (2d ed.
    1967). Because of the nationwide service of process authorized by
    Rule 7004, however, registration of the order of discharge is not
    necessary under these rules to enable a discharged debtor to obtain
    relief against a creditor proceeding anywhere in the United States
    in disregard of the injunctive provisions of the order of
    discharge.
      Subdivision (g). Notice of discharge should be mailed promptly
    after the order becomes final so that creditors may be informed of
    entry of the order and of its injunctive provisions. Rule 2002
    specifies the manner of the notice and persons to whom the notice
    is to be given.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to conform to Sec. 727(c) which gives the
    United States trustee the right to object to discharge. This
    amendment is derived from Rule X-1008(a)(1) and is consistent with
    Rule 2002. The amendment to subdivision (c) is to prevent a timely
    motion to dismiss a chapter 7 case for substantial abuse from
    becoming moot merely because a discharge order has been entered.
    Reference to the Official Form number in subdivision (e) is deleted
    in anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the Official
    Forms.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1996 AMENDMENT       
      Subsection (c) is amended to delay entry of the order of
    discharge if a motion pursuant to Rule 4004(b) to extend the time
    for filing a complaint objecting to discharge is pending. Also,
    this subdivision is amended to delay entry of the discharge order
    if the debtor has not paid in full the filing fee and the
    administrative fee required to be paid upon the commencement of the
    case. If the debtor is authorized to pay the fees in installments
    in accordance with Rule 1006, the discharge order will not be
    entered until the final installment has been paid.
      The other amendments to this rule are stylistic.
      GAP Report on Rule 4004. No changes have been made since
    publication, except for stylistic changes.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1999 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a) is amended to clarify that, in a chapter 7 case,
    the deadline for filing a complaint objecting to discharge under
    Sec. 727(a) is 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of
    creditors, whether or not the meeting is held on that date. The
    time for filing the complaint is not affected by any delay in the
    commencement or conclusion of the meeting of creditors. This
    amendment does not affect the right of any party in interest to
    file a motion for an extension of time to file a complaint
    objecting to discharge in accordance with Rule 4004(b).
      The substitution of the word "filed" for "made" in subdivision
    (b) is intended to avoid confusion regarding the time when a motion
    is "made" for the purpose of applying these rules. See, e.g., In re
    Coggin, 30 F.3d 1443 (11th Cir. 1994). As amended, this rule
    requires that a motion for an extension of time for filing a
    complaint objecting to discharge be filed before the time has
    expired.
      Other amendments to this rule are stylistic.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (c) is amended so that a discharge will not be
    granted while a motion requesting an extension of time to file a
    motion to dismiss the case under Sec. 707(b) is pending. Other
    amendments are stylistic.
      GAP Report on Rule 4004(c). No changes since publication except
    for style revisions.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (c)(1)(D) is amended to provide that the filing of a
    motion to dismiss under Sec. 707 of the Bankruptcy Code postpones
    the entry of the discharge. Under the present version of the rule,
    only motions to dismiss brought under Sec. 707(b) cause the
    postponement of the discharge. This amendment would change the
    result in cases such as In re Tanenbaum, 210 B.R. 182 (Bankr. D.
    Colo. 1997).
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were
    made.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (c)(1)(G) is amended to reflect the fee waiver
    provision in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1930, added by the 2005 amendments.
      Subdivision (c)(1)(H) is new. It reflects the 2005 addition to
    the Code of Secs. 727(a)(11) and 1328(g), which require that
    individual debtors complete a course in personal financial
    management as a condition to the entry of a discharge. Including
    this requirement in the rule helps prevent the inadvertent entry of
    a discharge when the debtor has not complied with this requirement.
    If a debtor fails to file the required statement regarding a
    personal financial management course, the clerk will close the
    bankruptcy case without the entry of a discharge.
      Subdivision (c)(1)(I) is new. It reflects the 2005 addition to
    the Code of Sec. 727(a)(12). This provision is linked to Sec.
    522(q). Section 522(q) limits the availability of the homestead
    exemption for individuals who have been convicted of a felony or
    who owe a debt arising from certain causes of action within a
    particular time frame. The existence of reasonable cause to believe
    that Sec. 522(q) may be applicable to the debtor constitutes
    grounds for withholding the discharge.
      Subdivision (c)(1)(J) is new. It accommodates the deadline for
    filing a reaffirmation agreement established by Rule 4008(a).
      Subdivision (c)(1)(K) is new. It reflects the 2005 revisions to
    Sec. 524 of the Code that alter the requirements for approval of
    reaffirmation agreements. Section 524(m) sets forth circumstances
    under which a reaffirmation agreement is presumed to be an undue
    hardship. This triggers an obligation to review the presumption and
    may require notice and a hearing. Subdivision (c)(1)(J) has been
    added to prevent the discharge from being entered until the court
    approves or disapproves the reaffirmation agreement in accordance
    with Sec. 524(m).
      Subdivision (c)(1)(L) is new. It implements Sec. 1228(a) of
    Public Law Number 109-8, an uncodified provision of the Bankruptcy
    Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which
    prohibits entry of a discharge unless required tax documents have
    been provided to the court.
      Subdivision (c)(3) is new. It postpones the entry of the
    discharge of an individual debtor in a case under chapter 11, 12,
    or 13 if there is a question as to the applicability of Sec. 522(q)
    of the Code. The postponement provides an opportunity for a
    creditor to file a motion to limit the debtor's exemption under
    that provision.
      Other changes are stylistic.
      Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after
    publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute
    a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules,
    deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 15-day periods become 14-day periods

    burden of producing evidence and the ultimate burden of persuasion,
    the rule leaves to the courts the formulation of rules governing
    the shift of the burden of going forward with the evidence in the
    light of considerations such as the difficulty of proving the
    nonexistence of a fact and of establishing a fact as to which the
    evidence is likely to be more accessible to the debtor than to the
    objector. See, e.g., In re Haggerty, 165 F.2d 977, 979-80 (2d Cir.
    1948); Federal Provision Co. v. Ershowsky, 94 F.2d 574, 575 (2d
    Cir. 1938); In re Riceputo, 41 F. Supp. 926, 927-28 (E.D.N.Y.

    Rule 4006. Notice of No Discharge

-STATUTE-
      If an order is entered: denying a discharge; revoking a
    discharge; approving a waiver of discharge; or, in the case of an
    individual debtor, closing the case without the entry of a
    discharge, the clerk shall promptly notify all parties in interest
    in the manner provided by Rule 2002.

      The suspension by Sec. 108(c) of the Code of the statute of
    limitations affecting any debt of a debtor terminates within 30
    days after the debtor is denied a discharge or otherwise loses his
    right to a discharge. If, however, a debtor's failure to receive a
    discharge does not come to the attention of his creditors until
    after the statutes of limitations have run, the debtor obtains
    substantially the same benefits from his bankruptcy as a debtor who
    is discharged.
      This rule requires the clerk to notify creditors if a debtor
    fails to obtain a discharge because a waiver of discharge was filed
    under Sec. 727(a)(10) or as a result of an order denying or
    revoking the discharge under Sec. 727(a) or (d).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      This amendment was necessary because the 2005 amendments to the
    Code require that individual debtors in a chapter 7 or 13 case
    complete a course in personal financial management as a condition
    to the entry of a discharge. If the debtor fails to complete the
    course, the case may be closed and no discharge will be entered.
    Reopening the case is governed by Sec. 350 and Rule 5010. The rule
    is amended to provide notice to parties in interest, including the
    debtor, that no discharge was entered.

    Rule 4007. Determination of Dischargeability of a Debt

-STATUTE-
      (a) Persons Entitled To File Complaint. A debtor or any creditor
    may file a complaint to obtain a determination of the
    dischargeability of any debt.
      (b) Time for Commencing Proceeding Other Than Under Sec. 523(c)
    of the Code. A complaint other than under Sec. 523(c) may be filed
    at any time. A case may be reopened without payment of an
    additional filing fee for the purpose of filing a complaint to
    obtain a determination under this rule.
      (c) Time for Filing Complaint Under Sec. 523(c) in a Chapter 7
    Liquidation, Chapter 11 Reorganization, Chapter 12 Family Farmer's
    Debt Adjustment Case, or Chapter 13 Individual's Debt Adjustment
    Case; Notice of Time Fixed. Except as otherwise provided in
    subdivision (d), a complaint to determine the dischargeability of a
    debt under Sec. 523(c) shall be filed no later than 60 days after
    the first date set for the meeting of creditors under Sec. 341(a).
    The court shall give all creditors no less than 30 days' notice of
    the time so fixed in the manner provided in Rule 2002. On motion of
    a party in interest, after hearing on notice, the court may for
    cause extend the time fixed under this subdivision. The motion
    shall be filed before the time has expired.
      (d) Time for Filing Complaint Under Sec. 523(a)(6) in a Chapter
    13 Individual's Debt Adjustment Case; Notice of Time Fixed. On
    motion by a debtor for a discharge under Sec. 1328(b), the court
    shall enter an order fixing the time to file a complaint to
    determine the dischargeability of any debt under Sec. 523(a)(6) and
    shall give no less than 30 days' notice of the time fixed to all
    creditors in the manner provided in Rule 2002. On motion of any
    party in interest, after hearing on notice, the court may for cause
    extend the time fixed under this subdivision. The motion shall be
    filed before the time has expired.
      (e) Applicability of Rules in Part VII. A proceeding commenced by
    a complaint filed under this rule is governed by Part VII of these
    rules.

      This rule prescribes the procedure to be followed when a party
    requests the court to determine dischargeability of a debt pursuant
    to Sec. 523 of the Code.
      Although a complaint that comes within Sec. 523(c) must
    ordinarily be filed before determining whether the debtor will be
    discharged, the court need not determine the issues presented by
    the complaint filed under this rule until the question of discharge
    has been determined under Rule 4004. A complaint filed under this
    rule initiates an adversary proceeding as provided in Rule 7003.
      Subdivision (b) does not contain a time limit for filing a
    complaint to determine the dischargeability of a type of debt
    listed as nondischargeable under Sec. 523(a)(1), (3), (5), (7),
    (8), or (9). Jurisdiction over this issue on these debts is held
    concurrently by the bankruptcy court and any appropriate
    nonbankruptcy forum.
      Subdivision (c) differs from subdivision (b) by imposing a
    deadline for filing complaints to determine the issue of
    dischargeability of debts set out in Sec. 523(a)(2), (4) or (6) of
    the Code. The bankruptcy court has exclusive jurisdiction to
    determine dischargeability of these debts. If a complaint is not
    timely filed, the debt is discharged. See Sec. 523(c).
      Subdivision (e). The complaint required by this subdivision
    should be filed in the court in which the case is pending pursuant
    to Rule 5005.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to delete the words "with the court"
    as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).
      Subdivision (c) is amended to apply in chapter 12 cases the same
    time period that applies in chapter 7 and 11 cases for filing a
    complaint under Sec. 523(c) of the Code to determine
    dischargeability of certain debts. Under Sec. 1228(a) of the Code,
    a chapter 12 discharge does not discharge the debts specified in
    Sec. 523(a) of the Code.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1999 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (c) is amended to clarify that the deadline for
    filing a complaint to determine the dischargeability of a debt
    under Sec. 523(c) of the Code is 60 days after the first date set
    for the meeting of creditors, whether or not the meeting is held on
    that date. The time for filing the complaint is not affected by any
    delay in the commencement or conclusion of the meeting of
    creditors. This amendment does not affect the right of any party in
    interest to file a motion for an extension of time to file a
    complaint to determine the dischargeability of a debt in accordance
    with this rule.
      The substitution of the word "filed" for "made" in the final
    sentences of subdivisions (c) and (d) is intended to avoid
    confusion regarding the time when a motion is "made" for the
    purpose of applying these rules. See, e.g., In re Coggin, 30 F.3d
    1443 (11th Cir. 1994). As amended, these subdivisions require that
    a motion for an extension of time be filed before the time has
    expired.
      The other amendments to this rule are stylistic.
      GAP Report on Rule 4007. No changes since publication, except for
    stylistic changes in the heading of Rule 4007(d).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (c) is amended because of the 2005 amendments to Sec.
    1328(a) of the Code. This revision expands the exceptions to
    discharge upon completion of a chapter 13 plan. Subdivision (c)
    extends to chapter 13 the same time limits applicable to other
    chapters of the Code with respect to the two exceptions to
    discharge that have been added to Sec. 1328(a) and that are within
    Sec. 523(c).
      The amendment to subdivision (d) reflects the 2005 amendments to
    Sec. 1328(a) that expands the exceptions to discharge upon
    completion of a chapter 13 plan, including two out of three of the
    provisions that fall within Sec. 523(c). However, the 2005
    revisions to Sec. 1328(a) do not include a reference to Sec.
    523(a)(6), which is the third provision to which Sec. 523(c)
    refers. Thus, subdivision (d) is now limited to that provision.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Section 524(d) of the Code requires the court to hold a hearing
    to inform an individual debtor concerning the granting or denial of
    discharge and the law applicable to reaffirmation agreements.
      The notice of the Sec. 524(d) hearing may be combined with the
    notice of the meeting of creditors or entered as a separate order.
      The expression "not more than" contained in the first sentence of
    the rule is for the explicit purpose of requiring the hearing to
    occur within that time period and cannot be extended.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is changed to conform to Sec. 524(d) of the Code as
    amended in 1986. A hearing under Sec. 524(d) is not mandatory
    unless the debtor desires to enter into a reaffirmation agreement.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      This rule is amended to establish a deadline for filing
    reaffirmation agreements. The Code sets out a number of
    prerequisites to the enforceability of reaffirmation agreements.
    Among those requirements, Sec. 524(k)(6)(A) provides that each
    reaffirmation agreement must be accompanied by a statement
    indicating the debtor's ability to make the payments called for by
    the agreement. In the event that this statement reflects an
    insufficient income to allow payment of the reaffirmed debt, Sec.
    524(m) provides that a presumption of undue hardship arises,
    allowing the court to disapprove the reaffirmation agreement, but
    only after a hearing conducted prior to the entry of discharge.
    Rule 4004(c)(1)(K) accommodates this provision by delaying the
    entry of discharge where a presumption of undue hardship arises.
    However, in order for that rule to be effective, the reaffirmation
    agreement itself must be filed before the entry of discharge. Under
    Rule 4004(c)(1) discharge is to be entered promptly after the
    expiration of the time for filing a complaint objecting to
    discharge, which, under Rule 4004(a), is 60 days after the first
    date set for the meeting of creditors under Sec. 341(a).
    Accordingly, that date is set as the deadline for filing a
    reaffirmation agreement.
      Any party may file the agreement with the court. Thus, whichever
    party has a greater incentive to enforce the agreement usually will
    file it. In the event that the parties are unable to file a
    reaffirmation agreement in a timely fashion, the rule grants the
    court broad discretion to permit a late filing. A corresponding
    change to Rule 4004(c)(1)(J) accommodates such an extension by
    providing for a delay in the entry of discharge during the pendency
    of a motion to extend the time for filing a reaffirmation
    agreement.
      Rule 4008 is also amended by deleting provisions regarding the
    timing of any reaffirmation and discharge hearing. As noted above,
    Sec. 524(m) itself requires that hearings on undue hardship be
    conducted prior to the entry of discharge. In other respects,
    including hearings to approve reaffirmation agreements of
    unrepresented debtors under Sec. 524(c)(6), the rule leaves
    discretion to the court to set the hearing at a time appropriate
    for the particular circumstances presented in the case and
    consistent with the scheduling needs of the parties.
      Changes Made After Publication. The only change was stylistic.
    The phrase "of the Code" was added to subdivision (b).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a) of the rule is amended to require that the entity
    filing the reaffirmation agreement with the court also include
    Official Form 27, the Reaffirmation Agreement Cover Sheet. The form
    includes information necessary for the court to determine whether
    the proposed reaffirmation agreement is presumed to be an undue
    hardship for the debtor under Sec. 524(m) of the Code.
      Changes Made After Publication. No changes since publication.

    take such action under the 2005 amendment to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 152(c).
    Under that provision, bankruptcy judges may hold court outside of

    Rule 5002. Restrictions on Approval of Appointments

-STATUTE-
      (a) Approval of Appointment of Relatives Prohibited. The
    appointment of an individual as a trustee or examiner pursuant to
    Sec. 1104 of the Code shall not be approved by the court if the
    individual is a relative of the bankruptcy judge approving the
    appointment or the United States trustee in the region in which the
    case is pending. The employment of an individual as an attorney,
    accountant, appraiser, auctioneer, or other professional person
    pursuant to Secs. 327, 1103, or 1114 shall not be approved by the
    court if the individual is a relative of the bankruptcy judge
    approving the employment. The employment of an individual as
    attorney, accountant, appraiser, auctioneer, or other professional
    person pursuant to Secs. 327, 1103, or 1114 may be approved by the
    court if the individual is a relative of the United States trustee
    in the region in which the case is pending, unless the court finds
    that the relationship with the United States trustee renders the
    employment improper under the circumstances of the case. Whenever
    under this subdivision an individual may not be approved for
    appointment or employment, the individual's firm, partnership,
    corporation, or any other form of business association or
    relationship, and all members, associates and professional
    employees thereof also may not be approved for appointment or
    employment.
      (b) Judicial Determination That Approval of Appointment or
    Employment Is Improper. A bankruptcy judge may not approve the
    appointment of a person as a trustee or examiner pursuant to Sec.
    1104 of the Code or approve the employment of a person as an
    attorney, accountant, appraiser, auctioneer, or other professional
    person pursuant to Secs. 327, 1103, or 1114 of the Code if that
    person is or has been so connected with such judge or the United
    States trustee as to render the appointment or employment improper.

    (As amended Apr. 29, 1985, eff. Aug. 1, 1985; Apr. 30, 1991, eff.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 505(a). The
    scope of the prohibition on appointment or employment is expanded
    to include an examiner appointed under Sec. 1104 of the Code and
    attorneys and other professional persons whose employment must be
    approved by the court under Sec. 327 or Sec. 1103.
      The rule supplements two statutory provisions. Under 18 U.S.C.
    Sec. 1910, it is a criminal offense for a judge to appoint a
    relative as a trustee and, under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 458, a person may
    not be "appointed to or employed in any office or duty in any
    court" if he is a relative of any judge of that court. The rule
    prohibits the appointment or employment of a relative of a
    bankruptcy judge in a case pending before that bankruptcy judge or
    before other bankruptcy judges sitting within the district.
      A relative is defined in Sec. 101(34) of the Code to be an
    "individual related by affinity or consanguinity within the third
    degree as determined by the common law, or individual in a step or
    adoptive relationship within such third degree." Persons within the
    third degree under the common law system are as follows: first
    degree - parents, brothers and sisters, and children; second degree
    - grandparents, uncles and aunts, first cousins, nephews and
    nieces, and grandchildren; third degree - great grandparents, great
    uncles and aunts, first cousins once removed, second cousins, grand
    nephews and nieces, great grandchildren. Rule 9001 incorporates the
    definitions of Sec. 101 of the Code.
      In order for the policy of this rule to be meaningfully
    implemented, it is necessary to extend the prohibition against
    appointment or employment to the firm or other business association
    of the ineligible person and to those affiliated with the firm or
    business association. "Firm" is defined in Rule 9001 to include a
    professional partnership or corporation of attorneys or
    accountants. All other types of business and professional
    associations and relationships are covered by this rule.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1985 AMENDMENT       
      The amended rule is divided into two subdivisions. Subdivision
    (a) applies to relatives of bankruptcy judges and subdivision (b)
    applies to persons who are or have been connected with bankruptcy
    judges. Subdivision (a) permits no judicial discretion; subdivision
    (b) allows judicial discretion. In both subdivisions of the amended
    rule "bankruptcy judge" has been substituted for "judge". The
    amended rule makes clear that it only applies to relatives of, or
    persons connected with, the bankruptcy judge. See In re Hilltop
    Sand and Gravel, Inc., 35 B.R. 412 (N.D. Ohio 1983).
      Subdivision (a). The original rule prohibited all bankruptcy
    judges in a district from appointing or approving the employment of
    (i) a relative of any bankruptcy judge serving in the district,
    (ii) the firm or business association of any ineligible relative
    and (iii) any member or professional employee of the firm or
    business association of an ineligible relative. In addition, the
    definition of relative, the third degree relationship under the
    common law, is quite broad. The restriction on the employment
    opportunities of relatives of bankruptcy judges was magnified by
    the fact that many law and accounting firms have practices and
    offices spanning the nation.
      Relatives are not eligible for appointment or employment when the
    bankruptcy judge to whom they are related makes the appointment or
    approves the employment. Canon 3(b)(4) of the Code of Judicial
    Conduct, which provides that the judge "shall exercise his power of
    appointment only on the basis of merit, avoiding nepotism and
    favoritism," should guide a bankruptcy judge when a relative of a
    judge of the same bankruptcy court is considered for appointment or
    employment.
      Subdivision (b), derived from clause (2) of the original rule,
    makes a person ineligible for appointment or employment if the
    person is so connected with a bankruptcy judge making the
    appointment or approving the employment as to render the
    appointment or approval of employment improper. The caption and
    text of the subdivision emphasize that application of the
    connection test is committed to the sound discretion of the
    bankruptcy judge who is to make the appointment or approve the
    employment. All relevant circumstances are to be taken into account
    by the court. The most important of those circumstances include:
    the nature and duration of the connection with the bankruptcy
    judge; whether the connection still exists, and, if not, when it
    was terminated; and the type of appointment or employment. These
    and other considerations must be carefully evaluated by the
    bankruptcy judge.
      The policy underlying subdivision (b) is essentially the same as
    the policy embodied in the Code of Judicial Conduct. Canon 2 of the
    Code of Judicial Conduct instructs a judge to avoid impropriety and
    the appearance of impropriety, and Canon 3(b)(4) provides that the
    judge "should exercise his power of appointment only on the basis
    of merit, avoiding nepotism and favoritism." Subdivision (b) alerts
    the potential appointee or employee and party seeking approval of
    employment to consider the possible relevance or impact of
    subdivision (b) and indicates to them that appropriate disclosure
    must be made to the bankruptcy court before accepting appointment
    or employment. The information required may be made a part of the
    application for approval of employment. See Rule 2014(a).
      Subdivision (b) departs from the former rule in an important
    respect: a firm or business association is not prohibited from
    appointment or employment merely because an individual member or
    employee of the firm or business association is ineligible under
    subdivision (b).
      The emphasis given to the bankruptcy court's judicial discretion
    in applying subdivision (b) and the absence of a per se extension
    of ineligibility to the firm or business association or any
    ineligible individual complement the amendments to subdivision (a).
    The change is intended to moderate the prior limitation on the
    employment opportunities of attorneys, accountants and other
    professional persons who are or who have been connected in some way
    with the bankruptcy judge. For example, in all but the most unusual
    situations service as a law clerk to a bankruptcy judge is not the
    type of connection which alone precludes appointment or employment.
    Even if a bankruptcy judge determines that it is improper to
    appoint or approve the employment of a former law clerk in the
    period immediately after completion of the former law clerk's
    service with the judge, the firm which employs the former law clerk
    will, absent other circumstances, be eligible for employment. In
    each instance all the facts must be considered by the bankruptcy
    judge.
      Subdivision (b) applies to persons connected with a bankruptcy
    judge. "Person" is defined in Sec. 101 of the Bankruptcy Code to
    include an "individual, partnership and corporation". A partnership
    or corporation may be appointed or employed to serve in a
    bankruptcy case. If a bankruptcy judge is connected in some way
    with a partnership or corporation, it is necessary for the court to
    determine whether the appointment or employment of that partnership
    or corporation is proper.
      The amended rule does not regulate professional relationships
    which do not require approval of a bankruptcy judge.
    Disqualification of the bankruptcy judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    455 may, however, be appropriate. Under Rule 5004(a), a bankruptcy
    judge may find that disqualification from only some aspect of the
    case, rather than the entire case, is necessary. A situation may
    also arise in which the disqualifying circumstance only comes to
    light after services have been performed. Rule 5004(b) provides
    that if compensation from the estate is sought for these services,
    the bankruptcy judge is disqualified from awarding compensation.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      The 1986 amendments to the Code provide that the United States
    trustee shall appoint trustees in chapter 7, chapter 12, and
    chapter 13 cases without the necessity of court approval. This rule
    is not intended to apply to the appointment of trustees in those
    cases because it would be inappropriate for a court rule to
    restrict in advance the exercise of discretion by the executive
    branch. See Committee Note to Rule 2009.
      In chapter 11 cases, a trustee or examiner is appointed by the
    United States trustee after consultation with parties in interest
    and subject to court approval. Subdivision (a), as amended,
    prohibits the approval of the appointment of an individual as a
    trustee or examiner if the person is a relative of the United
    States trustee making the appointment or the bankruptcy judge
    approving the appointment.
      The United States trustee neither appoints nor approves the
    employment of professional persons employed pursuant to Secs. 327,
    1103, or 1114 of the Code. Therefore, subdivision (a) is not a
    prohibition against judicial approval of employment of a
    professional person who is a relative of the United States trustee.
    However, the United States trustee monitors applications for
    compensation and reimbursement of expenses and may raise, appear
    and be heard on issues in the case. Employment of relatives of the
    United States trustee may be approved unless the court finds, after
    considering the relationship and the particular circumstances of
    the case, that the relationship would cause the employment to be
    improper. As used in this rule, "improper" includes the appearance
    of impropriety.
      United States trustee is defined to include a designee or
    assistant United States trustee. See Rule 9001. Therefore,
    subdivision (a) is applicable if the person appointed as trustee or
    examiner or the professional to be employed is a relative of a
    designee of the United States trustee or any assistant United
    States trustee in the region in which the case is pending.
      This rule is not exclusive of other laws or rules regulating
    ethical conduct. See, e.g., 28 CFR Sec. 45.735-5.

    FEDERAL RULES OF BANKRUPTCY PROCEDURE AND OFFICIAL BANKRUPTCY FORMS
    PART V - COURTS AND CLERKS

-HEAD-
    Rule 5003. Records Kept By the Clerk

-STATUTE-
      (a) Bankruptcy Dockets. The clerk shall keep a docket in each
    case under the Code and shall enter thereon each judgment, order,
    and activity in that case as prescribed by the Director of the
    Administrative Office of the United States Courts. The entry of a
    judgment or order in a docket shall show the date the entry is
    made.
      (b) Claims Register. The clerk shall keep in a claims register a
    list of claims filed in a case when it appears that there will be a
    distribution to unsecured creditors.
      (c) Judgments and Orders. The clerk shall keep, in the form and
    manner as the Director of the Administrative Office of the United
    States Courts may prescribe, a correct copy of every final judgment
    or order affecting title to or lien on real property or for the
    recovery of money or property, and any other order which the court
    may direct to be kept. On request of the prevailing party, a
    correct copy of every judgment or order affecting title to or lien
    upon real or personal property or for the recovery of money or
    property shall be kept and indexed with the civil judgments of the
    district court.
      (d) Index of Cases; Certificate of Search. The clerk shall keep
    indices of all cases and adversary proceedings as prescribed by the
    Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
    On request, the clerk shall make a search of any index and papers
    in the clerk's custody and certify whether a case or proceeding has
    been filed in or transferred to the court or if a discharge has
    been entered in its records.
      (e) Register of Mailing Addresses of Federal and State
    Governmental Units and Certain Taxing Authorities. The United
    States or the state or territory in which the court is located may
    file a statement designating its mailing address. The United
    States, state, territory, or local governmental unit responsible
    for collecting taxes within the district in which the case is
    pending may also file a statement designating an address for
    service of requests under Sec. 505(b) of the Code, and the
    designation shall describe where further information concerning
    additional requirements for filing such requests may be found. The
    clerk shall keep, in the form and manner as the Director of the
    Administrative Office of the United States Courts may prescribe, a
    register that includes the mailing addresses designated under the
    first sentence of this subdivision, and a separate register of the
    addresses designated for the service of requests under Sec. 505(b)
    of the Code. The clerk is not required to include in any single
    register more than one mailing address for each department, agency,
    or instrumentality of the United States or the state or territory.
    If more than one address for a department, agency, or
    instrumentality is included in the register, the clerk shall also
    include information that would enable a user of the register to
    determine the circumstances when each address is applicable, and
    mailing notice to only one applicable address is sufficient to
    provide effective notice. The clerk shall update the register
    annually, effective January 2 of each year. The mailing address in
    the register is conclusively presumed to be a proper address for
    the governmental unit, but the failure to use that mailing address
    does not invalidate any notice that is otherwise effective under
    applicable law.
      (f) Other Books and Records of the Clerk. The clerk shall keep
    any other books and records required by the Director of the
    Administrative Office of the United States Courts.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule consolidates former Bankruptcy Rules 504 and 507. The
    record-keeping duties of the referee under former Bankruptcy Rule
    504 are transferred to the clerk. Subdivisions (a), (c), (d) and
    (e) are similar to subdivisions (a)-(d) of Rule 79 F.R.Civ.P.
      Subdivision (b) requires that filed claims be listed on a claims
    register only when there may be a distribution to unsecured
    creditors. Compilation of the list for no asset or nominal asset
    cases would serve no purpose.
      Rule 2013 requires the clerk to maintain a public record of fees
    paid from the estate and an annual summary thereof.
      Former Bankruptcy Rules 507(d) and 508, which made materials in
    the clerk's office and files available to the public, are not
    necessary because Sec. 107 of the Code guarantees public access to
    files and dockets of cases under the Code.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) has been made more specific.
      Subdivision (c) is amended to require that on the request of the
    prevailing party the clerk of the district court shall keep and
    index bankruptcy judgments and orders affecting title to or lien
    upon real or personal property or for the recovery of money or
    property with the civil judgments of the district court. This
    requirement is derived from former Rule 9021(b). The Director of
    the Administrative Office will provide guidance to the bankruptcy
    and district court clerks regarding appropriate paperwork and
    retention procedures.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (e) is added to provide a source where debtors, their
    attorneys, and other parties may go to determine whether the United
    States or the state or territory in which the court is located has
    filed a statement designating a mailing address for notice
    purposes. By using the address in the register - which must be
    available to the public - the sender is assured that the mailing
    address is proper. But the use of an address that differs from the
    address included in the register does not invalidate the notice if
    it is otherwise effective under applicable law.
      The register may include a separate mailing address for each
    department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States or the
    state or territory. This rule does not require that addresses of
    municipalities or other local governmental units be included in the
    register, but the clerk may include them.
      Although it is important for the register to be kept current,
    debtors, their attorneys, and other parties should be able to rely
    on mailing addresses listed in the register without the need to
    continuously inquire as to new or amended addresses. Therefore, the
    clerk must update the register, but only once each year.
      To avoid unnecessary cost and burden on the clerk and to keep the
    register a reasonable length, the clerk is not required to include
    more than one mailing address for a particular agency, department,
    or instrumentality of the United States or the state or territory.
    But if more than one address is included, the clerk is required to
    include information so that a person using the register could
    determine when each address should be used. In any event, the
    inclusion of more than one address for a particular department,
    agency, or instrumentality does not impose on a person sending a
    notice the duty to send it to more than one address.
      GAP Report on Rule 5003. No changes since publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement Sec. 505(b)(1) of the Code added
    by the 2005 amendments, which allows a taxing authority to
    designate an address to use for the service of requests under that
    subsection. Under the amendment, the clerk is directed to maintain
    a separate register for mailing addresses of governmental units
    solely for the service of requests under Sec. 505(b). This register
    is in addition to the register of addresses of governmental units
    already maintained by the clerk. The clerk is required to keep only
    one address for a governmental unit in each register.
      Changes Made After Publication. Subdivision (e) was amended to
    clarify that the clerk must maintain a separate mailing address
    register that contains the addresses to which notices pertaining to
    actions under Sec. 505 of the Code are to be sent.

    Rule 5004. Disqualification

-STATUTE-
      (a) Disqualification of Judge. A bankruptcy judge shall be
    governed by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 455, and disqualified from presiding
    over the proceeding or contested matter in which the disqualifying
    circumstances (!1) arises or, if appropriate, shall be disqualified
    from presiding over the case.

      (b) Disqualification of Judge from Allowing Compensation. A
    bankruptcy judge shall be disqualified from allowing compensation
    to a person who is a relative of the bankruptcy judge or with whom
    the judge is so connected as to render it improper for the judge to
    authorize such compensation.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Subdivision (a). Disqualification of a bankruptcy judge is
    governed by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 455. That section provides that the
    judge "shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his
    impartiality might reasonably be questioned" or under certain other
    circumstances. In a case under the Code it is possible that the
    disqualifying circumstance will be isolated to an adversary
    proceeding or contested matter. The rule makes it clear that when
    the disqualifying circumstance is limited in that way the judge
    need only disqualify himself from presiding over that adversary
    proceeding or contested matter.
      It is possible, however, that even if the disqualifying
    circumstance arises in connection with an adversary proceeding, the
    effect will be so pervasive that disqualification from presiding
    over the case is appropriate. This distinction is consistent with
    the definition of "proceeding" in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 455(d)(1).
      Subdivision (b) precludes a bankruptcy judge from allowing
    compensation from the estate to a relative or other person closely
    associated with the judge. The subdivision applies where the judge
    has not appointed or approved the employment of the person
    requesting compensation. Perhaps the most frequent application of
    the subdivision will be in the allowance of administrative expenses
    under Sec. 503(b)(3)-(5) of the Code. For example, if an attorney
    or accountant is retained by an indenture trustee who thereafter
    makes a substantial contribution in a chapter 11 case, the attorney
    or accountant may seek compensation under Sec. 503(b)(4). If the
    attorney or accountant is a relative of or associated with the
    bankruptcy judge, the judge may not allow compensation to the
    attorney or accountant. Section 101(34) defines relative and Rule
    9001 incorporates the definitions of the Code. See the Advisory
    Committee's Note to Rule 5002.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1985 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) was affected by the Bankruptcy Amendments and
    Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, P.L. 98-353, 98 Stat. 333. The 1978
    Bankruptcy Reform Act, P.L. 95-598, included bankruptcy judges in
    the definition of United States judges in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 451 and
    they were therefore subject to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    455. This was to become effective on April 1, 1984, P.L. 95-598,
    Sec. 404(b). Section 113 of P.L. 98-353, however, appears to have
    rendered the amendment to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 451 ineffective.
    Subdivision (a) of the rule retains the substance and intent of the
    earlier draft by making bankruptcy judges subject to 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    455.
      The word "associated" in subdivision (b) has been changed to
    "connected" in order to conform with Rule 5002(b).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The rule is amended to be gender neutral. The bankruptcy judge
    before whom the matter is pending determines whether
    disqualification is required.

-HEAD-
    Rule 5005. Filing and Transmittal of Papers

-STATUTE-
      (a) Filing.
        (1) Place of Filing. The lists, schedules, statements, proofs
      of claim or interest, complaints, motions, applications,
      objections and other papers required to be filed by these rules,
      except as provided in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1409, shall be filed with
      the clerk in the district where the case under the Code is
      pending. The judge of that court may permit the papers to be
      filed with the judge, in which event the filing date shall be
      noted thereon, and they shall be forthwith transmitted to the
      clerk. The clerk shall not refuse to accept for filing any
      petition or other paper presented for the purpose of filing
      solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by
      these rules or any local rules or practices.
        (2) Filing by Electronic Means. A court may by local rule
      permit or require documents to be filed, signed, or verified by
      electronic means that are consistent with technical standards, if
      any, that the Judicial Conference of the United States
      establishes. A local rule may require filing by electronic means
      only if reasonable exceptions are allowed. A document filed by
      electronic means in compliance with a local rule constitutes a
      written paper for the purpose of applying these rules, the
      Federal Rules of Civil Procedure made applicable by these rules,
      and Sec. 107 of the Code.

      (b) Transmittal to the United States Trustee.
        (1) The complaints, motions, applications, objections and other
      papers required to be transmitted to the United States trustee by
      these rules shall be mailed or delivered to an office of the
      United States trustee, or to another place designated by the
      United States trustee, in the district where the case under the
      Code is pending.
        (2) The entity, other than the clerk, transmitting a paper to
      the United States trustee shall promptly file as proof of such
      transmittal a verified statement identifying the paper and
      stating the date on which it was transmitted to the United States
      trustee.
        (3) Nothing in these rules shall require the clerk to transmit
      any paper to the United States trustee if the United States
      trustee requests in writing that the paper not be transmitted.

      (c) Error in Filing or Transmittal. A paper intended to be filed
    with the clerk but erroneously delivered to the United States
    trustee, the trustee, the attorney for the trustee, a bankruptcy
    judge, a district judge, the clerk of the bankruptcy appellate
    panel, or the clerk of the district court shall, after the date of
    its receipt has been noted thereon, be transmitted forthwith to the
    clerk of the bankruptcy court. A paper intended to be transmitted
    to the United States trustee but erroneously delivered to the
    clerk, the trustee, the attorney for the trustee, a bankruptcy
    judge, a district judge, the clerk of the bankruptcy appellate
    panel, or the clerk of the district court shall, after the date of
    its receipt has been noted thereon, be transmitted forthwith to the
    United States trustee. In the interest of justice, the court may
    order that a paper erroneously delivered shall be deemed filed with
    the clerk or transmitted to the United States trustee as of the
    date of its original delivery.

      Subdivision (a) is an adaptation of Rule 5(e) F.R.Civ.P. Sections
    301-304 of the Code and Rules 1002 and 1003 require that cases
    under the Code be commenced by filing a petition "with the
    bankruptcy court." Other sections of the Code and other rules refer
    to or contemplate filing but there is no specific reference to
    filing with the bankruptcy court. For example, Sec. 501 of the Code
    requires filing of proofs of claim and Rule 3016(c) requires the
    filing of a disclosure statement. This subdivision applies to all
    situations in which filing is required. Except when filing in
    another district is authorized by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1473, all papers,
    including complaints commencing adversary proceedings, must be
    filed in the court where the case under the Code is pending.
      Subdivision (b) is the same as former Bankruptcy Rule 509(c).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to conform with the 1984 amendments.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b)(1) is flexible in that it permits the United
    States trustee to designate a place or places for receiving papers
    within the district in which the case is pending. Transmittal of
    papers to the United States trustee may be accomplished by mail or
    delivery, including delivery by courier, and the technical
    requirements for service of process are not applicable. Although
    papers relating to a proceeding commenced in another district
    pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1409 must be filed with the clerk in
    that district, the papers required to be transmitted to the United
    States trustee must be mailed or delivered to the United States
    trustee in the district in which the case under the Code is
    pending. The United States trustee in the district in which the
    case is pending monitors the progress of the case and should be
    informed of all developments in the case wherever the developments
    take place.
      Subdivision (b)(2) requires that proof of transmittal to the
    United States trustee be filed with the clerk. If papers are served
    on the United States trustee by mail or otherwise, the filing of
    proof of service would satisfy the requirements of this
    subdivision. This requirement enables the court to assure that
    papers are actually transmitted to the United States trustee in
    compliance with the rules. When the rules require that a paper be
    transmitted to the United States trustee and proof of transmittal
    has not been filed with the clerk, the court should not schedule a
    hearing or should take other appropriate action to assure that the
    paper is transmitted to the United States trustee. The filing of
    the verified statement with the clerk also enables other parties in
    interest to determine whether a paper has been transmitted to the
    United States trustee.
      Subdivision (b)(3) is designed to relieve the clerk of any
    obligation under these rules to transmit any paper to the United
    States trustee if the United States trustee does not wish to
    receive it.
      Subdivision (c) is amended to include the erroneous delivery of
    papers intended to be transmitted to the United States trustee.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to conform to the 1991 amendment to
    Rule 5(e) F.R.Civ.P. It is not a suitable role for the office of
    the clerk to refuse to accept for filing papers not conforming to
    requirements of form imposed by these rules or by local rules or
    practices. The enforcement of these rules and local rules is a role
    for a judge. This amendment does not require the clerk to accept
    for filing papers sent to the clerk's office by facsimile
    transmission.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1996 AMENDMENT       
      The rule is amended to permit, but not require, courts to adopt
    local rules that allow filing, signing, or verifying of documents
    by electronic means. However, such local rules must be consistent
    with technical standards, if any, promulgated by the Judicial
    Conference of the United States.
      An important benefit to be derived by permitting filing by
    electronic means is that the extensive volume of paper received and
    maintained as records in the clerk's office will be reduced
    substantially. With the receipt of electronic data transmissions by
    computer, the clerk may maintain records electronically without the
    need to reproduce them in tangible paper form.
      Judicial Conference standards governing the technological aspects
    of electronic filing will result in uniformity among judicial
    districts to accommodate an increasingly national bar. By
    delegating to the Judicial Conference the establishment and future
    amendment of national standards for electronic filing, the Supreme
    Court and Congress will be relieved of the burden of reviewing and
    promulgating detailed rules dealing with complex technological
    standards. Another reason for leaving to the Judicial Conference
    the formulation of technological standards for electronic filing is
    that advances in computer technology occur often, and changes in
    the technological standards may have to be implemented more
    frequently than would be feasible by rule amendment under the Rules
    Enabling Act process.
      It is anticipated that standards established by the Judicial
    Conference will govern technical specifications for electronic data
    transmission, such as requirements relating to the formatting of
    data, speed of transmission, means to transmit copies of supporting
    documentation, and security of communication procedures. In
    addition, before procedures for electronic filing are implemented,
    standards must be established to assure the proper maintenance and
    integrity of the record and to provide appropriate access and
    retrieval mechanisms. These matters will be governed by local rules
    until system-wide standards are adopted by the Judicial Conference.
      Rule 9009 requires that the Official Forms shall be observed and
    used "with alterations as may be appropriate." Compliance with
    local rules and any Judicial Conference standards with respect to
    the formatting or presentation of electronically transmitted data,
    to the extent that they do not conform to the Official Forms, would
    be an appropriate alteration within the meaning of Rule 9009.
      These rules require that certain documents be in writing. For
    example, Rule 3001 states that a proof of claim is a "written
    statement." Similarly, Rule 3007 provides that an objection to a
    claim "shall be in writing." Pursuant to the new subdivision
    (a)(2), any requirement under these rules that a paper be written
    may be satisfied by filing the document by electronic means,
    notwithstanding the fact that the clerk neither receives nor prints
    a paper reproduction of the electronic data.
      Section 107(a) of the Code provides that a "paper" filed in a
    case is a public record open to examination by an entity at
    reasonable times without charge, except as provided in Sec. 107(b).
    The amendment to subdivision (a)(2) provides that an electronically
    filed document is to be treated as such a public record.
      Although under subdivision (a)(2) electronically filed documents
    may be treated as written papers or as signed or verified writings,
    it is important to emphasize that such treatment is only for the
    purpose of applying these rules. In addition, local rules and
    Judicial Conference standards regarding verification must satisfy
    the requirements of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1746.
      GAP Report on Rule 5005. No changes since publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a). Amended Rule 5005(a)(2) acknowledges that many
    courts have required electronic filing by means of a standing
    order, procedures manual, or local rule. These local practices
    reflect the advantages that courts and most litigants realize from
    electronic filings. Courts requiring electronic filing must make
    reasonable exceptions for persons for whom electronic filing of
    documents constitutes an unreasonable denial of access to the
    courts. Experience with the rule will facilitate convergence on
    uniform exceptions in an amended Rule 5005(a)(2).
      Subdivision (c). The rule is amended to include the clerk of the
    bankruptcy appellate panel among the list of persons required to
    transmit to the proper person erroneously filed or transmitted
    papers. The amendment is necessary because the bankruptcy appellate
    panels were not in existence at the time of the original
    promulgation of the rule. The amendment also inserts the district
    judge on the list of persons required to transmit papers intended
    for the United States trustee but erroneously sent to another
    person. The district judge is included in the list of persons who
    must transmit papers to the clerk of the bankruptcy court in the
    first part of the rule, and there is no reason to exclude the
    district judge from the list of persons who must transmit
    erroneously filed papers to the United States trustee.
      Changes Made After Publication. The published version of the Rule
    did not include the sentence set out on lines 7-10 above [sic]. The
    Advisory Committee concluded, based on the written comments
    received and additonal Advisory Committee consideration, that the
    text of the rule should include a statement regarding the need for
    courts to protect access to the courts for those whose status might
    not allow for electronic participation in cases. The published
    version had relegated this notion to the Committee Note, but
    further deliberations led to the conclusion that this matter is too
    important to leave to the Committee Note and instead should be
    included in the text of the rule.

    10 days after the date of the filing of the petition notify
    creditors that the debtor has not filed the statement and that
    further notice will be given if a later filed statement indicates
    that a presumption of abuse has arisen. If a debtor later files a
    statement indicating that a presumption of abuse has arisen, the
    clerk shall notify creditors of the presumption of abuse as
    promptly as practicable.

      This rule [Rule 5008. Funds of the Estate; abrogated Apr. 30,
    1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991] is abrogated in view of the amendments to
    Sec. 345(b) of the Code and the role of the United States trustee
    in approving bonds and supervising trustees.

                      COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008                  
      This rule is new. The 2005 amendments to Sec. 342 of the Code
    require that clerks give written notice to all creditors not later
    than 10 days after the date of the filing of the petition that a
    presumption of abuse has arisen under Sec. 707(b). A statement
    filed by the debtor will be the source of the clerk's information
    about the presumption of abuse. This rule enables the clerk to meet
    its obligation to send the notice within the statutory time period
    set forth in Sec. 342. In the event that the court receives the
    debtor's statement after the clerk has sent the first notice, and
    the debtor's statement indicates a presumption of abuse, the rule
    requires that the clerk send a second notice.

      If in a chapter 7, chapter 12, or chapter 13 case the trustee has
    filed a final report and final account and has certified that the
    estate has been fully administered, and if within 30 days no

    facilitates the United States trustee's performance of statutory
    duties to supervise trustees and administer cases under chapters 7,
    12, and 13 pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 586. In the absence of a
    timely objection by the United States trustee or a party in
    interest, the court may discharge the trustee and close the case
    pursuant to Sec. 350(a) without the need to review the final report

-STATUTE-
      A case may be reopened on motion of the debtor or other party in
    interest pursuant to Sec. 350(b) of the Code. In a chapter 7, 12,
    or 13 case a trustee shall not be appointed by the United States
    trustee unless the court determines that a trustee is necessary to
    protect the interests of creditors and the debtor or to insure
    efficient administration of the case.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Section 350(b) of the Code provides: "A case may be reopened in
    the court in which such case was closed to administer assets, to
    accord relief to the debtor, or for other cause."
      Rule 9024, which incorporates Rule 60 F.R.Civ.P., exempts motions
    to reopen cases under the Code from the one year limitation of Rule
    60(b).
      Although a case has been closed the court may sometimes act
    without reopening the case. Under Rule 9024, clerical errors in
    judgments, orders, or other parts of the record or errors therein
    caused by oversight or omission may be corrected. A judgment
    determined to be non-dischargeable pursuant to Rule 4007 may be
    enforced after a case is closed by a writ of execution obtained
    pursuant to Rule 7069.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      In order to avoid unnecessary cost and delay, the rule is amended
    to permit reopening of a case without the appointment of a trustee
    when the services of a trustee are not needed.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to conform to the 1986 amendments to the
    Code that give the United States trustee the duty to appoint
    trustees in chapter 7, 12 and 13 cases. See Secs. 701, 702(d),
    1202(a), and 1302(a) of the Code. In most reopened cases, a trustee
    is not needed because there are no assets to be administered.
    Therefore, in the interest of judicial economy, this rule is
    amended so that a motion will not be necessary unless the United
    States trustee or a party in interest seeks the appointment of a
    trustee in the reopened case.

    administration of the case or any proceeding therein before the

      Motions for withdrawal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 157(d) or
    abstention pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1334(c), like all other
    motions, are to be filed with the clerk as required by Rule
    5005(a). If a bankruptcy clerk has been appointed for the district,
    all motions are filed with the bankruptcy clerk. The method for
    forwarding withdrawal motions to the district court will be
    established by administrative procedures.
      Subdivision (a). Section 157(d) permits the district court to
    order withdrawal on its own motion or the motion of a party.
    Subdivision (a) of this rule makes it clear that the bankruptcy
    judge will not conduct hearings on a withdrawal motion. The
    withdrawal decision is committed exclusively to the district court.
      Subdivision (b). A decision to abstain under 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    1334(c) is not appealable. The district court is vested originally
    with jurisdiction and the decision to relinquish that jurisdiction
    must ultimately be a matter for the district court. The bankruptcy
    judge ordinarily will be in the best position to evaluate the
    grounds asserted for abstention. This subdivision (b) provides that
    the initial hearing on the motion is before the bankruptcy judge.
    The procedure for review of the report and recommendation are
    governed by Rule 9033.
      This rule does not apply to motions under Sec. 305 of the Code
    for abstention from hearing a case. Judicial decisions will
    determine the scope of the bankruptcy judge's authority under Sec.
    305.
      Subdivision (c). Unless the court so orders, proceedings are not
    stayed when motions are filed for withdrawal or for abstention from
    hearing a proceeding. Because of the district court's authority
    over cases and proceedings, the subdivision authorizes the district
    court to order a stay or modify a stay ordered by the bankruptcy
    judge.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (b) is amended to delete the restriction that limits
    the role of the bankruptcy court to the filing of a report and
    recommendation for disposition of a motion for abstention under 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 1334(c)(2). This amendment is consistent with Sec.
    309(b) of the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 which amended Sec.
    1334(c)(2) so that it allows an appeal to the district court of a
    bankruptcy court's order determining an abstention motion. This
    subdivision is also amended to clarify that the motion is a
    contested matter governed by Rule 9014 and that it must be served
    on all parties to the proceeding which is the subject of the
    motion.

      This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 603. The Act
    contained, in Sec. 70d, a provision placing the burden of proof on
    the same person as did Rule 603. The Code does not contain any
    directive with respect to the burden of proof. This omission, in
    all probability, resulted from the intention to leave matters

    determine the propriety of the administration, including the

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      "Custodian" is defined in Sec. 101(10) of the Code. The
    definition includes a trustee or receiver appointed in proceedings
    not under the Code, as well as an assignee for the benefit of
    creditors.
      This rule prescribes the procedure to be followed by a custodian
    who under Sec. 543 of the Code is required to deliver property to
    the trustee and to account for its disposition. The examination
    under subdivision (b) may be initiated (1) on the motion of the
    custodian required to account under subdivision (a) for an approval
    of his account and discharge thereon, (2) on the motion of, or the
    filing of an objection to the custodian's account by, the trustee
    or any other party in interest, or (3) on the court's own
    initiative. Rule 9014 applies to any contested matter arising under
    this rule.
      Section 543(d) is similar to an abstention provision. It grants
    the bankruptcy court discretion to permit the custodian to remain
    in possession and control of the property. In that event, the
    custodian is excused from complying with Sec. 543(a)-(c) and thus
    would not be required to turn over the property to the trustee.
    When there is no duty to turn over to the trustee, Rule 6002 would
    not be applicable.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to enable the United States trustee to
    review, object to, or to otherwise be heard regarding the
    custodian's report and accounting. See Secs. 307 and 543 of the
    Code.

      This rule [Former Rule 6003 - Disbursement of Money of the Estate
    (Abrogated Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991)] is abrogated in view
    of the role of the United States trustee in supervising trustees.
    Use of estate funds by a trustee or debtor in possession is
    governed by Sec. 363 of the Code.

                      COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007                  
      There can be a flurry of activity during the first days of a
    bankruptcy case. This activity frequently takes place prior to the
    formation of a creditors' committee, and it also can include
    substantial amounts of materials for the court and parties in
    interest to review and evaluate. This rule is intended to alleviate
    some of the time pressures present at the start of a case so that
    full and close consideration can be given to matters that may have
    a fundamental impact on the case.
      The rule provides that the court cannot grant relief on
    applications for the employment of professional persons, motions
    for the use, sale, or lease of property of the estate other than
    such a motion under Rule 4001, and motions to assume or assign
    executory contracts and unexpired leases for the first 20 days of
    the case, unless granting relief is necessary to avoid immediate
    and irreparable harm. This standard is taken from Rule 4001(b)(2)
    and (c)(2), and decisions under those provisions should provide
    guidance for the application of this provision.
      This rule does not govern motions and applications made more than
    20 days after the filing of the petition.
      Changes After Publication. Subdivision (c) was amended by
    deleting the reference to the rejection of executory contracts or
    unexpired leases. The rule, as revised, now limits only the
    assumption or assignment of executory contracts or unexpired leases
    in that subdivision.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute
    a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules,
    deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods

-HEAD-
    Rule 6004. Use, Sale, or Lease of Property

-STATUTE-
      (a) Notice of Proposed Use, Sale, or Lease of Property. Notice of
    a proposed use, sale, or lease of property, other than cash
    collateral, not in the ordinary course of business shall be given
    pursuant to Rule 2002(a)(2), (c)(1), (i), and (k) and, if
    applicable, in accordance with Sec. 363(b)(2) of the Code.
      (b) Objection to Proposal. Except as provided in subdivisions (c)
    and (d) of this rule, an objection to a proposed use, sale, or
    lease of property shall be filed and served not less than seven
    days before the date set for the proposed action or within the time
    fixed by the court. An objection to the proposed use, sale, or
    lease of property is governed by Rule 9014.
      (c) Sale Free and Clear of Liens and Other Interests. A motion
    for authority to sell property free and clear of liens or other
    interests shall be made in accordance with Rule 9014 and shall be
    served on the parties who have liens or other interests in the
    property to be sold. The notice required by subdivision (a) of this
    rule shall include the date of the hearing on the motion and the
    time within which objections may be filed and served on the debtor
    in possession or trustee.
      (d) Sale of Property Under $2,500. Notwithstanding subdivision
    (a) of this rule, when all of the nonexempt property of the estate
    has an aggregate gross value less than $2,500, it shall be
    sufficient to give a general notice of intent to sell such property
    other than in the ordinary course of business to all creditors,
    indenture trustees, committees appointed or elected pursuant to the
    Code, the United States trustee and other persons as the court may
    direct. An objection to any such sale may be filed and served by a
    party in interest within 14 days of the mailing of the notice, or
    within the time fixed by the court. An objection is governed by
    Rule 9014.
      (e) Hearing. If a timely objection is made pursuant to
    subdivision (b) or (d) of this rule, the date of the hearing
    thereon may be set in the notice given pursuant to subdivision (a)
    of this rule.
      (f) Conduct of Sale Not in the Ordinary Course of Business.
        (1) Public or Private Sale. All sales not in the ordinary
      course of business may be by private sale or by public auction.
      Unless it is impracticable, an itemized statement of the property
      sold, the name of each purchaser, and the price received for each
      item or lot or for the property as a whole if sold in bulk shall
      be filed on completion of a sale. If the property is sold by an
      auctioneer, the auctioneer shall file the statement, transmit a
      copy thereof to the United States trustee, and furnish a copy to
      the trustee, debtor in possession, or chapter 13 debtor. If the
      property is not sold by an auctioneer, the trustee, debtor in
      possession, or chapter 13 debtor shall file the statement and
      transmit a copy thereof to the United States trustee.
        (2) Execution of Instruments. After a sale in accordance with
      this rule the debtor, the trustee, or debtor in possession, as
      the case may be, shall execute any instrument necessary or
      ordered by the court to effectuate the transfer to the purchaser.

      (g) Sale of Personally Identifiable Information.
        (1) Motion. A motion for authority to sell or lease personally
      identifiable information under Sec. 363(b)(1)(B) shall include a
      request for an order directing the United States trustee to
      appoint a consumer privacy ombudsman under Sec. 332. Rule 9014
      governs the motion which shall be served on: any committee
      elected under Sec. 705 or appointed under Sec. 1102 of the Code,
      or if the case is a chapter 11 reorganization case and no
      committee of unsecured creditors has been appointed under Sec.
      1102, on the creditors included on the list of creditors filed
      under Rule 1007(d); and on such other entities as the court may
      direct. The motion shall be transmitted to the United States
      trustee.
        (2) Appointment. If a consumer privacy ombudsman is appointed
      under Sec. 332, no later than seven days before the hearing on
      the motion under Sec. 363(b)(1)(B), the United States trustee
      shall file a notice of the appointment, including the name and
      address of the person appointed. The United States trustee's
      notice shall be accompanied by a verified statement of the person
      appointed setting forth the person's connections with the debtor,
      creditors, any other party in interest, their respective
      attorneys and accountants, the United States trustee, or any
      person employed in the office of the United States trustee.

      (h) Stay of Order Authorizing Use, Sale, or Lease of Property. An
    order authorizing the use, sale, or lease of property other than
    cash collateral is stayed until the expiration of 14 days after
    entry of the order, unless the court orders otherwise.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Subdivisions (a) and (b). Pursuant to Sec. 363(b) of the Code, a
    trustee or debtor in possession may use, sell, or lease property
    other than in the ordinary course of business only after notice and
    hearing. Rule 2002(a), (c) and (i) specifies the time when notice
    of sale is to be given, the contents of the notice and the persons
    to whom notice is to be given of sales of property. Subdivision (a)
    makes those provisions applicable as well to notices for proposed
    use and lease of property.
      The Code does not provide the time within which parties may file
    objections to a proposed sale. Subdivision (b) of the rule requires
    the objection to be in writing and filed not less than five days
    before the proposed action is to take place. The objection should
    also be served within that time on the person who is proposing to
    take the action which would be either the trustee or debtor in
    possession. This time period is subject to change by the court. In
    some instances there is a need to conduct a sale in a short period
    of time and the court is given discretion to tailor the
    requirements to the circumstances.
      Subdivision (c). In some situations a notice of sale for
    different pieces of property to all persons specified in Rule
    2002(a) may be uneconomic and inefficient. This is particularly
    true in some chapter 7 liquidation cases when there is property of
    relatively little value which must be sold by the trustee.
    Subdivision (c) allows a general notice of intent to sell when the
    aggregate value of the estate's property is less than $2,500. The
    gross value is the value of the property without regard to the
    amount of any debt secured by a lien on the property. It is not
    necessary to give a detailed notice specifying the time and place
    of a particular sale. Thus, the requirements of Rule 2002(c) need
    not be met. If this method of providing notice of sales is used,
    the subdivision specifies that parties in interest may serve and
    file objections to the proposed sale of any property within the
    class and the time for service and filing is fixed at not later
    than 15 days after mailing the notice. The court may fix a
    different time. Subdivision (c) would have little utility in
    chapter 11 cases. Pursuant to Rule 2002(i), the court can limit
    notices of sale to the creditors' committee appointed under Sec.
    1102 of the Code and the same burdens present in a small chapter 7
    case would not exist.
      Subdivision (d). If a timely objection is filed, a hearing is
    required with respect to the use, sale, or lease of property.
    Subdivision (d) renders the filing of an objection tantamount to
    requesting a hearing so as to require a hearing pursuant to Secs.
    363(b) and 102(l)(B)(i).
      Subdivision (e) is derived in part from former Bankruptcy Rule
    606(b) but does not carry forward the requirement of that rule that
    court approval be obtained for sales of property. Pursuant to Sec.
    363(b) court approval is not required unless timely objection is
    made to the proposed sale. The itemized statement or information
    required by the subdivision is not necessary when it would be
    impracticable to prepare it or set forth the information. For
    example, a liquidation sale of retail goods although not in the
    ordinary course of business may be on a daily ongoing basis and
    only summaries may be available.
      The duty imposed by paragraph (2) does not affect the power of
    the bankruptcy court to order third persons to execute instruments
    transferring property purchased at a sale under this subdivision.
    See, e.g., In re Rosenberg, 138 F.2d 409 (7th Cir. 1943).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to conform to the 1984 amendments to
    Sec. 363(b)(2) of the Code.
      Subdivision (b) is amended to provide that an objection to a
    proposed use, sale, or lease of property creates a contested matter
    governed by Rule 9014. A similar amendment is made to subdivision
    (d), which was formerly subdivision (c).
      Subdivision (c) is new. Section 363(f) provides that sales free
    and clear of liens or other interests are only permitted if one of
    the five statutory requirements is satisfied. Rule 9013 requires
    that a motion state with particularity the grounds relied upon by
    the movant. A motion for approval of a sale free and clear of liens
    or other interests is subject to Rule 9014, service must be made on
    the parties holding liens or other interests in the property, and
    notice of the hearing on the motion and the time for filing
    objections must be included in the notice given under subdivision
    (a).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to provide notice to the United States
    trustee of a proposed use, sale or lease of property not in the
    ordinary course of business. See Rule 2002(k). Subdivision (f)(1)
    is amended to enable the United States trustee to monitor the
    progress of the case in accordance with 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    586(a)(3)(G).
      The words "with the clerk" in subdivision (f)(1) are deleted as
    unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1999 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (g) is added to provide sufficient time for a party
    to request a stay pending appeal of an order authorizing the use,
    sale, or lease of property under Sec. 363(b) of the Code before the
    order is implemented. It does not affect the time for filing a
    notice of appeal in accordance with Rule 8002.
      Rule 6004(g) does not apply to orders regarding the use of cash
    collateral and does not affect the trustee's right to use, sell, or
    lease property without a court order to the extent permitted under
    Sec. 363 of the Code.
      The court may, in its discretion, order that Rule 6004(g) is not
    applicable so that the property may be used, sold, or leased
    immediately in accordance with the order entered by the court.
    Alternatively, the court may order that the stay under Rule 6004(g)
    is for a fixed period less than 10 days.
      GAP Report on Rule 6004. No changes since publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended by inserting a new subdivision (g) to
    implement Secs. 332 and 363(b)(1)(B) of the Code, added by the 2005
    amendments. This rule governs the proposed transfer of personally
    identifiable information in a manner inconsistent with any policy
    covering the transfer of the information. Rule 2002(c)(1) requires
    the seller to state in the notice of the sale or lease whether the
    transfer is consistent with and policy governing the transfer of
    the information.
      Under Sec. 332 of the Code, the consumer privacy ombudsman must
    be appointed at least five days prior to the hearing on a sale or
    lease of personally identifiable information. In an appropriate
    case, the consumer privacy ombudsman may seek a continuance of the
    hearing on the proposed sale to perform the tasks required of the
    ombudsman by Sec. 332 of the Code.
      Former subdivision (g) is redesignated as subdivision (h).
      Changes Made After Publication. The Committee Note was amended to
    highlight the connection between this rule and Rule 2002 with
    regard to the obligation to provide notice of proposed
    transactions. It was also amended to recognize the ability of the
    consumer privacy ombudsman to seek a continuance of a hearing on
    the proposed sale of personally identifiable information.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to

    officer or employee of the Judicial Branch of the United States or

      This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 606(c) and
    implements Sec. 327 of the Code. Pursuant to Sec. 327, the trustee
    or debtor in possession may employ one or more appraisers or
    auctioneers, subject to court approval. This rule requires the
    court order approving such employment to fix the amount or rate of
    compensation. The second sentence of the former rule is retained to
    continue to safeguard against imputations of favoritism which
    detract from public confidence in bankruptcy administration. The
    final sentence is to guard against imposition of parochial
    requirements not warranted by any consideration having to do with
    sound bankruptcy administration.
      Reference should also be made to Rule 2013(a) regarding the
    limitation on employment of appraisers and auctioneers, and Rule
    2014(a) regarding the application for appointment of an appraiser
    or auctioneer.

-HEAD-
    Rule 6006. Assumption, Rejection or Assignment of an Executory
      Contract or Unexpired Lease

-STATUTE-
      (a) Proceeding To Assume, Reject, or Assign. A proceeding to
    assume, reject, or assign an executory contract or unexpired lease,
    other than as part of a plan, is governed by Rule 9014.
      (b) Proceeding To Require Trustee To Act. A proceeding by a party
    to an executory contract or unexpired lease in a chapter 9
    municipality case, chapter 11 reorganization case, chapter 12
    family farmer's debt adjustment case, or chapter 13 individual's
    debt adjustment case, to require the trustee, debtor in possession,
    or debtor to determine whether to assume or reject the contract or
    lease is governed by Rule 9014.
      (c) Notice. Notice of a motion made pursuant to subdivision (a)
    or (b) of this rule shall be given to the other party to the
    contract or lease, to other parties in interest as the court may
    direct, and, except in a chapter 9 municipality case, to the United
    States trustee.
      (d) Stay of Order Authorizing Assignment. An order authorizing
    the trustee to assign an executory contract or unexpired lease
    under Sec. 365(f) is stayed until the expiration of 14 days after
    the entry of the order, unless the court orders otherwise.
      (e) Limitations. The trustee shall not seek authority to assume
    or assign multiple executory contracts or unexpired leases in one
    motion unless: (1) all executory contracts or unexpired leases to
    be assumed or assigned are between the same parties or are to be
    assigned to the same assignee; (2) the trustee seeks to assume, but
    not assign to more than one assignee, unexpired leases of real
    property; or (3) the court otherwise authorizes the motion to be
    filed. Subject to subdivision (f), the trustee may join requests
    for authority to reject multiple executory contracts or unexpired
    leases in one motion.
      (f) Omnibus Motions. A motion to reject or, if permitted under
    subdivision (e), a motion to assume or assign multiple executory
    contracts or unexpired leases that are not between the same parties
    shall:
        (1) state in a conspicuous place that parties receiving the
      omnibus motion should locate their names and their contracts or
      leases listed in the motion;
        (2) list parties alphabetically and identify the corresponding
      contract or lease;
        (3) specify the terms, including the curing of defaults, for
      each requested assumption or assignment;
        (4) specify the terms, including the identity of each assignee
      and the adequate assurance of future performance by each
      assignee, for each requested assignment;
        (5) be numbered consecutively with other omnibus motions to
      assume, assign, or reject executory contracts or unexpired
      leases; and
        (6) be limited to no more than 100 executory contracts or
      unexpired leases.

      (g) Finality of Determination. The finality of any order
    respecting an executory contract or unexpired lease included in an
    omnibus motion shall be determined as though such contract or lease
    had been the subject of a separate motion.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Section 365(a) of the Code requires court approval for the
    assumption or rejection of an executory contract by the trustee or
    debtor in possession. The trustee or debtor in possession may also
    assign an executory contract, Sec. 365(f)(1), but must first assume
    the contract, Sec. 365(f)(2). Rule 6006 provides a procedure for
    obtaining court approval. It does not apply to the automatic
    rejection of contracts which are not assumed in chapter 7
    liquidation cases within 60 days after the order for relief, or to
    the assumption or rejection of contracts in a plan pursuant to Sec.
    1123(b)(2) or Sec. 1322(b)(7).
      Subdivision (a) by referring to Rule 9014 requires a motion to be
    brought for the assumption, rejection, or assignment of an
    executory contract. Normally, the motion will be brought by the
    trustee, debtor in possession or debtor in a chapter 9 or chapter
    13 case. The authorization to assume a contract and to assign it
    may be sought in a single motion and determined by a single order.
      Subdivision (b) makes applicable the same motion procedure when
    the other party to the contract seeks to require the chapter
    officer to take some action. Section 365(d)(2) recognizes that this
    procedure is available to these contractual parties. This provision
    of the Code and subdivision of the rule apply only in chapter 9, 11
    and 13 cases. A motion is not necessary in chapter 7 cases because
    in those cases a contract is deemed rejected if the trustee does
    not timely assume it.
      Subdivision (c) provides for the court to set a hearing on a
    motion made under subdivision (a) or (b). The other party to the
    contract should be given appropriate notice of the hearing and the
    court may order that other parties in interest, such as a
    creditors' committee, also be given notice.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivisions (a) and (b) are amended to conform to the 1984
    amendment to Sec. 365 of the Code, which governs assumption or
    rejection of time share interests.
      Section 1113, governing collective bargaining agreements, was
    added to the Code in 1984. It sets out requirements that must be
    met before a collective bargaining agreement may be rejected. The
    application to reject a collective bargaining agreement referred to
    in Sec. 1113 shall be made by motion. The motion to reject creates
    a contested matter under Rule 9014, and service is made pursuant to
    Rule 7004 on the representative of the employees. The time periods
    set forth in Sec. 1113(d) govern the scheduling of the hearing and
    disposition of a motion to reject the agreement.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      References to time share interests are deleted as unnecessary.
    Time share interests are within the scope of this rule to the
    extent that they are governed by Sec. 365 of the Code.
      Subdivision (b) is amended to include chapter 12 cases.
      Subdivision (c) is amended to enable the United States trustee to
    appear and be heard on the issues relating to the assumption or
    rejection of executory contracts and unexpired leases. See Secs.
    307, 365, and 1113 of the Code.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to delete the requirement for an actual
    hearing when no request for a hearing is made. See Rule 9014.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1999 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (d) is added to provide sufficient time for a party
    to request a stay pending appeal of an order authorizing the
    assignment of an executory contract or unexpired lease under Sec.
    365(f) of the Code before the assignment is consummated. The stay
    under subdivision (d) does not affect the time for filing a notice
    of appeal in accordance with Rule 8002.
      The court may, in its discretion, order that Rule 6006(d) is not
    applicable so that the executory contract or unexpired lease may be
    assigned immediately in accordance with the order entered by the
    court. Alternatively, the court may order that the stay under Rule
    6006(d) is for a fixed period less than 10 days.
      GAP Report on Rule 6006. No changes since publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to authorize the use of omnibus motions to
    reject multiple executory contracts and unexpired leases. In some
    cases there may be numerous executory contracts and unexpired
    leases, and this rule permits the combining of up to one hundred of
    these contracts and leases in a single motion to initiate the
    contested matter.
      The rule also is amended to authorize the use of a single motion
    to assume or assign executory contracts and unexpired leases (i)
    when such contracts and leases are with a single nondebtor party,
    (ii) when such contracts and leases are being assigned to the same
    assignee, (iii) when the trustee proposes to assume, but not assign
    to more than one assignee, real property leases, or (iv) the court
    authorizes the filing of a joint motion to assume or to assume and
    assign executory contracts and unexpired leases under other
    circumstances that are not specifically recognized in the rule.
      An omnibus motion to assume, assign, or reject multiple executory
    contracts and unexpired leases must comply with the procedural
    requirements set forth in subdivision (f) of the rule, unless the
    court orders otherwise. These requirements are intended to ensure
    that the nondebtor parties to the contracts and leases receive
    effective notice of the motion. Among those requirements is the
    requirement in subdivision (f)(5) that these motions be
    consecutively numbered (e.g., Debtor in Possession's First Omnibus
    Motion for Authority to Assume Executory Contracts and Unexpired
    Leases, Debtor in Possession's Second Omnibus Motion for Authority
    to Assume Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases, etc.). There
    may be a need for several of these motions in a particular case.
    Numbering the motions consecutively is essential to keep track of
    these motions on the court's docket and should avoid confusion that
    might otherwise result from similar or identically-titled motions.
      Subdivision (g) of the rule provides that the finality of any
    order respecting an executory contract or unexpired lease included
    in an omnibus motion shall be determined as though such contract or
    lease had been the subject of a separate motion. A party seeking to
    appeal any such order is neither required, nor permitted, to await
    the court's resolution of all other contracts or leases included in
    the omnibus motion to obtain appellate review of the order. The
    rule permits the listing of multiple contracts or leases for
    convenience, and that convenience should not impede timely review
    of the court's decision with respect to each contract or lease.
      Changes After Publication. Subdivision (e) of the proposed rule
    was amended as suggested by the NBC to insert a third category of
    requests that the trustee may make under an omnibus motion. The
    list of categories was numbered, and the new category is set out in
    (e)(2).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute
    a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules,
    deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods

    creditors, indenture trustees, and committees elected pursuant to
    Sec. 705 or appointed pursuant to Sec. 1102 of the Code. A party in
    interest may file and serve an objection within 14 days of the
    mailing of the notice, or within the time fixed by the court. If a
    timely objection is made, the court shall set a hearing on notice
    to the United States trustee and to other entities as the court may
    direct.
      (b) Motion by Party in Interest. A party in interest may file and

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Sections 554 and 725 of the Code permit and require abandonment
    and disposition of property of the estate. Pursuant to Sec. 554,
    the trustee may abandon property but only after notice and hearing.
    This section is applicable in chapter 7, 11 and 13 cases. Section
    725 requires the trustee to dispose of property in which someone
    other than the estate has an interest, prior to final distribution.
    It applies only in chapter 7 cases. Notice and hearing are also
    required conditions. Section 102(1) provides that "notice and
    hearing" is construed to mean appropriate notice and an opportunity
    for a hearing. Neither Sec. 554 nor Sec. 725 specify to whom the
    notices are to be sent. This rule does not apply to Sec. 554(c).
    Pursuant to that subsection, property is deemed abandoned if it is
    not administered. A hearing is not required by the statute.
      Subdivision (a) requires the notices to be sent to all creditors,
    indenture trustees, and committees elected under Sec. 705 or
    appointed under Sec. 1102 of the Code. This may appear burdensome,
    expensive and inefficient but the subdivision is in keeping with
    the Code's requirement for notice and the Code's intent to remove
    the bankruptcy judge from undisputed matters. The burden, expense
    and inefficiency can be alleviated in large measure by
    incorporating the notice into or together with the notice of the
    meeting of creditors so that separate notices would not be
    required.
      Subdivision (b) implements Sec. 554(b) which specifies that a
    party in interest may request an order that the trustee abandon
    property. The rule specifies that the request be by motion and,
    pursuant to the Code, lists the parties who should receive notice.
      Subdivision (c) requires a hearing when an objection under
    subdivision (a) is filed or a motion under subdivision (b) is made.
    Filing of an objection is sufficient to require a hearing; a
    separate or joined request for a hearing is unnecessary since the
    objection itself is tantamount to such a request.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to conform to the 1986 amendments to 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 586(a) and to the Code. The United States trustee
    monitors the progress of the case and has standing to raise, appear
    and be heard on the issues relating to the abandonment or other
    disposition of property. See Secs. 307 and 554 of the Code.
    Committees of retired employees appointed under Sec. 1114 are not
    entitled to notice under subdivision (a) of this rule.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to clarify that when a motion is made
    pursuant to subdivision (b), a hearing is not required if a hearing
    is not requested or if there is no opposition to the motion. See
    Rule 9014. Other amendments are stylistic and make no substantive
    change.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT

    Ordinarily the secured creditor should be given notice of the
    trustee's motion so that any objection may be raised to the
    proposed redemption.
      The rule applies also to a debtor exercising a right of

      patient records the trustee proposes to destroy;
        (2) state the name, address, telephone number, email address,
      and website, if any, of a person from whom information about the
      patient records may be obtained;
        (3) state how to claim the patient records; and
        (4) state the date by which patient records must be claimed,
      and that if they are not so claimed the records will be
      destroyed.

      (b) Notice by Mail Under Sec. 351(1)(B). Subject to applicable
    nonbankruptcy law relating to patient privacy, a notice regarding
    the claiming or disposing of patient records under Sec. 351(1)(B)
    shall, in addition to including the information in subdivision (a),
    direct that a patient's family member or other representative who
    receives the notice inform the patient of the notice. Any notice
    under this subdivision shall be mailed to the patient and any
    family member or other contact person whose name and address have
    been given to the trustee or the debtor for the purpose of
    providing information regarding the patient's health care, to the
    Attorney General of the State where the health care facility is
    located, and to any insurance company known to have provided health
    care insurance to the patient.
      (c) Proof of Compliance With Notice Requirement. Unless the court
    orders the trustee to file proof of compliance with Sec. 351(1)(B)
    under seal, the trustee shall not file, but shall maintain, the
    proof of compliance for a reasonable time.
      (d) Report of Destruction of Records. The trustee shall file, no
    later than 30 days after the destruction of patient records under
    Sec. 351(3), a report certifying that the unclaimed records have
    been destroyed and explaining the method used to effect the
    destruction. The report shall not identify any patient by name or
    other identifying information.

      This rule is new. It implements Sec. 351(1), which was added to
    the Code by the 2005 amendments. That provision requires the
    trustee to notify patients that their patient records will be
    destroyed if they remain unclaimed for one year after the
    publication of a notice in an appropriate newspaper. The Code
    provision also requires that individualized notice be sent to each
    patient and to the patient's family member or other contact person.
      The variety of health care businesses and the range of current
    and former patients present the need for flexibility in the
    creation and publication of the notices that will be given.
    Nevertheless, there are some matters that must be included in any
    notice being given to patients, their family members, and contact
    persons to ensure that sufficient information is provided to these
    persons regarding the trustee's intent to dispose of patient
    records. Subdivision (a) of this rule lists the minimum
    requirements for notices given under Sec. 351(1)(A), and
    subdivision (b) governs the form of notices under Sec. 351(1)(B).
    Notices given under this rule are subject to provisions under
    applicable federal and state law that relate to the protection of
    patients' privacy, such as the Health Insurance Portability and
    Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-191 (HIPAA).
      Subdivision (c) directs the trustee to maintain proof of
    compliance with Sec. 351(1)(B), but because the proof of compliance
    may contain patient names that should or must remain confidential,
    it prohibits filing the proof of compliance unless the court orders
    the trustee to file it under seal.
      Subdivision (d) requires the trustee to file a report with the
    court regarding the destruction of patient records. This
    certification is intended to ensure that the trustee properly
    completed the destruction process. However, because the report will
    be filed with the court and ordinarily will be available to the
    public under Sec. 107, the names, addresses, and other identifying
    information of patients are not to be included in the report to
    protect patient privacy.
      Changes Made After Publication. Subdivision (b)(2) was amended to
    add the Attorney General of the State where a health care facility
    is located to the list of entities entitled to notice of the
    disposal of patient records.

    Rule 7001. Scope of Rules of Part VII

-STATUTE-
      An adversary proceeding is governed by the rules of this Part
    VII. The following are adversary proceedings:
        (1) a proceeding to recover money or property, other than a
      proceeding to compel the debtor to deliver property to the
      trustee, or a proceeding under Sec. 554(b) or Sec. 725 of the
      Code, Rule 2017, or Rule 6002;
        (2) a proceeding to determine the validity, priority, or extent
      of a lien or other interest in property, other than a proceeding
      under Rule 4003(d);
        (3) a proceeding to obtain approval under Sec. 363(h) for the
      sale of both the interest of the estate and of a co-owner in
      property;
        (4) a proceeding to object to or revoke a discharge;
        (5) a proceeding to revoke an order of confirmation of a
      chapter 11, chapter 12, or chapter 13 plan;
        (6) a proceeding to determine the dischargeability of a debt;
        (7) a proceeding to obtain an injunction or other equitable
      relief, except when a chapter 9, chapter 11, chapter 12, or
      chapter 13 plan provides for the relief;
        (8) a proceeding to subordinate any allowed claim or interest,
      except when a chapter 9, chapter 11, chapter 12, or chapter 13
      plan provides for subordination;
        (9) a proceeding to obtain a declaratory judgment relating to
      any of the foregoing; or
        (10) a proceeding to determine a claim or cause of action
      removed under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1452.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      The rules in Part VII govern the procedural aspects of litigation
    involving the matters referred to in this Rule 7001. Under Rule
    9014 some of the Part VII rules also apply to contested matters.
      These Part VII rules are based on the premise that to the extent
    possible practice before the bankruptcy courts and the district
    courts should be the same. These rules either incorporate or are
    adaptations of most of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
    Although the Part VII rules of the former Bankruptcy Rules also
    relied heavily on the F.R.Civ.P., the former Part VII rules
    departed from the civil practice in two significant ways: a trial
    or pretrial conference had to be scheduled as soon as the adversary
    proceeding was filed and pleadings had to be filed within periods
    shorter than those established by the F.R.Civ.P. These departures
    from the civil practice have been eliminated.
      The content and numbering of these Part VII rules correlates to
    the content and numbering of the F.R.Civ.P. Most, but not all, of
    the F.R.Civ.P. have a comparable Part VII rule. When there is no
    Part VII rule with a number corresponding to a particular
    F.R.Civ.P., Parts V and IX of these rules must be consulted to
    determine if one of the rules in those parts deals with the
    subject. The list below indicates the F.R.Civ.P., or subdivision
    thereof, covered by a rule in either Part V or Part IX.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------


      Proceedings to which the rules in Part VII apply directly include
    those brought to avoid transfers by the debtor under Secs. 544,
    545, 547, 548 and 549 of the Code; subject to important exceptions,
    proceedings to recover money or property; proceedings on bonds
    under Rules 5008(d) and 9025; proceedings under Rule 4004 to
    determine whether a discharge in a chapter 7 or 11 case should be
    denied because of an objection grounded on Sec. 727 and proceedings
    in a chapter 7 or 13 case to revoke a discharge as provided in
    Secs. 727(d) or 1328(e); and proceedings initiated pursuant to Sec.
    523(c) of the Code to determine the dischargeability of a
    particular debt. Those proceedings were classified as adversary
    proceedings under former Bankruptcy Rule 701.
      Also included as adversary proceedings are proceedings to revoke
    an order of confirmation of a plan in a chapter 11 or 13 case as
    provided in Secs. 1144 and 1330, to subordinate under Sec. 510(c),
    other than as part of a plan, an allowed claim or interest, and to
    sell under Sec. 363(h) both the interest of the estate and a co-
    owner in property.
      Declaratory judgments with respect to the subject matter of the
    various adversary proceedings are also adversary proceedings.
      Any claim or cause of action removed to a bankruptcy court
    pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1478 is also an adversary proceeding.
      Unlike former Bankruptcy Rule 701, requests for relief from an
    automatic stay do not commence an adversary proceeding. Section
    362(e) of the Code and Rule 4001 establish an expedited schedule
    for judicial disposition of requests for relief from the automatic
    stay. The formalities of the adversary proceeding process and the
    time for serving pleadings are not well suited to the expedited
    schedule. The motion practice prescribed in Rule 4001 is best
    suited to such requests because the court has the flexibility to
    fix hearing dates and other deadlines appropriate to the particular
    situation.
      Clause (1) contains important exceptions. A person with an
    interest in property in the possession of the trustee or debtor in
    possession may seek to recover or reclaim that property under Sec.
    554(b) or Sec. 725 of the Code. Since many attempts to recover or
    reclaim property under these two sections do not generate disputes,
    application of the formalities of the Part VII Rules is not
    appropriate. Also excluded from adversary proceedings is litigation
    arising from an examination under Rule 2017 of a debtor's payments
    of money or transfers of property to an attorney representing the
    debtor in a case under the Code or an examination of a superseded
    administration under Rule 6002.
      Exemptions and objections thereto are governed by Rule 4003.
    Filing of proofs of claim and the allowances thereof are governed
    by Rules 3001-3005, and objections to claims are governed by Rule
    3007. When an objection to a claim is joined with a demand for
    relief of the kind specified in this Rule 7001, the matter becomes
    an adversary proceeding. See Rule 3007.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Another exception is added to clause (1). A trustee may proceed
    by motion to recover property from the debtor.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Clauses (5) and (8) are amended to include chapter 12 plans.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1999 AMENDMENT             
      This rule is amended to recognize that an adversary proceeding is
    not necessary to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that
    is provided for in a plan under circumstances in which substantive
    law permits the relief. Other amendments are stylistic.
      GAP Report on Rule 7001. No changes since publication, except for
    stylistic changes.

    Rule 7002. References to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure

-STATUTE-
      Whenever a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure applicable to
    adversary proceedings makes reference to another Federal Rule of
    Civil Procedure, the reference shall be read as a reference to the
    Federal Rule of Civil Procedure as modified in this Part VII.


-MISC1-

      Rules 5, 12, 13, 14, 25, 27, 30, 41 and 52 F.R.Civ.P. are made
    applicable to adversary proceedings by Part VII. Each of those
    rules contains a cross reference to another Federal Rule; however,
    the Part VII rule which incorporates the cross-referenced Federal
    Rule modifies the Federal Rule in some way. Under this Rule 7002
    the cross reference is to the Federal Rule as modified by Part VII.
    For example, Rule 5 F.R.Civ.P., which is made applicable to
    adversary proceedings by Rule 7005, contains a reference to Rule 4
    F.R.Civ.P. Under this Rule 7002, the cross reference is to Rule 4
    F.R.Civ.P. as modified by Rule 7004.
      Rules 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 19, 22, 23.2, 24-37, 41, 45, 49, 50, 52,
    55, 59, 60, 62 F.R.Civ.P. are made applicable to adversary
    proceedings by Part VII or generally to cases under the Code by
    Part IX. Each of those Federal Rules contains a cross reference to
    another Federal Rule which is not modified by the Part VII or Part
    IX rule which makes the cross-referenced Federal Rule applicable.
    Since the cross-referenced rule is not modified by a Part VII rule
    this Rule 7002 does not apply.

        (1) Upon an individual other than an infant or incompetent, by
      mailing a copy of the summons and complaint to the individual's
      dwelling house or usual place of abode or to the place where the
      individual regularly conducts a business or profession.
        (2) Upon an infant or an incompetent person, by mailing a copy
      of the summons and complaint to the person upon whom process is
      prescribed to be served by the law of the state in which service
      is made when an action is brought against such a defendant in the
      courts of general jurisdiction of that state. The summons and
      complaint in that case shall be addressed to the person required
      to be served at that person's dwelling house or usual place of
      abode or at the place where the person regularly conducts a
      business or profession.
        (3) Upon a domestic or foreign corporation or upon a
      partnership or other unincorporated association, by mailing a
      copy of the summons and complaint to the attention of an officer,
      a managing or general agent, or to any other agent authorized by
      appointment or by law to receive service of process and, if the
      agent is one authorized by statute to receive service and the
      statute so requires, by also mailing a copy to the defendant.
        (4) Upon the United States, by mailing a copy of the summons
      and complaint addressed to the civil process clerk at the office
      of the United States attorney for the district in which the
      action is brought and by mailing a copy of the summons and
      complaint to the Attorney General of the United States at
      Washington, District of Columbia, and in any action attacking the
      validity of an order of an officer or an agency of the United
      States not made a party, by also mailing a copy of the summons
      and complaint to that officer or agency. The court shall allow a
      reasonable time for service pursuant to this subdivision for the
      purpose of curing the failure to mail a copy of the summons and
      complaint to multiple officers, agencies, or corporations of the
      United States if the plaintiff has mailed a copy of the summons
      and complaint either to the civil process clerk at the office of
      the United States attorney or to the Attorney General of the
      United States.
        (5) Upon any officer or agency of the United States, by mailing
      a copy of the summons and complaint to the United States as
      prescribed in paragraph (4) of this subdivision and also to the
      officer or agency. If the agency is a corporation, the mailing
      shall be as prescribed in paragraph (3) of this subdivision of
      this rule. The court shall allow a reasonable time for service
      pursuant to this subdivision for the purpose of curing the
      failure to mail a copy of the summons and complaint to multiple
      officers, agencies, or corporations of the United States if the
      plaintiff has mailed a copy of the summons and complaint either
      to the civil process clerk at the office of the United States
      attorney or to the Attorney General of the United States. If the
      United States trustee is the trustee in the case and service is
      made upon the United States trustee solely as trustee, service
      may be made as prescribed in paragraph (10) of this subdivision
      of this rule.
        (6) Upon a state or municipal corporation or other governmental
      organization thereof subject to suit, by mailing a copy of the
      summons and complaint to the person or office upon whom process
      is prescribed to be served by the law of the state in which
      service is made when an action is brought against such a
      defendant in the courts of general jurisdiction of that state, or
      in the absence of the designation of any such person or office by
      state law, then to the chief executive officer thereof.
        (7) Upon a defendant of any class referred to in paragraph (1)
      or (3) of this subdivision of this rule, it is also sufficient if
      a copy of the summons and complaint is mailed to the entity upon
      whom service is prescribed to be served by any statute of the
      United States or by the law of the state in which service is made
      when an action is brought against such a defendant in the court
      of general jurisdiction of that state.
        (8) Upon any defendant, it is also sufficient if a copy of the
      summons and complaint is mailed to an agent of such defendant
      authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of
      process, at the agent's dwelling house or usual place of abode or
      at the place where the agent regularly carries on a business or
      profession and, if the authorization so requires, by mailing also
      a copy of the summons and complaint to the defendant as provided
      in this subdivision.
        (9) Upon the debtor, after a petition has been filed by or
      served upon the debtor and until the case is dismissed or closed,
      by mailing a copy of the summons and complaint to the debtor at
      the address shown in the petition or to such other address as the
      debtor may designate in a filed writing.
        (10) Upon the United States trustee, when the United States
      trustee is the trustee in the case and service is made upon the
      United States trustee solely as trustee, by mailing a copy of the
      summons and complaint to an office of the United States trustee
      or another place designated by the United States trustee in the
      district where the case under the Code is pending.

      (c) Service by Publication. If a party to an adversary proceeding
    to determine or protect rights in property in the custody of the
    court cannot be served as provided in Rule 4(e)-(j) F.R.Civ.P. or
    subdivision (b) of this rule, the court may order the summons and
    complaint to be served by mailing copies thereof by first class
    mail, postage prepaid, to the party's last known address, and by at
    least one publication in such manner and form as the court may
    direct.
      (d) Nationwide Service of Process. The summons and complaint and
    all other process except a subpoena may be served anywhere in the
    United States.
      (e) Summons: Time Limit for Service Within the United States.
    Service made under Rule 4(e), (g), (h)(1), (i), or (j)(2)
    F.R.Civ.P. shall be by delivery of the summons and complaint within
    14 days after the summons is issued. If service is by any
    authorized form of mail, the summons and complaint shall be
    deposited in the mail within 14 days after the summons is issued.
    If a summons is not timely delivered or mailed, another summons
    shall be issued and served. This subdivision does not apply to
    service in a foreign country.
      (f) Personal Jurisdiction. If the exercise of jurisdiction is
    consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,
    serving a summons or filing a waiver of service in accordance with
    this rule or the subdivisions of Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P. made applicable
    by these rules is effective to establish personal jurisdiction over
    the person of any defendant with respect to a case under the Code
    or a civil proceeding arising under the Code, or arising in or
    related to a case under the Code.
      (g) Service on Debtor's Attorney. If the debtor is represented by
    an attorney, whenever service is made upon the debtor under this
    Rule, service shall also be made upon the debtor's attorney by any
    means authorized under Rule 5(b) F.R.Civ.P.
      (h) Service of Process on an Insured Depository Institution.
    Service on an insured depository institution (as defined in section
    3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) in a contested matter or
    adversary proceeding shall be made by certified mail addressed to
    an officer of the institution unless - 
        (1) the institution has appeared by its attorney, in which case
      the attorney shall be served by first class mail;
        (2) the court orders otherwise after service upon the
      institution by certified mail of notice of an application to
      permit service on the institution by first class mail sent to an
      officer of the institution designated by the institution; or
        (3) the institution has waived in writing its entitlement to
      service by certified mail by designating an officer to receive
      service.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Subdivision (a) of the rule, by incorporation of Rule 4(a), (b),
    (d), (e) and (g)-(i) F.R.Civ.P., governs the mechanics of issuance
    of a summons and its form, the manner of service on parties and
    their representatives, and service in foreign countries.
      Subdivision (b), which is the same as former Rule 704(c),
    authorizes service of process by first class mail postage prepaid.
    This rule retains the modes of service contained in former
    Bankruptcy Rule 704. The former practice, in effect since 1976, has
    proven satisfactory.
      Subdivision (c) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 704(d)(2).
      Subdivision (d). Nationwide service of process is authorized by
    subdivision (d).
      Subdivision (e) authorizes service by delivery on individuals and
    corporations in foreign countries if the party to be served is the
    debtor or any person required to perform the duties of the debtor
    and certain other persons, the adversary proceeding involves
    property in the custody of the bankruptcy court, or if federal or
    state law authorizes such service in a foreign country.
      Subdivision (f). The requirement of former Bankruptcy Rule 704
    that the summons be served within 10 days is carried over into
    these rules by subdivision (f).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to make Rule 4(j) F.R.Civ.P.
    applicable to service of the summons. If service is not completed
    within 120 days of the filing of the complaint, the complaint may
    be dismissed.
      Technical amendments are made to subdivisions (a), (b), (e), and
    (f) to conform to recent amendments to Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      The United States trustee may serve as trustee in a case pursuant
    to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 586(a)(2) and Secs. 701(a)(2), 1202(a), and
    1302(a) of the Code. This rule is amended to avoid the necessity of
    mailing copies of a summons and complaint or other pleadings to the
    Attorney General and to the United States attorney when service on
    the United States trustee is required only because the United
    States trustee is acting as a case trustee. For example, a
    proceeding commenced by a creditor to dismiss a case for
    unreasonable delay under Sec. 707(a) is governed by Rule 9014 which
    requires service on the trustee pursuant to the requirements of
    Rule 7004 for the service of a summons and complaint. The Attorney
    General and the United States attorney would have no interest in
    receiving a copy of the motion to dismiss. Mailing to the office of
    the United States trustee when acting as the case trustee is
    sufficient in such cases.
      The words "with the court" in subdivision (b)(9) are deleted as
    unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).
      The new paragraph (10) of subdivision (b) does not affect
    requirements for service of process on the United States trustee
    when sued or otherwise a party to a litigation unrelated to its
    capacity as a trustee. If a proceeding is commenced against the
    United States trustee which is unrelated to the United States
    trustee's role as trustee, the requirements of paragraph (5) of
    subdivision (b) of this rule would apply.
      Subdivision (g) is added in anticipation of substantial amendment
    to, and restructuring of subdivisions of, Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P. Any
    amendment to Rule 4 will not affect service in bankruptcy cases and
    proceedings until further amendment to the Bankruptcy Rules. On
    January 1, 1990, Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P. read as follows:

                             RULE 4 F.R.CIV.P.                         

                                  PROCESS                              
      (a) Summons: Issuance. Upon the filing of the complaint the clerk
    shall forthwith issue a summons and deliver the summons to the
    plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney, who shall be responsible for
    prompt service of the summons and a copy of the complaint. Upon
    request of the plaintiff separate or additional summons shall issue
    against any defendants.
      (b) Same: Form. The summons shall be signed by the clerk, be
    under the seal of the court, contain the name of the court and the
    names of the parties, be directed to the defendant, state the name
    and address of the plaintiff's attorney, if any, otherwise the
    plaintiff's address, and the time within which these rules require
    the defendant to appear and defend, and shall notify the defendant
    that in case of the defendant's failure to do so judgment by
    default will be rendered against the defendant for the relief
    demanded in the complaint. When, under Rule 4(e), service is made
    pursuant to a statute or rule of court of a state, the summons, or
    notice, or order in lieu of summons shall correspond as nearly as
    may be to that required by the statute or rule.
      (c) Service.
        (1) [Not applicable.]
        (2)(A) [Not applicable.]
        (B) [Not applicable.]
        (C) A summons and complaint may be served upon a defendant of
      any class referred to in paragraph (1) or (3) of subdivision (d)
      of this rule - 
          (i) pursuant to the law of the State in which the district
        court is held for the service of summons or other like process
        upon such defendant in an action brought in the courts of
        general jurisdiction of that State, or
          (ii) [Not applicable.]
        (D) [Not applicable.]
        (E) [Not applicable.]
        (3) [Not applicable.]
      (d) Summons and Complaint: Person To Be Served. The summons and
    complaint shall be served together. The plaintiff shall furnish the
    person making service with such copies as are necessary. Service
    shall be made as follows:
        (1) Upon an individual other than an infant or an incompetent
      person, by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint
      to the individual personally or by leaving copies thereof at the
      individual's dwelling house or usual place of abode with some
      person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein or by
      delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to an agent
      authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of
      process.
        (2) Upon an infant or an incompetent person, by serving the
      summons and complaint in the manner prescribed by the law of the
      state in which the service is made for the service of summons or
      other like process upon any such defendant in an action brought
      in the courts of general jurisdiction of that state.
        (3) Upon a domestic or foreign corporation or upon a
      partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject
      to suit under a common name, by delivering a copy of the summons
      and of the complaint to an officer, a managing or general agent,
      or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to
      receive service of process and, if the agent is one authorized by
      statute to receive service and the statute so requires, by also
      mailing a copy to the defendant.
        (4) Upon the United States, by delivering a copy of the summons
      and of the complaint to the United States attorney for the
      district in which the action is brought or to an assistant United
      States attorney or clerical employee designated by the United
      States attorney in a writing filed with the clerk of the court
      and by sending a copy of the summons and of the complaint by
      registered or certified mail to the Attorney General of the
      United States at Washington, District of Columbia, and in any
      action attacking the validity of an order of an officer or agency
      of the United States not made a party, by also sending a copy of
      the summons and of the complaint by registered or certified mail
      to such officer or agency.
        (5) Upon an officer or agency of the United States, by serving
      the United States and by sending a copy of the summons and of the
      complaint by registered or certified mail to such officer or
      agency. If the agency is a corporation the copy shall be
      delivered as provided in paragraph (3) of this subdivision of
      this rule.
        (6) Upon a state or municipal corporation or other governmental
      organization thereof subject to suit, by delivering a copy of the
      summons and of the complaint to the chief executive officer
      thereof or by serving the summons and complaint in the manner
      prescribed by the law of that state for the service of summons or
      other like process upon any such defendant.
      (e) Summons: Service Upon Party Not Inhabitant of or Found Within
    State. Whenever a statute of the United States or an order of court
    thereunder provides for service of a summons, or of a notice, or of
    an order in lieu of summons upon a party not an inhabitant of or
    found within the state in which the district court is held, service
    may be made under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed by
    the statute or order, or, if there is no provision therein
    prescribing the manner of service, in a manner stated in this rule.
    Whenever a statute or rule of court of the state in which the
    district court is held provides (1) for service of a summons, or of
    a notice, or of an order in lieu of summons upon a party not an
    inhabitant of or found within the state, or (2) for service upon or
    notice to such a party to appear and respond or defend in an action
    by reason of the attachment or garnishment or similar seizure of
    the party's property located within the state, service may in
    either case be made under the circumstances and in the manner
    prescribed in the statute or rule.
      (f) [Not applicable.]
      (g) Return. The person serving the process shall make proof of
    service thereof to the court promptly and in any event within the
    time during which the person served must respond to the process. If
    service is made by a person other than a United States marshal or
    deputy United States marshal, such person shall make affidavit
    thereof. If service is made under subdivision (c)(2)(C)(ii) of this
    rule, return shall be made by the sender's filing with the court
    the acknowledgment received pursuant to such subdivision. Failure
    to make proof of service does not affect the validity of the
    service.
      (h) Amendment. At any time in its discretion and upon such terms
    as it deems just, the court may allow any process or proof of
    service thereof to be amended, unless it clearly appears that
    material prejudice would result to the substantial rights of the
    party against whom the process issued.
      (i) Alternative Provisions for Service in a Foreign Country.
        (1) Manner. When the federal or state law referred to in
      subdivision (e) of this rule authorizes service upon a party not
      an inhabitant of or found within the state in which the district
      court is held, and service is to be effected upon the party in a
      foreign country, it is also sufficient if service of the summons
      and complaint is made: (A) in the manner prescribed by the law of
      the foreign country for service in that country in an action in
      any of its courts of general jurisdiction; or (B) as directed by
      the foreign authority in response to a letter rogatory, when
      service in either case is reasonably calculated to give actual
      notice; or (C) upon an individual, by delivery to the individual
      personally, and upon a corporation or partnership or association,
      by delivery to an officer, a managing or general agent; or (D) by
      any form of mail, requiring a signed receipt, to be addressed and
      dispatched by the clerk of the court to the party to be served;
      or (E) as directed by order of the court. Service under (C) or
      (E) above may be made by any person who is not a party and is not
      less than 18 years of age or who is designated by order of the
      district court or by the foreign court. On request, the clerk
      shall deliver the summons to the plaintiff for transmission to
      the person or the foreign court or officer who will make the
      service.
        (2) Return. Proof of service may be made as prescribed by
      subdivision (g) of this rule, or by the law of the foreign
      country, or by order of the court. When service is made pursuant
      to subparagraph (1)(D) of this subdivision, proof of service
      shall include a receipt signed by the addressee or other evidence
      of delivery to the addressee satisfactory to the court.
      (j) Summons: Time Limit for Service. If a service of the summons
    and complaint is not made upon a defendant within 120 days after
    the filing of the complaint and the party on whose behalf such
    service was required cannot show good cause why such service was
    not made within that period, the action shall be dismissed as to
    that defendant without prejudice upon the court's own initiative
    with notice to such party or upon motion. This subdivision shall
    not apply to service in a foreign country pursuant to subdivision
    (i) of this rule.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1996 AMENDMENT       
      The purpose of these amendments is to conform the rule to the
    1993 revisions of Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P. and to make stylistic
    improvements. Rule 7004, as amended, continues to provide for
    service by first class mail as an alternative to the methods of
    personal service provided in Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P., except as provided
    in the new subdivision (h).
      Rule 4(d)(2) F.R.Civ.P. provides a procedure by which the
    plaintiff may request by first class mail that the defendant waive
    service of the summons. This procedure is not applicable in
    adversary proceedings because it is not necessary in view of the
    availability of service by mail pursuant to Rule 7004(b). However,
    if a written waiver of service of a summons is made in an adversary
    proceeding, Rule 4(d)(1) F.R.Civ.P. applies so that the defendant
    does not thereby waive any objection to the venue or the
    jurisdiction of the court over the person of the defendant.
      Subdivisions (b)(4) and (b)(5) are amended to conform to the 1993
    amendments to Rule 4(i)(3) F.R.Civ.P., which protect the plaintiff
    from the hazard of losing a substantive right because of failure to
    comply with the requirements of multiple service when the United
    States or an officer, agency, or corporation of the United States
    is a defendant. These subdivisions also are amended to require that
    the summons and complaint be addressed to the civil process clerk
    at the office of the United States attorney.
      Subdivision (e), which has governed service in a foreign country,
    is abrogated and Rule 4(f) and (h)(2) F.R.Civ.P., as substantially
    revised in 1993, are made applicable in adversary proceedings.
      The new subdivision (f) is consistent with the 1993 amendments to
    F.R.Civ.P. 4(k)(2). It clarifies that service or filing a waiver of
    service in accordance with this rule or the applicable subdivisions
    of F.R.Civ.P. 4 is sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction
    over the defendant. See the committee note to the 1993 amendments
    to Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P.
      Subdivision (g) is abrogated. This subdivision was promulgated in
    1991 so that anticipated revisions to Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P. would not
    affect service of process in adversary proceedings until further
    amendment to Rule 7004.
      Subdivision (h) and the first phrase of subdivision (b) were
    added by Sec. 114 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, Pub. L. No.
    103-394, 108 Stat. 4106.
      GAP Report on Rule 7004. After publication of the proposed
    amendments, Rule 7004(b) was amended and Rule 7004(h) was added by
    the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 to provide for service by
    certified mail on an insured depository institution. The above
    draft includes those statutory amendments (without underlining new
    language or striking former language). No other changes have been
    made since publication, except for stylistic changes.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1999 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (e) is amended so that the ten-day time limit for
    service of a summons does not apply if the summons is served in a
    foreign country.
      GAP Report on Rule 7004. No changes since publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             
      This amendment specifically authorizes the clerk to issue a
    summons electronically. In some bankruptcy cases the trustee or
    debtor in possession may commence hundreds of adversary proceedings
    simultaneously, and permitting the electronic signing and sealing
    of the summonses for those proceedings increases the efficiency of
    the clerk's office without any negative impact on any party. The
    rule only authorizes electronic issuance of the summons. It does
    not address the service requirements for the summons. Those
    requirements are set out elsewhere in Rule 7004, and nothing in
    Rule 7004(a)(2) should be construed as authorizing electronic
    service of a summons.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made
    after publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             
      Under current Rule 7004, an entity may serve a summons and
    complaint upon the debtor by personal service or by mail. If the
    entity chooses to serve the debtor by mail, it must also serve a
    copy of the summons and complaint on the debtor's attorney by mail.
    If the entity effects personal service on the debtor, there is no
    requirement that the debtor's attorney also be served.
      Subdivision (b)(9). The rule is amended to delete the reference
    in subdivision (b)(9) to the debtor's address as set forth in the
    statement of financial affairs. In 1991, the Official Form of the
    statement of financial affairs was revised and no longer includes a
    question regarding the debtor's current residence. Since that time,
    Official Form 1, the petition, has required the debtor to list both
    the debtor's residence and mailing address. Therefore, the
    subdivision is amended to delete the statement of financial affairs
    as a document that might contain an address at which the debtor can
    be served.
      Subdivision (g). The rule is amended to require service on the
    debtor's attorney whenever the debtor is served with a summons and
    complaint. The amendment makes this change by deleting that portion
    of Rule 7004(b)(9) that requires service on the debtor's attorney
    when the debtor is served by mail, and relocates the obligation to
    serve the debtor's attorney into new subdivision (g). Service on
    the debtor's attorney is not limited to mail service, but may be
    accomplished by any means permitted under Rule 5(b) F.R.Civ.P.
      Changes Made After Publication. The Committee Note was amended to
    add the final [second] paragraph of the Note. The new paragraph
    describes the reason for the deletion of the reference in the rule
    to the statement of affairs as a source for the debtor's address.
    This was a secondary reason for amending the rule, and even in the
    absence of public comment on the proposed amendment, the Advisory
    Committee believes that the additional explanation in the Committee
    Note is appropriate.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to
    substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout
    the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 15-day periods become 14-day periods

-STATUTE-
      (a) Required Disclosure. Any corporation that is a party to an
    adversary proceeding, other than the debtor or a governmental unit,
    shall file two copies of a statement that identifies any
    corporation, other than a governmental unit, that directly or
    indirectly owns 10% or more of any class of the corporation's
    equity interests, or states that there are no entities to report
    under this subdivision.
      (b) Time for Filing. A party shall file the statement required
    under Rule 7007.1(a) with its first appearance, pleading, motion,
    response, or other request addressed to the court. A party shall
    file a supplemental statement promptly upon any change in
    circumstances that this rule requires the party to identify or
    disclose.

-MISC1-
                      COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003                  
      This rule is derived from Rule 26.1 of the Federal Rules of
    Appellate Procedure. The information that parties shall supply will
    support properly informed disqualification decisions in situations
    that call for automatic disqualification under Canon 3C(1)(c) of
    the Code of Conduct for United States Judges. This rule does not
    cover all of the circumstances that may call for disqualification
    under the subjective financial interest standard of Canon 3C, and
    does not deal at all with other circumstances that may call for
    disqualification. Nevertheless, the required disclosures are
    calculated to reach the majority of circumstances that are likely
    to call for disqualification under Canon 3C(1)(c).
      The rule directs nongovernmental corporate parties to list those
    corporations that hold significant ownership interests in them.
    This includes listing membership interests in limited liability
    companies and similar entities that fall under the definition of a
    corporation in Bankruptcy Code Sec. 101.
      Under subdivision (b), parties must file the statement with the
    first document that they file in any adversary proceeding. The rule
    also requires parties and other persons to file supplemental
    statements promptly whenever changed circumstances require
    disclosure of new or additional information.
      The rule does not prohibit the adoption of local rules requiring
    disclosures beyond those called for in Rule 7007.1.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes since
    publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to clarify that a party must file a corporate
    ownership statement with its initial paper filed with the court in
    an adversary proceeding. The party's initial filing may be a
    document that is not a "pleading" as defined in Rule 7 F. R. Civ.
    P., which is made applicable in adversary proceedings by Rule 7007.
    The amendment also brings Rule 7007.1 more closely in line with
    Rule 7.1 F. R. Civ. P.
      Changes After Publication. No changes were made after
    publication.

    and chapter of the case under the Code to which the adversary
    proceeding relates and to the district and division where the case

    bankruptcy judge, the complaint, counterclaim, cross-claim, or
    third-party complaint shall contain a statement that the proceeding
    is core or non-core and, if non-core, that the pleader does or does
    not consent to entry of final orders or judgment by the bankruptcy
    judge.
      (b) Attorney's Fees. A request for an award of attorney's fees

-MISC1-
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Proceedings before a bankruptcy judge are either core or non-
    core. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 157. A bankruptcy judge may enter a final
    order or judgment in a core proceeding. In a non-core proceeding,
    absent consent of the parties, the bankruptcy judge may not enter a
    final order or judgment but may only submit proposed findings of
    fact and conclusions of law to the district judge who will enter
    the final order or judgment. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 157(c)(1). The
    amendment to subdivision (a) of this rule requires an allegation as
    to whether a proceeding is core or non-core. A party who alleges
    that the proceeding is non-core shall state whether the party does
    or does not consent to the entry of a final order or judgment by
    the bankruptcy judge. Failure to include the statement of consent
    does not constitute consent. Only express consent in the pleadings
    or otherwise is effective to authorize entry of a final order or
    judgment by the bankruptcy judge in a non-core proceeding.
    Amendments to Rule 7012 require that the defendant admit or deny
    the allegation as to whether the proceeding is core or non-core.

      (a) When Presented. If a complaint is duly served, the defendant
    shall serve an answer within 30 days after the issuance of the
    summons, except when a different time is prescribed by the court.
    The court shall prescribe the time for service of the answer when
    service of a complaint is made by publication or upon a party in a
    foreign country. A party served with a pleading stating a cross-
    claim shall serve an answer thereto within 21 days after service.
    The plaintiff shall serve a reply to a counterclaim in the answer
    within 21 days after service of the answer or, if a reply is
    ordered by the court, within 21 days after service of the order,
    unless the order otherwise directs. The United States or an officer
    or agency thereof shall serve an answer to a complaint within 35
    days after the issuance of the summons, and shall serve an answer
    to a cross-claim, or a reply to a counterclaim, within 35 days
    after service upon the United States attorney of the pleading in
    which the claim is asserted. The service of a motion permitted
    under this rule alters these periods of time as follows, unless a
    different time is fixed by order of the court: (1) if the court
    denies the motion or postpones its disposition until the trial on
    the merits, the responsive pleading shall be served within 14 days
    after notice of the court's action; (2) if the court grants a
    motion for a more definite statement, the responsive pleading shall
    be served within 14 days after the service of a more definite
    statement.
      (b) Applicability of Rule 12(b)-(i) F.R.Civ.P. Rule 12(b)-(i)
    F.R.Civ.P. applies in adversary proceedings. A responsive pleading
    shall admit or deny an allegation that the proceeding is core or
    non-core. If the response is that the proceeding is non-core, it
    shall include a statement that the party does or does not consent
    to entry of final orders or judgment by the bankruptcy judge. In
    non-core proceedings final orders and judgments shall not be
    entered on the bankruptcy judge's order except with the express
    consent of the parties.

      Subdivision (a) continues the practice of former Bankruptcy Rule
    712(a) by requiring that the answer to a complaint be filed within
    30 days after the issuance of the summons. Under Rule 7004(f), the
    summons must be served within 10 days of issuance. The other
    pleading periods in adversary proceedings are the same as those in
    civil actions before the district courts, except that the United
    States is allowed 35 rather than 60 days to respond.
      Rule 12(b)(7) and (h)(2) F.R.Civ.P. refers to Rule 19 F.R.Civ.P.

-STATUTE-
      Rule 19 F.R.Civ.P. applies in adversary proceedings, except that
    (1) if an entity joined as a party raises the defense that the
    court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter and the defense is
    sustained, the court shall dismiss such entity from the adversary
    proceedings and (2) if an entity joined as a party properly and
    timely raises the defense of improper venue, the court shall
    determine, as provided in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1412, whether that part of
    the proceeding involving the joined party shall be transferred to
    another district, or whether the entire adversary proceeding shall
    be transferred to another district.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule addresses a situation different from that encountered
    by the district court when its jurisdiction is based on diversity
    of citizenship under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332. Joining of a party whose
    citizenship is the same as that of an adversary destroys the
    district court's jurisdiction over the entire civil action but
    under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1471 the attempted joinder of such a person
    would not affect the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction over the
    original adversary proceeding.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The rule is amended to delete the reference to retention of the
    adversary proceeding if venue is improper. See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1412.

-STATUTE-
      Rule 41 F.R.Civ.P. applies in adversary proceedings, except that
    a complaint objecting to the debtor's discharge shall not be
    dismissed at the plaintiff's instance without notice to the
    trustee, the United States trustee, and such other persons as the
    court may direct, and only on order of the court containing terms
    and conditions which the court deems proper.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Dismissal of a complaint objecting to a discharge raises special
    concerns because the plaintiff may have been induced to dismiss by
    an advantage given or promised by the debtor or someone acting in
    his interest. Some courts by local rule or order have required the
    debtor and his attorney or the plaintiff to file an affidavit that
    nothing has been promised to the plaintiff in consideration of the
    withdrawal of the objection. By specifically authorizing the court
    to impose conditions in the order of dismissal this rule permits
    the continuation of this salutary practice.
      Rule 41 F.R.Civ.P. refers to Rule 19 F.R.Civ.P. Pursuant to Rule
    7002 that reference is to Rule 19 F.R.Civ.P. as incorporated and
    modified by Rule 7019.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      The United States trustee has standing to object to the debtor's
    discharge pursuant to Sec. 727(c) and may have refrained from
    commencing an adversary proceeding objecting to discharge within
    the time limits provided in Rule 4004 only because another party
    commenced such a proceeding. The United States trustee may oppose
    dismissal of the original proceeding.
      The rule is also amended to clarify that the court may direct
    that other persons receive notice of a plaintiff's motion to
    dismiss a complaint objecting to discharge.

-STATUTE-
      Rule 52 F.R.Civ.P. applies in adversary proceedings, except that
    any motion under subdivision (b) of that rule for amended or
    additional findings shall be filed no later than 14 days after
    entry of judgment. In these proceedings, the reference in Rule 52
    F.R.Civ.P. to the entry of judgment under Rule 58 F.R.Civ.P. shall
    be read as a reference to the entry of a judgment or order under
    Rule 5003(a).

      Rule 52(a) F.R.Civ.P. refers to Rule 12 F.R.Civ.P. Pursuant to
    Rule 7002 this reference is to Rule 12 F.R.Civ.P. as incorporated
    and modified by Rule 7012.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended by limiting the time for filing post judgment
    motions for amended or additional findings. In 2009, Rule 52 F. R.
    Civ. P. was amended to extend the deadline for filing those post
    judgment motions to no later than 28 days after entry of the
    judgment. That deadline corresponds to the 30-day deadline for
    filing a notice of appeal in a civil case under Rule 4(a)(1)(A) F.
    R. App. P. In a bankruptcy case, the deadline for filing a notice
    of appeal is 14 days. Therefore, the 28-day deadline for filing a
    motion for amended or additional findings would effectively
    override the notice of appeal deadline under Rule 8002(a) but for
    this amendment.
      The rule is amended to clarify that the reference in Rule 52 F.
    R. Civ. P. to Rule 58 F. R. Civ. P. and its provisions is construed
    as a reference to the entry of a judgment or order under Rule
    5003(a).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to include as additional exceptions to Rule
    62(a) an order granting relief from the automatic stay of actions
    against codebtors provided by Sec. 1201 of the Code, the sale or
    lease of property of the estate under Sec. 363, and the assumption
    or assignment of an executory contract under Sec. 365.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1999 AMENDMENT             
      The additional exceptions to Rule 62(a) consist of orders that
    are issued in contested matters. These exceptions are deleted from
    this rule because of the amendment to Rule 9014 that renders this
    rule inapplicable in contested matters unless the court orders
    otherwise. See also the amendments to Rules 3020, 3021, 4001, 6004,

    for a period of ten days unless the court otherwise directs.

    PART VIII - APPEALS TO DISTRICT COURT OR BANKRUPTCY APPELLATE PANEL

-HEAD-
    Rule 8001. Manner of Taking Appeal; Voluntary Dismissal;
      Certification to Court of Appeals

-STATUTE-
      (a) Appeal as of Right; How Taken. An appeal from a judgment,
    order, or decree of a bankruptcy judge to a district court or
    bankruptcy appellate panel as permitted by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(a)(1)
    or (a)(2) shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the
    clerk within the time allowed by Rule 8002. An appellant's failure
    to take any step other than timely filing a notice of appeal does
    not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for such
    action as the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel deems
    appropriate, which may include dismissal of the appeal. The notice
    of appeal shall (1) conform substantially to the appropriate
    Official Form, (2) contain the names of all parties to the
    judgment, order, or decree appealed from and the names, addresses,
    and telephone numbers of their respective attorneys, and (3) be
    accompanied by the prescribed fee. Each appellant shall file a
    sufficient number of copies of the notice of appeal to enable the
    clerk to comply promptly with Rule 8004.
      (b) Appeal by Leave; How Taken. An appeal from an interlocutory
    judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy judge as permitted by 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 158(a)(3) shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal,
    as prescribed in subdivision (a) of this rule, accompanied by a
    motion for leave to appeal prepared in accordance with Rule 8003
    and with proof of service in accordance with Rule 8008.
      (c) Voluntary Dismissal.
        (1) Before Docketing. If an appeal has not been docketed, the
      appeal may be dismissed by the bankruptcy judge on the filing of
      a stipulation for dismissal signed by all the parties, or on
      motion and notice by the appellant.
        (2) After Docketing. If an appeal has been docketed and the
      parties to the appeal sign and file with the clerk of the
      district court or the clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel an
      agreement that the appeal be dismissed and pay any court costs or
      fees that may be due, the clerk of the district court or the
      clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel shall enter an order
      dismissing the appeal. An appeal may also be dismissed on motion
      of the appellant on terms and conditions fixed by the district
      court or bankruptcy appellate panel.

      [(d) Effect of Taking a Direct Appeal to the Court of Appeals]
    (Abrogated Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987)
      (e) Election To Have Appeal Heard by District Court Instead of
    Bankruptcy Appellate Panel; Withdrawal of Election.
        (1) Separate Writing for Election. An election to have an
      appeal heard by the district court under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(c)(1)
      may be made only by a statement of election contained in a
      separate writing filed within the time prescribed by 28 U.S.C.
      Sec. 158(c)(1).
        (2) Withdrawal of Election. A request to withdraw the election
      may be filed only by written stipulation of all the parties to
      the appeal or their attorneys of record. Upon such a stipulation,
      the district court may either transfer the appeal to the
      bankruptcy appellate panel or retain the appeal in the district
      court.

      (f) Certification for Direct Appeal to Court of Appeals.
        (1) Timely Appeal Required. A certification of a judgment,
      order, or decree of a bankruptcy court to a court of appeals
      under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(d)(2) shall not be effective until a
      timely appeal has been taken in the manner required by
      subdivisions (a) or (b) of this rule and the notice of appeal has
      become effective under Rule 8002.
        (2) Court Where Certification Made and Filed. A certification
      that a circumstance specified in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(d)(2)(A)(i)-
      (iii) exists shall be filed in the court in which a matter is
      pending for purposes of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(d)(2) and this rule. A
      matter is pending in a bankruptcy court until the docketing, in
      accordance with Rule 8007(b), of an appeal taken under 28 U.S.C.
      Sec. 158(a)(1) or (2), or the grant of leave to appeal under 28
      U.S.C. Sec. 158(a)(3). A matter is pending in a district court or
      bankruptcy appellate panel after the docketing, in accordance
      with Rule 8007(b), of an appeal taken under 28 U.S.C. Sec.
      158(a)(1) or (2), or the grant of leave to appeal under 28 U.S.C.
      Sec. 158(a)(3).
          (A) Certification by Court on Request or Court's Own
        Initiative.
            (i) Before Docketing or Grant of Leave to Appeal. Only a
          bankruptcy court may make a certification on request or on
          its own initiative while the matter is pending in the
          bankruptcy court.
            (ii) After Docketing or Grant of Leave to Appeal. Only the
          district court or bankruptcy appellate panel involved may
          make a certification on request of the parties or on its own
          initiative while the matter is pending in the district court
          or bankruptcy appellate panel.

          (B) Certification by All Appellants and Appellees Acting
        Jointly. A certification by all the appellants and appellees,
        if any, acting jointly may be made by filing the appropriate
        Official Form with the clerk of the court in which the matter
        is pending. The certification may be accompanied by a short
        statement of the basis for the certification, which may include
        the information listed in subdivision (f)(3)(C) of this rule.

        (3) Request for Certification; Filing; Service; Contents.
          (A) A request for certification shall be filed, within the
        time specified by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(d)(2), with the clerk of
        the court in which the matter is pending.
          (B) Notice of the filing of a request for certification shall
        be served in the manner required for service of a notice of
        appeal under Rule 8004.
          (C) A request for certification shall include the following:
            (i) the facts necessary to understand the question
          presented;
            (ii)the question itself;
            (iii) the relief sought;
            (iv) the reasons why the appeal should be allowed and is
          authorized by statute or rule, including why a circumstance
          specified in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(d)(2)(A)(i)-(iii) exists; and
            (v) an attached copy of the judgment, order, or decree
          complained of and any related opinion or memorandum.

          (D) A party may file a response to a request for
        certification or a cross request within 14 days after the
        notice of the request is served, or another time fixed by the
        court.
          (E) Rule 9014 does not govern a request, cross request, or
        any response. The matter shall be submitted without oral
        argument unless the court otherwise directs.
          (F) A certification of an appeal under 28 U.S.C. Sec.
        158(d)(2) shall be made in a separate document served on the
        parties.

        (4) Certification on Court's Own Initiative.
          (A) A certification of an appeal on the court's own
        initiative under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(d)(2) shall be made in a
        separate document served on the parties in the manner required
        for service of a notice of appeal under Rule 8004. The
        certification shall be accompanied by an opinion or memorandum
        that contains the information required by subdivision
        (f)(3)(C)(i)-(iv) of this rule.
          (B) A party may file a supplementary short statement of the
        basis for certification within 14 days after the certification.

        (5) Duties of Parties After Certification. A petition for
      permission to appeal in accordance with F.R.App.P. 5 shall be
      filed no later than 30 days after a certification has become
      effective as provided in subdivision (f)(1).

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      These rules in Part VIII apply only to appeals to the district
    courts or bankruptcy appellate panels. Subsequent appeals to the
    courts of appeals, or direct appeals by agreement of the parties
    under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1293(b), are governed by the Federal Rules of
    Appellate Procedure.
      Subdivisions (a) and (b) require that a notice of appeal be filed
    whenever a litigant seeks to secure appellate review by the
    district court or bankruptcy appellate panel. An appeal from an
    interlocutory order which will be heard only if leave is granted
    under 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1334(b) or 1482(b) is taken by filing a
    notice of appeal accompanied by a motion for leave to appeal which
    complies with the requirements set forth in Rule 8003. Rule 8003
    also governs other aspects of interlocutory appeals.
      Subdivision (c) is an adaptation of Rule 42 F.R.App.P.
      Subdivision (d) deals with the situation in which an appellant
    perfects an appeal to the district court or a bankruptcy appellate
    panel and also a direct appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1293(b)
    to the court of appeals. This subdivision provides that once the
    appeal to the court of appeals is taken, a notice of appeal to the
    district court or bankruptcy appellate panel shall be dismissed
    and, if the first appeal is to the district court or bankruptcy
    appellate panel, the first appeal shall be dismissed. Paragraph (3)
    gives an appellant or cross appellant an opportunity to file an
    appeal to the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel if the
    court of appeals dismisses the direct appeal because the judgment,
    order, or decree appealed from is not final. Since the court of
    appeals has determined the judgment, order, or decree is not final,
    the new appeal is an appeal for which leave is necessary.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivisions (a) and (b) are amended to conform to the 1984
    amendments.
      Subdivision (d) is abrogated because there is no direct appeal to
    the court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158, as enacted by the
    1984 amendments.
      Subdivision (e) is new. Section 158(b)(1) of title 28 authorizes
    the circuit councils to establish bankruptcy appellate panels.
    Appeals may not be heard by these panels unless the district court
    authorizes the referral and all parties to the appeal consent. This
    rule requires that the parties consent to such an appeal; however,
    the method of consenting to an appeal may be the subject of a rule
    promulgated by a circuit council under Rule 8018.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Reference to the Official Form number is deleted in anticipation
    of future revision and renumbering of the Official Forms.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to conform to the Bankruptcy Reform Act of
    1994 which amended 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158. As amended, a party may -
    without obtaining leave of the court - appeal from an interlocutory
    order or decree of the bankruptcy court issued under Sec. 1121(d)
    of the Code increasing or reducing the time periods referred to in
    Sec. 1121.
      Subdivision (e) is amended to provide the procedure for electing
    under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(c)(1) to have an appeal heard by the
    district court instead of the bankruptcy appellate panel service.
    This subdivision is applicable only if a bankruptcy appellate panel
    service is authorized under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(b) to hear the
    appeal.
      GAP Report on Rule 8001. The heading of subdivision (e) is
    amended to clarify that it applies to the election to have an
    appeal heard by the district court instead of the BAP. The final
    paragraph of the Committee Note is revised to clarify that
    subdivision (e) is applicable only if a BAP is authorized to hear
    the appeal.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (e) is amended by redesignating the subdivision as
    (e)(1) and adding new subdivision (e)(2). Subdivision (e)(2)
    explicitly recognizes the district court's authority to transfer an
    appeal to the bankruptcy appellate panel on two conditions: first,
    all of the parties to the appeal must have agreed to request the
    withdrawal of the election to have the district court hear the
    appeal; and, second, the district court must decide whether to
    grant the request for withdrawal. The district court has discretion
    either to keep the case or transfer it to the bankruptcy appellate
    panel, which will prevent strategic behavior by parties and avoid
    the wasting of judicial resources.
      Subdivision (f) is added to the rule to implement the 2005
    amendments to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(d). That section authorizes
    appeals directly to the court of appeals, with that court's
    consent, upon certification that a ground for the appeal exists
    under Sec. 158(d)(2)(A)(i)-(iii). Certification can be made by the
    court on its own initiative under subdivision (f)(4), or in
    response to a request of a party or a majority of the appellants
    and appellees (if any) under subdivision (f)(3). Certification also
    can be made by all of the appellants and appellees under
    subdivision (f)(2)(B). Under subdivision (f)(1), certification is
    effective only when a timely appeal is commenced under subdivision
    (a) or (b), and a notice of appeal has been timely filed under Rule
    8002. These actions will provide sufficient notice of the appeal to
    the circuit clerk, so the rule dispenses with the uncodified
    temporary procedural requirements set out in Sec. 1233(b)(4) of the
    Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005,
    Pub. L. No. 109-8.
      The rule adopts a bright-line test for identifying the court in
    which a matter is pending. Under subdivision (f)(2), the bright-
    line chosen is the "docketing" under Rule 8007(b) of an appeal of
    an interlocutory order or decree under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(a)(2) or
    a final judgment, order or decree under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(a)(1),
    or the granting of leave to appeal any other interlocutory
    judgment, order or decree under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(a)(3), whichever
    is earlier.
      To ensure that parties are aware of a certification, the rule
    requires either that it be made on the Official Form (if being made
    by all of the parties to the appeal) or on a separate document
    (whether the certification is made on the court's own initiative or
    in response to a request by a party). This is particularly
    important because the rule adopts the bankruptcy practice
    established by Rule 8001(a) and (b) of requiring a notice of appeal
    in every instance, including interlocutory orders, of appeals from
    bankruptcy court orders, judgments, and decrees. Because this
    requirement is satisfied by filing the notice of appeal that takes
    the appeal to the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel in
    the first instance, the rule does not require a separate notice of
    appeal if a certification occurs after a district court or
    bankruptcy appellate panel decision.
      A certification under subdivision (f)(1) does not place the
    appeal in the circuit court. Rather, the court of appeals must
    first authorize the direct appeal. Subdivision (f)(5) therefore
    provides that any party intending to pursue the appeal in the court
    of appeals must seek that permission under Rule 5 of the Federal
    Rules of Appellate Procedure. Subdivision (f)(5) requires that the
    petition for permission to appeal be filed within 30 days after an
    effective certification.
      Changes Made After Publication. The second paragraph of the
    Committee Note was amended to identify more specifically the
    different ways in which the certification of a direct appeal to the
    court of appeals.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to
    substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout
    the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 15-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 20-day periods become 21-day periods
        -- 25-day periods become 28-day periods

    FEDERAL RULES OF BANKRUPTCY PROCEDURE AND OFFICIAL BANKRUPTCY FORMS
    PART VIII - APPEALS TO DISTRICT COURT OR BANKRUPTCY APPELLATE PANEL

-HEAD-
    Rule 8002. Time for Filing Notice of Appeal

-STATUTE-
      (a) Fourteen-Day Period. The notice of appeal shall be filed with
    the clerk within 14 days of the date of the entry of the judgment,
    order, or decree appealed from. If a timely notice of appeal is
    filed by a party, any other party may file a notice of appeal
    within 14 days of the date on which the first notice of appeal was
    filed, or within the time otherwise prescribed by this rule,
    whichever period last expires. A notice of appeal filed after the
    announcement of a decision or order but before entry of the
    judgment, order, or decree shall be treated as filed after such
    entry and on the day thereof. If a notice of appeal is mistakenly
    filed with the district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel,
    the clerk of the district court or the clerk of the bankruptcy
    appellate panel shall note thereon the date on which it was
    received and transmit it to the clerk and it shall be deemed filed
    with the clerk on the date so noted.
      (b) Effect of Motion on Time for Appeal. If any party makes a
    timely motion of a type specified immediately below, the time for
    appeal for all parties runs from the entry of the order disposing
    of the last such motion outstanding. This provision applies to a
    timely motion:
        (1) to amend or make additional findings of fact under Rule
      7052, whether or not granting the motion would alter the
      judgment;
        (2) to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 9023;
        (3) for a new trial under Rule 9023; or
        (4) for relief under Rule 9024 if the motion is filed no later
      than 14 days after the entry of judgment. A notice of appeal
      filed after announcement or entry of the judgment, order, or
      decree but before disposition of any of the above motions is
      ineffective to appeal from the judgment, order, or decree, or
      part thereof, specified in the notice of appeal, until the entry
      of the order disposing of the last such motion outstanding.
      Appellate review of an order disposing of any of the above
      motions requires the party, in compliance with Rule 8001, to
      amend a previously filed notice of appeal. A party intending to
      challenge an alteration or amendment of the judgment, order, or
      decree shall file a notice, or an amended notice, of appeal
      within the time prescribed by this Rule 8002 measured from the
      entry of the order disposing of the last such motion outstanding.
      No additional fees will be required for filing an amended notice.

      (c) Extension of Time for Appeal.
        (1) The bankruptcy judge may extend the time for filing the
      notice of appeal by any party, unless the judgment, order, or
      decree appealed from:
          (A) grants relief from an automatic stay under Sec. 362, Sec.
        922, Sec. 1201, or Sec. 1301;
          (B) authorizes the sale or lease of property or the use of
        cash collateral under Sec. 363;
          (C) authorizes the obtaining of credit under Sec. 364;
          (D) authorizes the assumption or assignment of an executory
        contract or unexpired lease under Sec. 365;

      notice of appeal may be granted upon a showing of excusable
      neglect. An extension of time for filing a notice of appeal may
      not exceed 21 days from the expiration of the time for filing a
      notice of appeal otherwise prescribed by this rule or 14 days
      from the date of entry of the order granting the motion,
      whichever is later.

      This rule is an adaptation of Rule 4(a) F.R.App.P. The time to
    appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy judge is
    10 days, rather than the 30 days provided for in the civil
    practice. The shortened time is specified in order to obtain prompt
    appellate review, often important to the administration of a case
    under the Code. If a timely notice of appeal is filed, other
    parties have an additional 10 days within which to file a notice of
    appeal. A notice of appeal filed within the additional 10 day
    period by an appellee is a cross appeal, but there is a separate
    appeal if a non-appellee files a notice of appeal within that 10
    day period. The district courts and bankruptcy appellate panels
    have inherent authority to consolidate appeals.
      Subdivision (b) is essentially the same as Rule 4(a)(4) of the
    F.R.App.P.
      Subdivision (c) is similar to former Bankruptcy Rule 802(c). To
    expedite the disposition of appeals the maximum extension of time
    is 20 days instead of the 30 days provided by Rule 4(a)(5) of the
    F.R.App.P. Subject to the exceptions set forth in subdivision (c),
    the court may extend the time for taking an appeal when a motion
    for extension is filed after the expiration of the original 10 day
    period but no later than 20 days after the expiration of the
    original 10 day period. Orders of the bankruptcy court relating to
    the sale of property, extension of credit, confirmation of a plan,
    dismissal or conversion of the case, and approval of the disclosure
    statement are of such significance to the administration of the
    case, the parties in interest, and third parties that this
    subdivision requires that either an appeal or a motion for
    extension be filed within the original 10 day period.
      If a timely notice of appeal is not filed, no appeal may be taken
    later. Former Bankruptcy Rule 803, which provided that a referee's
    judgment became final when the appeal period expired, has been
    omitted as unnecessary.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to conform to F.R.App.P. 4(a)(2) which
    is designed to avoid the loss of the right to appeal when a notice
    of appeal is filed prematurely.
      Subdivision (b)(1) is deleted because Rule 9015 was abrogated in
    1987.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      These amendments are intended to conform to the 1993 amendments
    to F.R.App.P. 4(a)(4) and 6(b)(2)(i).
      This rule as amended provides that a notice of appeal filed
    before the disposition of a specified postjudgment motion will
    become effective upon disposition of the motion. A notice filed
    before the filing of one of the specified motions or after the
    filing of a motion but before disposition of the motion is, in
    effect, suspended until the motion is disposed of, whereupon, the
    previously filed notice effectively places jurisdiction in the
    district court or bankruptcy appellate panel.
      Because a notice of appeal will ripen into an effective appeal
    upon disposition of a postjudgment motion, in some instances there
    will be an appeal from a judgment that has been altered
    substantially because the motion was granted in whole or in part.
    The appeal may be dismissed for want of prosecution when the
    appellant fails to meet the briefing schedule. But, the appellee
    may also move to strike the appeal. When responding to such a
    motion, the appellant would have an opportunity to state that, even
    though some relief sought in a postjudgment motion was granted, the
    appellant still plans to pursue the appeal. Because the appellant's
    response would provide the appellee with sufficient notice of the
    appellant's intentions, the rule does not require an additional
    notice of appeal in that situation.
      The amendment provides that a notice of appeal filed before the
    disposition of a postjudgment tolling motion is sufficient to bring
    the judgment, order, or decree specified in the original notice of
    appeal to the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel. If the
    judgment is altered upon disposition of a postjudgment motion,
    however, and if a party who has previously filed a notice of appeal
    wishes to appeal from the disposition of the motion, the party must
    amend the notice to so indicate. When a party files an amended
    notice, no additional fees are required because the notice is an
    amendment of the original and not a new notice of appeal.
      Subdivision (b) is also amended to include, among motions that
    extend the time for filing a notice of appeal, a motion under Rule
    9024 that is filed within 10 days after entry of judgment. The
    addition of this motion conforms to a similar amendment to
    F.R.App.P. 4(a)(4) made in 1993, except that a Rule 9024 motion
    does not toll the time to appeal unless it is filed within the 10-
    day period. The reason for providing that the motion extends the
    time to appeal only if it is filed within the 10-day period is to
    enable the court and the parties in interest to determine solely
    from the court records whether the time to appeal has been extended
    by a motion for relief under Rule 9024.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (c) is amended to provide that a request for an
    extension of time to file a notice of appeal must be filed within
    the applicable time period. This amendment will avoid uncertainty
    as to whether the mailing of a motion or an oral request in court
    is sufficient to request an extension of time, and will enable the
    court and the parties in interest to determine solely from the
    court records whether a timely request for an extension has been
    made.
      The amendments also give the court discretion to permit a party
    to file a notice of appeal more than 20 days after expiration of
    the time to appeal otherwise prescribed, but only if the motion was
    timely filed and the notice of appeal is filed within a period not
    exceeding 10 days after entry of the order extending the time. This
    amendment is designed to protect parties that file timely motions
    to extend the time to appeal from the harshness of the present rule
    as demonstrated in In re Mouradick, 13 F.3d 326 (9th Cir. 1994),
    where the court held that a notice of appeal filed within the 3-day
    period expressly prescribed by an order granting a timely motion
    for an extension of time did not confer jurisdiction on the
    appellate court because the notice of appeal was not filed within
    the 20-day period specified in subdivision (c).
      The subdivision is amended further to prohibit any extension of
    time to file a notice of appeal - even if the motion for an
    extension is filed before the expiration of the original time to
    appeal - if the order appealed from grants relief from the
    automatic stay, authorizes the sale or lease of property, use of
    cash collateral, obtaining of credit, or assumption or assignment
    of an executory contract or unexpired lease under Sec. 365, or
    approves a disclosure statement or confirms a plan. These types of
    orders are often relied upon immediately after they are entered and
    should not be reviewable on appeal after the expiration of the
    original appeal period under Rule 8002(a) and (b).

      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to
    substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout
    the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods

    Rule 8003. Leave to Appeal

-STATUTE-
      (a) Content of Motion; Answer. A motion for leave to appeal under
    28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(a) shall contain: (1) a statement of the facts
    necessary to an understanding of the questions to be presented by
    the appeal; (2) a statement of those questions and of the relief
    sought; (3) a statement of the reasons why an appeal should be
    granted; and (4) a copy of the judgment, order, or decree
    complained of and of any opinion or memorandum relating thereto.
    Within 14 days after service of the motion, an adverse party may
    file with the clerk an answer in opposition.
      (b) Transmittal; Determination of Motion. The clerk shall
    transmit the notice of appeal, the motion for leave to appeal and
    any answer thereto to the clerk of the district court or the clerk
    of the bankruptcy appellate panel as soon as all parties have filed
    answers or the time for filing an answer has expired. The motion
    and answer shall be submitted without oral argument unless
    otherwise ordered.
      (c) Appeal Improperly Taken Regarded as a Motion for Leave to
    Appeal. If a required motion for leave to appeal is not filed, but
    a notice of appeal is timely filed, the district court or
    bankruptcy appellate panel may grant leave to appeal or direct that
    a motion for leave to appeal be filed. The district court or the
    bankruptcy appellate panel may also deny leave to appeal but in so
    doing shall consider the notice of appeal as a motion for leave to
    appeal. Unless an order directing that a motion for leave to appeal
    be filed provides otherwise, the motion shall be filed within 14
    days of entry of the order.
      (d) Requirement of Leave to Appeal. If leave to appeal is
    required by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(a) and has not earlier been granted,
    the authorization of a direct appeal by a court of appeals under 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 158(d)(2) shall be deemed to satisfy the requirement
    for leave to appeal.

      Subdivisions (a) and (b) of this rule are derived from Rules 5
    and 6 F.R.App.P. The motion for leave to appeal is addressed to the
    district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel, although filed
    with the clerk of the bankruptcy court.
      Subdivision (c) provides that if a party mistakenly believes the
    order appealed from is final and files only a notice of appeal, the
    appeal is not automatically dismissed. The district court or
    bankruptcy appellate panel has the options to direct that a motion
    be filed, to decide exclusively on the papers already filed to
    grant leave to appeal, or to deny leave to appeal. Cf. 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 2103.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to add subdivision (d) to solve the
    jurisdictional problem that could otherwise ensue when a district
    court or bankruptcy appellate panel has not granted leave to appeal
    under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(a)(3). If the court of appeals accepts the
    appeal, the requirement of leave to appeal is deemed satisfied.
    However, if the court of appeals does not authorize a direct
    appeal, the question of whether to grant leave to appeal remains a
    matter to be resolved by the district court or the bankruptcy
    appellate panel.

-HEAD-
    Rule 8005. Stay Pending Appeal

-STATUTE-
      A motion for a stay of the judgment, order, or decree of a
    bankruptcy judge, for approval of a supersedeas bond, or for other
    relief pending appeal must ordinarily be presented to the
    bankruptcy judge in the first instance. Notwithstanding Rule 7062
    but subject to the power of the district court and the bankruptcy
    appellate panel reserved hereinafter, the bankruptcy judge may
    suspend or order the continuation of other proceedings in the case
    under the Code or make any other appropriate order during the
    pendency of an appeal on such terms as will protect the rights of
    all parties in interest. A motion for such relief, or for
    modification or termination of relief granted by a bankruptcy
    judge, may be made to the district court or the bankruptcy
    appellate panel, but the motion shall show why the relief,
    modification, or termination was not obtained from the bankruptcy
    judge. The district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel may
    condition the relief it grants under this rule on the filing of a
    bond or other appropriate security with the bankruptcy court. When
    an appeal is taken by a trustee, a bond or other appropriate
    security may be required, but when an appeal is taken by the United
    States or an officer or agency thereof or by direction of any
    department of the Government of the United States a bond or other
    security shall not be required.

      The first, third, and fourth sentences of this rule are
    adaptations of Rule 8(a) and (b) F.R.App.P. The second sentence of
    the rule is derived from Sec. 39(c) of the Bankruptcy Act and
    confers on the bankruptcy judge discretion respecting the stay or
    continuation of other proceedings in the case while an appeal is
    pending.
      The last sentence of the rule, which specifically subjects a
    trustee to the same kind of security requirements as other
    litigants, is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 805. The
    exemption of the United States from the bond or security
    requirements is the same as the exemption contained in Rule 62(e)
    F.R.Civ.P.
      Sections 363(m) and 364(e) of the Code provide that unless an
    order approving a sale of property, or authorizing the obtaining of
    credit or the incurring of debt is stayed pending appeal, the sale
    of property to a good faith purchaser or a good faith extension of
    credit, with or without any priority or lien, shall not be affected
    by the reversal or modification of such order on appeal, whether or
    not the purchaser or creditor knows of the pendency of the appeal.

    of an order disposing of the last timely motion outstanding of a
    type specified in Rule 8002(b), whichever is later, the appellant
    shall file with the clerk and serve on the appellee a designation
    of the items to be included in the record on appeal and a statement
    of the issues to be presented. Within 14 days after the service of
    the appellant's statement the appellee may file and serve on the
    appellant a designation of additional items to be included in the
    record on appeal and, if the appellee has filed a cross appeal, the
    appellee as cross appellant shall file and serve a statement of the
    issues to be presented on the cross appeal and a designation of
    additional items to be included in the record. A cross appellee
    may, within 14 days of service of the cross appellant's statement,
    file and serve on the cross appellant a designation of additional
    items to be included in the record. The record on appeal shall
    include the items so designated by the parties, the notice of
    appeal, the judgment, order, or decree appealed from, and any
    opinion, findings of fact, and conclusions of law of the court. Any
    party filing a designation of the items to be included in the
    record shall provide to the clerk a copy of the items designated
    or, if the party fails to provide the copy, the clerk shall prepare
    the copy at the party's expense. If the record designated by any
    party includes a transcript of any proceeding or a part thereof,
    the party shall, immediately after filing the designation, deliver
    to the reporter and file with the clerk a written request for the
    transcript and make satisfactory arrangements for payment of its
    cost. All parties shall take any other action necessary to enable
    the clerk to assemble and transmit the record.

      The seven-day time periods are changed to 10 days to conform to
    Rule 75(b)(2) F.R.Civ.P. and Rule 10(b)(3) F.R.App.P. The amendment
    requiring a party to provide a copy of the items designated for the
    record is to facilitate the amendments to Rule 8007 providing for
    retention by the bankruptcy clerk of the original record.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1994 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment to the first sentence of this rule is made together
    with the amendment to Rule 8002(b), which provides, in essence,
    that certain specified postjudgment motions suspend a filed notice
    of appeal until the disposition of the last of such motions. The
    purpose of this amendment is to suspend the 10-day period for
    filing and serving a designation of the record and statement of the
    issues if a timely postjudgment motion is made and a notice of
    appeal is suspended under Rule 8002(b). The 10-day period set forth
    in the first sentence of this rule begins to run when the order
    disposing of the last of such postjudgment motions outstanding is
    entered. The other amendments to this rule are stylistic.

    the request the date it was received and the date on which the
    reporter expects to have the transcript completed and shall
    transmit the request, so endorsed, to the clerk or the clerk of the
    bankruptcy appellate panel. On completion of the transcript the
    reporter shall file it with the clerk and, if appropriate, notify
    the clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel. If the transcript
    cannot be completed within 30 days of receipt of the request the
    reporter shall seek an extension of time from the clerk or the
    clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel and the action of the clerk
    shall be entered in the docket and the parties notified. If the
    reporter does not file the transcript within the time allowed, the
    clerk or the clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel shall notify
    the bankruptcy judge.
      (b) Duty of Clerk To Transmit Copy of Record; Docketing of
    Appeal. When the record is complete for purposes of appeal, the
    clerk shall transmit a copy thereof forthwith to the clerk of the
    district court or the clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel. On
    receipt of the transmission the clerk of the district court or the
    clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel shall enter the appeal in
    the docket and give notice promptly to all parties to the judgment,
    order, or decree appealed from of the date on which the appeal was
    docketed. If the bankruptcy appellate panel directs that additional
    copies of the record be furnished, the clerk of the bankruptcy
    appellate panel shall notify the appellant and, if the appellant
    fails to provide the copies, the clerk shall prepare the copies at
    the expense of the appellant.
      (c) Record for Preliminary Hearing. If prior to the time the
    record is transmitted a party moves in the district court or before
    the bankruptcy appellate panel for dismissal, for a stay pending
    appeal, for additional security on the bond on appeal or on a
    supersedeas bond, or for any intermediate order, the clerk at the
    request of any party to the appeal shall transmit to the clerk of
    the district court or the clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel a
    copy of the parts of the record as any party to the appeal shall
    designate.

      Subdivision (a) is an adaptation of Rule 11(b) F.R.App.P.
      Subdivision (b) is similar to former Bankruptcy Rule 807. The
    duty of the clerk of the bankruptcy court to transmit the record as
    soon as the record is complete is derived from the second paragraph
    of Rule 11(b) F.R.App.P. The last sentence of the subdivision
    applies to appeals to bankruptcy appellate panels. Additional
    copies of the record may be needed when the appendix to the brief
    required under Rule 8009(b) is not adequate in the judgment of the
    bankruptcy appellate panel for disposition of the appeal. If
    additional copies are required, the appellant will arrange for the
    production of the copies; if the appellant fails to do so, the
    clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel shall prepare the copies at
    the expense of the appellant.
      Subdivision (c) is derived from subdivisions (c), (e) and (f) of
    Rule 11 F.R.App.P. and subdivision (d) is essentially the same as
    Rule 11(b) F.R.App.P.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to require that the bankruptcy clerk retain
    the original record and transmit a copy of the record to the clerk
    of the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel. Transmission
    of the original documents may cause disruption in the continuing
    administration of the case in the bankruptcy court.

    Rule 8008. Filing and Service

-STATUTE-
      (a) Filing. Papers required or permitted to be filed with the
    clerk of the district court or the clerk of the bankruptcy
    appellate panel may be filed by mail addressed to the clerk, but
    filing is not timely unless the papers are received by the clerk
    within the time fixed for filing, except that briefs are deemed
    filed on the day of mailing. An original and one copy of all papers
    shall be filed when an appeal is to the district court; an original
    and three copies shall be filed when an appeal is to a bankruptcy
    appellate panel. The district court or bankruptcy appellate panel
    may require that additional copies be furnished. Rule 5005(a)(2)
    applies to papers filed with the clerk of the district court or the
    clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel if filing by electronic
    means is authorized by local rule promulgated pursuant to Rule
    8018.
      (b) Service of All Papers Required. Copies of all papers filed by
    any party and not required by these rules to be served by the clerk
    of the district court or the clerk of the bankruptcy appellate
    panel shall, at or before the time of filing, be served by the
    party or a person acting for the party on all other parties to the
    appeal. Service on a party represented by counsel shall be made on
    counsel.
      (c) Manner of Service. Service may be personal or by mail.
    Personal service includes delivery of the copy to a clerk or other
    responsible person at the office of counsel. Service by mail is
    complete on mailing.
      (d) Proof of Service. Papers presented for filing shall contain
    an acknowledgment of service by the person served or proof of
    service in the form of a statement of the date and manner of
    service and of the names of the persons served, certified by the
    person who made service. The clerk of the district court or the
    clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel may permit papers to be
    filed without acknowledgment or proof of service but shall require
    the acknowledgment or proof of service to be filed promptly
    thereafter.

      This rule is an adaptation of Rule 25 F.R.App.P. Motions, briefs,
    appendices when required, statements, and any other filed paper
    must be accompanied by the specified number of copies. Rules 8001
    and 8004 govern the number of copies of the notice of appeal which
    must be filed.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1996 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to permit, but not require, district courts
    and, where bankruptcy appellate panels have been authorized,
    circuit councils to adopt local rules that allow filing of
    documents by electronic means, subject to the limitations contained
    in Rule 5005(a)(2). See the committee note to the amendments to
    Rule 5005. Other amendments to this rule are stylistic.

-HEAD-
    Rule 8009. Briefs and Appendix; Filing and Service

-STATUTE-
      (a) Briefs. Unless the district court or the bankruptcy appellate
    panel by local rule or by order excuses the filing of briefs or
    specifies different time limits:
        (1) The appellant shall serve and file a brief within 14 days
      after entry of the appeal on the docket pursuant to Rule 8007.
        (2) The appellee shall serve and file a brief within 14 days
      after service of the brief of appellant. If the appellee has
      filed a cross appeal, the brief of the appellee shall contain the
      issues and argument pertinent to the cross appeal, denominated as
      such, and the response to the brief of the appellant.
        (3) The appellant may serve and file a reply brief within 14
      days after service of the brief of the appellee, and if the
      appellee has cross-appealed, the appellee may file and serve a
      reply brief to the response of the appellant to the issues
      presented in the cross appeal within 14 days after service of the
      reply brief of the appellant. No further briefs may be filed
      except with leave of the district court or the bankruptcy
      appellate panel.

      (b) Appendix to Brief. If the appeal is to a bankruptcy appellate
    panel, the appellant shall serve and file with the appellant's
    brief excerpts of the record as an appendix, which shall include
    the following:
        (1) The complaint and answer or other equivalent pleadings;
        (2) Any pretrial order;
        (3) The judgment, order, or decree from which the appeal is
      taken;
        (4) Any other orders relevant to the appeal;
        (5) The opinion, findings of fact, or conclusions of law filed
      or delivered orally by the court and citations of the opinion if
      published;
        (6) Any motion and response on which the court rendered
      decision;
        (7) The notice of appeal;
        (8) The relevant entries in the bankruptcy docket; and
        (9) The transcript or portion thereof, if so required by a rule
      of the bankruptcy appellate panel.

    An appellee may also serve and file an appendix which contains
    material required to be included by the appellant but omitted by
    appellant.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Subdivision (a) of this rule is adapted from Rules 28(a) and
    31(a) F.R.App.P. The introductory clause of the rule recognizes the
    desirability of allowing local and individual variation in the
    filing of briefs. The numbered paragraphs prescribe shorter periods
    than the corresponding periods allowed by Rule 31(a) F.R.App.P.
      Subdivision (b), which is similar to an interim rule for
    bankruptcy appellate panels promulgated by the Ninth Circuit,
    applies only when an appeal is to an appellate panel. The appellant
    must prepare an appendix to the brief which contains the documents
    relevant to the appeal. With the appendix available to each member
    of the appellate panel, it is unlikely that multiple copies of the
    record will be necessary. The last sentence of the subdivision
    enables the appellee to correct an omission of the appellant.
      Rule 30 F.R.App.P., which governs the preparation of the appendix
    in appeals taken to the courts of appeals, specifies fewer
    documents which must be included in the appendix but permits the
    parties to include any other material.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment to Rule 8007(c) permits a rule of the bankruptcy
    appellate panel to provide that the record is to be retained rather
    than transmitted. The new paragraph (9) of subdivision (b) of this
    rule complements Rule 8007(c) by authorizing a rule of the panel to
    require inclusion of the transcript or a portion thereof in the
    appendix.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to
    substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout
    the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 15-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 20-day periods become 21-day periods

    Rule 8010. Form of Briefs; Length

-STATUTE-
      (a) Form of Briefs. Unless the district court or the bankruptcy
    appellate panel by local rule otherwise provides, the form of brief
    shall be as follows:
        (1) Brief of the Appellant. The brief of the appellant shall
      contain under appropriate headings and in the order here
      indicated:
          (A) A table of contents, with page references, and a table of
        cases alphabetically arranged, statutes and other authorities
        cited, with references to the pages of the brief where they are
        cited.
          (B) A statement of the basis of appellate jurisdiction.
          (C) A statement of the issues presented and the applicable
        standard of appellate review.
          (D) A statement of the case. The statement shall first
        indicate briefly the nature of the case, the course of the
        proceedings, and the disposition in the court below. There
        shall follow a statement of the facts relevant to the issues
        presented for review, with appropriate references to the
        record.
          (E) An argument. The argument may be preceded by a summary.
        The argument shall contain the contentions of the appellant
        with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor,
        with citations to the authorities, statutes and parts of the
        record relied on.
          (F) A short conclusion stating the precise relief sought.

        (2) Brief of the Appellee. The brief of the appellee shall
      conform to the requirements of paragraph (1)(A)-(E) of this
      subdivision, except that a statement of the basis of appellate
      jurisdiction, of the issues, or of the case need not be made
      unless the appellee is dissatisfied with the statement of the
      appellant.

      (b) Reproduction of Statutes, Rules, Regulations, or Similar
    Material. If determination of the issues presented requires
    reference to the Code or other statutes, rules, regulations, or
    similar material, relevant parts thereof shall be reproduced in the
    brief or in an addendum or they may be supplied to the court in
    pamphlet form.
      (c) Length of Briefs. Unless the district court or the bankruptcy
    appellate panel by local rule or order otherwise provides,
    principal briefs shall not exceed 50 pages, and reply briefs shall
    not exceed 25 pages, exclusive of pages containing the table of
    contents, tables of citations and any addendum containing statutes,
    rules, regulations, or similar material.


-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is derived from subdivisions (a), (b), (c), and (f) of
    Rule 28 F.R.App.P.
      When an appeal is to a bankruptcy appellate panel and an appendix
    is filed pursuant to Rule 8009(b) and reference is made in a brief
    to parts of the record included in the appendix, the reference
    should be to the appropriate pages of the appendix at which those
    parts appear.

-HEAD-
    Rule 8011. Motions

-STATUTE-
      (a) Content of Motions; Response; Reply. A request for an order
    or other relief shall be made by filing with the clerk of the
    district court or the clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel a
    motion for such order or relief with proof of service on all other
    parties to the appeal. The motion shall contain or be accompanied
    by any matter required by a specific provision of these rules
    governing such a motion, shall state with particularity the grounds
    on which it is based, and shall set forth the order or relief
    sought. If a motion is supported by briefs, affidavits or other
    papers, they shall be served and filed with the motion. Any party
    may file a response in opposition to a motion other than one for a
    procedural order within seven days after service of the motion, but
    the district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel may shorten or
    extend the time for responding to any motion.
      (b) Determination of Motions for Procedural Orders.
    Notwithstanding subdivision (a) of this rule, motions for
    procedural orders, including any motion under Rule 9006, may be
    acted on at any time, without awaiting a response thereto and
    without hearing. Any party adversely affected by such action may
    move for reconsideration, vacation, or modification of the action.
      (c) Determination of all Motions. All motions will be decided
    without oral argument unless the court orders otherwise. A motion
    for a stay, or for other emergency relief may be denied if not
    presented promptly.
      (d) Emergency Motions. Whenever a movant requests expedited
    action on a motion on the ground that, to avoid irreparable harm,
    relief is needed in less time than would normally be required for
    the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel to receive and
    consider a response, the word "Emergency" shall precede the title
    of the motion. The motion shall be accompanied by an affidavit
    setting forth the nature of the emergency. The motion shall state
    whether all grounds advanced in support thereof were submitted to
    the bankruptcy judge and, if any grounds relied on were not
    submitted, why the motion should not be remanded to the bankruptcy
    judge for reconsideration. The motion shall include the office
    addresses and telephone numbers of moving and opposing counsel and
    shall be served pursuant to Rule 8008. Prior to filing the motion,
    the movant shall make every practicable effort to notify opposing
    counsel in time for counsel to respond to the motion. The affidavit
    accompanying the motion shall also state when and how opposing
    counsel was notified or if opposing counsel was not notified why it
    was not practicable to do so.
      (e) Power of a Single Judge To Entertain Motions. A single judge
    of a bankruptcy appellate panel may grant or deny any request for
    relief which under these rules may properly be sought by motion,
    except that a single judge may not dismiss or otherwise decide an
    appeal or a motion for leave to appeal. The action of a single
    judge may be reviewed by the panel.

    determine after examination of the briefs and record, or appendix
    to the brief, that oral argument is not needed. Any party shall
    have an opportunity to file a statement setting forth the reason
    why oral argument should be allowed.
      Oral argument will not be allowed if (1) the appeal is frivolous;
    (2) the dispositive issue or set of issues has been recently
    authoritatively decided; or (3) the facts and legal arguments are
    adequately presented in the briefs and record and the decisional
    process would not be significantly aided by oral argument.

    the production of copies of briefs, the appendices, and the record
    and in the preparation and transmission of the record, the cost of
    the reporter's transcript, if necessary for the determination of
    the appeal, the premiums paid for cost of supersedeas bonds or

    Rule 8015. Motion for Rehearing

-STATUTE-
      Unless the district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel by
    local rule or by court order otherwise provides, a motion for
    rehearing may be filed within 14 days after entry of the judgment
    of the district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel. If a
    timely motion for rehearing is filed, the time for appeal to the
    court of appeals for all parties shall run from the entry of the
    order denying rehearing or the entry of subsequent judgment.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This is an adaptation of the first sentence of Rule 40(a)
    F.R.App.P. The filing of a motion for rehearing does not toll the
    time for taking an appeal to the court of appeals from the district
    court or the bankruptcy appellate panel. Appeals from a district
    court or a bankruptcy appellate panel are to the appropriate court
    of appeals. Under Rule 4(a)(4) F.R.App.P. the filing of post-trial
    motions in the district court has the effect of vitiating any prior
    notice of appeal and, on the district court's disposition of those
    post-trial motions, a new appeal period starts. Rule 4 F.R.App.P.
    does not, however, contain any provision which stays or otherwise
    alters the time for taking an appeal to the court of appeals when a
    motion for rehearing is filed under Rule 8015 with the district
    court or bankruptcy appellate panel.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The amendment, which is derived from Rule 8002(b), Rule 4(a)(4)
    F.R.App.P., and Rule 11.1 Sup.Ct.R., clarifies the effect of the
    filing of a timely motion for rehearing. If a timely motion is
    filed, the appeal period to the court of appeals begins to run on
    the entry of an order denying the motion or the entry of a
    subsequent judgment.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute
    a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules,
    deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods

-HEAD-
    Rule 8017. Stay of Judgment of District Court or Bankruptcy
      Appellate Panel

-STATUTE-
      (a) Automatic Stay of Judgment on Appeal. Judgments of the
    district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel are stayed until
    the expiration of 14 days after entry, unless otherwise ordered by
    the district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel.
      (b) Stay Pending Appeal to the Court of Appeals. On motion and
    notice to the parties to the appeal, the district court or the
    bankruptcy appellate panel may stay its judgment pending an appeal
    to the court of appeals. The stay shall not extend beyond 30 days
    after the entry of the judgment of the district court or the
    bankruptcy appellate panel unless the period is extended for cause
    shown. If before the expiration of a stay entered pursuant to this
    subdivision there is an appeal to the court of appeals by the party
    who obtained the stay, the stay shall continue until final
    disposition by the court of appeals. A bond or other security may
    be required as a condition to the grant or continuation of a stay
    of the judgment. A bond or other security may be required if a
    trustee obtains a stay but a bond or security shall not be required
    if a stay is obtained by the United States or an officer or agency
    thereof or at the direction of any department of the Government of
    the United States.
      (c) Power of Court of Appeals Not Limited. This rule does not
    limit the power of a court of appeals or any judge thereof to stay
    proceedings during the pendency of an appeal or to suspend, modify,
    restore, or grant an injunction during the pendency of an appeal or
    to make any order appropriate to preserve the status quo or the
    effectiveness of the judgment subsequently to be entered.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is derived from Rule 62 F.R.Civ.P. and Rule 41
    F.R.App.P.
      Subdivision (a) accords to the parties to an appeal 10 days
    within which to decide whether to pursue an appeal to the court of
    appeals. In ordinary civil litigation there is a similar
    opportunity. Rule 62(a) F.R.Civ.P. automatically stays enforcement
    of a district court's judgment in a civil action and Rule 41(a)
    F.R.App.P. provides that the mandate of the court of appeals shall
    not issue for 21 days, unless the court otherwise directs. The
    district court or bankruptcy appellate panel may reduce the 10 day
    period of this subdivision.
      Subdivision (b) vests in the district courts and the bankruptcy
    appellate panels the same authority the courts of appeals have
    under Rule 41(b) F.R.App.P. to stay their judgments pending appeal.
    Perfection of an appeal to the court of appeals while a stay
    entered by the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel is in
    effect results in the automatic continuation of that stay during
    the course of the appeal in the court of appeals.
      Subdivision (c) is the same as Rule 62(g) F.R.Civ.P.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT

      When There is No Controlling Law

-STATUTE-
      (a) Local Rules by Circuit Councils and District Courts.
        (1) Circuit councils which have authorized bankruptcy appellate
      panels pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(b) and the district courts
      may, acting by a majority of the judges of the council or
      district court, make and amend rules governing practice and
      procedure for appeals from orders or judgments of bankruptcy
      judges to the respective bankruptcy appellate panel or district
      court consistent with - but not duplicative of - Acts of Congress
      and the rules of this Part VIII. Local rules shall conform to any
      uniform numbering system prescribed by the Judicial Conference of
      the United States. Rule 83 F.R.Civ.P. governs the procedure for
      making and amending rules to govern appeals.
        (2) A local rule imposing a requirement of form shall not be
      enforced in a manner that causes a party to lose rights because
      of a nonwillful failure to comply with the requirement.

      (b) Procedure When There is No Controlling Law. A bankruptcy
    appellate panel or district judge may regulate practice in any
    manner consistent with federal law, these rules, Official Forms,
    and local rules of the circuit council or district court. No
    sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed for noncompliance
    with any requirement not in federal law, federal rules, Official
    Forms, or the local rules of the circuit council or district court
    unless the alleged violator has been furnished in the particular
    case with actual notice of the requirement.

    Local rules governing procedure before the bankruptcy courts may be
    promulgated under Rule 9028.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 83 F.R.Civ.P. was amended in August 1985 to require greater
    participation by the public in the rule making process. The
    amendment to Rule 8018 incorporates Rule 83 F.R.Civ.P. Under 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 158(b)(2), appeals may be taken to a bankruptcy
    appellate panel only if the district court so authorizes. If a
    district court does not authorize appeals to the bankruptcy
    appellate panel, appeals will be to the district court. This rule

    appeals.

    appeal, or a bankruptcy appellate panel, has the authority to award
    damages and costs to an appellee if it finds that the appeal is
    frivolous. By conforming to the language of Rule 38 F.R.App.P.,
    this rule recognizes that the authority to award damages and costs
    in connection with frivolous appeals is the same for district

-STATUTE-
      The definitions of words and phrases in Sec. 101, Sec. 902 and
    Sec. 1101 and the rules of construction in Sec. 102 of the Code
    govern their use in these rules. In addition, the following words
    and phrases used in these rules have the meanings indicated:
        (1) "Bankruptcy clerk" means a clerk appointed pursuant to 28
      U.S.C. Sec. 156(b).
        (2) "Bankruptcy Code" or "Code" means title 11 of the United
      States Code.
        (3) "Clerk" means bankruptcy clerk, if one has been appointed,

        (4) "Court" or "judge" means the judicial officer before whom a

        (5) "Debtor." When any act is required by these rules to be
      performed by a debtor or when it is necessary to compel
      attendance of a debtor for examination and the debtor is not a
      natural person: (A) if the debtor is a corporation, "debtor"
      includes, if designated by the court, any or all of its officers,
      members of its board of directors or trustees or of a similar
      controlling body, a controlling stockholder or member, or any
      other person in control; (B) if the debtor is a partnership,
      "debtor" includes any or all of its general partners or, if
      designated by the court, any other person in control.
        (6) "Firm" includes a partnership or professional corporation
      of attorneys or accountants.
        (7) "Judgment" means any appealable order.
        (8) "Mail" means first class, postage prepaid.
        (9) "Notice provider" means any entity approved by the
      Administrative Office of the United States Courts to give notice
      to creditors under Rule 2002(g)(4).
        (10) "Regular associate" means any attorney regularly employed
      by, associated with, or counsel to an individual or firm.
        (11) "Trustee" includes a debtor in possession in a chapter 11
      case.
        (12) "United States trustee" includes an assistant United
      States trustee and any designee of the United States trustee.

-MISC1-
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The terms "bankruptcy clerk" and "clerk" have been defined to
    reflect that unless otherwise stated, for the purpose of these
    rules, the terms are meant to identify the court officer for the
    bankruptcy records. If a bankruptcy clerk is appointed, all filings
    are made with the bankruptcy clerk. If one has not been appointed,
    all filings are with the clerk of the district court. Rule 5005.
      The rule is also amended to include a definition of "court or
    judge". Since a case or proceeding may be before a bankruptcy judge
    or a judge of the district court, "court or judge" is defined to
    mean the judicial officer before whom the case or proceeding is
    pending.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Section 582 of title 28 provides that the Attorney General may
    appoint one or more assistant United States trustees in any region
    when the public interest so requires. This rule is amended to
    clarify that an assistant United States trustee, as well as any
    designee of the United States trustee, is included within the
    meaning of "United States trustee" in the rules.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to add the definition of a notice provider
    and to renumber the final three definitions in the rule. A notice
    provider is an entity approved by the Administrative Office of the
    United States Courts to enter into agreements with entities to give
    notice to those entities in the form and manner agreed to by those
    parties. The new definition supports the amendment to Rule
    2002(g)(4) that authorizes a notice provider to give notices under
    Rule 2002.
      Many entities conduct business on a national scale and receive
    vast numbers of notices in bankruptcy cases throughout the country.
    Those entities can agree with a notice provider to receive their
    notices in a form and at an address or addresses that the creditor
    and notice provider agree upon. There are processes currently in
    use that provide substantial assurance that notices are not
    misdirected. Any notice provider would have to demonstrate to the
    Administrative Office of the United States Courts that it could
    provide the service in a manner that ensures the proper delivery of
    notice to creditors. Once the Administrative Office of the United
    States Courts approves the notice provider to enter into agreements
    with creditors, the notice provider and other entities can
    establish the relationship that will govern the delivery of notices
    in cases as provided in Rule 2002(g)(4).

    Rule 9003. Prohibition of Ex Parte Contacts

-STATUTE-
      (a) General Prohibition. Except as otherwise permitted by
    applicable law, any examiner, any party in interest, and any
    attorney, accountant, or employee of a party in interest shall
    refrain from ex parte meetings and communications with the court
    concerning matters affecting a particular case or proceeding.
      (b) United States Trustee. Except as otherwise permitted by
    applicable law, the United States trustee and assistants to and
    employees or agents of the United States trustee shall refrain from
    ex parte meetings and communications with the court concerning
    matters affecting a particular case or proceeding. This rule does
    not preclude communications with the court to discuss general
    problems of administration and improvement of bankruptcy
    administration, including the operation of the United States
    trustee system.

      This rule regulates the actions of parties in interest and their
    attorneys or others employed by parties in interest. This
    regulation of the conduct of parties in interest and their
    representative is designed to insure that the bankruptcy system
    operates fairly and that no appearance of unfairness is created.
    See H. Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 95 et seq. (1977).
      This rule is not a substitute for or limitation of any applicable
    canon of professional responsibility or judicial conduct. See,
    e.g., Canon 7, EC7-35, Disciplinary Rule 7-110(B) of the Code of
    Professional Responsibility: "Generally, in adversary proceedings a
    lawyer should not communicate with a judge relative to a matter
    pending before, or which is to be brought before, a tribunal over
    which he presides in circumstances which might have the effect or
    give the appearance of granting undue advantage to one party;" and
    Canon 3A(4) of the Code of Judicial Conduct: "A judge should . . .
    neither initiate nor consider ex parte or other communications
    concerning a pending or impending proceeding."

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to apply to both the bankruptcy judges and
    the district judges of the district.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to extend to examiners the prohibition
    on ex parte meetings and communications with the court.
      Subdivision (b) is derived from Rule X-1010.

      The rule is added to adopt the new rule added to the Federal
    Rules of Civil Procedure. The new Civil Rule replaces Rule 24(c) F.
    R. Civ. P., so the cross reference to Civil Rule 24 contained in
    Rule 7024 is no longer sufficient to bring the provisions of new
    Civil Rule 5.1 into adversary proceedings. This rule also makes
    Civil Rule 5.1 applicable to all contested matters and other
    proceedings within the bankruptcy case.

    TITLE 11 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF BANKRUPTCY PROCEDURE AND OFFICIAL BANKRUPTCY FORMS
    PART IX - GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 9006. Computing and Extending Time

-STATUTE-
      (a) Computing Time. The following rules apply in computing any
    time period specified in these rules, in the Federal Rules of Civil
    Procedure, in any local rule or court order, or in any statute that
    does not specify a method of computing time.
        (1) Period Stated in Days or a Longer Unit. When the period is
      stated in days or a longer unit of time:
          (A) exclude the day of the event that triggers the period;
          (B) count every day, including intermediate Saturdays,
        Sundays, and legal holidays; and
          (C) include the last day of the period, but if the last day
        is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues
        to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday,
        Sunday, or legal holiday.

        (2) Period Stated in Hours. When the period is stated in hours:
          (A) begin counting immediately on the occurrence of the event
        that triggers the period;
          (B) count every hour, including hours during intermediate
        Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and
          (C) if the period would end on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal
        holiday, then continue the period until the same time on the
        next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.

        (3) Inaccessibility of Clerk's Office. Unless the court orders
      otherwise, if the clerk's office is inaccessible:
          (A) on the last day for filing under Rule 9006(a)(1), then
        the time for filing is extended to the first accessible day
        that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday; or
          (B) during the last hour for filing under Rule 9006(a)(2),
        then the time for filing is extended to the same time on the
        first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal
        holiday.

        (4) "Last Day" Defined. Unless a different time is set by a
      statute, local rule, or order in the case, the last day ends:
          (A) for electronic filing, at midnight in the court's time
        zone; and
          (B) for filing by other means, when the clerk's office is
        scheduled to close.

        (5) "Next Day" Defined. The "next day" is determined by
      continuing to count forward when the period is measured after an
      event and backward when measured before an event.
        (6) "Legal Holiday" Defined. "Legal holiday" means:
          (A) the day set aside by statute for observing New Year's
        Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday,
        Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day,
        Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, or Christmas Day;
          (B) any day declared a holiday by the President or Congress;
        and
          (C) for periods that are measured after an event, any other
        day declared a holiday by the state where the district court is
        located. (In this rule, "state" includes the District of
        Columbia and any United States commonwealth or territory.)

      (b) Enlargement.
        (1) In General. Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of
      this subdivision, when an act is required or allowed to be done
      at or within a specified period by these rules or by a notice
      given thereunder or by order of court, the court for cause shown
      may at any time in its discretion (1) with or without motion or
      notice order the period enlarged if the request therefor is made
      before the expiration of the period originally prescribed or as
      extended by a previous order or (2) on motion made after the
      expiration of the specified period permit the act to be done
      where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect.
        (2) Enlargement Not Permitted. The court may not enlarge the
      time for taking action under Rules 1007(d), 2003(a) and (d),
      7052, 9023, and 9024.
        (3) Enlargement Governed By Other Rules. The court may enlarge
      the time for taking action under Rules 1006(b)(2), 1017(e),
      3002(c), 4003(b), 4004(a), 4007(c), 4008(a), 8002, and 9033, only
      to the extent and under the conditions stated in those rules. In
      addition, the court may enlarge the time to file the statement
      required under Rule 1007(b)(7), and to file schedules and
      statements in a small business case under Sec. 1116(3) of the
      Code, only to the extent and under the conditions stated in Rule
      1007(c).

      (c) Reduction.
        (1) In General. Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this
      subdivision, when an act is required or allowed to be done at or
      within a specified time by these rules or by a notice given
      thereunder or by order of court, the court for cause shown may in
      its discretion with or without motion or notice order the period
      reduced.
        (2) Reduction Not Permitted. The court may not reduce the time
      for taking action under Rules 2002(a)(7), 2003(a), 3002(c), 3014,
      3015, 4001(b)(2), (c)(2), 4003(a), 4004(a), 4007(c), 4008(a),
      8002, and 9033(b). In addition, the court may not reduce the time
      under Rule 1007(c) to file the statement required by Rule
      1007(b)(7).

      (d) For Motions - Affidavits. A written motion, other than one
    which may be heard ex parte, and notice of any hearing shall be
    served not later than seven days before the time specified for such
    hearing, unless a different period is fixed by these rules or by
    order of the court. Such an order may for cause shown be made on ex
    parte application. When a motion is supported by affidavit, the
    affidavit shall be served with the motion; and, except as otherwise
    provided in Rule 9023, opposing affidavits may be served not later
    than one day before the hearing, unless the court permits them to
    be served at some other time.
      (e) Time of Service. Service of process and service of any paper
    other than process or of notice by mail is complete on mailing.
      (f) Additional Time After Service by Mail or Under Rule
    5(b)(2)(D), (E), or (F) F.R.Civ.P. When there is a right or
    requirement to act or undertake some proceedings within a
    prescribed period after service and that service is by mail or
    under Rule 5(b)(2)(D), (E), or (F) F.R.Civ.P., three days are added
    after the prescribed period would otherwise expire under Rule
    9006(a).
      (g) Grain Storage Facility Cases. This rule shall not limit the
    court's authority under Sec. 557 of the Code to enter orders
    governing procedures in cases in which the debtor is an owner or
    operator of a grain storage facility.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Subdivision (a). This rule is an adaptation of Rule 6 F.R.Civ.P.
    It governs the time for acts to be done and proceedings to be had
    in cases under the Code and any litigation arising therein.
      Subdivision (b) is patterned after Rule 6(b) F.R.Civ.P. and Rule
    26(b) F.R.App.P.
      Paragraph (1) of this subdivision confers on the court discretion
    generally to authorize extensions of time for doing acts required
    or allowed by these rules or orders of court. The exceptions to
    this general authority to extend the time are contained in
    paragraphs (2) and (3).
      In the interest of prompt administration of bankruptcy cases
    certain time periods may not be extended. Paragraph (2) lists the
    rules which establish time periods which may not be extended: Rule
    1007(d), time for filing a list of 20 largest creditors; Rule
    1017(b)(3), 30 day period for sending notice of dismissal for
    failure to pay the filing fee; Rule 1019(2), 20 day period for
    notice of conversion to a chapter 7 case; Rule 2003(a), meeting of
    creditors not more than 40 days after order for relief; Rule
    2003(d), 10 days for filing a motion for resolution of an election
    dispute; Rule 3014, time for the Sec. 1111(b)(2) election; Rule
    4001(b), expiration of stay 30 days following the commencement of
    final hearing; Rule 7052(b), 10 day period to move to amend
    findings of fact; Rule 9015(f), 20 day period to move for judgment
    notwithstanding the verdict; Rule 9023, 10 day period to move for a
    new trial; and Rule 9024, time to move for relief from judgment.
      Many rules which establish a time for doing an act also contain a
    specific authorization and standard for granting an extension of
    time and, in some cases, limit the length of an extension. In some
    instances it would be inconsistent with the objective of the rule
    and sound administration of the case to permit extension under Rule
    9006(b)(1), but with respect to the other rules it is appropriate
    that the power to extend time be supplemented by Rule 9006(b)(1).
    Unless a rule which contains a specific authorization to extend
    time is listed in paragraph (3) of this subdivision, an extension
    of the time may be granted under paragraph (1) of this subdivision.
    If a rule is included in paragraph (3) an extension may not be
    granted under paragraph (1). The following rules are listed in
    paragraph (3): Rule 1006(b)(2), time for paying the filing fee in
    installments; Rule 3002(c), 90 day period for filing a claim in a
    chapter 7 or 13 case; Rule 4003(b), 30 days for filing objections
    to a claim of exemptions; Rule 4004(a), 60 day period to object to
    a discharge; Rule 4007(b), 60 day period to file a dischargeability
    complaint; and Rule 8002, 10 days for filing a notice of appeal.
      Subdivision (c). Paragraph (1) of this subdivision authorizes the
    reduction of the time periods established by these rules or an
    order of the court. Excluded from this general authority are the
    time periods established by the rules referred to in paragraph (2)
    of the subdivision: Rule 2002 (a) and (b), 20 day and 25 day
    notices of certain hearings and actions in the case; Rule 2003(a),
    meeting of creditors to be not less than 20 days after the order
    for relief; Rule 3002(c), 90 days for filing a claim in a chapter 7
    or 13 case; Rule 3014, time for Sec. 1111(b)(2) election; Rule
    3015, 10 day period after filing of petition to file a chapter 13
    plan; Rule 4003(a), 15 days for a dependent to claim exemptions;
    Rule 4004(a), 60 day period to object to a discharge; Rule 4007(c),
    60 day period to file a dischargeability complaint; and Rule 8002,
    10 days for filing a notice of appeal. Reduction of the time
    periods fixed in the rules referred to in this subdivision would be
    inconsistent with the purposes of those rules and would cause
    harmful uncertainty.
      Subdivision (d) is derived from Rule 6(d) F.R.Civ.P. The
    reference is to Rule 9023 instead of to Rule 59(c) F.R.Civ.P.
    because Rule 9023 incorporates Rule 59 F.R.Civ.P. but excepts
    therefrom motions to reconsider orders allowing and disallowing
    claims.
      Subdivision (f) is new and is the same as Rule 6(e) F.R.Civ.P.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to conform to the 1984 amendments to
    Rule 6 F.R.Civ.P.
      Subdivision (b). The reference to Rule 4001(b) in paragraph (3)
    is deleted because of the amendments made to Rule 4001. Rule 9033,
    which is new, contains specific provisions governing the extension
    of time to file objections to proposed findings of fact and
    conclusions of law. Rule 9033 is added to the rules referred to in
    paragraph (3).
      Subdivision (c). Rule 4001(b)(2) and (c)(2) provide that a final
    hearing on a motion to use cash collateral or a motion for
    authority to obtain credit may be held no earlier than 15 days
    after the filing of the motion. These two rules are added to
    paragraph (2) to make it clear that the 15 day period may not be
    reduced. Rule 9033 is also added to paragraph (2).
      Subdivision (g) is new. Under Sec. 557 of the Code, as enacted by
    the 1984 amendments, the court is directed to expedite grain
    storage facility cases. This subdivision makes it clear this rule
    does not limit the court's authority under Sec. 557.
      The original Advisory Committee Note to this rule included the 25
    day notice period of Rule 2002(b) as a time period which may not be
    reduced under Rule 9006(c)(2). This was an error.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1989 AMENDMENT       
      Prior to 1987, subdivision (a) provided that intermediate
    weekends and legal holidays would not be counted in the computation
    of a time period if the prescribed or allowed time was less than 7
    days. This rule was amended in 1987 to conform to Fed. R. Civ. P.
    6(a) which provides for the exclusion of intermediate weekends and
    legal holidays if the time prescribed or allowed is less than 11
    days. An undesirable result of the 1987 amendment was that 10-day
    time periods prescribed in the interest of prompt administration of
    bankruptcy cases were extended to at least 14 calendar days.
      As a result of the present amendment, 10-day time periods
    prescribed or allowed will no longer be extended to at least 14
    calendar days because of intermediate weekends and legal holidays.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      As a result of the 1989 amendment to this rule, the method of
    computing time under subdivision (a) is not the same as the method
    of computing time under Rule 6(a) F.R.Civ.P. Subdivision (a) is
    amended to provide that it governs the computation of time periods
    prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure when the
    Bankruptcy Rules make a civil rule applicable to a bankruptcy case
    or proceeding.
      Subdivision (b)(2) is amended because of the deletion of Rule
    1019(2). Reference to Rule 9015(f) is deleted because of the
    abrogation of Rule 9015 in 1987.
      Subdivision (b)(3) is amended to limit the enlargement of time
    regarding dismissal of a chapter 7 case for substantial abuse in
    accordance with Rule 1017(e).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1996 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (c)(2) is amended to conform to the abrogation of
    Rule 2002(a)(4) and the renumbering of Rule 2002(a)(8) to Rule

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1999 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 9006(b)(2) is amended to conform to the abrogation of Rule
    1017(b)(3).
      GAP Report on Rule 9006. The proposed amendment to Rule
    9006(b)(2) has been added as a technical change to conform to the
    abrogation of Rule 1017(b)(3). The proposed amendment to Rule
    9006(c)(2), providing that the time under Rule 1019(6) to file a
    request for payment of an administrative expense after a case is
    converted to chapter 7 could not be reduced by the court, was
    deleted. The proposed amendments to Rule 1019(6) have been changed
    so that the court will fix the time for filing the request for
    payment. Since the court will fix the time limit, the court should
    have the power to reduce it. See GAP Report to Rule 1019(6).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2001 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 5(b) F. R. Civ. P., which is made applicable in adversary
    proceedings by Rule 7005, is being restyled and amended to
    authorize service by electronic means - or any other means not
    otherwise authorized under Rule 5(b) - if consent is obtained from
    the person served. The amendment to Rule 9006(f) is intended to
    extend the three-day "mail rule" to service under Rule 5(b)(2)(D),
    including service by electronic means. The three-day rule also will
    apply to service under Rule 5(b)(2)(C) F. R. Civ. P. when the
    person served has no known address and the paper is served by
    leaving a copy with the clerk of the court.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were
    made.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             
      Rule 9006(f) is amended, consistent with a corresponding
    amendment to Rule 6(e) of the F.R. Civ. P., to clarify the method
    of counting the number of days to respond after service either by
    mail or under Civil Rule 5(b)(2)(C) or (D). Three days are added
    after the prescribed period expires. If, before the application of
    Rule 9006(f), the prescribed period is less than 8 days,
    intervening Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are excluded
    from the calculation under Rule 9006(a). Some illustrations may be
    helpful.
      Under existing Rule 9006(a), assuming that there are no legal
    holidays and that a response is due in seven days, if a paper is
    filed on a Monday, the seven day response period commences on
    Tuesday and concludes on Wednesday of the next week. Adding three
    days to the end of the period would extend it to Saturday, but
    because the response period ends on a weekend, the response day
    would be the following Monday, two weeks after the filing of the
    initial paper. If the paper is filed on a Tuesday, the seven-day
    response period would end on the following Thursday, and the
    response time would also be the following Monday. If the paper is
    mailed on a Wednesday, the initial seven-day period would expire
    nine days later on a Friday, but the response would again be due on
    the following Monday because of Rule 9006(f). If the paper is
    mailed on a Thursday, however, the seven day period ends on Monday,
    eleven days after the mailing of the service because of the
    exclusion of the two intervening Saturdays and Sundays. The
    response is due three days later on the following Thursday. If the
    paper is mailed on a Friday, the seven day period would conclude on
    a Tuesday, and the response is due three days later on a Friday.
      No other change in the system of counting time is intended.
      Other changes are stylistic.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comment. The phrase "would
    otherwise expire under Rule 9006(a)" was added to the end of the
    rule to clarify further that the three day extension is to be added
    to the end of the period that is established under the counting
    provisions of Rule 9006(a). This also maintains a parallel
    construction with Civil Rule 6(e) in which the same addition to the
    rule was made after the public comment period.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (b)(3) is amended to implement Sec. 1116(3) of the
    Code, as amended by the 2005 amendments, which places specific
    limits on the extension of time for filing schedules and statements
    of financial affairs in a small business case.
      Subdivisions (b)(3) and (c)(2) are amended to provide that
    enlargement or reduction of the time to file the statement of
    completion of a personal financial management course required by
    Rule 1007(b)(7) are governed by Rule 1007(c). Likewise, the
    amendments to subdivisions (b)(3) and (c)(2) recognize that the
    enlargement of time to file a reaffirmation agreement is governed
    by Rule 4008(a), and that reduction of the time provided under that
    rule is not permitted.
      Other amendments are stylistic.
      Changes Made After Publication. Subdivision (b)(3) was amended to
    provide that Rule 9006 does not govern the enlargement of time to
    file a reaffirmation agreement, the statement required under Rule
    1007(b)(7), or the time to file schedules and statements of
    financial affairs in small business cases. The title of subdivision
    (b)(3) was also amended to more accurately describe the operation
    of the provision. Subdivision (c)(2) was amended to recognize that
    the court may not reduce the time under Rule 1007(c) to file the
    statement required by Rule 1007(b)(7).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a). Subdivision (a) has been amended to simplify and
    clarify the provisions that describe how deadlines are computed.
    Subdivision (a) governs the computation of any time period found in
    a Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure, a Federal Rule of Civil
    Procedure, a statute, a local rule, or a court order. In accordance
    with Bankruptcy Rule 9029(a), a local rule may not direct that a
    deadline be computed in a manner inconsistent with subdivision (a).
      The time-computation provisions of subdivision (a) apply only
    when a time period must be computed. They do not apply when a fixed
    time to act is set. The amendments thus carry forward the approach
    taken in Violette v. P.A. Days, Inc., 427 F.3d 1015, 1016 (6th Cir.
    2005) (holding that Civil Rule 6(a) "does not apply to situations
    where the court has established a specific calendar day as a
    deadline"), and reject the contrary holding of In re American
    Healthcare Management, Inc., 900 F.2d 827, 832 (5th Cir. 1990)
    (holding that Bankruptcy Rule 9006(a) governs treatment of date-
    certain deadline set by court order). If, for example, the date
    for filing is "no later than November 1, 2007," subdivision (a)
    does not govern. But if a filing is required to be made "within 10
    days" or "within 72 hours," subdivision (a) describes how that
    deadline is computed.
      Subdivision (a) does not apply when computing a time period set
    by a statute if the statute specifies a method of computing time.
    See, e.g., 11 U.S.C. Sec. 527(a)(2) (debt relief agencies must
    provide a written notice to an assisted person "not later than 3
    business days" after providing bankruptcy assistance services).
      Subdivision (a)(1). New subdivision (a)(1) addresses the
    computation of time periods that are stated in days. It also
    applies to time periods that are stated in weeks, months, or years.
    See, e.g., Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(c)(1) made applicable
    to bankruptcy cases under Rule 9024. Subdivision (a)(1)(B)'s
    directive to "count every day" is relevant only if the period is
    stated in days (not weeks, months, or years).
      Under former Rule 9006(a), a period of eight days or more was
    computed differently than a period of less than eight days.
    Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays were included
    in computing the longer periods, but excluded in computing the
    shorter periods. Former Rule 9006(a) thus made computing deadlines
    unnecessarily complicated and led to counterintuitive results.
      Under new subdivision (a)(1), all deadlines stated in days (no
    matter the length) are computed in the same way. The day of the
    event that triggers the deadline is not counted. All other days -
    including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays - are
    counted, with only one exception: If the period ends on a Saturday,
    Sunday, or legal holiday, then the deadline falls on the next day
    that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. An illustration
    is provided below in the discussion of subdivision (a)(5).
    Subdivision (a)(3) addresses filing deadlines that expire on a day
    when the clerk's office is inaccessible.
      Where subdivision (a) formerly referred to the "act, event, or
    default" that triggers the deadline, new subdivision (a) refers
    simply to the "event" that triggers the deadline; this change in
    terminology is adopted for brevity and simplicity, and is not
    intended to change meaning.
      Periods previously expressed as less than eight days will be
    shortened as a practical matter by the decision to count
    intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays in computing
    all periods. Many of those periods have been lengthened to
    compensate for the change. See, e.g., Rules 2008 (trustee's duty to
    notify court of acceptance of the appointment within five days is
    extended to seven days); 6004(b) (time for filing and service of
    objection to proposed use, sale or lease of property extended from
    five days prior to the hearing to seven days prior to the hearing);
    and 9006(d) (time for giving notice of a hearing extended from five
    days prior to the hearing to seven days).
      Most of the 10-day periods were adjusted to meet the change in
    computation method by setting 14 days as the new period. See, e.g.,
    Rules 1007(h) (10-day period to file supplemental schedule for
    property debtor becomes entitled to acquire after the commencement
    of the case is extended to 14 days); 3020(e) (10-day stay of order
    confirming a chapter 11 plan extended to 14 days); 8002(a) (10-day
    period in which to file notice of appeal extended to 14 days). A 14-
    day period also has the advantage that the final day falls on the
    same day of the week as the event that triggered the period -
    the14th day after a Monday, for example, is a Monday. This
    advantage of using week-long periods led to adopting seven-day
    periods to replace some of the periods set at less than 10 days, 21-
    day periods to replace 20-day periods, and 28-day periods to
    replace 25-day periods.Thirty-day and longer periods, however, were
    generally retained without change.
      Subdivision (a)(2). New subdivision (a)(2) addresses the
    computation of time periods that are stated in hours. No such
    deadline currently appears in the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy
    Procedure. But some statutes contain deadlines stated in hours, as
    do some court orders issued in expedited proceedings.
      Under subdivision (a)(2), a deadline stated in hours starts to
    run immediately on the occurrence of the event that triggers the
    deadline. The deadline generally ends when the time expires. If,
    however, the time period expires at a specific time (say, 2:17
    p.m.) on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the deadline is
    extended to the same time (2:17 p.m.) on the next day that is not a
    Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Periods stated in hours are not
    to be "rounded up" to the next whole hour. Subdivision (a)(3)
    addresses situations when the clerk's office is inaccessible during
    the last hour before a filing deadline expires.
      Subdivision (a)(2)(B) directs that every hour be counted. Thus,
    for example, a 72-hour period that commences at 10:23 a.m. on
    Friday, November 2, 2007, will run until 9:23 a.m. on Monday,
    November 5; the discrepancy in start and end times in this example
    results from the intervening shift from daylight saving time to
    standard time.
      Subdivision (a)(3). When determining the last day of a filing
    period stated in days or a longer unit of time, a day on which the
    clerk's office is not accessible because of the weather or another
    reason is treated like a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. When
    determining the end of a filing period stated in hours, if the
    clerk's office is inaccessible during the last hour of the filing
    period computed under subdivision (a)(2) then the period is
    extended to the same time on the next day that is not a weekend,
    holiday, or day when the clerk's office is inaccessible.
      Subdivision (a)(3)'s extensions apply "[u]nless the court orders
    otherwise." In some circumstances, the court might not wish a
    period of inaccessibility to trigger a full 24-hour extension; in
    those instances, the court can specify a briefer extension.
      The text of the rule no longer refers to "weather or other
    conditions" as the reason for the inaccessibility of the clerk's
    office. The reference to "weather" was deleted from the text to
    underscore that inaccessibility can occur for reasons unrelated to
    weather, such as an outage of the electronic filing system. Weather
    can still be a reason for inaccessibility of the clerk's office.
    The rule does not attempt to define inaccessibility. Rather, the
    concept will continue to develop through caselaw. See, e.g.,
    William G. Phelps, When Is Office of Clerk of Court Inaccessible
    Due to Weather or Other Conditions for Purpose of Computing Time
    Period for Filing Papers under Rule 6(a) of Federal Rules of Civil
    Procedure, 135 A.L.R. Fed. 259 (1996) (collecting cases). In
    addition, many local provisions address inaccessibility for
    purposes of electronic filing. See, e.g., D. Kan. Rule 5.4.11 ("A
    Filing User whose filing is made untimely as the result of a
    technical failure may seek appropriate relief from the court.").
      Subdivision (a)(4). New subdivision (a)(4) defines the end of the
    last day of a period for purposes of subdivision (a)(1).
    Subdivision (a)(4) does not apply in computing periods stated in
    hours under subdivision (a)(2), and does not apply if a different
    time is set by a statute, local rule, or order in the case. A local
    rule may provide, for example, that papers filed in a drop box
    after the normal hours of the clerk's office are filed as of the
    day that is date-stamped on the papers by a device in the drop box.
      28 U.S.C. Sec. 452 provides that "[a]ll courts of the United
    States shall be deemed always open for the purpose of filing proper
    papers, issuing and returning process, and making motions and
    orders." A corresponding provision exists in Rule 5001(a). Some
    courts have held that these provisions permit an after-hours filing
    by handing the papers to an appropriate official. See, e.g.,
    Casalduc v. Diaz, 117 F.2d 915, 917 (1st Cir. 1941). Subdivision
    (a)(4) does not address the effect of the statute on the question
    of after-hours filing; instead, the rule is designed to deal with
    filings in the ordinary course without regard to Section 452.
      Subdivision (a)(5). New subdivision (a)(5) defines the "next" day
    for purposes of subdivisions (a)(1)(C) and (a)(2)(C). The Federal
    Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure contain both forward-looking time
    periods and backward-looking time periods. A forward-looking time
    period requires something to be done within a period of time after
    an event. See, e.g., Rules 1007(c) (["]the schedules, statements,
    and other documents shall be filed by the debtor within 14 days of
    the entry of the order for relief"); 1019(5)(B)(ii) ("the trustee,
    not later than 30 days after conversion of the case, shall file and
    transmit to the United States trustee a final report and account");
    and 7012(a) ("If a complaint is duly served, the defendant shall
    serve an answer within 30 days after the issuance of the summons,
    except when a different time is prescribed by the court.").
      A backward-looking time period requires something to be done
    within a period of time before an event. See, e.g., Rules 6004(b)
    ("an objection to a proposed use, sale, or lease of property shall
    be filed and served not less than seven days before the date set
    for the proposed action"); 9006(d) ("A written motion, other than
    one which may be heard ex parte, and notice of any hearing shall be
    served not later than seven days before the time specified for such
    hearing"). In determining what is the "next" day for purposes of
    subdivisions (a)(1)(C) and (a)(2)(C), one should continue counting
    in the same direction - that is, forward when computing a forward-
    looking period and backward when computing a backward-looking
    period. If, for example, a filing is due within 10 days after an
    event, and the tenth day falls on Saturday, September 1, 2007, then
    the filing is due on Tuesday, September 4, 2007 (Monday, September
    3, is Labor Day). But if a filing is due 10 days before an event,
    and the tenth day falls on Saturday, September 1, then the filing
    is due on Friday, August 31.
      Subdivision (a)(6). New subdivision (a)(6) defines "legal
    holiday" for purposes of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure,
    including the time-computation provisions of subdivision (a).
    Subdivision (a)(6) continues to include within the definition of
    "legal holiday" days that are declared a holiday by the President
    or Congress.
      For forward-counted periods - i.e., periods that are measured
    after an event - subdivision (a)(6)(C) includes certain state
    holidays within the definition of legal holidays, and defines the
    term "state" - for purposes of subdivision (a)(6) - to include the
    District of Columbia and any commonwealth or territory of the
    United States. Thus, for purposes of subdivision (a)(6)'s
    definition of "legal holiday," "state" includes the District of
    Columbia, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the
    Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Commonwealth of the Northern
    Mariana Islands.
      However, state legal holidays are not recognized in computing
    backward-counted periods. For both forward- and backward-counted
    periods, the rule thus protects those who may be unsure of the
    effect of state holidays. For forward-counted deadlines, treating
    state holidays the same as federal holidays extends the deadline.
    Thus, someone who thought that the federal courts might be closed
    on a state holiday would be safeguarded against an inadvertent late
    filing. In contrast, for backward-counted deadlines, not giving
    state holidays the treatment of federal holidays allows filing on
    the state holiday itself rather than the day before. Take, for
    example, Monday, April 21, 2008 (Patriot's Day, a legal holiday in
    the relevant state). If a filing is due 14 days after an event, and
    the fourteenth day is April 21, then the filing is due on Tuesday,
    April 22 because Monday, April 21 counts as a legal holiday. But if
    a filing is due 14 days before an event, and the fourteenth day is
    April 21, the filing is due on Monday, April 21; the fact that
    April 21 is a state holiday does not make April 21 a legal holiday
    for purposes of computing this backward-counted deadline. But note
    that if the clerk's office is inaccessible on Monday, April 21,
    then subdivision (a)(3) extends the April 21 filing deadline
    forward to the next accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday
    or legal holiday - no earlier than Tuesday, April 22.
      Changes Made After Publication. The reference to Rule 6(a)(1) in
    subdivision (a)(3)(A) at line 50 of the rule as it was published
    was corrected by referring instead to Rule 9006(a)(1).
      The Standing Committee changed Rule 9006(a)(6) to exclude state
    holidays from the definition of "legal holiday" for purposes of
    computing backward-counted periods; conforming changes were made to
    the Committee Note to subdivision (a)(6). In addition, the term
    "possession" was deleted from the definition of "state" in
    subdivision (a)(6), and a conforming change was made to the
    Committee Note.
      [Subdivision (d).] The rule is amended to implement changes in
    connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by
    which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is
    amended to substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days.
    Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
    manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 15-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 20-day periods become 21-day periods
        -- 25-day periods become 28-day periods
      Subdivision (f) is amended to conform to the changes made to Rule
    5(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as a part of the
    Civil Rules Restyling Project. As a part of that project,
    subparagraphs (b)(2)(C) and (D) of that rule were rewritten as
    subparagraphs (b)(2)(D), (E), and (F). The cross reference to those
    rules contained in subdivision (f) of this rule is corrected by
    this amendment.

-HEAD-
    Rule 9009. Forms

-STATUTE-
      Except as otherwise provided in Rule 3016(d), the Official Forms
    prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States shall be
    observed and used with alterations as may be appropriate. Forms may
    be combined and their contents rearranged to permit economies in
    their use. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United
    States Courts may issue additional forms for use under the Code.
    The forms shall be construed to be consistent with these rules and
    the Code.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      The rule continues the obligatory character of the Official Forms
    in the interest of facilitating the processing of the paperwork of
    bankruptcy administration, but provides that Official Forms will be
    prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States. The
    Supreme Court and the Congress will thus be relieved of the burden
    of considering the large number of complex forms used in bankruptcy
    practice. The use of the Official Forms has generally been held
    subject to a "rule of substantial compliance" and some of these
    rules, for example Rule 1002, specifically state that the filed
    document need only "conform substantially" to the Official Form.
    See also Rule 9005. The second sentence recognizes the propriety of
    combining and rearranging Official Forms to take advantage of
    technological developments and resulting economies.
      The Director of the Administrative Office is authorized to issue
    additional forms for the guidance of the bar.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 9029 [9009] is amended to clarify that local court rules may
    not prohibit or limit the use of the Official Forms.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to provide that a plan proponent in a small
    business chapter 11 case need not use an Official Form of a plan of
    reorganization and disclosure statement. The use of those forms is
    optional, and under Rule 3016(d) the proponent may submit a plan
    and disclosure statement in those cases that does not conform to
    the Official Forms.
      Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after
    publication.

-HEAD-
    Rule 9010. Representation and Appearances; Powers of Attorney

-STATUTE-
      (a) Authority To Act Personally or by Attorney. A debtor,
    creditor, equity security holder, indenture trustee, committee or
    other party may (1) appear in a case under the Code and act either
    in the entity's own behalf or by an attorney authorized to practice
    in the court, and (2) perform any act not constituting the practice
    of law, by an authorized agent, attorney in fact, or proxy.
      (b) Notice of Appearance. An attorney appearing for a party in a
    case under the Code shall file a notice of appearance with the
    attorney's name, office address and telephone number, unless the
    attorney's appearance is otherwise noted in the record.
      (c) Power of Attorney. The authority of any agent, attorney in
    fact, or proxy to represent a creditor for any purpose other than
    the execution and filing of a proof of claim or the acceptance or
    rejection of a plan shall be evidenced by a power of attorney
    conforming substantially to the appropriate Official Form. The
    execution of any such power of attorney shall be acknowledged
    before one of the officers enumerated in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 459, Sec.
    953, Rule 9012, or a person authorized to administer oaths under
    the laws of the state where the oath is administered.

    TITLE 11 - APPENDIX
    FEDERAL RULES OF BANKRUPTCY PROCEDURE AND OFFICIAL BANKRUPTCY FORMS
    PART IX - GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 9011. Signing of Papers; Representations to the Court;
      Sanctions; Verification and Copies of Papers

-STATUTE-
      (a) Signature. Every petition, pleading, written motion, and
    other paper, except a list, schedule, or statement, or amendments
    thereto, shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in the
    attorney's individual name. A party who is not represented by an
    attorney shall sign all papers. Each paper shall state the signer's
    address and telephone number, if any. An unsigned paper shall be
    stricken unless omission of the signature is corrected promptly
    after being called to the attention of the attorney or party.
      (b) Representations to the Court. By presenting to the court
    (whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating) a
    petition, pleading, written motion, or other paper, an attorney or
    unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the person's
    knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry
    reasonable under the circumstances, -  (!1)

        (1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as
      to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in
      the cost of litigation;
        (2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein
      are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for
      the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the
      establishment of new law;
        (3) the allegations and other factual contentions have
      evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are likely
      to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for
      further investigation or discovery; and
        (4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the
      evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based
      on a lack of information or belief.

      (c) Sanctions. If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to
    respond, the court determines that subdivision (b) has been
    violated, the court may, subject to the conditions stated below,
    impose an appropriate sanction upon the attorneys, law firms, or
    parties that have violated subdivision (b) or are responsible for
    the violation.
        (1) How Initiated.
          (A) By Motion. A motion for sanctions under this rule shall
        be made separately from other motions or requests and shall
        describe the specific conduct alleged to violate subdivision
        (b). It shall be served as provided in Rule 7004. The motion
        for sanctions may not be filed with or presented to the court
        unless, within 21 days after service of the motion (or such
        other period as the court may prescribe), the challenged paper,
        claim, defense, contention, allegation, or denial is not
        withdrawn or appropriately corrected, except that this
        limitation shall not apply if the conduct alleged is the filing
        of a petition in violation of subdivision (b). If warranted,
        the court may award to the party prevailing on the motion the
        reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred in presenting
        or opposing the motion. Absent exceptional circumstances, a law
        firm shall be held jointly responsible for violations committed
        by its partners, associates, and employees.
          (B) On Court's Initiative. On its own initiative, the court
        may enter an order describing the specific conduct that appears
        to violate subdivision (b) and directing an attorney, law firm,
        or party to show cause why it has not violated subdivision (b)
        with respect thereto.

        (2) Nature of Sanction; Limitations. A sanction imposed for
      violation of this rule shall be limited to what is sufficient to
      deter repetition of such conduct or comparable conduct by others
      similarly situated. Subject to the limitations in subparagraphs
      (A) and (B), the sanction may consist of, or include, directives
      of a nonmonetary nature, an order to pay a penalty into court,
      or, if imposed on motion and warranted for effective deterrence,
      an order directing payment to the movant of some or all of the
      reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred as a
      direct result of the violation.
          (A) Monetary sanctions may not be awarded against a
        represented party for a violation of subdivision (b)(2).
          (B) Monetary sanctions may not be awarded on the court's
        initiative unless the court issues its order to show cause
        before a voluntary dismissal or settlement of the claims made
        by or against the party which is, or whose attorneys are, to be
        sanctioned.

        (3) Order. When imposing sanctions, the court shall describe
      the conduct determined to constitute a violation of this rule and
      explain the basis for the sanction imposed.

      (d) Inapplicability To Discovery. Subdivisions (a) through (c) of
    this rule do not apply to disclosures and discovery requests,
    responses, objections, and motions that are subject to the
    provisions of Rules 7026 through 7037.
      (e) Verification. Except as otherwise specifically provided by
    these rules, papers filed in a case under the Code need not be
    verified. Whenever verification is required by these rules, an
    unsworn declaration as provided in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1746 satisfies
    the requirement of verification.
      (f) Copies of Signed or Verified Papers. When these rules require
    copies of a signed or verified paper, it shall suffice if the
    original is signed or verified and the copies are conformed to the
    original.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Subdivision (a). Excepted from the papers which an attorney for a
    debtor must sign are lists, schedules, statements of financial
    affairs, statements of executory contracts, Chapter 13 Statements
    and amendments thereto. Rule 1008 requires that these documents be
    verified by the debtor. Although the petition must also be
    verified, counsel for the debtor must sign the petition. See
    Official Form No. 1. An unrepresented party must sign all papers.
      The last sentence of this subdivision authorizes a broad range of
    sanctions.
      The word "document" is used in this subdivision to refer to all
    papers which the attorney or party is required to sign.
      Subdivision (b) extends to all papers filed in cases under the
    Code the policy of minimizing reliance on the formalities of
    verification which is reflected in the third sentence of Rule 11
    F.R.Civ.P. The second sentence of subdivision (b) permits the
    substitution of an unsworn declaration for the verification. See 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 1746. Rules requiring verification or an affidavit are
    as follows: Rule 1008, petitions, schedules, statements of
    financial affairs, Chapter 13 Statements and amendments; Rule
    2006(e), list of multiple proxies and statement of facts and
    circumstances regarding their acquisition; Rule 4001(c), motion for
    ex parte relief from stay; Rule 7065, incorporating Rule 65(b)
    F.R.Civ.P. governing issuance of temporary restraining order; Rule
    8011(d), affidavit in support of emergency motion on appeal.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The statement of intention of the debtor under Sec. 521(2) of the
    Code is added to the documents which counsel is not required to
    sign.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) is amended to conform to Rule 11 F.R.Civ.P. where
    appropriate, but also to clarify that it applies to the unnecessary
    delay or needless increase in the cost of the administration of the
    case. Deletion of the references to specific statements that are
    excluded from the scope of this subdivision is stylistic. As used
    in subdivision (a) of this rule, "statement" is limited to the
    statement of financial affairs and the statement of intention
    required to be filed under Rule 1007. Deletion of the reference to
    the Chapter 13 Statement is consistent with the amendment to Rule
    1007(b).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to conform to the 1993 changes to F.R.Civ.P.
    11. For an explanation of these amendments, see the advisory
    committee note to the 1993 amendments to F.R.Civ.P. 11.
      The "safe harbor" provision contained in subdivision (c)(1)(A),
    which prohibits the filing of a motion for sanctions unless the
    challenged paper is not withdrawn or corrected within a prescribed
    time after service of the motion, does not apply if the challenged
    paper is a petition. The filing of a petition has immediate serious
    consequences, including the imposition of the automatic stay under
    Sec. 362 of the Code, which may not be avoided by the subsequent
    withdrawal of the petition. In addition, a petition for relief
    under chapter 7 or chapter 11 may not be withdrawn unless the court
    orders dismissal of the case for cause after notice and a hearing.
      GAP Report on Rule 9011. The proposed amendments to subdivision
    (a) were revised to clarify that a party not represented by an
    attorney must sign lists, schedules, and statements, as well as
    other papers that are filed.

    may administer oaths and affirmations and take acknowledgments: a
    bankruptcy judge, clerk, deputy clerk, United States trustee,
    officer authorized to administer oaths in proceedings before the
    courts of the United States or under the laws of the state where
    the oath is to be taken, or a diplomatic or consular officer of the
    United States in any foreign country.
      (b) Affirmation in Lieu of Oath. When in a case under the Code an
    oath is required to be taken a solemn affirmation may be accepted
    in lieu thereof.

      This rule is derived from Rule 43(d) F.R.Civ.P.
      The provisions of former Bankruptcy Rule 912(a) relating to who
    may administer oaths have been deleted as unnecessary. Bankruptcy
    judges and the clerks and deputy clerks of bankruptcy courts are
    authorized by statute to administer oaths and affirmations and to
    take acknowledgments. 28 U.S.C. Secs. 459, 953. A person designated
    to preside at the meeting of creditors has authority under Rule
    2003(b)(1) to administer the oath. Administration of the oath at a
    deposition is governed by Rule 7028.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a) has been added to the rule to authorize
    bankruptcy judges and clerks to administer oaths.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to conform to the 1986 amendment to Sec. 343
    which provides that the United States trustee may administer the
    oath to the debtor at the Sec. 341 meeting. This rule also allows
    the United States trustee to administer oaths and affirmations and
    to take acknowledgments in other situations. This amendment also
    affects Rule 9010(c) relating to the acknowledgment of a power of
    attorney. The words "United States trustee" include a designee of
    the United States trustee pursuant to Rule 9001 and Sec. 102(9) of
    the Code.

-HEAD-
    Rule 9014. Contested Matters

-STATUTE-
      (a) Motion. In a contested matter not otherwise governed by these
    rules, relief shall be requested by motion, and reasonable notice
    and opportunity for hearing shall be afforded the party against
    whom relief is sought. No response is required under this rule
    unless the court directs otherwise.
      (b) Service. The motion shall be served in the manner provided
    for service of a summons and complaint by Rule 7004. Any paper
    served after the motion shall be served in the manner provided by
    Rule 5(b) F. R. Civ. P.
      (c) Application of Part VII Rules. Except as otherwise provided
    in this rule, and unless the court directs otherwise, the following
    rules shall apply: 7009, 7017, 7021, 7025, 7026, 7028-7037, 7041,
    7042, 7052, 7054-7056, 7064, 7069, and 7071. The following
    subdivisions of Fed. R. Civ. P. 26, as incorporated by Rule 7026,
    shall not apply in a contested matter unless the court directs
    otherwise: 26(a)(1) (mandatory disclosure), 26(a)(2) (disclosures
    regarding expert testimony) and 26(a)(3) (additional pre-trial
    disclosure), and 26(f) (mandatory meeting before scheduling
    conference/discovery plan). An entity that desires to perpetuate
    testimony may proceed in the same manner as provided in Rule 7027
    for the taking of a deposition before an adversary proceeding. The
    court may at any stage in a particular matter direct that one or
    more of the other rules in Part VII shall apply. The court shall
    give the parties notice of any order issued under this paragraph to
    afford them a reasonable opportunity to comply with the procedures
    prescribed by the order.
      (d) Testimony of Witnesses. Testimony of witnesses with respect
    to disputed material factual issues shall be taken in the same
    manner as testimony in an adversary proceeding.
      (e) Attendance of Witnesses. The court shall provide procedures
    that enable parties to ascertain at a reasonable time before any
    scheduled hearing whether the hearing will be an evidentiary
    hearing at which witnesses may testify.

-MISC1-

      Rules 1017(d), 3020(b)(1), 4001(a), 4003(d), and 6006(a), which
    govern respectively dismissal or conversion of a case, objections
    to confirmation of a plan, relief from the automatic stay and the
    use of cash collateral, avoidance of a lien under Sec. 552(f) of
    the Code, and the assumption or rejection of executory contracts or
    unexpired leases, specifically provide that litigation under those
    rules shall be as provided in Rule 9014. This rule also governs
    litigation in other contested matters.
      Whenever there is an actual dispute, other than an adversary
    proceeding, before the bankruptcy court, the litigation to resolve
    that dispute is a contested matter. For example, the filing of an
    objection to a proof of claim, to a claim of exemption, or to a
    disclosure statement creates a dispute which is a contested matter.
    Even when an objection is not formally required, there may be a
    dispute. If a party in interest opposes the amount of compensation
    sought by a professional, there is a dispute which is a contested
    matter.
      When the rules of Part VII are applicable to a contested matter,
    reference in the Part VII rules to adversary proceedings is to be
    read as a reference to a contested matter. See Rule 9002(1).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 1999 AMENDMENT             
      This rule is amended to delete Rule 7062 from the list of Part
    VII rules that automatically apply in a contested matter.
      Rule 7062 provides that Rule 62 F.R.Civ.P., which governs stays
    of proceedings to enforce a judgment, is applicable in adversary
    proceedings. The provisions of Rule 62, including the ten-day
    automatic stay of the enforcement of a judgment provided by Rule
    62(a) and the stay as a matter of right by posting a supersedeas
    bond provided in Rule 62(d), are not appropriate for most orders
    granting or denying motions governed by Rule 9014.
      Although Rule 7062 will not apply automatically in contested
    matters, the amended rule permits the court, in its discretion, to
    order that Rule 7062 apply in a particular matter, and Rule 8005
    gives the court discretion to issue a stay or any other appropriate
    order during the pendency of an appeal on such terms as will
    protect the rights of all parties in interest. In addition,
    amendments to Rules 3020, 4001, 6004, and 6006 automatically stay
    certain types of orders for a period of ten days, unless the court
    orders otherwise.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      The list of Part VII rules that are applicable in a contested
    matter is extended to include Rule 7009 on pleading special
    matters, and Rule 7017 on real parties in interest, infants and
    incompetent persons, and capacity. The discovery rules made
    applicable in adversary proceedings apply in contested matters
    unless the court directs otherwise.
      Subdivision (b) is amended to permit parties to serve papers,
    other than the original motion, in the manner provided in Rule 5(b)
    F.R. Civ.P. When the court requires a response to the motion, this
    amendment will permit service of the response in the same manner as
    an answer is served in an adversary proceeding.
      Subdivision (d) is added to clarify that if the motion cannot be
    decided without resolving a disputed material issue of fact, an
    evidentiary hearing must be held at which testimony of witnesses is
    taken in the same manner as testimony is taken in an adversary
    proceeding or at a trial in a district court civil case. Rule
    43(a), rather than Rule 43(e), F.R. Civ.P. would govern the
    evidentiary hearing on the factual dispute. Under Rule 9017, the
    Federal Rules of Evidence also apply in a contested matter. Nothing
    in the rule prohibits a court from resolving any matter that is
    submitted on affidavits by agreement of the parties.
      Subdivision (e). Local procedures for hearings and other court
    appearances in a contested matter vary from district to district.
    In some bankruptcy courts, an evidentiary hearing at which
    witnesses may testify usually is held at the first court appearance
    in the contested matter. In other courts, it is customary for the
    court to delay the evidentiary hearing on disputed factual issues
    until some time after the initial hearing date. In order to avoid
    unnecessary expense and inconvenience, it is important for
    attorneys to know whether they should bring witnesses to a court
    appearance. The purpose of the final sentence of this rule is to
    require that the court provide a mechanism that will enable
    attorneys to know at a reasonable time before a scheduled hearing
    whether it will be necessary for witnesses to appear in court on
    that particular date.
      Other amendments to this rule are stylistic.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments:
      The Advisory Committee made two changes to subdivision (d) after
    considering the comments received addressing the proposed rule.
    First, the word "material" is inserted to make explicit that which
    was implied in the published version of the proposed rule. Second,
    the reference to F.R.Civ.P. 43(a) was removed. The purpose of
    proposed subdivision (d) was to recognize that testimony should be
    taken in the same manner in both contested matters and adversary
    proceedings. The revision to the published rule states this more
    directly.
      The Committee Note was amended to reflect the changes made in the
    text of the rule.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2004 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to provide that the mandatory disclosure
    requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 26, as incorporated by Rule 7026,
    do not apply in contested matters. The typically short time between
    the commencement and resolution of most contested matters makes the
    mandatory disclosure provisions of Rule 26 ineffective.
    Nevertheless, the court may by local rule or by order in a
    particular case provide that these provisions of the rule apply in
    a contested matter.
      Changes Made After Publication. No changes since publication.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended by deleting Rule 50 F.R.Civ.P. from the list
    in subdivision (a) of rules made applicable in cases and
    proceedings. However, subdivision (c) is added to make Rule 50
    applicable in cases and proceedings, but it limits the time for
    filing certain post judgment motions to 14 days after the entry of
    judgment. The amendment is necessary because Rule 50 F.R.Civ.P. was
    amended in 2009 to extend the deadline for the filing of these post
    judgment motions to 28 days. That deadline corresponds to the 30-
    day deadline for filing a notice of appeal in a civil case under
    Rule 4(a)(1)(A) F.R.App.P. In a bankruptcy case, the deadline for
    filing a notice of appeal is 14 days. Therefore, the 28-day
    deadline for filing these post judgment motions would effectively
    override the notice of appeal deadline under Rule 8002(a) but for
    this amendment.
      Other amendments are stylistic.

    Rule 9020. Contempt Proceedings

    United States trustee or a party in interest.

-SOURCE-

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Section 1481 of Title 28 provides that a bankruptcy court "may
    not . . . punish a criminal contempt not committed in the presence
    of the judge of the court or warranting a punishment of
    imprisonment." Rule 9020 does not enlarge the power of bankruptcy
    courts.
      Subdivision (a) is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 920 and
    Rule 42 F.R.Crim.P. Paragraph (1) of the subdivision permits
    summary imposition of punishment for contempt if the conduct is in
    the presence of the court and is of such nature that the conduct
    "obstruct[s] the administration of justice." See 18 U.S.C. Sec.
    401(a). Cases interpreting Rule 42(a) F.R.Crim.P. have held that
    when criminal contempt is in question summary disposition should be
    the exception: summary disposition should be reserved for
    situations where it is necessary to protect the judicial
    institution. 3 Wright, Federal Practice & Procedure - Criminal Sec.
    707 (1969). Those cases are equally pertinent to the application of
    this rule and, therefore, contemptuous conduct in the presence of
    the judge may often be punished only after the notice and hearing
    requirements of subdivision (b) are satisfied.
      If the bankruptcy court concludes it is without power to punish
    or to impose the proper punishment for conduct which constitutes
    contempt, subdivision (a)(3) authorizes the bankruptcy court to
    certify the matter to the district court.
      Subdivision (b) makes clear that when a person has a
    constitutional or statutory right to a jury trial in a criminal
    contempt matter this rule in no way affects that right. See Frank
    v. United States, 395 U.S. 147 (1969).
      The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not specifically provide
    the procedure for the imposition of civil contempt sanctions. The
    decisional law governing the procedure for imposition of civil
    sanctions by the district courts will be equally applicable to the
    bankruptcy courts.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      The United States Bankruptcy Courts, as constituted under the
    Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, were courts of law, equity, and
    admiralty with an inherent contempt power, but former 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 1481 restricted the criminal contempt power of bankruptcy
    judges. Under the 1984 amendments, bankruptcy judges are judicial
    officers of the district court, 28 U.S.C. Secs. 151, 152(a)(1).
    There are no decisions by the courts of appeals concerning the
    authority of bankruptcy judges to punish for either civil or
    criminal contempt under the 1984 amendments. This rule, as amended,
    recognizes that bankruptcy judges may not have the power to punish
    for contempt.
      Sound judicial administration requires that the initial
    determination of whether contempt has been committed should be made
    by the bankruptcy judge. If timely objections are not filed to the
    bankruptcy judge's order, the order has the same force and effect
    as an order of the district court. If objections are filed within
    10 days of service of the order, the district court conducts a de
    novo review pursuant to Rule 9033 and any order of contempt is
    entered by the district court on completion of the court's review
    of the bankruptcy judge's order.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      The words "with the clerk" in subdivision (c) are deleted as
    unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2001 AMENDMENT             
      The amendments to this rule cover a motion for an order of
    contempt filed by the United States trustee or a party in interest.
    This rule, as amended, does not address a contempt proceeding
    initiated by the court sua sponte.
      Whether the court is acting on motion under this rule or is
    acting sua sponte, these amendments are not intended to extend,
    limit, or otherwise affect either the contempt power of a
    bankruptcy judge or the role of the district judge regarding
    contempt orders. Issues relating to the contempt power of
    bankruptcy judges are substantive and are left to statutory and
    judicial development, rather than procedural rules.
      This rule, as amended in 1987, delayed for ten days from service
    the effectiveness of a bankruptcy judge's order of contempt and
    rendered the order subject to de novo review by the district court.
    These limitations on contempt orders were added to the rule in
    response to the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of
    1984, Pub. L. No. 98-353, 98 Stat. 333, which provides that
    bankruptcy judges are judicial officers of the district court, but
    does not specifically mention contempt power. See 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    151. As explained in the committee note to the 1987 amendments to
    this rule, no decisions of the courts of appeals existed concerning
    the authority of a bankruptcy judge to punish for either civil or
    criminal contempt under the 1984 Act and, therefore, the rule as
    amended in 1987 "recognizes that bankruptcy judges may not have the
    power to punish for contempt." Committee Note to 1987 Amendments to
    Rule 9020.
      Since 1987, several courts of appeals have held that bankruptcy
    judges have the power to issue civil contempt orders. See, e.g.,
    Matter of Terrebonne Fuel and Lube, Inc., 108 F.3d 609 (5th Cir.
    1997); In re Rainbow Magazine, Inc., 77 F.3d 278 (9th Cir. 1996).
    Several courts have distinguished between a bankruptcy judge's
    civil contempt power and criminal contempt power. See, e.g., Matter
    of Terrebonne Fuel and Lube, Inc., 108 F.3d at 613, n. 3
    ("[a]lthough we find that bankruptcy judge's [sic] can find a party
    in civil contempt, we must point out that bankruptcy courts lack
    the power to hold persons in criminal contempt."). For other
    decisions regarding criminal contempt power, see, e.g., In re
    Ragar, 3 F.3d 1174 (8th Cir. 1993); Matter of Hipp, Inc., 895 F.2d
    1503 (5th Cir. 1990). To the extent that Rule 9020, as amended in
    1987, delayed the effectiveness of civil contempt orders and
    required de novo review by the district court, the rule may have
    been unnecessarily restrictive in view of judicial decisions
    recognizing that bankruptcy judges have the power to hold parties
    in civil contempt.
      Subdivision (d), which provides that the rule shall not be
    construed to impair the right to trial by jury, is deleted as
    unnecessary and is not intended to deprive any party of the right
    to a jury trial when it otherwise exists.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made
    in the text of the proposed amendments. Stylistic changes were made
    to the Committee Note.

      Subdivision (a). This rule is derived from Rule 58 F.R.Civ.P. The
    requirement that a judgment entered in an adversary proceeding or
    contested matter be set forth on a separate document is to
    eliminate uncertainty as to whether an opinion or memorandum of the
    court is a judgment. There is no sound reason to require that every
    order in a case under the Code be evidenced by a separate document.
      Subdivision (b) establishes a procedure for entering a judgment
    of a bankruptcy court for the recovery of money or property in an
    index of judgments kept by the clerk of the district court. It
    clarifies the availability of the same remedies for the enforcement
    of a bankruptcy court judgment as those provided for the
    enforcement of a district court judgment. See 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1961-
    63. When indexed in accordance with subdivision (b) of this rule a
    judgment of the bankruptcy court may be found by anyone searching
    for liens of record in the judgment records of the district court.
    Certification of a copy of the judgment to the clerk of the
    district court provides a basis for registration of the judgment
    pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1963 in any other district. When so
    registered, the judgment may be enforced by issuance of execution
    and orders for supplementary proceedings that may be served
    anywhere within the state where the registering court sits. See 7
    Moore, Federal Practice 2409-11 (2d ed. 1971). The procedures
    available in the district court are not exclusive, however, and the
    holder of a judgment entered by the bankruptcy court may use the
    remedies under Rules 7069 and 7070 even if the judgment is indexed
    by the clerk of the district court.
      Subdivision (c) makes it clear that when a district court hears a
    matter reserved to it by 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1471, 1481, its judgments
    are entered in the district court's civil docket and in the docket
    of the bankruptcy court. When the district court acts as an
    appellate court, Rule 8016(a) governs the entry of judgments on
    appeal.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Former subdivision (a) was derived from Rule 58 F.R.Civ.P. As
    amended, Rule 9021 adopts Rule 58. The reference in Rule 58 to Rule
    79(a) F.R.Civ.P. is to be read as a reference to Rule 5003.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended in connection with the amendment that adds
    Rule 7058. The entry of judgment in adversary proceedings is
    governed by Rule 7058, and the entry of a judgment or order in all
    other proceedings is governed by this rule.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Judgment or Order of Bankruptcy Judge. Immediately on the
    entry of a judgment or order the clerk shall serve a notice of
    entry in the manner provided in Rule 5(b) F.R.Civ.P. on the
    contesting parties and on other entities as the court directs.
    Unless the case is a chapter 9 municipality case, the clerk shall
    forthwith transmit to the United States trustee a copy of the
    judgment or order. Service of the notice shall be noted in the
    docket. Lack of notice of the entry does not affect the time to
    appeal or relieve or authorize the court to relieve a party for
    failure to appeal within the time allowed, except as permitted in
    Rule 8002.
      (b) Judgment or Order of District Judge. Notice of a judgment or
    order entered by a district judge is governed by Rule 77(d)
    F.R.Civ.P. Unless the case is a chapter 9 municipality case, the
    clerk shall forthwith transmit to the United States trustee a copy
    of a judgment or order entered by a district judge.

    F.R.Civ.P.
      Subdivision (b) complements Rule 9021(b). When a district court

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to enable the United States trustee to be

    supervisory functions provided in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 586(a) may be
    performed.

    proceedings by Rule 7005, is being restyled and amended to
    authorize service by electronic means - or any other means not
    otherwise authorized under Rule 5(b) - if consent is obtained from
    the person served. The amendment to Rule 9022(a) authorizes the
    clerk to serve notice of entry of a judgment or order by electronic
    means if the person served consents, or to use any other means of
    service authorized under Rule 5(b), including service by mail. This

    Rule 9023. New Trials; Amendment of Judgments

-STATUTE-
      Except as provided in this rule and Rule 3008, Rule 59 F.R.Civ.P.
    applies in cases under the Code. A motion for a new trial or to
    alter or amend a judgment shall be filed, and a court may on its
    own order a new trial, no later than 14 days after entry of
    judgment.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Rule 59 F.R.Civ.P. regulates motions for a new trial and
    amendment of judgment. Those motions must be served within 10 days
    of the entry of judgment. No similar time limit is contained in
    Rule 3008 which governs reconsideration of claims.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to limit to 14 days the time for a party to
    file a post judgment motion for a new trial and for the court to
    order sua sponte a new trial. In 2009, Rule 59 F. R. Civ. P. was
    amended to extend the deadline for these actions to 28 days after
    the entry of judgment. That deadline corresponds to the 30-day
    deadline for filing a notice of appeal in a civil case under Rule
    4(a)(1)(A) F.R.App.P. In a bankruptcy case, however, the deadline
    for filing a notice of appeal is 14 days. Therefore, the 28-day
    deadline for filing a motion for a new trial or a motion to alter
    or amend a judgment would effectively override the notice of appeal
    deadline under Rule 8002(a) but for this amendment.

    (1) a motion to reopen a case under the Code or for the
    reconsideration of an order allowing or disallowing a claim against
    the estate entered without a contest is not subject to the one year

      Motions to reopen cases are governed by Rule 5010.
    Reconsideration of orders allowing and disallowing claims is
    governed by Rule 3008. For the purpose of this rule all orders of
    the bankruptcy court are subject to Rule 60 F.R.Civ.P.
      Pursuant to Sec. 727(e) of the Code a complaint to revoke a
    discharge must be filed within one year of the entry of the
    discharge or, when certain grounds of revocation are asserted, the
    later of one year after the entry of the discharge or the date the
    case is closed. Under Sec. 1144 and Sec. 1330 of the Code a party
    must file a complaint to revoke an order confirming a chapter 11 or
    13 plan within 180 days of its entry. Clauses (2) and (3) of this
    rule make it clear that the time periods established by Secs.
    727(e), 1144 and 1330 of the Code may not be circumvented by the

-HEAD-
    Rule 9027. Removal

-STATUTE-
      (a) Notice of Removal.
        (1) Where Filed; Form and Content. A notice of removal shall be
      filed with the clerk for the district and division within which
      is located the state or federal court where the civil action is
      pending. The notice shall be signed pursuant to Rule 9011 and
      contain a short and plain statement of the facts which entitle
      the party filing the notice to remove, contain a statement that
      upon removal of the claim or cause of action the proceeding is
      core or non-core and, if non-core, that the party filing the
      notice does or does not consent to entry of final orders or
      judgment by the bankruptcy judge, and be accompanied by a copy of
      all process and pleadings.
        (2) Time for Filing; Civil Action Initiated Before Commencement
      of the Case Under the Code. If the claim or cause of action in a
      civil action is pending when a case under the Code is commenced,
      a notice of removal may be filed only within the longest of (A)
      90 days after the order for relief in the case under the Code,
      (B) 30 days after entry of an order terminating a stay, if the
      claim or cause of action in a civil action has been stayed under
      Sec. 362 of the Code, or (C) 30 days after a trustee qualifies in
      a chapter 11 reorganization case but not later than 180 days
      after the order for relief.
        (3) Time for filing; civil action initiated after commencement
      of the case under the Code. If a claim or cause of action is
      asserted in another court after the commencement of a case under
      the Code, a notice of removal may be filed with the clerk only
      within the shorter of (A) 30 days after receipt, through service
      or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the
      claim or cause of action sought to be removed, or (B) 30 days
      after receipt of the summons if the initial pleading has been
      filed with the court but not served with the summons.

      (b) Notice. Promptly after filing the notice of removal, the
    party filing the notice shall serve a copy of it on all parties to
    the removed claim or cause of action.
      (c) Filing in Non-Bankruptcy Court. Promptly after filing the
    notice of removal, the party filing the notice shall file a copy of
    it with the clerk of the court from which the claim or cause of
    action is removed. Removal of the claim or cause of action is
    effected on such filing of a copy of the notice of removal. The
    parties shall proceed no further in that court unless and until the
    claim or cause of action is remanded.
      (d) Remand. A motion for remand of the removed claim or cause of
    action shall be governed by Rule 9014 and served on the parties to
    the removed claim or cause of action.
      (e) Procedure After Removal.
        (1) After removal of a claim or cause of action to a district
      court the district court or, if the case under the Code has been
      referred to a bankruptcy judge of the district, the bankruptcy
      judge, may issue all necessary orders and process to bring before
      it all proper parties whether served by process issued by the
      court from which the claim or cause of action was removed or
      otherwise.
        (2) The district court or, if the case under the Code has been
      referred to a bankruptcy judge of the district, the bankruptcy
      judge, may require the party filing the notice of removal to file
      with the clerk copies of all records and proceedings relating to
      the claim or cause of action in the court from which the claim or
      cause of action was removed.
        (3) Any party who has filed a pleading in connection with the
      removed claim or cause of action, other than the party filing the
      notice of removal, shall file a statement admitting or denying
      any allegation in the notice of removal that upon removal of the
      claim or cause of action the proceeding is core or non-core. If
      the statement alleges that the proceeding is non-core, it shall
      state that the party does or does not consent to entry of final
      orders or judgment by the bankruptcy judge. A statement required
      by this paragraph shall be signed pursuant to Rule 9011 and shall
      be filed not later than 14 days after the filing of the notice of
      removal. Any party who files a statement pursuant to this
      paragraph shall mail a copy to every other party to the removed
      claim or cause of action.

      (f) Process After Removal. If one or more of the defendants has
    not been served with process, the service has not been perfected
    prior to removal, or the process served proves to be defective,
    such process or service may be completed or new process issued
    pursuant to Part VII of these rules. This subdivision shall not
    deprive any defendant on whom process is served after removal of
    the defendant's right to move to remand the case.
      (g) Applicability of Part VII. The rules of Part VII apply to a
    claim or cause of action removed to a district court from a federal
    or state court and govern procedure after removal. Repleading is
    not necessary unless the court so orders. In a removed action in
    which the defendant has not answered, the defendant shall answer or
    present the other defenses or objections available under the rules
    of Part VII within 21 days following the receipt through service or
    otherwise of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim
    for relief on which the action or proceeding is based, or within 21
    days following the service of summons on such initial pleading, or
    within seven days following the filing of the notice of removal,
    whichever period is longest.
      (h) Record Supplied. When a party is entitled to copies of the
    records and proceedings in any civil action or proceeding in a
    federal or a state court, to be used in the removed civil action or
    proceeding, and the clerk of the federal or state court, on demand
    accompanied by payment or tender of the lawful fees, fails to
    deliver certified copies, the court may, on affidavit reciting the
    facts, direct such record to be supplied by affidavit or otherwise.
    Thereupon the proceedings, trial and judgment may be had in the
    court, and all process awarded, as if certified copies had been
    filed.
      (i) Attachment or Sequestration; Securities. When a claim or
    cause of action is removed to a district court, any attachment or
    sequestration of property in the court from which the claim or
    cause of action was removed shall hold the property to answer the
    final judgment or decree in the same manner as the property would
    have been held to answer final judgment or decree had it been
    rendered by the court from which the claim or cause of action was
    removed. All bonds, undertakings, or security given by either party
    to the claim or cause of action prior to its removal shall remain
    valid and effectual notwithstanding such removal. All injunctions
    issued, orders entered and other proceedings had prior to removal
    shall remain in full force and effect until dissolved or modified
    by the court.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      Under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1478(a) "any claim or cause of action in a
    civil action, other than a proceeding before the United States Tax
    Court or a civil action by a Government unit to enforce [a] . . .
    regulatory or police power" may be removed "if the bankruptcy
    courts have jurisdiction over such claim or cause of action." This
    rule specifies how removal is accomplished, the procedure
    thereafter, and the procedure to request remand of the removed
    claim or cause of action. If the claim or cause of action which is
    removed to the bankruptcy court is subject to the automatic stay of
    Sec. 362 of the Code, the litigation may not proceed in the
    bankruptcy court until relief from the stay is granted.
      The subdivisions of this rule conform substantially to 28 U.S.C.
    Secs. 1446-1450 and Rule 81(a) F.R.Civ.P. pertaining to removal to
    the district courts.
      Subdivision (a)(1) is derived from 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1446(a).
      Subdivisions (a)(2) and (a)(3) are derived from paragraphs one
    and two of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1446(b). Timely exercise of the right to
    remove is as important in bankruptcy cases as in removals from a
    state court to a district court.
      Subdivision (a)(2) governs the situation in which there is
    litigation pending and a party to the litigation becomes a debtor
    under the Code. Frequently, removal would be of little utility in
    such cases because the pending litigation will be stayed by Sec.
    362(a) on commencement of the case under the Code. As long as the
    stay remains in effect there is no reason to impose a time limit
    for removal to the bankruptcy court and, therefore, clause (B) of
    subdivision (a)(2) provides that a removal application may be filed
    within 30 days of entry of an order terminating the stay. Parties
    to stayed litigation will not be required to act immediately on
    commencement of a case under the Code to protect their right to
    remove. If the pending litigation is not stayed by Sec. 362(a) of
    the Code, the removal application must ordinarily be filed within
    90 days of the order for relief. Clause (C) contains an alternative
    period for a chapter 11 case. If a trustee is appointed, the
    removal application may be filed within 30 days of the trustee's
    qualification, provided that the removal application is filed not
    more than 180 days after the order for relief.
      The removal application must be filed within the longest of the
    three possible periods. For example, in a chapter 11 case if the 90
    day period expires but a trustee is appointed shortly thereafter,
    the removal application may be filed within 30 days of the
    trustee's qualification but not later than 180 days after the order
    for relief. Nevertheless, if the claim or cause of action in the
    civil action is stayed under Sec. 362, the application may be filed
    after the 180 day period expires, provided the application is filed
    within 30 days of an order terminating the stay.
      Subdivision (a)(3) applies to the situation in which the case
    under the Code is pending when the removable claim or cause of
    action is asserted in a civil action initiated in other than the
    bankruptcy court. The time for filing the application for removal
    begins to run on receipt of the first pleading containing the
    removable claim or cause of action. Only litigation not stayed by
    the Code or by court order may properly be initiated after the case
    under the Code is commenced. See e.g., Sec. 362(a).
      Subdivision (b). With one exception, this subdivision is the same
    as 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1446(d). The exemption from the bond requirement
    is enlarged to include a trustee or debtor in possession. Complete
    exemption from the bond requirement for removal is appropriate
    because of the limited resources which may be available at the
    beginning of a case and the small probability that an action will
    be improperly removed.
      Recovery on the bond is permitted only when the removal was
    improper. If the removal is proper but the bankruptcy court orders
    the action remanded on equitable grounds, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1478(b),
    there is no recovery on the bond.
      Subdivisions (c) and (d) are patterned on 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1446(e).
      Subdivision (e). There is no provision in the Federal Rules of
    Civil Procedure for seeking remand. The first sentence of this
    subdivision requires that a request for remand be by motion and
    that the moving party serve all other parties; however, no hearing
    is required. In recognition of the intrusion of the removal
    practice on the state and federal courts from which claims or
    causes of action are removed, the subdivision directs the
    bankruptcy court to decide remand motions as soon as practicable.
    The last sentence of this subdivision is derived from 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 1446(c)
      Subdivisions (f) and (g), with appropriate changes to conform
    them to the bankruptcy context, are the same as 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    1447(a) and (b) and 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1448, respectively.
      Subdivisions (h) and (i) are taken from Rule 81(c) F.R.Civ.P.
      Subdivisions (j) and (k) are derived from 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1449 and
    Sec. 1450, respectively.
      Remand orders of bankruptcy judges are not appealable. 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 1478(b).
      This rule does not deal with the question whether a single
    plaintiff or defendant may remove a claim or cause of action if
    there are two or more plaintiffs or defendants. See 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    1478.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Section 1452 of title 28, with certain exceptions, provides for
    removal of claims or causes of action in civil actions pending in
    state or federal courts when the claim or cause of action is within
    the jurisdiction conferred by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1334. An order
    granting or denying a motion for remand is not appealable. 28
    U.S.C. Sec. 1452(b). Under subdivision (e), as amended, the
    district court must enter the order on the remand motion; however,
    the bankruptcy judge conducts the initial hearing on the motion and
    files a report and recommendation. The parties may file objections.
    Review of the report and recommendation is pursuant to Rule 9033.
      Subdivision (f) has been amended to provide that if there has
    been a referral pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 157(a) the bankruptcy
    judge will preside over the removed civil action.
      Subdivision (i) has been abrogated consistent with the abrogation
    of Rule 9015.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      The abrogation of subdivision (b) is consistent with the repeal
    of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1446(d). The changes substituting the notice of
    removal for the application for removal conform to the 1988
    amendments to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1446.
      Rules 7008(a) and 7012(b) were amended in 1987 to require parties
    to allege in pleadings whether a proceeding is core or non-core
    and, if non-core, whether the parties consent to the entry of final
    orders or judgment by the bankruptcy judge. Subdivision (a)(1) is
    amended and subdivision (f)(3) is added to require parties to a
    removed claim or cause of action to make the same allegations. The
    party filing the notice of removal must include the allegation in
    the notice and the other parties who have filed pleadings must
    respond to the allegation in a separate statement filed within 10
    days after removal. However, if a party to the removed claim or
    cause of action has not filed a pleading prior to removal, there is
    no need to file a separate statement under subdivision (f)(3)
    because the allegation must be included in the responsive pleading
    filed pursuant to Rule 7012(b).
      Subdivision (e), redesignated as subdivision (d), is amended to
    delete the restriction that limits the role of the bankruptcy court
    to the filing of a report and recommendation for disposition of a
    motion for remand under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1452(b). This amendment is
    consistent with Sec. 309(c) of the Judicial Improvements Act of
    1990, which amended Sec. 1452(b) so that it allows an appeal to the
    district court of a bankruptcy court's order determining a motion
    for remand. This subdivision is also amended to clarify that the
    motion is a contested matter governed by Rule 9014. The words
    "filed with the clerk" are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules
    5005(a) and 9001(3).

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             
      Subdivision (a)(3) is amended to clarify that if a claim or cause
    of action is initiated after the commencement of a bankruptcy case,
    the time limits for filing a notice of removal of the claim or
    cause of action apply whether the case is still pending or has been
    suspended, dismissed, or closed.
      Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were
    made.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2009 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the
    amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed
    under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to
    substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout
    the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:
        -- 5-day periods become 7-day periods
        -- 10-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 15-day periods become 14-day periods
        -- 20-day periods become 21-day periods
        -- 25-day periods become 28-day periods

    PART IX - GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 9029. Local Bankruptcy Rules; Procedure When There is No
      Controlling Law

-STATUTE-
      (a) Local Bankruptcy Rules.
        (1) Each district court acting by a majority of its district
      judges may make and amend rules governing practice and procedure
      in all cases and proceedings within the district court's
      bankruptcy jurisdiction which are consistent with - but not
      duplicative of - Acts of Congress and these rules and which do
      not prohibit or limit the use of the Official Forms. Rule 83
      F.R.Civ.P. governs the procedure for making local rules. A
      district court may authorize the bankruptcy judges of the
      district, subject to any limitation or condition it may prescribe
      and the requirements of 83 F.R.Civ.P., to make and amend rules of
      practice and procedure which are consistent with - but not
      duplicative of - Acts of Congress and these rules and which do
      not prohibit or limit the use of the Official Forms. Local rules
      shall conform to any uniform numbering system prescribed by the
      Judicial Conference of the United States.
        (2) A local rule imposing a requirement of form shall not be
      enforced in a manner that causes a party to lose rights because
      of a nonwillful failure to comply with the requirement.

      (b) Procedure When There is No Controlling Law. A judge may
    regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law, these
    rules, Official Forms, and local rules of the district. No sanction
    or other disadvantage may be imposed for noncompliance with any
    requirement not in federal law, federal rules, Official Forms, or
    the local rules of the district unless the alleged violator has
    been furnished in the particular case with actual notice of the
    requirement.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1983            
      This rule is an adaptation of Rule 83 F.R.Civ.P. and Rule 57(a)
    F.R.Crim.P. Under this rule bankruptcy courts may make local rules
    which govern practice before those courts. Circuit councils and
    district courts are authorized by Rule 8018 to make local rules
    governing appellate practice.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987 AMENDMENT       
      Rule 9029 is amended to authorize the district court to
    promulgate local rules governing bankruptcy practice. This rule, as
    amended, permits the district court to authorize the bankruptcy
    judges to promulgate or recommend local rules for adoption by the
    district court.
      Effective August 1, 1985, Rule 83 F.R.Civ.P., governing adoption
    of local rules, was amended to achieve greater participation by the
    bar, scholars, and the public in the rule making process; to
    authorize the judicial council to abrogate local rules; and to make
    certain that single-judge standing orders are not inconsistent with
    these rules or local rules. Rule 9029 has been amended to
    incorporate Rule 83. The term "court" in the last sentence of the
    rule includes the judges of the district court and the bankruptcy
    judges of the district. Rule 9001(4).

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991 AMENDMENT       
      This rule is amended to make it clear that the Official Forms
    must be accepted in every bankruptcy court.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1995 AMENDMENT       
      Subdivision (a). This rule is amended to reflect the requirement
    that local rules be consistent not only with applicable national
    rules but also with Acts of Congress. The amendment also states
    that local rules should not repeat applicable national rules and
    Acts of Congress.
      The amendment also requires that the numbering of local rules
    conform with any uniform numbering system that may be prescribed by
    the Judicial Conference. Lack of uniform numbering might create
    unnecessary traps for counsel and litigants. A uniform numbering
    system would make it easier for an increasingly national bar and
    for litigants to locate a local rule that applies to a particular
    procedural issue.
      Paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) is new. Its aim is to protect
    against loss of rights in the enforcement of local rules relating
    to matters of form. For example, a party should not be deprived of
    a right to a jury trial because its attorney, unaware of - or
    forgetting - a local rule directing that jury demands be noted in
    the caption of the case, includes a jury demand only in the body of
    the pleading. The proscription of paragraph (2) is narrowly drawn -
    covering only violations that are not willful and only those
    involving local rules directed to matters of form. It does not
    limit the court's power to impose substantive penalties upon a
    party if it or its attorney stubbornly or repeatedly violates a
    local rule, even one involving merely a matter of form. Nor does it
    affect the court's power to enforce local rules that involve more
    than mere matters of form - for example, a local rule requiring
    that a party demand a jury trial within a specified time period to
    avoid waiver of the right to a trial by jury.
      Subdivision (b). This rule provides flexibility to the court in
    regulating practice when there is no controlling law. Specifically,
    it permits the court to regulate practice in any manner consistent
    with federal law, with rules adopted under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2075,
    with Official Forms, and with the district's local rules.
      This rule recognizes that courts rely on multiple directives to
    control practice. Some courts regulate practice through the
    published Federal Rules and the local rules of the court. Some
    courts also have used internal operating procedures, standing
    orders, and other internal directives. Although such directives
    continue to be authorized, they can lead to problems. Counsel or
    litigants may be unaware of various directives. In addition, the
    sheer volume of directives may impose an unreasonable barrier. For
    example, it may be difficult to obtain copies of the directives.
    Finally, counsel or litigants may be unfairly sanctioned for
    failing to comply with a directive. For these reasons, the
    amendment to this rule disapproves imposing any sanction or other
    disadvantage on a person for noncompliance with such an internal
    directive, unless the alleged violator has been furnished in a
    particular case with actual notice of the requirement.
      There should be no adverse consequence to a party or attorney for
    violating special requirements relating to practice before a
    particular judge unless the party or attorney has actual notice of
    those requirements. Furnishing litigants with a copy outlining the
    judge's practices - or attaching instructions to a notice setting a
    case for conference or trial - would suffice to give actual notice,
    as would an order in a case specifically adopting by reference a
    judge's standing order and indicating how copies can be obtained.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Service. In non-core proceedings heard pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 157(c)(1), the bankruptcy judge shall file proposed findings
    of fact and conclusions of law. The clerk shall serve forthwith
    copies on all parties by mail and note the date of mailing on the
    docket.
      (b) Objections: Time for Filing. Within 14 days after being
    served with a copy of the proposed findings of fact and conclusions
    of law a party may serve and file with the clerk written objections
    which identify the specific proposed findings or conclusions
    objected to and state the grounds for such objection. A party may
    respond to another party's objections within 14 days after being
    served with a copy thereof. A party objecting to the bankruptcy
    judge's proposed findings or conclusions shall arrange promptly for
    the transcription of the record, or such portions of it as all
    parties may agree upon or the bankruptcy judge deems sufficient,
    unless the district judge otherwise directs.
      (c) Extension of Time. The bankruptcy judge may for cause extend
    the time for filing objections by any party for a period not to
    exceed 21 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed
    by this rule. A request to extend the time for filing objections
    must be made before the time for filing objections has expired,
    except that a request made no more than 21 days after the
    expiration of the time for filing objections may be granted upon a
    showing of excusable neglect.
      (d) Standard of Review. The district judge shall make a de novo
    review upon the record or, after additional evidence, of any
    portion of the bankruptcy judge's findings of fact or conclusions
    of law to which specific written objection has been made in
    accordance with this rule. The district judge may accept, reject,
    or modify the proposed findings of fact or conclusions of law,
    receive further evidence, or recommit the matter to the bankruptcy
    judge with instructions.

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1987            
      Section 157(c)(1) of title 28 requires a bankruptcy judge to
    submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the
    district court when the bankruptcy judge has heard a non-core
    proceeding. This rule, which is modeled on Rule 72 F.R.Civ.P.,
    provides the procedure for objecting to, and for review by, the
    district court of specific findings and conclusions.
      Subdivision (a) requires the clerk to serve a copy of the
    proposed findings and conclusions on the parties. The bankruptcy
    clerk, or the district court clerk if there is no bankruptcy clerk
    in the district, shall serve a copy of the proposed findings and
    conclusions on all parties.
      Subdivision (b) is derived from Rule 72(b) F.R.Civ.P. which
    governs objections to a recommended disposition by a magistrate.
      Subdivision (c) is similar to Rule 8002(c) of the Bankruptcy
    Rules and provides for granting of extensions of time to file

      Section 307 of the Code gives the United States trustee the right
    to appear and be heard on issues in cases and proceedings under the
    Code. This rule is intended to keep the United States trustee
    informed of certain developments and disputes in which the United
    States trustee may wish to be heard. This rule, which derives from
    Rule X-1008, also enables the United States trustee to monitor the
    progress of the case in accordance with 28 U.S.C. Sec. 586(a). The
    requirement to transmit copies of certain pleadings, motion papers
    and other documents is intended to be flexible in that the United
    States trustee in a particular judicial district may request copies
    of papers in certain categories, and may request not to receive
    copies of documents in other categories, when the practice in that
    district makes that desirable. When the rules require that a paper
    be served on particular parties, the time period in which service
    is required is also applicable to transmittal to the United States
    trustee.
      Although other rules require that certain notices be transmitted
    to the United States trustee, this rule goes further in that it
    requires the transmittal to the United States trustee of other
    papers filed in connection with these matters. This rule is not an
    exhaustive list of the matters of which the United States trustee
    may be entitled to receive notice.

    Rule 9035. Applicability of Rules in Judicial Districts in Alabama
      and North Carolina

-STATUTE-
      In any case under the Code that is filed in or transferred to a
    district in the State of Alabama or the State of North Carolina and
    in which a United States trustee is not authorized to act, these
    rules apply to the extent that they are not inconsistent with any
    federal statute effective in the case.

    (Added Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; amended Apr. 11, 1997,

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991            
      Section 302(d)(3) of the Bankruptcy Judges, United States
    Trustees, and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of 1986 provides that
    amendments to the Code relating to United States trustees and
    quarterly fees required under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1930(a)(6) do not
    become effective in any judicial district in the States of Alabama
    and North Carolina until the district elects to be included in the
    United States trustee system, or October 1, 1992, whichever occurs
    first, unless Congress extends the deadline. If the United States
    trustee system becomes effective in these districts, the transition
    provisions in the 1986 Act will govern the application of the
    United States trustee amendments to cases that are pending at that
    time. See Sec. 302(d)(3)(F). The statute, and not the bankruptcy
    court, determines whether a United States trustee is authorized to
    act in a particular case.
      Section 302(d)(3)(I) of the 1986 Act authorizes the Judicial
    Conference of the United States to promulgate regulations governing
    the appointment of bankruptcy administrators to supervise the
    administration of estates and trustees in cases in the districts in
    Alabama and North Carolina until the provisions of the Act relating
    to the United States trustee take effect in these districts.
    Pursuant to this authority, in September 1987, the Judicial
    Conference promulgated regulations governing the selection and
    appointment of bankruptcy administrators and regulations governing
    the establishment, duties, and functions of bankruptcy
    administrators. Guidelines relating to the bankruptcy administrator
    program have been prescribed by the Director of the Administrative
    Office of the United States Courts.
      Many of these rules were amended to implement the United States
    trustee system in accordance with the 1986 Act. Since the
    provisions of the 1986 Act relating to the United States trustee
    system are not effective in cases in Alabama and North Carolina in
    which a bankruptcy administrator is serving, rules referring to
    United States trustees are at least partially inconsistent with the
    provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and title 28 of the United States
    Code effective in such cases.
      In determining the applicability of these rules in cases in
    Alabama and North Carolina in which a United States trustee is not
    authorized to act, the following guidelines should be followed:
        (1) The following rules do not apply because they are
      inconsistent with the provisions of the Code or title 28 in these
      cases: 1002(b), 1007(1), 1009(c), 2002(k), 2007.1(b), 2015(a)(6),
      2020, 3015(b), 5005(b), 7004(b)(10), 9003(b), and 9034.
        (2) The following rules are partially inconsistent with the
      provisions of the Code effective in these cases and, therefore,
      are applicable with the following modifications:
          (a) Rule 2001(a) and (c) - The court, rather than the United
        States trustee, appoints the interim trustee.
          (b) Rule 2003 - The duties of the United States trustee
        relating to the meeting of creditors or equity security holders
        are performed by the officer determined in accordance with
        regulations of the Judicial Conference, guidelines of the
        Director of the Administrative Office, local rules or court
        orders.
          (c) Rule 2007 - The court, rather than the United States
        trustee, appoints committees in chapter 9 and chapter 11 cases.
          (d) Rule 2008 - The bankruptcy administrator, rather than the
        United States trustee, informs the trustee of how to qualify.
          (e) Rule 2009(c) and (d) - The court, rather than the United
        States trustee, appoints interim trustees in chapter 7 cases
        and trustees in chapter 11, 12 and 13 cases.
          (f) Rule 2010 - The court, rather than the United States
        trustee, determines the amount and sufficiency of the trustee's
        bond.
          (g) Rule 5010 - The court, rather than the United States
        trustee, appoints the trustee when a case is reopened.
        (3) All other rules are applicable because they are consistent
      with the provisions of the Code and title 28 effective in these
      cases, except that any reference to the United States trustee is
      not applicable and should be disregarded.
      Many of the amendments to the rules are designed to give the
    United States trustee, a member of the Executive Branch, notice of
    certain developments and copies of petitions, schedules, pleadings,
    and other papers. In contrast, the bankruptcy administrator is an
    officer in the Judicial Branch and matters relating to notice of
    developments and access to documents filed in the clerk's office
    are governed by regulations of the Judicial Conference of the
    United States, guidelines of the Administrative Office of the
    United States Courts, local rules, and court orders. Also,
    requirements for disclosure of connections with the bankruptcy
    administrator in applications for employment of professional
    persons, restrictions on appointments of relatives of bankruptcy
    administrators, effects of erroneously filing papers with the
    bankruptcy administrator, and other matters not covered by these
    rules may be governed by regulations of the Judicial Conference,
    guidelines of the Director of the Administrative Office, local
    rules, and court orders.
      This rule will cease to have effect if a United States trustee is
    authorized in every case in the districts in Alabama and North
    Carolina.

           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       
      Certain statutes that are not codified in title 11 or title 28 of
    the United States Code, such as Sec. 105 of the Bankruptcy Reform
    Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-394, 108 Stat. 4106, relate to bankruptcy
    administrators in the judicial districts of North Carolina and
    Alabama. This amendment makes it clear that the Bankruptcy Rules do
    not apply to the extent that they are inconsistent with these
    federal statutes.

    Rule 9036. Notice by Electronic Transmission

-STATUTE-
      Whenever the clerk or some other person as directed by the court
    is required to send notice by mail and the entity entitled to
    receive the notice requests in writing that, instead of notice by
    mail, all or part of the information required to be contained in
    the notice be sent by a specified type of electronic transmission,
    the court may direct the clerk or other person to send the
    information by such electronic transmission. Notice by electronic
    means is complete on transmission.

-SOURCE-
    (Added Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Aug. 1, 1993; amended Apr. 25, 2005,

-MISC1-
                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993            
      This rule is added to provide flexibility for banks, credit card
    companies, taxing authorities, and other entities that ordinarily
    receive notices by mail in a large volume of bankruptcy cases, to
    arrange to receive by electronic transmission all or part of the
    information required to be contained in such notices.
      The use of electronic technology instead of mail to send
    information to creditors and interested parties will be more
    convenient and less costly for the sender and the receiver. For
    example, a bank that receives by mail, at different locations,
    notices of meetings of creditors pursuant to Rule 2002(a) in
    thousands of cases each year may prefer to receive only the vital
    information ordinarily contained in such notices by electronic
    transmission to one computer terminal.
      The specific means of transmission must be compatible with
    technology available to the sender and the receiver. Therefore,
    electronic transmission of notices is permitted only upon request
    of the entity entitled to receive the notice, specifying the type
    of electronic transmission, and only if approved by the court.
      Electronic transmission pursuant to this rule completes the
    notice requirements. The creditor or interested party is not
    thereafter entitled to receive the relevant notice by mail.

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             
      The rule is amended to delete the requirement that the sender of
    an electronic notice must obtain electronic confirmation that the
    notice was received. The amendment provides that notice is complete
    upon transmission. When the rule was first promulgated,
    confirmation of receipt of electronic notices was commonplace. In
    the current electronic environment, very few internet service
    providers offer the confirmation of receipt service. Consequently,
    compliance with the rule may be impossible, and the rule could
    discourage the use of electronic noticing.
      Confidence in the delivery of email text messages now rivals or
    exceeds confidence in the delivery of printed materials. Therefore,
    there is no need for confirmation of receipt of electronic messages
    just as there is no such requirement for paper notices.

    PART IX - GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Rule 9037. Privacy Protection For Filings Made with the Court

-STATUTE-
      (a) Redacted Filings. Unless the court orders otherwise, in an
    electronic or paper filing made with the court that contains an
    individual's social-security number, taxpayer-identification
    number, or birth date, the name of an individual, other than the
    debtor, known to be and identified as a minor, or a financial-
    account number, a party or nonparty making the filing may include
    only:
        (1) the last four digits of the social-security number and
      taxpayer-identification number;
        (2) the year of the individual's birth;
        (3) the minor's initials; and
        (4) the last four digits of the financial-account number.

      (b) Exemptions From the Redaction Requirement. The redaction
    requirement does not apply to the following:
        (1) a financial-account number that identifies the property
      allegedly subject to forfeiture in a forfeiture proceeding;
        (2) the record of an administrative or agency proceeding unless
      filed with a proof of claim;
        (3) the official record of a state-court proceeding;
        (4) the record of a court or tribunal, if that record was not
      subject to the redaction requirement when originally filed;
        (5) a filing covered by subdivision (c) of this rule; and
        (6) a filing that is subject to Sec. 110 of the Code.

      (c) Filings Made Under Seal. The court may order that a filing be
    made under seal without redaction. The court may later unseal the
    filing or order the entity that made the filing to file a redacted
    version for the public record.
      (d) Protective Orders. For cause, the court may by order in a
    case under the Code:
        (1) require redaction of additional information; or
        (2) limit or prohibit a nonparty's remote electronic access to
      a document filed with the court.

      (e) Option for Additional Unredacted Filing Under Seal. An entity
    making a redacted filing may also file an unredacted copy under
    seal. The court must retain the unredacted copy as part of the
    record.
      (f) Option for Filing a Reference List. A filing that contains
    redacted information may be filed together with a reference list
    that identifies each item of redacted information and specifies an
    appropriate identifier that uniquely corresponds to each item
    listed. The list must be filed under seal and may be amended as of
    right. Any reference in the case to a listed identifier will be
    construed to refer to the corresponding item of information.
      (g) Waiver of Protection of Identifiers. An entity waives the
    protection of subdivision (a) as to the entity's own information by
    filing it without redaction and not under seal.

-MISC1-
                      COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007                  
      The rule is adopted in compliance with section 205(c)(3) of the E-
    Government Act of 2002, Public Law No. 107-347. Section 205(c)(3)
    requires the Supreme Court to prescribe rules "to protect privacy
    and security concerns relating to electronic filing of documents
    and the public availability . . . of documents filed
    electronically." The rule goes further than the E-Government Act in
    regulating paper filings even when they are not converted to
    electronic form, but the number of filings that remain in paper
    form is certain to diminish over time. Most districts scan paper
    filings into the electronic case file, where they become available
    to the public in the same way as documents initially filed in
    electronic form. It is electronic availability, not the form of the
    initial filing, that raises the privacy and security concerns
    addressed in the E-Government Act.
      The rule is derived from and implements the policy adopted by the
    Judicial Conference in September 2001 to address the privacy
    concerns resulting from public access to electronic case files. See
    http://www.privacy.uscourts.gov/Policy.htm. The Judicial Conference
    policy is that documents in case files generally should be made
    available electronically to the same extent they are available at
    the courthouse, provided that certain "personal data identifiers"
    are not included in the public file.
      While providing for the public filing of some information, such
    as the last four digits of an account number, the rule does not
    intend to establish a presumption that this information never could
    or should be protected. For example, it may well be necessary in
    individual cases to prevent remote access by nonparties to any part
    of an account number or social-security number. It may also be
    necessary to protect information not covered by the redaction
    requirement - such as driver's license numbers and alien
    registration numbers - in a particular case. In such cases,
    protection may be sought under subdivision (c) or (d). Moreover,
    the rule does not affect the protection available under other
    rules, such as Rules 16 and 26(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil
    Procedure, or under other sources of protective authority.
      Any personal information not otherwise protected by sealing or
    redaction will be made available over the internet. Counsel should
    therefore notify clients of this fact so that an informed decision
    may be made on what information is to be included in a document
    filed with the court.
      An individual debtor's full social-security number or taxpayer-
    identification number is included on the notice of the Sec. 341
    meeting of creditors sent to creditors. Of course, that is not
    filed with the court, see Rule 1007(f) (the debtor "submits" this
    information), and the copy of the notice that is filed with the
    court does not include the full social-security number or taxpayer-
    identification number. Thus, since the full social-security number
    or taxpayer-identification number is not filed with the court, it
    is not available to a person searching that record.
      The clerk is not required to review documents filed with the
    court for compliance with this rule. As subdivision (a) recognizes,
    the responsibility to redact filings rests with counsel, parties,
    and others who make filings with the court.
      Subdivision (d) recognizes the court's inherent authority to
    issue a protective order to prevent remote access to private or
    sensitive information and to require redaction of material in
    addition to that which would be redacted under subdivision (a) of
    the rule. These orders may be issued whenever necessary either by
    the court on its own motion, or on motion of a party in interest.
      Subdivision (e) allows an entity that makes a redacted filing to
    file an unredacted document under seal. This provision is derived
    from section 205(c)(3)(iv) of the E-Government Act. Subdivision (f)
    allows the option to file a reference list of redacted information.
    This provision is derived from section 205(c)(3)(v) of the E-
    Government Act, as amended in 2004.
      In accordance with the E-Government Act, subdivision (f) of the
    rule refers to "redacted" information. The term "redacted" is
    intended to govern a filing that is prepared with abbreviated
    identifiers in the first instance, as well as a filing in which a
    personal identifier is edited after its preparation.
      Subdivision (g) allows an entity to waive the protections of the
    rule as to that entity's own information by filing it in unredacted
    form. An entity may elect to waive the protection if, for example,
    it is determined that the costs of redaction outweigh the benefits
    to privacy. As to financial account numbers, the instructions to
    Schedules E and F of Official Form 6 note that the debtor may elect
    to include the complete account number on those schedules rather
    than limit the number to the final four digits. Including the
    complete number would operate as a waiver by the debtor under
    subdivision (g) as to the full information that the debtor set out
    on those schedules. The waiver operates only to the extent of the
    information that the entity filed without redaction. If an entity
    files an unredacted identifier by mistake, it may seek relief from
    the court.
      Trial exhibits are subject to the redaction requirements of Rule
    9037 to the extent they are filed with the court. Trial exhibits
    that are not initially filed with the court must be redacted in
    accordance with this rule if and when they are filed as part of an
    appeal or for other reasons.
      Changes After Publication. Rule 9037 is intended to parallel as
    closely as possible Civil Rule 5.2 and Criminal Rule 49.1. The
    Advisory Committees have worked together to maintain as much
    consistency as possible in the three versions of the rule. The rule
    has been revised to implement the several style revisions suggested
    by the Style Subcommittee of the Standing Committee. Subdivision
    (b) was reorganized and renumbered. Subdivisions (b)(1) and (b)(3)
    were added in response to suggestions by the Department of Justice.
    Subdivision (b)(4), formerly subdivision (b)(2), was amended in
    response to the suggestion of the Committee on Court Administration
    and Case Management so that the subdivision now refers to court
    records that become a part of the record in the pending matter. The
    term "entity" has been substituted for "person" in subdivision (c)
    and for "party" in subdivisions (e) and (f) to conform the rule to
    the definitions provided in the Bankruptcy Code.

      [Note: These official forms should be observed and used with such
    alterations as may be appropriate to suit the circumstances. See
    Rule 9009.]


-MISC1-
                   INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS               
      Rule 9009 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure states
    that the Official Forms prescribed by the Judicial Conference of
    the United States "shall be observed and used." The Official Forms,
    accordingly, are obligatory in character.
      Rule 9009 expressly permits the user of the Official Forms to
    make such "alterations as may be appropriate," and the use of the
    Official Forms has been held to be subject to a "rule of
    substantial compliance." Some rules, for example Fed.R.Bankr.P.
    3001(a), specifically state that the filed document need only
    "conform substantially" to the Official Form. A document for which
    an Official Form is prescribed generally will meet the standard of
    substantial compliance if the document contains the complete
    substance, that is, all of the information required by the Official
    Form.
      Rule 9009 also expressly permits the contents of Official Forms
    to be rearranged, and the format of the Official Forms
    traditionally has been quite flexible. The forms of the voluntary
    petition, the schedules, and the statement of financial affairs are
    printed and sold by private publishers. Design features such as
    type face, type size, layout, and side and top margins were not
    prescribed by the Judicial Conference, but rather left to the
    professional judgment of each publisher.
      A great deal of variation, accordingly, has developed. Some
    publishers also add forms that are not official but which have been
    drafted by the publisher. A form for a chapter 13 plan, for
    example, frequently is included with commercially printed packages
    of forms for filing cases under chapter 13, although there is no
    Official Form for this purpose. The variety of formats has
    accelerated since the introduction of computer software for
    generating the petitions, schedules, and statements of affairs. It
    is the policy of the Judicial Conference that such diversity is
    desirable and should be encouraged.
      The sheer volume of bankruptcy cases, however, has compelled the
    Judicial Conference, for the first time, to prescribe the format of
    certain Official Forms. In particular, the format of Form 1, the
    Voluntary Petition, now is prescribed. This format is designed to
    assist the clerk of the bankruptcy court to enter the case in the
    court's computer database and ensures that all required information
    is available to both the clerk and the United States trustee at the
    inception of the case. The rule of substantial compliance continues
    to apply, however. Accordingly, publishers may vary the size and
    style of the type and may alter the size and shape of the boxes on
    the form, within the bounds of that rule.
      The Official Forms of the petitions, schedules, and statement of
    financial affairs, (Forms 1, 5, 6, and 7), are to be printed on one
    side of the paper only. Each page is to be prepunched with two
    holes at the top, and sufficient top margin allowed so that neither
    caption nor text is destroyed or obscured. Compliance with these
    standards will facilitate both the securing of the papers in the
    case file and review of the file by the public.
      Although Rule 9009 permits alteration, for most of the Official
    Forms, alteration will be appropriate only in rare circumstances.
    The special forms for chapter 11 cases, on the other hand, seldom
    will be used without alterations. Forms 12 through 15, while
    legally sufficient in any chapter 11 case, are intended by the
    Judicial Conference, and most often will be used, as a framework
    for drafting a document specially tailored to the particular case.
    These alterations generally will take the form of additions to the
    prescribed elements.
      Rule 9009 provides for a balance of prescribed substance, to
    which full adherence is expected in all but the most unusual cases,
    and flexible formatting, under which requirements are kept to the
    minimum necessary for proper operation of the courts and the
    bankruptcy system. While Rule 9009 recognizes the overall need for
    flexibility, Rule 9029 makes it clear that the Official Forms must
    be accepted in every bankruptcy court.
      Under Rule 9029, courts may not reject documents presented for
    filing in novel or unfamiliar formats if those documents contain
    the substance prescribed by the Official Form and meet the
    requirements for one-sided printing, pre-punched holes, and
    adequate top margins. Nor are courts authorized to impose local
    forms which vary in substance from the Official Forms or reject
    papers presented for filing on Official Forms on the basis that the
    proffered documents differ from a locally preferred version.

             SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPUTER-GENERATED FORMS         
      In Form 1, the Voluntary Petition, if a box contains multiple
    choices, a computer-generated petition that shows only the choice
    made is acceptable for filing. All sections of the petition must be
    shown and completed, however, unless instructions on the Official
    Form of the petition state that the box is applicable only to cases
    filed under a chapter other than the one selected by the debtor. If
    the debtor has no information to provide for a particular box, for
    example if the debtor has no prior bankruptcies to report, a
    computer-generated petition should so indicate by stating "None."
      Form 6, the Schedules, on which the debtor reports all of the
    debtor's assets and liabilities, has been prescribed in a columnar
    format. Columns help to organize the information which the debtor
    is required to report and should be used when the printed schedules
    are completed on a typewriter. In a computerized law office,
    however, the organizational structure of the schedules can be built
    into the computer program, and a rigid columnar format may be a
    hindrance rather than a help. Schedules generated by computer which
    provide all of the information requested by the prescribed form are
    fully acceptable, regardless of the format of the printed page. The
    information must be appropriately labeled, however. In Schedule B,
    for example, all of the categories of personal property must be
    printed on the filed document together with the debtor's response
    to each. The space occupied by each category may be expanded,
    however, so that attachments are not needed. Instructions provided
    on the printed forms can simply be built into the computer program;
    they need not be reprinted on the filed document.
      Form 7, the Statement of Financial Affairs, contains a series of
    questions which direct the debtor to answer by furnishing
    information. If the answer to a question is "None," or the question
    is not applicable, an affirmative statement to that effect is
    required. To assure that the trustee and the creditors can review
    the debtor's statement properly, the complete text of each question
    must be printed on the filed document.
      Form 9, the Notice of Filing under the Bankruptcy Code, Meeting
    of Creditors, and Fixing of Dates, will be prepared by the clerk of
    the bankruptcy court in most cases. The form is designed for use
    with automated printing and mailing equipment. Two free lines,
    which do not appear on the printed blank form, have been programmed
    into the form. Courts may use this space to add local information,
    such as directions for obtaining copies of the debtor's schedules.

    Committee on Bankruptcy Rules of the Judicial Conference, June 28,

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991            

      Form 1, the Voluntary Petition, is to be used to commence a
    voluntary case under chapter 7, 11, 12, or 13 of the Bankruptcy
    Code. A chapter 9 petition requires other allegations, (see Sec.
    109(c) of the Code), but this form may be adapted for such use. The
    form also may be adapted for use in filing a petition ancillary to
    a foreign proceeding under Sec. 304 of the Code.
      The form departs from the traditional format of a captioned
    pleading. All of the elements of the caption prescribed in Rule
    1005 have been retained. Their placement on the page, however, has
    been changed to make the form compatible with electronic data
    processing by the clerk. The form of the caption of the case for
    use in other documents, formerly incorporated in Official Form No.
    1, has been made a separate Form 16A.
      All names used by the debtor, including trade names, names used
    in doing business, married names, and maiden names should be
    furnished in the spaces provided. If there is not sufficient room
    for all such names on the form itself, the list should be continued
    on an additional sheet attached to the petition. A complete list
    will enable creditors to identify the debtor properly when they
    receive notices and orders.
      Redesign of this form into a box format also is intended to
    provide the court, the United States trustee, and other interested
    parties with as much information as possible during the 15-day
    period provided by Rule 1007(c), when schedules and statements may
    not have been filed. The box format separates into categories the
    data provided by the debtor, and enables the form to be used by all
    voluntary debtors in all chapters.
      For the first time, the form requires both a street address and
    any separate mailing address, as well as any separate addresses
    used by a joint debtor. Disclosure of prior bankruptcies is new to
    the petition but formerly was required in the statement of
    financial affairs; its inclusion in the petition is intended to
    alert the trustee to cases in which an objection to discharge
    pursuant to Sec. 727(a)(8) or (a)(9) or a motion to dismiss under
    Sec. 109(g) may be appropriate. The information about pending
    related cases, also new to the petition, signals the clerk to
    assign the case to the judge to whom any related case has been
    assigned.
      Rule 1008 requires all petitions to be verified or contain an
    unsworn declaration as provided in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1746. The unsworn
    declaration on page two of the petition conforms with 28 U.S.C.
    Sec. 1746, which permits the declaration to be made in the manner
    indicated with the same force and effect as a sworn statement. The
    form may be adapted for use outside the United States by adding the
    words "under the laws of the United States" after the word
    "perjury."
      Exhibit "A," to be attached to the petition of a corporate
    debtor, is for the purpose of supplying the Securities and Exchange
    Commission with information it needs at the beginning stages of a
    chapter 11 case in order to determine how actively to monitor the
    proceedings. Exhibit "B" was added by Sec. 322 of Pub. L. No. 98-
    353, the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984.
    The references to chapters 11 and 12 of the Code found in Exhibit
    "B" and its related allegations were added by Sec. 283(aa) of the
    1986 amendments, (Pub. L. No. 99-554). This exhibit has been
    included in the form of the petition.
      The form effects a merger of the petition and the bankruptcy
    cover sheet to assist the clerk in providing the statistical
    information required by the Director of the Administrative Office
    of the United States Courts pursuant to the Congressional reporting
    mandates of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 604. The Director is authorized to
    change the particulars of the statistical portion of the form as
    needed in the performance of these statutory duties.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       

      The form has been amended to require a debtor not represented by
    an attorney to provide a telephone number so that court personnel,
    the trustee, other parties in the case, and their attorneys can
    contact the debtor concerning matters in the case.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1995 AMENDMENT       

      The form is amended to provide space for signing by a "bankruptcy
    petition preparer," as required under section 110 of the Code,
    which was added by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994. In addition
    to signing, a bankruptcy petition preparer is required by section
    110 to disclose the information requested. All signatories of Form
    1 are requested to provide the clerk's office with a telephone
    number.
      A chapter 11 debtor that qualifies as a "small business" under
    section 101 of the Code, as amended by the 1994 Act, may elect
    special, expedited treatment under amendments made to chapter 11 by
    the 1994 Act. The court may order that a creditors committee not be
    appointed in a small business case. Accordingly, the first page of
    the petition is amended to require a small business filing under
    chapter 11 to identify itself. The petition also is amended to
    offer a small business chapter 11 debtor an opportunity to exercise
    its right to elect to be considered a small business at the
    commencement of the case.
      Several clarifying and technical amendments also have been made
    to indicate that a debtor is to check only one box with respect to
    "Type of Debtor" and "Nature of Debt," to clarify the intent that
    the individual signing on behalf of a corporation or partnership is
    authorized to file the petition, and to require a debtor to
    represent that it is eligible for relief under the chapter of title
    11 specified in the petition.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       

      The form has been substantially amended to simplify its format
    and make the form easier to complete correctly. The Latin phrase
    "In re" has been deleted as unnecessary. The amount of information
    requested in the boxes labeled "Type of Debtor" and "Nature of
    Debt" has been reduced, and the reporting by a corporation of
    whether it is a publicly held entity has been moved to Exhibit "A"
    of the petition. The box labeled "Representation by Attorney" has
    been deleted; the information it contained is requested in the
    signature boxes on the second page of the form.
      In the statistical information section, the labels on the ranges
    of estimated assets and liabilities have been rewritten to improve
    the accuracy of reporting. The asset/liability range of $10 million
    to $100 million has been divided into two categories to promote
    better statistical reporting of business cases. Requests for
    information in chapter 11 and chapter 12 cases concerning the
    number of the debtor's employees and equity security holders have
    been deleted.
      The second page of the form has been simplified so that a debtor
    need only sign the petition once. The request for information
    concerning the filing of a plan has been deleted.
      Exhibit "A" has been simplified. In addition, the category of
    chapter 11 debtors required to file Exhibit "A" is modified to
    include a corporation, partnership, or other entity, but only if
    the debtor has issued publicly-traded equity securities or debt
    instruments. Most small corporations will not be required to file
    Exhibit "A."
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2001 AMENDMENT             

      The form has been amended to require the debtor to disclose
    whether the debtor owns or has possession of any property that
    poses or is alleged to pose a threat of imminent and identifiable
    harm to public health or safety. If any such property exists, the
    debtor must complete and attach Exhibit "C" describing the
    property, its location, and the potential danger it poses. Exhibit
    "C" will alert the United States trustee and any person selected as
    trustee that immediate precautionary action may be necessary.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             

      The form has been amended to provide a checkbox for designating a
    clearing bank case filed under subchapter V of chapter 7 of the
    Code enacted by Sec. 112 of Pub. L. No. 106-554 (December 21,
    2000).
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             

      The form is amended to require the debtor to disclose only the
    last four digits of the debtor's social security number to afford
    greater privacy to the individual debtor, whose bankruptcy case
    records may be available on the Internet. Pursuant to Sec. 110(c)
    of the Bankruptcy Code, the certification by a non-attorney
    bankruptcy petition preparer requires a petition preparer to
    provide the full social security number of the individual who
    actually prepares the document.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             

      The form is amended to implement amendments to the Bankruptcy
    Code contained in the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer
    Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23 (April 20,
    2005). The period for which the debtor must provide all names used
    and information about any prior bankruptcy cases is now eight years
    to match the required time between the granting of discharges to
    the same debtor in Sec. 727(a)(8) of the Code as amended in 2005.
    The box indicating the debtor's selection of a chapter under which
    to file the case has been amended to delete "Sec. 304 - Case
    ancillary to foreign proceeding" and replace it with "Chapter 15
    Petition for Recognition of a Foreign Main Proceeding" and "Chapter
    15 Petition for Recognition of a Foreign Nonmain Proceeding"
    reflecting the 2005 repeal of Sec. 304 and enactment of chapter 15
    of the Code. A statement of venue to be used in a chapter 15 case
    also has been added.
      The section of the form labeled "Type of Debtor" has been revised
    and subtitled "Form of Organization." This section is revised to
    make it clear that a limited liability corporation ("LLC") and
    limited liability partnership ("LLP") should identify itself as a
    "corporation." A new section titled "Nature of Business" has been
    created that includes both existing check boxes that identify
    certain types of debtors for which the Bankruptcy Code provides
    special treatment, such as stockbrokers and railroads, and a new
    checkbox for a "health care business" for which the 2005 amendments
    to the Code include specific requirements. This section of the form
    also contains checkboxes for single asset real estate debtors and
    nonprofit organizations which will be used by trustees and
    creditors and by the Director of the Administrative Office of the
    United States Courts in preparing statistical reports and analyses.
    The statistical section of the form also is amended to provide more
    detail concerning the number of creditors in a case. A check box
    also has been added for a debtor to indicate that the debtor is
    applying for a waiver of the filing fee, to implement the 2005
    enactment of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1930(f) authorizing the bankruptcy
    court to waive the filing fee in certain circumstances.
      Although the 2005 Act eliminated an eligible debtor's option to
    elect to be treated as a "small business" in a chapter 11 case, new
    provisions for such debtors added to the Code in 2005 make it
    desirable to identify eligible debtors at the outset of the case.
    Accordingly, the section of the form labeled "Chapter 11 Small
    Business" has been revised and renamed "Chapter 11 Debtors" for
    this purpose. Chapter 11 debtors that meet the definition of "small
    business debtor" in Sec. 101 of the Code are directed to identify
    themselves in this section of the form. In addition, chapter 11
    debtors whose aggregate noncontingent debts owed to non-insiders or
    affiliates are less than $2 million are directed to identify
    themselves in this section.
      A space is provided for individuals to certify that they have
    received budget and credit counseling prior to filing, as required
    by Sec. 109(h) which was added to the Code in 2005, or to request a
    waiver of the requirement. Space also is provided for a debtor who
    is a tenant of residential real property to state whether the
    debtor's landlord has a judgment against the debtor for possession
    of the premises, whether under applicable nonbankruptcy law the
    debtor would be permitted to cure the monetary default, and whether
    the debtor has made the appropriate deposit with the court. This
    addition to the form implements Sec. 362(l) which was added to the
    Code in 2005.
      The signature sections and the declaration under penalty of
    perjury by an individual debtor concerning the notice received
    about bankruptcy relief, the declaration under penalty of perjury
    by a bankruptcy petition preparer, and the declaration and
    certification by an attorney all are amended to include new
    material mandated by the 2005 Act. A signature section also is
    provided for a representative of a foreign proceeding.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             

      Page one of the form is amended in several ways to assist the
    courts in evaluating their workload and fulfilling the statistical
    reporting requirements of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 159. Section 159 was
    enacted as part of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer
    Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), Pub. L. No. 109-8 and takes effect
    October 17, 2006. Accordingly, in the section of the form labeled
    "Nature of Business," the instruction is amended to specify that
    only one box should be checked and only if the debtor is any of the
    entities listed. The "nonprofit" choice is separated into a
    discrete section and the language amended to the more precise "tax-
    exempt."
      In addition, the section labeled "Type of Debtor" is amended to
    include, below the checkbox for "Individual or Joint," a direction
    to "See Exhibit D on page 2 of this form." Exhibit D replaces the
    certification concerning prepetition credit counseling and is
    described below. The section labeled "Nature of Debts" is amended
    to state the statutory definition of a "consumer debt" and to
    modify both the consumer and business categories by adding the word
    "primarily" to both make it clearer to individual debtors that
    "business" may be the more appropriate choice if personal debts
    have been incurred to finance a business venture.
      In the section labeled "Chapter 11 Debtors," the language
    concerning whether the debtor owes less than $2 million is re-
    styled for clarity. This section also is augmented to provide the
    court with notice when a case if [sic] filed as a "pre-packaged"
    chapter 11 reorganization case. Two checkboxes are offered, using
    language adapted from Sec. 1126(b) of the Code. Lastly, the
    information requested concerning estimated assets and liabilities
    is abbreviated, with the number of ranges reduced and the scope of
    each range amended. Statistical reports now will be derived from
    actual dollar amounts of assets and liabilities as shown on the
    debtor's schedules. The information on the petition, accordingly,
    is for case management and public information purposes only.
      Exhibit D replaces the section formerly labeled "Certification
    Concerning Debt Counseling by Individual/Joint Debtor(s)." Early
    cases decided under the 2005 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code
    indicate that individual debtors may not be aware of the
    requirement to obtain prepetition credit counseling, the few and
    very narrow exceptions to that requirement, or the potentially dire
    consequences to their efforts to obtain bankruptcy relief if they
    fail to complete the requirement. Accordingly, page 2 of the
    petition instructs individual debtors to attach a completed Exhibit
    D and makes it clear that each spouse in a joint case must complete
    and attach a separate Exhibit D. Exhibit D itself includes a
    warning about the requirement to obtain counseling and the
    consequences of failing to fulfill this requirement. It further
    provides checkboxes and instructions concerning the additional
    documents that are required in particular circumstances, in order
    to minimize the number of cases which the court must dismiss for
    ineligibility.
              COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005-2007 AMENDMENT          

      [The 2005-2007 Committee Note incorporates Committee Notes
    previously published in 2005 and 2006.]
      The form is amended to implement amendments to the Bankruptcy
    Code contained in the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer
    Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23 (April 20,
    2005) ("BAPCPA"). The period for which the debtor must provide all
    names used and information about any prior bankruptcy cases is now
    eight years to match the required time between the granting of
    discharges to the same debtor in Sec. 727(a)(8) of the Code as
    amended in 2005. In conformity with Rule 9037, the debtor is
    directed to provide only the last four digits of any individual's
    tax-identification number.
      The box indicating the debtor's selection of a chapter under
    which to file the case is amended to delete "Sec. 304 - Case
    ancillary to foreign proceeding" and replace it with "Chapter 15
    Petition for Recognition of a Foreign Main Proceeding" and "Chapter
    15 Petition for Recognition of a Foreign Nonmain Proceeding"
    reflecting the 2005 repeal of Sec. 304 and enactment of chapter 15
    of the Code. A statement of venue to be used in a chapter 15 case
    also is added on page 2 of the form.
      The section labeled "Type of Debtor" is amended to include, below
    the checkbox for "Individual or Joint," a direction to "See Exhibit
    D on page 2 of this form." This addition alerts individual debtors
    that Exhibit D on page 2 of the form applies to them. Exhibit D,
    more fully described below, addresses the prepetition credit
    counseling requirements added to the Code by BAPCPA. The subtitle,
    "Form of Organization," is added, and this section also is revised
    to make clear that a limited liability corporation ("LLC") or
    limited liability partnership ("LLP") should identify itself as a
    "corporation."
      The form also is amended in several ways to assist the courts in
    evaluating their workload and fulfilling the statistical reporting
    requirements of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 159, enacted as part of BAPCPA.
    Accordingly, a new section of the form labeled "Nature of
    Business," is added that contains both existing checkboxes that
    identify certain types of debtors for which the Bankruptcy Code
    provides special treatment, such as stockbrokers and railroads, and
    a new checkbox for a "health care business" for which the 2005
    amendments to the Code include specific requirements. This section
    of the form also contains a checkbox for single asset real estate
    debtors, so they can be identified at the time of filing. All other
    businesses will mark the checkbox labeled "Other." Another new
    section titled "Tax-Exempt Entity" contains a checkbox to be used
    by qualified organizations. The Judicial Conference of the United
    States and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts
    will use this information in preparing statistical reports and
    analyses for Congress.
      A checkbox also is added for an individual debtor to indicate
    that the debtor is applying for a waiver of the filing fee, to
    implement the 2005 enactment of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1930(f) authorizing
    the bankruptcy court to waive the filing fee in certain
    circumstances. The description directs the debtor to the Official
    Form for the application that must be filed for the court's
    consideration.
      The section labeled "Nature of Debts" is amended to state the
    statutory definition of a "consumer debt" and to modify both the
    consumer and business categories by adding the word "primarily" to
    both choices to make it clearer to individual debtors that
    "business" may be the appropriate choice if personal debts have
    been incurred to finance a business venture.
      Although the 2005 Act eliminated from the Code any option to
    elect to be treated as a "small business" in a chapter 11 case, new
    provisions for "small business" debtors added by BAPCPA make it
    desirable to identify eligible debtors at the outset of the case.
    Accordingly, the section of the form labeled "Chapter 11 Small
    Business" is revised and renamed "Chapter 11 Debtors" for this
    purpose. Chapter 11 debtors that meet the definition of "small
    business debtor" in Sec. 101 of the Code are directed to identify
    themselves in this section of the form. Chapter 11 debtors whose
    aggregate noncontingent debts owed to non-insiders or affiliates
    are less than $2,190,000 are directed to identify themselves in
    this section. A third part of this section attempts to identify
    chapter 11 cases that are filed as pre-packaged cases, using
    criteria taken from Sec. 1126(b) of the Code. Identifying "pre-
    packs" at filing will assist judges and court staff to manage
    these cases appropriately.
      The statistical information concerning the number of creditors
    and estimated assets and liabilities is revised to provide more
    detail.
      BAPCPA also added a new Sec. 109(h) to the Code. To implement
    this provision, a section labeled "Exhibit D" is inserted on page 2
    of the form, and a separate Exhibit D is added. These additions
    will enable individual debtors to certify that they have received
    budget and credit counseling prior to filing, as required by Sec.
    109(h), or request a temporary waiver of, or exemption from, the
    requirement, if they meet the statutory requirements for such
    relief. Exhibit D includes directions to attach required
    documentation or, if the debtor requests a temporary waiver or an
    exemption, a motion for a determination by the court. Exhibit D
    also states the requirement that all individual debtors must obtain
    a briefing from an approved credit counseling agency before filing
    a bankruptcy case, unless one of the very limited exceptions
    applies, and further states the consequences that may be faced by
    any debtor who fails to comply.
      Space is provided on page 2 for a debtor who is a tenant of
    residential real property to certify whether the debtor's landlord
    has a judgment against the debtor for possession of the premises,
    whether under applicable nonbankruptcy law the debtor would be
    permitted to cure the monetary default, and whether the debtor has
    made the appropriate deposit with the court. This addition to the
    form implements Sec. 362(l) which was added to the Code in 2005.
    And a box is provided that allows the debtor to certify that s/he
    has served the landlord with the certification as required by Sec.
    362(l)(1).
      The signature sections and the declaration under penalty of
    perjury by an individual debtor concerning the notice received
    about bankruptcy relief, the declaration under penalty of perjury
    by a bankruptcy petition preparer, and the attorney signature box
    are amended to include new material mandated by the 2005 Act. The
    attorney signature box is also amended to remind the attorney that
    in a case in which Sec. 707(b)(4)(D) applies, that the signature
    constitutes a certification that the attorney has no knowledge
    after an inquiry that the information in the schedules filed with
    the petition is incorrect. A signature section is also provided for
    a representative of a foreign proceeding.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             

      Paragraph 3 of Exhibit D is amended to delete any reference to a
    requirement that a debtor file a motion with the court to obtain an
    order approving a request for the postponement of the debtor's
    obligation to obtain a credit counseling briefing prior to the
    commencement of the case. The paragraph immediately following
    numbered paragraph 3 is also amended to reflect the deletion of the
    need for a separate motion beyond the completion of the
    certification itself. That paragraph continues to warn the debtor
    that the case may be dismissed if the court does not find that a
    postponement is warranted. It also advises the debtor that, even if
    the court concludes that postponement of the obligation is
    appropriate, the debtor still must complete the briefing within the
    time allowed under the Code.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991            

      This form is derived from former Official Form No. 2.
      A statement that the applicant is unable to pay the filing fee
    except in installments has been added as required by Rule 1006(b).
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1995 AMENDMENT       

      This form is a "document for filing" that may be prepared by a
    "bankruptcy petition preparer" as defined in 11 U.S.C. Sec. 110,
    which was added to the Code by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994;
    accordingly, a signature line is provided for such preparer. In
    addition to signing, a bankruptcy petition preparer is required by
    section 110 to disclose the information requested. A signature line
    for a debtor's attorney also is added, as required by Rule 9011.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       

      The form has been reorganized and the paragraphs numbered. The
    debtor's certification concerning payment for services in the case
    has been placed ahead of the statement of proposed terms for
    installment payment of court fees. Acknowledgement by the debtor of
    the potential consequences of failure to pay any installment when
    due has been added. (See 11 U.S.C. Sec. 707(a)(2).) The language of
    the form also has been changed to conform to Rule 1006 and to
    clarify that a debtor is not disqualified from paying the filing
    fee in installments because the debtor has paid money to a
    bankruptcy petition preparer.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             

      Pursuant to Sec. 110(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, the certification
    by a non-attorney bankruptcy petition preparer requires a petition
    preparer to provide the full social security number of the
    individual who actually prepares the document pursuant to Sec.
    110(c) of the Code.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             

      The form is amended to direct the debtor to state that, until the
    filing fee is paid in full, the debtor will not make any additional
    payment or transfer any additional property to an attorney or any
    other person for services in connection with the case. The
    declaration and certification by a non-attorney bankruptcy petition
    preparer in the form are amended to include material mandated by
    Sec. 110 of the Code as amended by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention
    and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat.
    23 (April 20, 2005). The certification by a non-attorney bankruptcy
    petition preparer is re-named a declaration and also is revised to
    include material mandated by Sec. 110 of the Code as amended in
    2005. The order is amended to provide space for the court to set
    forth a payment schedule other than the one proposed by the debtor.

      [The 2005-2007 Committee Note incorporates the Committee Note
    previously published in 2005.]
      The form is amended to direct the debtor to state that, until the
    filing fee is paid in full, the debtor will not make any additional
    payment or transfer any additional property to an attorney or any
    other person for services in connection with the case. The
    declaration and certification by a non-attorney bankruptcy petition
    preparer in the form are amended to include material mandated by

    and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat.

      This form is new. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1930(f), enacted as part of the
    Bankruptcy Abuse [Prevention] and Consumer Protection Act of 2005,
    Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23 (April 20, 2005), provides that

    United States, the district court or the bankruptcy court may waive
    the filing fee in a case under chapter 7 of title 11 for an
    individual if the court determines that such individual has income
    less than 150 percent of the income official poverty line . . .
    applicable to a family of the size involved and is unable to pay
    that fee in installments." To implement this provision, Interim
    Rule 1006 adds a new subdivision (c). Official Form 3B is the form
    referenced in that subdivision, and is to be used by individual
    chapter 7 debtors when applying for a waiver of the filing fee. A
    corresponding standard order also is included.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991            

      This form is derived from former Official Form No. 9.
      In conformity with Rule 1007(d) and in recognition of the notice
    function served by this list under Rule 4001, governmental units
    must be listed if they are among the creditors holding the 20

      Rule 1008 requires all lists to be verified or contain an unsworn
    declaration conforming with 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1746.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       

      The form has been amended to delete reference to the specific
    subsection of 11 U.S.C. Sec. 101 in connection with the definition
    of the term "insider." Section 101 of the Bankruptcy Code contains
    numerous definitions, and statutory amendments from time to time
    have resulted in the renumbering of many of its subsections. The
    more general reference will avoid the necessity to amend the form
    further in the event of future amendments to Sec. 101.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             

      The form is amended to direct that the name of any minor child
    not be disclosed. The amendment implements Sec. 112 of the Code,
    which was added by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer
    Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23 (April 20,

    Rule 1007(m) a direction to include for noticing purposes the name,
    address, and legal relationship to the child of "a person
    described" in that rule. Rule 1007(m) requires the person named to
    be someone on whom process would be served in an adversary

    concerning any allegation can be requested by the debtor as part of
    the discovery process.
      Each petitioning creditor, by signing on the line provided, signs
    both the petition and the unsworn declaration which 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    1746 permits instead of verification. The addresses as well as the
    names of individuals signing the petition in a representative
    capacity are required, together with disclosure of which petitioner
    is represented by each signatory.
      This form is intended to be used in every involuntary case,
    including that of a partnership. The separate form for a petition
    by a partner has been abrogated. Pursuant to Sec. 303(b)(3)(A) of
    the Code, a petition by fewer than all of the general partners
    seeking an order for relief with respect to the partnership is
    treated as an involuntary petition. Such a petition is adversarial
    in character because not all of the partners are joining in the
    petition.
      Section 303(b)(3)(B) permits a petition against the partnership
    if relief has been ordered under the Code with respect to all of
    the general partners. In that event, the petition may be filed by a
    general partner, a trustee of a general partner's estate, or a
    creditor of the partnership. This form may be adapted for use in
    that type of case.
      28 U.S.C. Sec. 1408(1) specifies the proper venue alternatives
    for all persons, including partnerships, as domicile, residence,
    principal place of business, or location of principal assets. Venue
    also may be based on a pending case commenced by an affiliate,
    general partner, or partnership pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1408(2).
    Both options are set forth in the block labeled "Venue."
      28 U.S.C. Sec. 1746 permits the unsworn declaration instead of a
    verification. See Committee Note to Form 2.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1992 AMENDMENT       

      The form has been amended to require the dating of signatures.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT             

      The form is amended to give notice that no filing fee is required
    if a child support creditor or its representative is a petitioner,
    and if the petitioner also files a form detailing the child support
    debt, its status, and other characteristics, as specified in Sec.
    304(g) of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-394,
    108 Stat. 4106 (Oct. 22, 1994).
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             

      The form is amended to require the petitioner to disclose the
    debtor's employer identification number, if any, and only the last
    four digits of the debtor's social security number to afford
    greater privacy to the individual debtor, whose bankruptcy case
    records may be available on the Internet. The form also is amended
    to delete the request for information concerning the "Type of
    Business," as this data no longer is collected for statistical
    purposes.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             

      The form has been amended to delete statistical information no
    longer required and to add "as to liability or amount" to the
    language concerning debts that are the subject of a bona fide
    dispute, in conformity with Sec. 303 of the Code as amended by the
    Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005,
    Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23 (April 20, 2005). The petitioning
    creditors must now provide, to the extent known to them, all other
    names used by the debtor during the 8 years, rather than 6 years,
    before the filing of the petition. A new check box is provided for
    the petitioning creditors to identify the debtor that is a "health
    care business" as defined in Sec. 101 of the Code, thereby alerting
    the court and the United States trustee of the necessity under Sec.
    333 to appoint an ombudsman to represent the interests of the
    patients of the health care business. These amendments also
    implement the 2005 amendments to the Code. A new checkbox also is
    provided for a "clearing bank," which may become a debtor upon the
    filing of a petition at the direction of the Board of Governors of
    the Federal Reserve System; this addition conforms to an amendment
    to Sec. 109(b)(2) of the Code which was enacted in 2000.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             

      The section of the form labeled "Information Regarding Debtor" is
    amended to facilitate, to the extent available in an involuntary
    case, the collection of the same statistical information that is
    requested in a voluntary case. Accordingly, information about
    whether the debtor is an individual, a corporation, or some other
    type of entity is separated from the checklist of types of debtors,
    such as health care businesses and railroads, concerning which the
    Code provides for specialized treatment.
              COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005-2007 AMENDMENT          

      [The 2005-2007 Committee Note incorporates Committee Notes
    previously published in 2005 and 2006.]
      The form has been amended to delete statistical information about
    the debtor that no longer is required, and to substitute checkboxes
    similar to those on the voluntary petition form. The form also is
    amended to add "as to liability or amount" to the language
    concerning debts that are the subject of a bona fide dispute, in
    conformity with Sec. 303 of the Code as amended by the Bankruptcy
    Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No.
    109-8, 119 Stat. 23 (April 20, 2005). The petitioning creditors
    must now provide, to the extent known to them, all other names used
    by the debtor during the 8 years, rather than 6 years, before the
    filing of the petition. In conformity with Rule 9037, the
    petitioning creditors are directed to provide only the last four
    digits of any individual's tax-identification number. A new
    checkbox is provided for the petitioning creditors to identify the
    debtor that is a "health care business" as defined in Sec. 101 of
    the Code, thereby alerting the court and the United States trustee
    of the necessity under Sec. 333 of the Code to appoint an ombudsman
    to represent the interests of the patients of the health care
    business. These amendments also implement the 2005 amendments to
    the Code. A new checkbox also is provided for a "clearing bank,"
    which may become a debtor upon the filing of a petition at the
    direction of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System;
    this addition conforms to an amendment to Sec. 109(b)(2) of the
    Code, which was enacted in 2000.

    (ADDED AUG. 1, 1991; AMENDED MAR. 16, 1993; MAR. 14, 1995; OCT. 1,
      1997; DEC. 1, 2003; OCT. 17, 2005; OCT. 1, 2006; DEC. 1, 2007.)

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991            

      These schedules shall be used to comply with Sec. 521(1) of the
    Code and Rule 1007(b). Schedules A, B, D, E, and F constitute the
    schedule of assets and liabilities. Schedules I and J constitute a
    schedule of current income and current expenditures for individual
    and joint debtors. Two new schedules have been created, Schedule G -
     Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases, and Schedule H -
    Codebtors.
      The order of the schedules has been arranged with the summary
    sheet in front and with the schedules of assets appearing first,
    followed by the schedules of liabilities. This structure
    corresponds to the customary pattern by which trustees and
    creditors review these documents and to the format of the
    accounting profession for balance sheets.
      The schedules require a complete listing of assets and
    liabilities but leave many of the details to investigation by the
    trustee. Instructions in the former schedules to provide details
    concerning "written instruments" relating to the debtor's property
    or debts have been deleted. Section 521(3) of the Code requires the
    debtor to cooperate with the trustee, who can administer the estate
    more effectively by requesting any documents from the debtor rather
    than relying on descriptions in the schedules which may prove to be
    inaccurate.
      Leasehold interests in both real and personal property are to be
    reported in Schedule G - Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases.
    This information should not be repeated in the schedules of assets.
      Generally in these schedules, a creditor's claim will be listed
    only once, even if the claim is secured only in part, or is
    entitled only in part to priority under Sec. 507(a) of the Code,
    with the remainder of the claim to be treated as a general
    unsecured claim. For example, a partially secured creditor whose
    claim is reported in Schedule D - Creditors Holding Secured Claims
    will be listed together with the value of the property securing the
    claim and a notation of the amount of any unsecured portion of the
    claim. Information concerning the unsecured portion should not be
    repeated in Schedule F - Creditors Holding Nonpriority Unsecured
    Claims. Any resulting overstatement of the amounts owed on secured
    and priority claims as reported on the summary sheet is offset by a
    corresponding understatement of the amount owed on unsecured
    claims.
      If a debtor has no property or no creditors in a particular
    category, an affirmative statement to that effect is required.
    Married debtors should indicate whether property is jointly or
    separately owned and whether spouses are jointly or separately
    liable for debts, using the columns provided in the schedules.
      Former "Schedule B-3. Property not otherwise scheduled," has been
    deleted and its two questions moved. Schedule B - Personal Property
    now includes at item 33, "Other personal property of any kind not
    already listed." The only other question on former Schedule B-3
    concerned assignments for the benefit of creditors; it has been
    moved to the Statement of Financial Affairs.
      Schedule A - Real Property. Instructions at the top of the form
    indicate the scope of the interests in property to be reported on
    the schedule. Leasehold interests of the debtor are not reported
    here but on the Schedule of Executory Contracts and Unexpired
    Leases. The trustee will request copies of deeds or other
    instruments necessary to the administration of the estate.
      Schedule B - Personal Property. This schedule is to be used for
    reporting all of the debtor's interests in personal property except
    leases and executory contracts, which are to be listed on the
    Schedule of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases. Several new
    categories of property have been added to the schedule, i.e.,
    aircraft, and interests in IRA, ERISA, Keogh, or other pension or
    profit-sharing plans. To minimize the potential for concealment of
    assets, the debtor must declare whether the debtor has any property
    in each category on the schedule. The trustee can request copies of
    any documents concerning the debtor's property necessary to the
    administration of the estate.
      Schedule C - Property Claimed as Exempt. The form of the schedule
    has been modified to eliminate duplication of information provided
    elsewhere. The location of property, for example, which formerly
    was required here, is disclosed in the schedules of real and
    personal property. The requirement that the debtor state the
    present use of the property also has been eliminated as best left
    to inquiry by the trustee. Exemptions in some states are granted by
    constitutional provisions; accordingly, the requirement that the
    debtor state the "statute" creating an exemption has been changed
    to request a statement of the relevant "law."
      This schedule adds a new requirement that the debtor state the
    market value of the property in addition to the amount claimed as
    exempt.
      Schedule D - Creditors Holding Secured Claims. Schedules D, E,
    and F have been redesigned with address boxes sized to match the
    number of characters which can be accommodated on the computerized
    noticing systems used by the courts. The size also closely
    approximates that of standard mailing labels. Space is designated
    at the top of the box for the debtor's account number with the
    creditor. The design of the form is intended to reduce the volume
    of misdirected creditor mail.
      The form requires the debtor to state affirmatively that a claim
    is disputed, unliquidated, or contingent. The existence of any type
    of codebtor is to be disclosed, but details are to be provided in
    Schedule H, as they are not needed here. Duplication of information
    also has been kept to a minimum by deleting requests that the
    debtor indicate on this schedule whether a debt has been reduced to
    judgment and the date on which a creditor repossessed any
    collateral. Requests for details concerning negotiable instruments
    and the consideration for a claim, formerly part of the schedule,
    are left to the trustee's inquiries.
      Schedule E - Creditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims. The
    schedule lists all of the types of claims entitled to priority and
    requires the debtor to indicate the existence of claims in each
    category. Continuation sheets are provided. The type of priority
    claim is to be noted at the top of the continuation sheet, and each
    type must be reported on a separate sheet. This schedule also
    requires the debtor to indicate the existence of any codebtors. As
    in Schedule D - Creditors Holding Secured Claims, requests for
    information concerning judgments and negotiable instruments have
    been deleted.
      Schedule F - Creditors Holding Unsecured Nonpriority Claims. This
    schedule has been revised generally in conformity with the other
    schedules of creditors. If a claim is subject to setoff, the debtor
    is required to so state.
      Schedule G - Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases. Rule
    1007(b) requires the debtor to file a schedule of executory
    contracts and unexpired leases, unless the court orders otherwise.
    All unexpired leases of either real or personal property are to be
    reported on this schedule. The schedule also requires the debtor to
    disclose specific information to assist the trustee in identifying
    leases which must be assumed within 60 days after the order for
    relief or be deemed rejected under Sec. 365(d) of the Code.
      Schedule H - Schedule of Codebtors. This schedule is designed to
    provide the trustee and creditors with information about codebtors
    of all types other than spouses in joint cases. The completed
    schedule provides information concerning non-debtor parties, such
    as guarantors and non-debtor spouses having an interest in property
    as tenants by the entirety. In chapter 12 and chapter 13 cases, the
    completed schedule also indicates those persons who may be entitled
    to certain protections from creditor action under Secs. 1201 and
    1301 of the Code.
      Schedule I - Schedule of Current Income of Individual Debtor(s)
    and Schedule J - Schedule of Current Expenditures of Individual
    Debtor(s). Former Official Form No. 6A has been divided into a
    schedule of current income and a separate schedule of current
    expenditures. The language is substantially the same as in former
    Official Form No. 6A. In light of the abrogation of Official Form
    No. 10, the Chapter 13 Statement, style changes have been made so
    that these schedules can be used by individual and joint debtors in
    all chapters.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       

      Schedule E (Creditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims) has been
    changed to conform to the statutory amendment that added subsection
    (a)(8) to Sec. 507 of the Code. Pub. L. No. 101-647, (Crime Control
    Act of 1990), added the new subsection, which had the effect of
    creating an eighth priority for claims of certain governmental
    units based on commitments to maintain the capital of an insured
    depository institution.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1995 AMENDMENT       

      Schedule E - Creditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims is
    amended to add the new seventh priority afforded to debts for
    alimony, maintenance, or support of a spouse, former spouse, or
    child of the debtor by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994. Statutory
    references are amended to conform to the paragraph numbers of
    section 507(a) of the Code as renumbered by the 1994 Act. Schedule
    E also is amended to add commissions owed to certain independent
    sales representatives and to raise the maximum dollar amounts for
    certain priorities in accordance with amendments made by the 1994
    Act to section 507(a) of the Code. The 1994 Act also amended
    section 104 of the Code to provide for future adjustment of the
    maximum dollar amounts specified in section 507(a) to be made by
    administrative action at three-year intervals to reflect changes in
    the consumer price index. Schedule E is amended to give notice that
    these dollar amounts are subject to change without formal amendment
    to the official form.
      The Schedules are a "document for filing" that may be prepared by
    a "bankruptcy petition preparer" as defined in 11 U.S.C. Sec. 110,
    which was added to the Code by the 1994 Act; accordingly, a
    signature line for such preparer is added. In addition to signing,
    a bankruptcy petition preparer is required by section 110 to
    disclose the information requested.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       

      The form is amended to add to the column labels a reference to
    community liability for claims. The amendment is technical and
    corrects an editorial oversight.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             

      The instructions to Schedule D (Creditors Holding Secured
    Claims), Schedule E (Creditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims),
    and Schedule F (Creditors Holding Unsecured Nonpriority Claims) are
    amended to inform the debtor that the debtor must list the last
    four digits of any account number with the listed creditor, and
    that the debtor may, in its discretion, include the entire account
    number in the schedules. Schedule I (Current Income of Individual
    Debtor(s)) is amended to provide greater privacy to minors and
    other dependents of the debtor by deleting the requirement that the
    debtor disclose their names. Pursuant to Sec. 110(c) of the
    Bankruptcy Code, the certification by a non-attorney bankruptcy
    petition preparer requires a petition preparer to provide the full
    social security number of the individual who actually prepares the
    document.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             

      The forms of the Schedules of Assets and Liabilities are amended
    to implement the provisions of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and
    Consumer Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23,
    (April 20, 2005). An amendment that directs the debtor to avoid
    disclosing the name of any minor child occurs in several of the
    schedules in conformity with Sec. 112 which was added to the Code
    in 2005. Section 112 provides for the debtor to provide the name of
    any minor child confidentially to the court, should the trustee
    need the information to evaluate properly the information filed by
    the debtor.
      The "Statistical Summary of Certain Liabilities" is added to
    collect information needed to prepare statistical reports required
    under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 159, which was enacted as part of the 2005
    Act.
      Schedules A, B, C, and D are amended to delete the word "market"
    from the columns in which the debtor reports the value of various
    kinds of property. Amendments to Sec. 506 of the Code enacted in
    2005 specify that "replacement value" must be used in connection
    with certain property. The schedules no longer specify "market"
    value and permit the debtor to choose the appropriate one, whether
    that be replacement, market, or some other value. Valuation of
    property, generally, is the subject of extensive provisions in the
    Code, and the deletion of the word "market" from the determinations
    of value to be made by the debtor on the schedules is intended to
    remove any inference about choice of valuation standard. This
    deletion simply indicates that the form takes no position on which
    Code provision or valuation standard may be applicable in any
    instance.
      The following paragraphs describe changes that are specific to
    each schedule.
      Schedule B - Personal Property is amended to require the debtor
    to list any interests in an education IRA, as Sec. 541(b)(5), added
    to the Code in 2005, makes special provision for them. The schedule
    also is amended to require the debtor to disclose the existence of
    any customer lists or other compilations containing personally
    identifiable information provided by an individual to the debtor in
    connection with obtaining a product or service from the debtor for
    personal, family, or household purposes. This amendment implements
    Sec. 332, which was added to the Code in 2005.
      Schedule C - Property Claimed as Exempt is amended to delete
    descriptive information concerning the length of domicile required
    for the debtor to qualify to claim certain exemptions. Any summary
    of the amendments enacted in 2005 to Sec. 522 of the Code
    concerning these requirements might inadvertently cause the debtor
    to lose important rights. Accordingly, the form now directs the
    debtor to indicate whether exemptions are being claimed under Sec.
    522(b)(2) or Sec. 522(b)(3) and whether the debtor claims a
    homestead exemption that exceeds $125,000.
      Schedule E - Creditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims is
    amended to implement the changes in priority to which a claim may
    be entitled under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 507 as amended by the 2005 Act and
    to add the new priority included in the Reform Act for claims for
    death or personal injury while the debtor was intoxicated.
    "Subtotal" and "Total" boxes have been added to the column labeled
    "Amount Entitled to Priority" to assist the individual debtor to
    complete the Current Monthly Income ("CMI" or "Means Test") form.
      Schedule G - Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases is amended
    by deleting the note to the debtor advising that parties listed on
    this schedule may not receive notice of the filing of the
    bankruptcy case unless they also are listed on one of the schedules
    of liabilities. The better practice is for all parties to
    transactions with the debtor to receive notice of the filing of the
    case, and an amendment to Rule 1007 requiring the debtor to provide
    a mailing list that includes these parties is scheduled to take
    effect December 1, 2005.
      Schedule H - Codebtors is amended to add specifics about
    community property jurisdictions in connection with the requirement
    to provide the name of any spouse of a debtor who resides or
    resided in a community property jurisdiction. This amendment also
    mirrors amendments made in 1997 to Official Form 7, the Statement
    of Financial Affairs, and will assure that these codebtors receive
    notice of the filing of the bankruptcy case. The form also is
    amended to extend from six years to eight years the time period for
    which this information is reported pursuant to the 2005 amendments
    to Sec. 727(a)(8) of the Code.
      Schedule I - Current Income of Individual Debtor(s) is amended to
    require the income of a nondebtor spouse to be reported in cases
    filed under chapters 7 and 11. Line numbers have been added to
    assist the debtor in calculating and reporting totals. A new
    subtotal line for income from sources other than as an employee and
    a new "total monthly income" line provide for this form to be used
    in conjunction with Schedule J to satisfy the requirements of Sec.
    521(a)(1)(B)(v), which was added to the Code in 2005. The form also
    has been revised to provide the statement concerning any
    anticipated increase or decrease in income required in Sec.
    521(a)(1)(B)(vi), which also was added to the Code in 2005.
      Schedule J - Current Expenditures of Individual Debtor(s). A
    direction has been added to require the debtor to report any
    increase or decrease in expenses anticipated to occur within the
    year following the filing of the document, as required by Sec.
    521(a)(1)(B)(vi), which was added to the Code in 2005. The form
    also is amended to provide, in conjunction with Schedule I, a
    statement of monthly net income, itemized to show how the amount is
    calculated, as required by Sec. 522(a)(1)(B)(v), which was added to
    the Code in 2005.
      Declaration Concerning Debtor's Schedules. The declaration by a
    non-attorney bankruptcy petition preparer is amended to include
    material mandated by Sec. 110 of the Code as amended in 2005.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             

      In order to comply fully with the statistical reporting
    requirements of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 159, which was enacted as part of
    the 2005 Act [Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection
    Act of 2005, Pub. L. 109-8, Apr. 20, 2005, 119 Stat. 23] and takes
    effect in October 2006, the "Statistical Summary of Certain
    Liabilities" is renamed "Statistical Summary of Certain Liabilities
    and Related Data," and additional information is required to be
    stated there. Collecting in one place the bulk of the information
    to be used in the reports required under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 159 will
    assist the courts and the Director of the Administrative Office of
    the United States Courts to fulfill their statutory
    responsibilities.
      Schedule D is amended to provide for creating a total of any
    unsecured amounts (amounts that exceed the value of the collateral)
    owed to creditors holding secured claims, and for stating this
    amount on the Statistical Summary of Certain Liabilities and
    Related Data. Schedule E is amended to provide for creating totals
    of the amounts entitled to priority and of any amounts that exceed
    the statutory limits on certain priorities and to direct the debtor
    to report these amounts on the Statistical Summary of Certain
    Liabilities and Related Data. Schedule F is amended to direct the
    debtor to report the total of this schedule both on the Summary of
    Schedules and on the Statistical Summary of Certain Liabilities.
      The statistical reports required under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 159 must
    include "the current monthly income, average income, and average
    expenses" of individual debtors with primarily consumer debts as
    reported on the schedules filed by those debtors. Accordingly,
    Schedules I and J, on which debtors already are directed to report
    average income and average expenses are amended to label the totals
    arrived at by completing the schedules as "average monthly income"
    and "average monthly expenses." These amendments make no
    substantive changes, simply conforming the terminology on these
    schedules to that used in Sec. 159.
      The amount of the debtor's current monthly income, which also is
    required by Sec. 159, is derived from Official Forms 22A, 22B, or
    22C, depending on the chapter under which the debtor files. This
    amount is included on the Statistical Summary of Certain
    Liabilities and Related Data as a convenience to make reports under
    Sec. 159 easier to compile.
      The Declaration Concerning Debtor's Schedules is amended in the
    section designated for signing and verifying by an individual or
    joint debtor. The amendment accommodates the requirement that
    individual debtors must complete both the Summary of Schedules and
    the Statistical Summary of Certain Liabilities and Related Data by
    directing the debtor to state number of pages being verified as the
    number of sheets in the completed schedules "plus 2."
              COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005-2007 AMENDMENT          

      [The 2005-2007 Committee Note incorporates Committee Notes
    previously published in 2005 and 2006.]
      The forms of the Schedules of Assets and Liabilities are amended
    to implement the provisions of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and
    Consumer Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23,
    (April 20, 2005) ("BAPCPA"). An amendment that directs the debtor
    to avoid disclosing the name and address of any minor child occurs
    in Schedules B, D, E, F, G, and H in conformity with Sec. 112 which
    was added to the Code in 2005. Section 112 provides for the debtor
    to furnish the name of any minor child confidentially to the court,
    should the trustee need the information to evaluate properly the
    information filed by the debtor. In addition, those schedules are
    amended to add to the reference to Rule 1007(m), with respect to a
    minor child, a direction to include for noticing purposes the name,
    address, and legal relationship to the child of "a person
    described" in that rule. Rule 1007(m) requires the person named to
    be someone on whom process would be served in an adversary
    proceeding against the child.
      The "Statistical Summary of Certain Liabilities and Related Data"
    is added to collect from individual debtors with primarily consumer
    debts the information needed to prepare statistical reports
    required under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 159, which was enacted as part of
    BAPCPA. Collecting the bulk of the information to be used in these
    statistical reports in the Summary of Schedules and the statistical
    summary will assist the courts and the Director of the
    Administrative Office to fulfill their statutory responsibilities.
    Schedules D and E are amended to provide additional totals and,
    together with Schedule F, to direct debtors who must complete the
    statistical summary to report total amounts there. Similarly,
    Schedules I and J are amended to conform their terminology to that
    used in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 159 and direct debtors who must complete the
    statistical summary to report the specified amounts there.
      Schedules A, B, C, and D are amended to delete the word "market"
    from the columns in which the debtor reports the value of various
    kinds of property. Amendments to Sec. 506 of the Code enacted in
    2005 specify that "replacement value" must be used in connection
    with certain property. The schedules no longer specify "market"
    value and permit the debtor to choose the appropriate one, whether
    that be replacement, market, or some other value. Valuation of
    property, generally, is the subject of extensive provisions in the
    Code, and the deletion of the word "market" from the determinations
    of value to be made by the debtor on the schedules is intended to
    remove any inference about choice of valuation standard. This
    deletion simply indicates that the form takes no position on which
    Code provision or valuation standard may be applicable in any
    particular instance.
      The following paragraphs describe changes that are specific to
    each schedule:
      Schedule B - Personal Property is amended to require the debtor
    to list any interests in an education IRA, because Sec. 541(b)(5),
    added to the Code in 2005, makes special provision for them. The
    schedule is also amended to require the debtor to disclose the
    existence of any customer lists or other compilations containing
    personally identifiable information provided by an individual to
    the debtor in connection with obtaining a product or service from
    the debtor for personal, family, or household purposes. This
    amendment implements Sec. 332, which was added to the Code by
    BAPCPA in 2005.
      Schedule C - Property Claimed as Exempt is amended to delete
    descriptive information concerning the length of domicile required
    for the debtor to qualify to claim certain exemptions. Any summary
    of the BAPCPA amendments to Sec. 522 of the Code concerning these
    requirements might inadvertently cause the debtor to lose important
    rights. Accordingly, the form now directs the debtor to indicate
    whether exemptions are being claimed under Sec. 522(b)(2) or Sec.
    522(b)(3) and whether the debtor claims a homestead exemption that
    exceeds $136,875.
      Schedule D - Creditors Holding Secured Claims is amended to
    provide for creating a total of any unsecured amounts (amounts that
    exceed the value of the collateral) owed to creditors holding
    secured claims. In addition to facilitating statistical reporting,
    providing a breakdown of the amounts owed to creditors listed on
    this schedule will assist the individual debtor in completing the
    means test calculation under Sec. 707(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code.
      Schedule E - Creditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims is
    amended to implement the changes in priority to which a claim may
    be entitled under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 507 as amended by BAPCPA and to
    add the new priority included in the 2005 Act for claims for death
    or personal injury while the debtor was intoxicated. "Subtotal" and
    "Total" boxes have been added to the columns labeled "Amount
    Entitled to Priority" and "Amount Not Entitled to Priority" for
    statistical reporting purposes and to assist the individual debtor
    in completing the means test calculation under Sec. 707(b)(2)(A)(i)
    of the Code.
      Schedule H - Codebtors is amended to add specifics about
    community property jurisdictions in connection with the requirement
    to provide the name of any spouse of a debtor who resides or
    resided in a community property jurisdiction. This amendment also
    mirrors amendments made in 1997 to Official Form 7, the Statement
    of Financial Affairs, and will assure that these codebtors receive
    notice of the filing of the bankruptcy case. The form also is
    amended to extend from six years to eight years the time period for
    which this information is reported pursuant to the 2005 amendments
    to Sec. 727(a)(8) of the Code.
      Schedule I - Current Income of Individual Debtor(s) is amended to
    make it clear that "every" married debtor must provide income
    information for both spouses, unless the spouses are separated and
    a joint petition is not filed. The description of the income to be
    reported is revised to clarify that the purpose of this schedule is
    to obtain information about actual income on the date the
    bankruptcy case is filed and which a debtor reasonably expects in
    the future in contrast to the debtor's "current monthly income" as
    defined in Sec. 101(10A) and reported on Form 22A, 22B, or 22C. And
    a statement included at the top of the form also explains that the
    income calculated [sic] this form may be different than the current
    monthly income. Line numbers have been added to assist the debtor
    in calculating and reporting totals. A new subtotal line for income
    from sources other than as an employee and a new "average monthly
    income" line will enable this form to be used in conjunction with
    Schedule J to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 521(a)(1)(B)(v),
    which was added to the Code by BAPCPA. New statistical reporting
    requirements in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 159 also require "average monthly
    income." In addition, the form is revised to provide the statement
    concerning any anticipated increase or decrease in income required
    in Sec. 521(a)(1)(B)(vi), also added to the Code in 2005.
      Schedule J - Current Expenditures of Individual Debtor(s). In
    conjunction with amendments to Schedule I, the form is amended to
    provide for reporting the debtor's actual "average monthly
    expenses," as required by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 159 and a statement of
    monthly net income, itemized to show how the amount is calculated,
    as required by Sec. 522(a)(1)(B)(v), which was added to the Code by
    BAPCPA in 2005. In addition, line numbers have been inserted and
    the description of expenses revised to make it clear than [sic] the
    purpose of this schedule is to obtain information about a debtor's
    actual and reasonably foreseeable expenses on the date the
    bankruptcy case is filed. And a statement similar to the statement
    at the top of Schedule I explains that the expenses calculated on
    the form may differ from the expenses calculated on Forms [sic] 22A
    or 22C. A direction has been added to require the debtor to report
    any increase or decrease in expenses anticipated to occur within
    the year following the filing of the document, as required by Sec.
    521(a)(1)(B)(vi), which also was added to the Code in 2005.
      Declaration Concerning Debtor's Schedules. The declaration by
    individual or joint debtors is amended to require the debtor to
    merely state the total number of pages being verified. The
    declaration and signature of any non-attorney bankruptcy petition
    preparer is amended to include material mandated by Sec. 110 of the
    Code as amended in 2005.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991            

      This form consolidates questions from former Official Forms No.
    7, No. 8, and No. 10. This form is to be completed by all debtors.
    An individual debtor engaged in business as a sole proprietor,
    partner, family farmer, or self-employed professional should
    provide the information requested on this statement concerning all
    such activities as well as the individual's personal affairs.
      The Chapter 13 Statement, former Official Form No. 10, has been
    abrogated. Chapter 13 debtors are to complete this statement and
    the schedules prescribed in Official Form 6.
      All questions have been converted to affirmative directions to
    furnish information, and each question must be answered. If the
    answer is "none," or the question is not applicable, the debtor is
    required to so state by marking the box labeled "None" provided at
    each question.
      See Committee Note to Form 2 for a discussion of the unsworn
    declaration at the end of this form.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       

      The form has been amended in two ways. In the second paragraph of
    the instructions, the third sentence has been deleted to clarify
    that only a debtor that is or has been in business as defined in
    the form should answer Questions 16-21. In addition, administrative
    proceedings have been added to the types of legal actions to be
    disclosed in Question 4.a.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1995 AMENDMENT       

      This form is a "document for filing" that may be prepared by a
    "bankruptcy petition preparer" as defined in 11 U.S.C. Sec. 110,
    which was added to the Code by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994;
    accordingly, a signature line for such preparer is added. In
    addition to signing, a bankruptcy petition preparer is required by
    section 110 to disclose the information requested.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 2000 AMENDMENT       

      The form has been amended to provide more information to taxing
    authorities, pension fund supervisors, and governmental units
    charged with environmental protection and regulation. Four new
    questions have been added to the form, covering community property
    owned by a debtor and the debtor's non-filing spouse or former
    spouse (Question 16), environmental information (Question 17), any
    consolidated tax group of a corporate debtor (Question 24), and the
    debtor's contributions to any employee pension fund (Question 25).
    In addition, every debtor will be required to state on the form
    whether the debtor has been in business within six years before
    filing the petition and, if so, must answer the remaining questions
    on the form (Questions 19-25). This is an enlargement of the two-
    year period previously specified. One reason for the longer "reach
    back" period is that business debtors often owe taxes that have
    been owed for more than two years. Another is that some of the
    questions already addressed to business debtors request information
    for the six-year period before the commencement of the case.
    Application of a six-year period to this section of the form will
    assure disclosure of all relevant information.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             

      Pursuant to Sec. 110(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, the certification
    by a non-attorney bankruptcy petition preparer requires a petition
    preparer to provide the full social security number of the
    individual who actually prepares the document.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             

      The form is amended in several ways to reflect changes in the
    Bankruptcy Code made by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and
    Consumer Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23
    (April 20, 2005). A new sentence in the introduction advises the
    debtor not to disclose the name and address of any minor child.
      The definition of "in business" is amended in the introductory
    section and in Question 1 and Question 18 to clarify that various
    part-time activities can result in the debtor being "in business"
    for purposes of the form.
      Question 1 is amended to specify that, in addition to the income
    from the debtor's primary employment, the debtor must include
    income from part-time activities either as an employee or from self-
    employment. The debtor now also will report the source of all
    income from employment or operation of a business, even if there is
    only one source, in order to assist the trustee in reviewing the
    pay stubs, etc., filed by the debtor in the case.
      Question 3 is amended to accommodate amendments to Sec. 547(c) of
    the Code enacted in 2005 which exempt from recovery by the trustee
    payments by a debtor for a domestic support obligation or as part
    of an alternative repayment schedule negotiated by an approved
    nonprofit budgeting and credit counseling agency. In addition,
    Question 3 now requires a debtor with primarily non-consumer debts
    to report only those transfers that aggregate more than $5,000 to
    any creditor in the 90-day period prior to the filing of the
    petition, as a result of the addition of Sec. 547(c)(9) to the Code
    in 2005.
      In Question 10, the extension of the reachback period for
    transfers from one year to two years reflects the 2005 amendment to
    Sec. 548(a)(1) of the Code to permit a trustee to avoid a
    fraudulent transfer made by the debtor within two years of the date
    of the filing of the petition. Question 10 also is amended to
    implement new Sec. 548(e) added to the Code in 2005 to require the
    debtor to disclose all transfers to any self-settled asset
    protection trust within the ten years before the filing of the
    petition.
      Question 15 is amended to extend from two years to three years
    the preterition time period for which the debtor must disclose the
    addresses of all premises occupied by the debtor. This information
    will assist the trustee, the United States trustee, and the court
    to ascertain whether any homestead exemption asserted by the debtor
    is properly claimed under Sec. 522(v)(3)(A) as amended, and Secs.
    522(p) and (q) as added to the Code in 2005.
      The form also is amended to extend from six years to eight years
    the period before the filing of the petition concerning which the
    debtor is required to disclose the name of the debtor's spouse or
    of any former spouse who resides or resided with the debtor in a
    community property state. In addition, the certification by a non-
    attorney bankruptcy petition preparer is renamed a "declaration"
    and is amended to include material mandated by 11 U.S.C. Sec. 110
    as amended by the 2005 Act.
              COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005-2007 AMENDMENT          

      [The 2005-2007 Committee Note incorporates the Committee Note
    previously published in 2005.]
      The form is amended in several ways to reflect changes in the
    Bankruptcy Code made by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and
    Consumer Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23
    (April 20, 2005). A new sentence in the introduction advises the
    debtor not to disclose the name and address of any minor child in
    conformity with Sec. 112, which was added to the Code by the 2005
    Act. In addition, the form is amended to add to the reference to
    Rule 1007(m) with respect to a minor child a direction to include
    for noticing purposes the name, address, and legal relationship to
    the child of "a person described" in that rule. Rule 1007(m)
    requires the person named to be someone on whom process would be
    served in an adversary proceeding against the child.
      The definition of "in business" is amended in the introductory
    section and in Question 1 and Question 18 to clarify that various
    part-time activities can result in the debtor being "in business"
    for purposes of the form.
      Question 1 is amended to specify that, in addition to the income
    from the debtor's primary employment, the debtor must include
    income from part-time activities either as an employee or from self-
    employment. The debtor now also will report the source of all
    income from employment or operation of a business, even if there is
    only one source, in order to assist the trustee in reviewing the
    pay stubs, etc., filed by the debtor in the case.
      Question 3 is amended to accommodate amendments to Sec. 547(c) of
    the Code enacted in 2005 which exempt from recovery by the trustee
    payments by a debtor for a domestic support obligation or as part
    of an alternative repayment schedule negotiated by an approved
    nonprofit budgeting and credit counseling agency. In addition,
    Question 3 now requires a debtor with primarily non-consumer debts
    to report only those transfers that aggregate more than $5,475 to
    any creditor in the 90-day period prior to the filing of the
    petition, as a result of the addition of Sec. 547(c)(9) to the Code
    in 2005. In addition, the language of the question is revised for
    clarity.
      In Question 10, the extension of the reach-back period for
    transfers from one year to two years reflects the 2005 amendment to
    Sec. 548(a)(1) of the Code to permit a trustee to avoid a
    fraudulent transfer made by the debtor within two years before the
    date of the filing of the petition. Question 10 also is amended to
    implement new Sec. 548(e) added to the Code in 2005 to require the
    debtor to disclose all transfers to any self-settled asset
    protection trust within the ten years before the filing of the
    petition.
      Question 15 is amended to extend from two years to three years
    the prepetition time period for which the debtor must disclose the
    addresses of all premises occupied by the debtor. This information
    will assist the trustee, the United States trustee, and the court
    to ascertain whether any homestead exemption asserted by the debtor
    is properly claimed under Sec. 522(b)(3)(A) as amended, and Secs.
    522(p) [sic] and (q) as added to the Code in 2005.
      The form also is amended to extend from six years to eight years
    the period before the filing of the petition concerning which the
    debtor is required to disclose the name of the debtor's spouse or
    of any former spouse who resides or resided with the debtor in a
    community property state. In addition, the certification by a non-
    attorney bankruptcy petition preparer is renamed a "declaration"
    and is amended to include material mandated by 11 U.S.C. Sec. 110
    as amended by the 2005 Act.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991            

      This form is derived from former Official Form No. 8A. Rule
    1007(b)(2) requires the debtor to serve a copy of this statement on
    the trustee and all creditors named in the statement. In a joint
    case, if the property and debts of both debtors are the same, the
    form may be adapted for joint use. If joint debtors have separate
    debts, however, each debtor must use a separate form.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1995 AMENDMENT       

      This form is a "document for filing" that may be prepared by a
    "bankruptcy petition preparer" as defined in 11 U.S.C. Sec. 110,
    which was added to the Code by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994;
    accordingly, a signature line for such preparer is added. In
    addition to signing, a bankruptcy petition preparer is required by
    section 110 to disclose the information requested.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       

      The form is amended to conform more closely to the language of
    the Bankruptcy Code. The amendments also make clear that the form
    is not intended to take a position regarding whether the options
    stated on the form are the only choices available to the debtor.
    Compare Lowry Federal Credit Union v. West, 882 F.2d 1543 (10th
    Cir. 1989), with In re Taylor, 3 F.3d 1512 (11th Cir. 1993).
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             

      Pursuant to Sec. 110(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, the certification
    by a non-attorney bankruptcy petition preparer requires a petition
    preparer to provide the full social security number of the
    individual who actually prepares the document.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             

      The form is amended to conform to Sec. 521(a)(6), which was added
    to the Code by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer
    Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23 (April 20,
    2005), by adding a section covering personal property subject to an
    unexpired lease and an option labeled "lease will be assumed
    pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Sec. 362(h)(1)(A)" to the choices a debtor
    may make. The certification by a non-attorney bankruptcy petition
    preparer in the form is renamed a "declaration" and is amended to
    include material mandated by the 2005 amendments to Sec. 110 of the
    Code.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             

      The form is amended to conform to Sec. 362(h), which was added to
    the Code, and Sec. 521(a)(2), which was amended, by the Bankruptcy
    Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No.
    109-8, 119 Stat. 23 (April 20, 2005), by expanding the questions
    directed to the debtor regarding leased personal property and
    property subject to security interests. The form is also amended
    and reformatted to require the debtor to complete a series of
    statements describing the property and setting out what actions the
    debtor intends to take for each listed asset. The amended form is
    intended to elicit more complete information about the debtor's
    intentions with regard to property subject to security interests
    and personal property leases than has been obtained under the
    current version of the form.
      In addition, the form is amended to specify that the debtor's
    signature is a declaration under penalty of perjury, as required by
    Rule 1008, and to provide space for the co-debtor's signature. A
    continuation page has been provided for use if necessary. The
    Declaration of Non-Attorney Bankruptcy Petition Preparer has been
    deleted from the form as duplicative of Form 19, Declaration and
    Signature of Non-Attorney Bankruptcy Petition Preparer. Form 19
    contains both the petition preparer's declaration and signature and
    the notice the petition preparer is required to give to the debtor
    under Sec. 110 of the Code.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991            

      The form has been redesigned to facilitate electronic generation
    of notice to creditors concerning the filing of the petition, the
    meeting of creditors, and important deadlines in the case. Adoption
    of a box format, with significant dates highlighted, is intended to
    assist creditors who may be unfamiliar with bankruptcy cases to
    understand the data provided. Nine variations of the form,
    designated 9A through 9I, have been created to meet the specialized
    notice requirements for chapters 7, 11, 12, and 13, asset and no-
    asset cases, and the various types of debtors.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1992 AMENDMENT       

      Forms 9B, 9D, 9F, and 9H are amended to make a technical
    correction in the reference to Rule 9001(5). Form 9H also contains
    a technical correction deleting the reference to a complaint object
    to discharge of the debtor.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       

      The title page of the form has been amended to conform to the
    headings used on Forms 9A-9I. Alternate versions of Form 9E and
    Form 9F have been added for the convenience of districts that
    routinely set a deadline for filing claims in a chapter 11 case.
    When a creditor receives the alternate form in a case, the box
    labeled "Filing Claims" will contain information about the bar date
    as follows: "Deadline for filing a claim: (date)." If no deadline
    is set in a particular case, either the court will use Form 9E or
    Form 9F, as appropriate, or the alternate form will be used with
    the following sentence appearing in the box labeled "Filing
    Claims": "When the court sets a deadline for filing claims,
    creditors will be notified."
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1995 AMENDMENT       

      The form is amended to provide notice of the claims filing period
    provided to "a governmental unit" by section 502(b)(9) of the Code
    as amended by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994. A court that
    routinely sets a deadline for filing proofs of claim at the outset
    of chapter 11 cases and, accordingly, uses Form 9E(Alt.) or Form
    9F(Alt.) retains the option in any case in which no deadlines
    actually are set to substitute a message stating that creditors
    will be notified if the court fixes a deadline.
      The form also is amended to add, in the paragraph labeled
    "Discharge of Debts," a reference to dischargeability actions under
    section 523(a)(15) of the Code, which was added by the 1994 Act.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       

      Forms 9A, 9I (and the alternate versions of Forms 9E and 9F) have
    been amended, redesigned, and rewritten. Minor conforming changes
    have been made to respond to amendments made in the Bankruptcy
    Reform Act of 1994: the longer claims filing period for
    governmental units in section 502(b)(9) of the Code (see Forms 9C,
    9D, 9E(Alt.), 9F(Alt.), 9G, 9H, and 9I); and a reference to
    dischargeability actions under section 523(a)(15) (see Forms 9A,
    9C, 9E, and 9E(Alt.), 9G, and 9H). All of the forms have been
    substantially revised to make them easier to read and understand.
    The titles have been simplified. Recipients are told why they are
    receiving the notice. Explanations are provided on the back of the
    form and are set in larger type. Plain English is used. Deadlines
    are highlighted on the front of the form. Recipients are told that
    papers must be received by the bankruptcy clerk's office by the
    applicable deadline. The box for the trustee has been deleted from
    the chapter 11 notices (Forms 9E and 9F and the alternates).
    Various alternatives are set out in brackets in many of the forms,
    permitting each bankruptcy clerk's office to tailor the forms even
    more precisely to fit the needs of a particular case. The court may
    use blank spaces on the form to include additional information
    applicable to the particular district.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             

      The form is amended to add to the information provided to
    creditors, the trustee and the United States trustee, all the names
    used by the debtor during the six years prior to the filing of the
    petition. The form includes the debtor's full employer
    identification number, if any, as well as the last four digits of
    the debtor's social security number. Rule 2002(a)(1) also is
    amended to direct the clerk to include the debtor's full social
    security number and employer identification number on the notices
    served on the United States trustee, the trustee, and creditors.
    This will enable creditors to identify the debtor accurately. The
    copy of Official Form 9 included in the case file, however, will
    show only the last four digits of the debtor's social security
    number. This should afford greater privacy to the individual
    debtor, whose bankruptcy case records may be available on the
    Internet.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             

      The form is amended in a variety of way [sic] to implement the
    provisions of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer
    Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23 (April 20,
    2005). All versions of the form are amended to advise creditors to
    consult an attorney concerning what rights they may have in the
    specific case. All versions of the form are also amended to provide
    information about filing claims to creditors with foreign addresses
    and to advise those creditors to consult a lawyer familiar with
    United States bankruptcy law regarding any questions they may have
    about their rights in a particular case. These amendments implement
    Sec. 1514, which was added to the Code in 2005.
      Forms 9A and 9C are amended to include a box in which the clerk
    can notify creditors in a chapter 7 case filed by an individual
    with primarily consumer debts whether the presumption of abuse has
    arisen under Sec. 707(b) of the Code as amended in 2005. Under Sec.
    342(d) of the Code, the clerk has a duty to notify creditors
    concerning the presumption within ten days of the filing of the
    petition. If [sic] cases in which the debtor does not file Official
    Form 22A with the petition, the forms provide for the clerk to
    state that insufficient information has been filed, and to inform
    creditors that if later-filed information indicates that the
    presumption arises, creditors will be sent another notice.
      In cases involving serial filers (debtors who have filed more
    than one case within a specified period), the automatic stay
    provided by Sec. 362(a) of the Code as amended in 2005 may not
    apply or may be limited in duration, unless the stay is extended or
    imposed by court order. The form contains a general statement
    alerting debtors to this possibility.
      Section 1514, added to the Code in 2005, also requires that a
    secured creditor with a foreign address be advised whether the
    creditor is required to file a proof of claim, and Forms 9B, 9D,
    9E, 9E (Alt.), 9F, 9F (Alt.), 9G, 9H, and 9I are amended to include
    general information addressing that question. Forms 9E, 9E (Alt.),
    9F, and 9F (Alt.) also are amended to inform creditors that in a
    case in which the debtor has filed a plan for which it has
    solicited acceptances before filing the case, the court may, after
    notice and a hearing, order that the United States trustee not
    convene a meeting of creditors.
      Forms 9E and 9E Alt. are amended to state that, unless the court
    orders otherwise, an individual chapter 11 debtor's discharge is
    not effective until completion of all payments under the plan, as
    provided in Sec. 1141(d)(5) which was added to the Code in 2005.
    Forms 9F and 9F (Alt.) are amended to include a deadline to file a
    complaint to determine the discharge ability of a debt, in
    conformity with Sec. 1141(d)(6) which was added to the Code in
    2005.
      Form 9I is amended to include a deadline to file a complaint to
    determine the discharge ability of certain debts. This amendment
    implements 2005 amendment [sic] to Sec. 1328(a)(1) of the Code.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             

      Forms 9G and 9H are amended to add "family fisherman" to the
    title and to the description of chapter 12. The 2005 amendments to
    the Code added a "family fisherman," as defined in Sec. 101(19A),
    to the persons eligible to file a bankruptcy case under chapter 12.
    Form 9I is amended to provide general notice to parties in interest
    of the potential for a claim to be filed late in the case.
              COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005-2007 AMENDMENT          

      [The 2005-2007 Committee Note incorporates Committee Notes
    previously published in 2005 and 2006.]
      The form is amended in a variety of ways to implement the
    provisions of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer
    Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23 (April 20,
    2005). All versions of the form are amended to advise creditors to
    consult an attorney concerning what rights they may have in the
    specific case. All versions of the form also are amended to provide
    to creditors with foreign addresses information about filing claims
    and to advise those creditors to consult a lawyer familiar with
    United States bankruptcy law regarding any questions they may have
    about their rights in a particular case. These amendments implement
    Sec. 1514, which was added to the Code in 2005.
      Forms 9A and 9C are amended to include a box in which the clerk
    can notify creditors in a chapter 7 case filed by an individual
    with primarily consumer debts if the presumption of abuse has
    arisen under Sec. 707(b) of the Code as amended in 2005. Under Sec.
    342(d) of the Code, the clerk has a duty to notify creditors
    concerning the presumption within ten days of the filing of the
    petition. In cases in which the debtor does not file Official Form
    22A with the petition, the forms provide for the clerk to state
    that insufficient information has been filed, and to inform
    creditors that if later-filed information indicates that the
    presumption arises, creditors will be sent another notice. Forms 9G
    and 9H are amended to add "family fishermen" to the notices used in
    chapter 12 cases, in conformity with the 2005 amendments to the
    Code extending the provisions of chapter 12 to family fishermen.
      In cases involving serial filers (debtors who have filed more
    than one case within a specified period), the automatic stay
    provided by Sec. 362(a) of the Code as amended in 2005 may not
    apply or may be limited in duration, unless the stay is extended or
    imposed by court order. The form contains a general statement
    alerting debtors to this possibility.
      Section 1514, added to the Code in 2005, also requires that a
    secured creditor with a foreign address be advised whether the
    creditor is required to file a proof of claim, and Forms 9B, 9D,
    9E, 9E (Alt.), 9F, 9F (Alt.), 9G, 9H, and 9I are amended to include
    general information addressing that question. Forms 9E, 9E (Alt.),
    9F, and 9F (Alt.) also are amended to inform creditors that in a
    case in which the debtor has filed a plan for which it has
    solicited acceptances before filing the case, the court may, after
    notice and a hearing, order that the United States trustee not
    convene a meeting of creditors.
      Forms 9E and 9E (Alt.) are amended to state that, unless the
    court orders otherwise, an individual chapter 11 debtor's discharge
    is not effective until completion of all payments under the plan,
    as provided in Sec. 1141(d)(5) which was added to the Code in 2005.
    Forms 9F and 9F (Alt.) are amended to include a deadline to file a
    complaint to determine the dischargeability of a debt, in
    conformity with Sec. 1141(d)(6), which also was added to the Code
    in 2005.
      Form 9I is amended to include a deadline to file a complaint to
    determine the dischargeability of certain debts. This amendment
    implements a 2005 amendment to Sec. 1328(a) of the Code.
      In addition, all versions of the form are amended to provide to
    the public only the last four digits of any individual debtor's
    taxpayer-identification number. This amendment implements Rule
    9037.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991            

      This form replaces former Official Forms No. 19, No. 20, and No.
    21. The box format and simplified language are intended to
    facilitate completion of the form.
      The form directs the claimant to attach documents to support the
    claim or, if voluminous, a summary of such documents. These include
    any security agreement (if not included in the writing on which the
    claim is founded), and evidence of perfection of any security
    interest. See Committee Note to Rule 3001(d) concerning
    satisfactory evidence of perfection. If the claim includes
    prepetition interest or other charges such as attorney fees, a
    statement giving a detailed breakdown of the elements of the claim
    is required.
      Rule 2002(g) requires the clerk to update the mailing list in the
    case by substituting the address provided by a creditor on a proof
    of claim, if that address is different from the one supplied by the
    debtor. The form contains checkboxes to assist the clerk in
    performing this duty. The form also alerts the trustee when the
    claim is an amendment to or replacement for an earlier claim.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1993 AMENDMENT       

      The form has been amended to accommodate inclusion of the
    priority afforded in Sec. 507(a)(8) of the Code, which was added by
    Pub. L. No. 101-647, (Crime Control Act of 1990), and to avoid the
    necessity of further amendment to the form if other priorities are
    added to Sec. 507(a) in the future. In addition, sections 4 and 5
    of the form have been amended to clarify that only prepetition
    arrearages and charges are to be included in the amount of the
    claim.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1995 AMENDMENT       

      The form is amended to add the seventh priority granted by the
    Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 to debts for alimony, maintenance, or
    support of a spouse, former spouse, or child of the debtor. The
    form also amends the Code reference to the priority afforded to tax
    debts and the dollar maximums for the priorities granted to wages
    and customer deposits in conformity with amendments made by the
    1994 Act to section 507(a) of the Code. The 1994 Act also amended
    section 104 of the Code to provide for future adjustment of the
    dollar amounts specified in section 507(a) to be made by
    administrative action at three-year intervals to reflect changes in
    the consumer price index. The form is amended to include notice
    that these dollar amounts are subject to change without formal
    amendment to the official form.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       

      Numbered sections 4. and 5. of the form have been reformatted to
    eliminate redundant information and make it easier to complete the
    form correctly. A creditor will report the total amount of the
    claim first, and will report only that amount unless the claim is
    secured by collateral or entitled to a priority under Sec. 507 of
    the Code.
      Explanatory definitions and instructions for completing the form
    also have been added.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             

      The form is amended to require a wage, salary, or other
    compensation creditor to disclose only the last four digits of the
    creditor's social security number to afford greater privacy to the
    creditor. A trustee can request the full information necessary for
    tax withholding and reporting at the time the trustee makes a
    distribution to creditors.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             

      The form is amended to conform to changes in the priority
    afforded the claims of certain creditors in Sec. 507(a) of the Code
    as amended by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer
    Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23 (April 20,
    2005).
              COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005-2007 AMENDMENT          

      [The 2005-2007 Committee Note incorporates the Committee Note
    previously published in 2005.]
      The form is amended to conform to changes in the priority
    afforded the claims of certain creditors in Sec. 507(a) of the Code
    as amended by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer
    Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23 (April 20,
    2005).
      In addition, the form and its instructions are amended in several
    respects based on the experiences of creditors and trustees in
    using it and on the technological changes that have occurred in the
    courts' processing of claims. A definition of the word "redacted"
    has been added in conformity with Rule 9037.
      The creditor now has a space in which to provide a separate
    payment address if different from the creditor's address for
    receiving notices in the case. The checkboxes for indicating that
    the creditor's address provided on the proof of claim is a new
    address, and that the creditor never received any notices from the
    court in the case have been deleted. The computer systems now used
    by the courts make it unnecessary for a creditor to "flag" a new
    address or call attention to the fact that the creditor is making
    its first appearance in the case. In place of the deleted items is
    a new checkbox to be used when a debtor or a trustee files a proof
    of claim for a creditor; it will alert the clerk to send the notice
    required by Rule 3004. The box for indicating whether the claim
    replaces a previously filed claim also has been deleted as no
    longer necessary in light of the 2005 amendments to Rules 3004 and
    3005. The creditor simply will amend the claim filed by the other
    party.
      Requests for the creditor to state the date on which the debt was
    incurred and the date on which any court judgment concerning the
    debt was obtained have been deleted, based on reports from trustees
    that they rely on the documents supporting the claim for this
    information. The checkboxes for stating the basis for the
    creditor's claim have been replaced with a blank in which the
    creditor is to provide this information. Examples of the most
    common categories, based on the former checkboxes, can be found in
    the instructions on the form. The request to state the account
    number by which the creditor identifies the debtor has been moved
    to paragraph 3 of the form and has been revised to request only the
    last four digits of the number, in conformity with Rule 9037. In
    addition, a new paragraph 3a gives the creditor a place to notify
    the trustee and the court of any change in the creditor's name, or
    that the claim has been transferred, or to provide any other
    information to clarify a difference between the proof of claim and
    the creditor's claim as scheduled by the debtor.
      The adjective "total" is deleted from the sections of the form
    where the creditor states the amount of the claim and the creditor
    now simply reports the amount of the claim. If the claim is a
    general unsecured claim, no further details are stated on the form,
    although a creditor still must attach a copy of any writing on
    which the claim is based, as required by Rule 3001(c), and must
    attach a statement itemizing any interest or other charges (in
    addition to the principal) that are included in the claim. If the
    claim or any part of it is secured or entitled to priority under
    Sec. 507(a) of the Code, the creditor is directed to provide
    details in the appropriate sections of the form. The creditor now
    states the amount to be afforded priority only once, in the section
    of the form designated for describing the specific priority being
    asserted. The introductory language in the section where the
    creditor describes any priority to which it is entitled has been
    revised for clarity. The word "collateral" has been replaced with
    the less colloquial and more accurate phrase "lien on property"
    throughout the form.
      Information about obtaining acknowledgment from the court of the
    filing of the proof of claim is revised and moved to a new section
    on the reverse side called "Information." This new section also
    alerts a creditor to the possibility that it may be approached
    about selling its claim, advises that the court has no role in any
    such solicitations, and states that a creditor is under no
    obligation to accept any offer to purchase its claim. A new
    instruction is added about signing a proof of claim. This
    instruction includes citations to Rules 9011 and 5005(a)(2)
    concerning signature requirements in an electronic filing
    environment.
      Finally, all of the definitions and instructions on the reverse
    side of the form are amended generally to reflect the deletions,
    additions, and other changes made on page 1. These include a
    reminder to the creditor to keep the court informed of any changes
    in its address. The instructions now appear at the top of the page,
    and the text is revised both to reflect the substantive changes to
    the form and to improve the clarity and style of this explanatory
    material.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             

      The form is amended at box seven on page one, and instructions
    two and seven on page two, to instruct the claimant that the
    information contained in or attached to a claim based on the
    delivery of health care goods or services should be limited so as
    to avoid embarrassment or the unnecessary disclosure of
    confidential information. The claimant is informed that additional
    disclosure may be required if the trustee or another party in
    interest objects to the claim.
      Page two of the form is also amended to revise slightly the
    definitions of "creditor" and "claim" to conform more closely to
    the definitions of those terms in the Code.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991            

      This form previously was numbered Official Form No. 28. The form
    is related to Rule 3017(a). Section 1125 of the Code requires court
    approval of a disclosure statement before votes may be solicited
    for or against a plan in either chapter 11 reorganization or
    chapter 9 municipality cases.
      Objections to the disclosure statement may be filed. Rule 3017(a)
    specifies that the court may fix a time for the filing of
    objections or they can be filed at any time prior to approval of
    the statement.
      Rule 3017(a) also specifies the persons who are to receive copies
    of the statement and plan prior to the hearing. These documents
    will not be sent to all parties in interest because at this stage
    of the case it could be unnecessarily expensive and confusing.
    However, any party in interest may request copies. The request
    should be made in writing (Rule 3017(a)), and sent to the person
    mailing the statement and plan which, as the form indicates, would
    usually be the proponent of the plan.
      This form may be adapted for use if more than one disclosure
    statement is to be considered by the court.

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991            

      This form is derived from former Official Form No. 30. The form
    has been amended to facilitate the voting of a debtor's shares held
    in "street name." The form may be adapted to designate the class in
    which each ballot is to be tabulated. It is intended that a
    separate ballot will be provided for each class in which a holder
    may vote.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       

      The form has been substantially amended to simplify its format
    and make it easier to complete correctly.
      Directions or blanks for proponent to complete the text of the
    ballot are in italics and enclosed within brackets. A ballot should
    include only the applicable language from the alternatives shown on
    this form and should be adapted to the particular requirements of
    the case.
      If the plan provides for creditors in a class to have the right
    to reduce their claims so as to qualify for treatment given to
    creditors whose claims do not exceed a specified amount, the ballot
    should make provisions for the exercise of that right. See section
    1122(b) of the Code.
      If debt or equity securities are held in the name of a
    broker/dealer or nominee, the ballot should require the furnishing
    of sufficient information to assure that duplicate ballots are not
    submitted and counted and that ballots submitted by a broker/dealer
    or nominee reflect the votes of the beneficial holders of such
    securities. See Rule 3017(e).
      In the event that more than one plan of reorganization is to be
    voted upon, the form of ballot will need to be adapted to permit
    holders of claims or equity interests (a) to accept or reject each
    plan being proposed, and (b) to indicate preferences among the
    competing plans. See section 1129(c) of the Code.

    name, all other names used by the debtor within six years before
    the commencement of the case, and the debtor's social security and
    tax identification numbers. This form of caption is prescribed for
    use on the petition, the notice of the meeting of creditors, the
    order of discharge, and the documents relating to a chapter 11
    plan, (Official Forms 1, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 18). See Rule
    2002(m). In the petition (Official Form 1), and the notice of the
    meeting of creditors, (Official Form 9), the information required
    by Rule 1005 appears in a block format. A notation of the chapter
    of the Bankruptcy Code under which the case is proceeding has been
    added to the form.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1995 AMENDMENT       

      The form is amended to provide for the debtor's address to appear
    in the caption in furtherance of the duty of the debtor to include
    this information on every notice given by the debtor. The
    Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 amended section 342 of the Code to
    add this requirement.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             

      The form is amended to require disclosure of only the last four
    digits of the debtor's social security number to afford greater
    privacy to the individual debtor, whose bankruptcy case records may
    be available over the Internet.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             

      The form is amended to require that the title of the case include
    all names used by the debtor within the last eight years in
    conformity with Sec. 727(a)(8) as amended by the Bankruptcy Abuse
    Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-8,
    119 Stat. 23 (April 20, 2005), extending from six years to eight
    years the period during which a debtor is barred from receiving
    successive discharges.

    previously published in 2005.]
      The form is amended to require that the title of the case include

                NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1991            

      This form of caption is prescribed for general use in filing
    papers in a case under the Bankruptcy Code. Rule 9004(b) requires a
    caption to set forth the title of the case, and Rule 1005 specifies
    that the title must include all names used by the debtor within six
    years before the commencement of the case and the debtor's social
    security and tax identification numbers. This information is
    necessary in the petition, the notice of the meeting of creditors,
    the order of discharge, and the documents relating to the plan in a
    chapter 11 case. See Rule 2002(m) and Official Form 16A. In other
    notices, motions, applications, and papers filed in a case,
    however, a short title containing simply the names of the debtor or
    joint debtors may be used. Additional names, such as any under
    which the debtor has engaged in business, may be included in the
    short title as needed.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1995 AMENDMENT       

      The title of this form is amended to specify that it can be used
    when section 342(c) of the Code, as added by the Bankruptcy Reform
    Act of 1994, is not applicable.

      This form previously was numbered Official Form No. 34. A
    notation of the chapter of the Bankruptcy Code under which the case
    is proceeding has been added to the form. Rule 7010 refers to this

    proceeding.

      The form is amended to conform to the amendments made to section

                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2003 AMENDMENT             

      The form is abrogated. An amendment to Official Form 16A directs
    that only the last four digits of the debtor's social security
    number should appear in a caption. Section 342(c) of the Bankruptcy
    Code continues to require the debtor to provide a creditor with the
    debtor's name, address, and taxpayer identification number on any
    notice the debtor is required to give to the creditor. An
    individual debtor can fulfill this requirement by including the
    debtor's social security account number on only the creditor's copy
    of any notice or summons the debtor may serve on the creditor.

    As a complaint initiating an adversary proceeding serves as a
    notice to the defendant of the filing of an action, a debtor filing
    an adversary proceeding must follow the notice requirements of Sec.
    342(c) of the Code. To protect individual privacy a debtor should
    use the defendant's copy of the summons to be served with the
    complaint to provide the information required by Sec. 342(c) to any
    creditor named as a defendant.

    other than in an adversary proceeding.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1995 AMENDMENT       

      The form is amended to reflect the amendments to 28 U.S.C. Sec.
    158 concerning bankruptcy appellate panels made by the Bankruptcy
    Reform Act of 1994. Section 158(d) requires an appellant who elects
    to appeal to a district court rather than a bankruptcy appellate
    panel to do so "at the time of filing the appeal."
      The 1994 Act also amended 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(a) to permit
    immediate appeal of interlocutory orders increasing or reducing a
    chapter 11 debtor's exclusive period to file a plan under section
    1121 of the Code. The form is amended to provide appropriate
    flexibility.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       

      The form has been amended to conform to Rule 8001(a), which
    requires the notice to contain the names of all parties to the
    judgment, order, or decree appealed from and the names, addresses,
    and telephone numbers of their respective attorneys. A party filing
    a notice of appeal pro se should provide equivalent information.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2002 AMENDMENT

    characteristics, as specified in Sec. 304(g) of the Bankruptcy

      This form previously was numbered Official Form No. 27. The form
    has been revised to accommodate cases commenced by the filing of
    either a voluntary or an involuntary petition.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1995 AMENDMENT       

      The form is amended to include debts described in section
    523(a)(15) of the Code, which was added by the Bankruptcy Reform
    Act of 1994, in the list of debts discharged unless determined by
    the court to be nondischargeable.
           NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES - 1997 AMENDMENT       

      The discharge order has been simplified by deleting paragraphs
    which had detailed some, but not all, of the effects of the
    discharge. These paragraphs have been replaced with a plain English
    explanation of the discharge. This explanation is to be printed on
    the reverse of the order, to increase understanding of the
    bankruptcy discharge among creditors and debtors. The bracketed
    sentence in the second paragraph should be included when the case
    involves community property.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005 AMENDMENT             

      The form is amended to require that the title of the case include
    all names used by the debtor within the eight years prior to the
    filing of the petition in the case in conformity with Sec.

    Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No.

    preparer's signed declaration (also required by Sec. 110 of the
    Code) that the notice was given to the debtor.
      The notice states, in language mandated in the 2005 Act, that the
    bankruptcy petition preparer is not an attorney and must not give
    legal advice. The notice also includes examples of advice a
    bankruptcy petition preparer may not give that are taken from Sec.
    110(e)(2) of the Code.
      Although space is provided in the declaration to list multiple
    documents prepared for a single filing, a new form 19 must be
    completed and accompany subsequent filings. For example, one form
    19 listing all forms prepared by the bankruptcy petition preparer
    would be filed with the debtor's petition package. Another form 19
    would be required if the debtor files amended schedules later in
    the case that were prepared by the bankruptcy petition preparer.
      The form must be signed by the debtor and the bankruptcy petition
    preparer where indicated, and must be filed with each document for
    filing prepared by the bankruptcy petition preparer.

    "bankruptcy petition preparer," as defined in 11 U.S.C. Sec. 110,
    to sign any "document for filing" that the bankruptcy petition
    preparer prepares for compensation on behalf of a debtor, to
    disclose on the document certain information, and to provide the
    debtor with a copy of the document. This form or adaptations of
    this form have been incorporated into the official forms of the
    voluntary petition, the schedules, the statement of financial
    affairs, and other official forms that typically would be prepared

      The form implements Rule 1007(f), which requires a debtor to
    submit a statement under penalty of perjury setting out the
    debtor's Social Security number. The form is necessary because Rule
    1005 provides that the caption of the petition includes only the
    final four digits of the debtor's Social Security number. The
    statement provides the information necessary for the clerk to
    include the debtor's full Social Security number on the notice of
    the meeting of creditors, as required under Rule 2002(a)(1).
    Creditors in a case, along with the trustee and United States
    trustee or bankruptcy administrator, will receive the full Social
    Security number on their copy of the notice of the meeting of
    creditors. The copy of that notice which goes into the court file
    will show only the last four digits of the number.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2007 AMENDMENT             

      The form is amended to direct an individual debtor who does not
    have a social-security number but has another government-issued
    individual taxpayer-identification number to furnish that number to
    the court. In light of the new Rule 9037 which limits public
    disclosure to all but the last four digits of any individual
    taxpayer-identification number, the amendment to this form will
    ensure that the court and creditors can properly identify a debtor
    who does not have a social-security number.

                      COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005                  

    A. Overview
      Among the changes introduced by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention
    and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 [Pub. L. 109-8, Apr. 20, 2005,
    119 Stat. 23] are interlocking provisions defining "current monthly
    income" and establishing a means test to determine whether relief
    under Chapter 7 should be presumed abusive. Current monthly income
    ("CMI") is defined in Sec. 101(10A) of the Code, and the means test
    is set out in Sec. 707(b)(2). These provisions have a variety of
    applications. In Chapter 7, if the debtor's CMI exceeds a defined
    level the debtor is subject to the means test, and Sec.
    707(b)(2)(C) specifically requires debtors to file a statement of
    CMI and calculations to determine the applicability of the means
    test presumption. In Chapters 11 and 13, CMI provides the starting
    point for determining the disposable income that must be
    contributed to payment of unsecured creditors. Moreover, Chapter 13
    debtors with CMI above defined levels are required by Sec.
    1325(b)(3) to complete the means test in order to determine the
    amount of their monthly disposable income, and pursuant to Sec.
    1325(b)(4), the level of CMI determines the "applicable commitment
    period" over which projected disposable income must be paid to
    unsecured creditors.
      To provide for the reporting and calculation of CMI and for the
    completion of the means test where required, three separate
    official forms have been created - one for Chapter 7, one for
    Chapter 11, and one for Chapter 13. This note first describes the
    calculation of CMI that is common to all three of the forms, next
    describes the means test as set out in the Chapter 7 and 13 forms,
    and finally addresses particular issues that are unique to each of
    the separate forms.

    B. Calculation of CMI
      Although Chapters 7, 11, and 13 use CMI for different purposes,
    the basic computation is the same in each. As defined in Sec.
    101(10A), CMI is the monthly average of certain income that the
    debtor (and in a joint case, the debtor's spouse) received in the
    six calendar months before the bankruptcy filing. The definition
    includes in this average (1) income from all sources, whether or
    not taxable, and (2) any amount paid by an entity other than the
    debtor (or the debtor's spouse in a joint case) on a regular basis
    for the household expenses of the debtor, the debtor's dependents,
    and (in a joint case) the debtor's spouse if not otherwise a
    dependent. At the same time, the definition excludes from the
    averaged income "benefits received under the Social Security Act"
    and certain payments to victims of terrorism, war crimes, and
    crimes against humanity.

    Each of the forms provides for reporting income items constituting
    CMI. The items are reported in a set of entry lines - Part II of
    the Chapter 7 form and Part I of the forms for Chapter 11 and
    Chapter 13 - that include separate columns for reporting income of
    the debtor and of the debtor's spouse. The first of these entry
    lines includes a set of instructions and check boxes indicating
    when the "debtor's spouse" column must be completed. The
    instructions also direct the required averaging of reported income.
      The subsequent entry lines specify several common types of income
    and are followed by a "catch-all" line for other income. The
    specific entry lines address (a) gross wages; (b) business income;
    (c) rental income; (d) interest, dividends, and royalties; (e)
    pension and retirement income; (f) regular contributions to the
    debtor's household expenses; and (g) unemployment compensation.
    Gross wages (before taxes) are required to be entered. Consistent
    with usage in the Internal Revenue Manual and the American
    Community Survey of the Census Bureau, business and rental income
    is defined as gross receipts less ordinary and necessary expenses.
    Unemployment compensation is given special treatment. Because the
    federal government provides funding for state unemployment
    compensation under the Social Security Act, there may be a dispute
    about whether unemployment compensation is a "benefit received
    under the Social Security Act." The forms take no position on the
    merits of this argument, but give debtors the option of reporting
    unemployment compensation separately from the CMI calculation. This
    separate reporting allows parties in interest to determine the
    materiality of an exclusion of unemployment compensation and to
    challenge it. The forms provide for totaling the income lines.

    C. The means test: deductions from current monthly income (CMI)
      The means test operates by deducting from CMI defined allowances
    for living expenses and payment of secured and priority debt,
    leaving disposable income presumptively available to pay unsecured
    non-priority debt. These deductions from CMI under are set out in
    the Code at Sec. 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)-(iv). The forms for Chapter 7 and
    Chapter 13 have identical sections (Parts V and III, respectively)
    for calculating these deductions. The calculations are divided into
    subparts reflecting three different kinds of allowed deductions.
      1. Deductions under IRS standards
      Subpart A deals with deductions from CMI, set out in Sec.
    707(b)(2)(A)(ii), for "the debtor's applicable monthly expense
    amounts specified under the National Standards and Local Standards,
    and the debtor's actual monthly expenses for the categories
    specified as Other Necessary Expenses issued by the Internal
    Revenue Service for the area in which the debtor resides." The
    forms provide entry lines for each of the specified expense
    deductions under the IRS standards, and instructions on the entry
    lines identify the website of the U.S. Trustee Program, where the
    relevant IRS allowances can be found. As with all of the deductions
    in Sec. 707(b)(2)(A)(ii), deductions under the IRS standards are
    subject to the proviso that they not include "any payments for
    debts."
      The IRS National Standards provide a single allowance for food,
    clothing, household supplies, personal care, and miscellany,
    depending on income and household size. The forms contain an entry
    line for the applicable allowance.
      The IRS Local Standards provide one set of deductions for housing
    and utilities and another set for transportation expenses, with
    different amounts for different areas of the country, depending on
    the size of the debtor's family and the number of the debtor's
    vehicles. Each of the amounts specified in the Local Standards are
    treated by the IRS as a cap on actual expenses, but because Sec.
    707(b)(2)(A)(ii) provides for deductions in the "amounts specified
    under the . . . Local Standards," the forms treat these amounts as
    allowed deductions. The forms again direct debtors to the website
    of the U.S. Trustee Program to obtain the appropriate allowances.
      The Local Standards for housing and utilities, as published by
    the IRS for its internal purposes, present single amounts covering
    all housing expenses; however, for bankruptcy purposes, the IRS has
    separated these amounts into a non-mortgage component and a
    mortgage/rent component. The non-mortgage component covers a
    variety of expenses involved in maintaining a residence, such as
    utilities, repairs and maintenance. The mortgage/rent component
    covers the cost of acquiring the residence. For homeowners with
    mortgages, the mortgage/rent component involves debt payment, since
    the cost of a mortgage is part of the allowance. Accordingly, the
    forms require debtors to deduct from the mortgage/rent component
    their average monthly mortgage payment (including required payments
    for taxes and insurance), up to the full amount of the IRS
    mortgage/rent component, and instruct debtors that this average
    monthly payment is the one reported on the separate line of the
    forms for deductions of secured debt under Sec. 707(b)(2)(a)(iii).
    The forms allow debtors to challenge the appropriateness of this
    method of computing the Local Standards allowance for housing and
    utilities and to claim any additional housing allowance to which
    they contend they are entitled, but the forms require specification
    of the basis for such a contention.
      The IRS issues Local Standards for transportation in two
    components for its internal purposes as well as for bankruptcy: one
    component covers vehicle operation/public transportation expense
    and the other ownership/lease expense. The amount of the vehicle
    operation/public transportation allowance depends on the number of
    vehicles the debtor operates, with debtors who do not operate
    vehicles being given a public transportation allowance. The
    instruction for this line item makes it clear that every debtor is
    thus entitled to some transportation expense allowance. No debt
    payment is involved in this allowance. The ownership/lease
    component, on the other hand, may involve debt payment.
    Accordingly, the forms require debtors to reduce the allowance for
    ownership/lease expense by the average monthly loan payment amount
    (principal and interest), up to the full amount of the IRS
    ownership/lease expense amount. This average payment is as reported
    on the separate line of the forms for deductions of secured debt
    under Sec. 707(b)(2)(a)(iii).
      The IRS does not set out specific dollar allowances for "Other
    Necessary Expenses." Rather, it specifies a number of categories
    for such expenses, and describes the nature of the expenses that
    may be deducted in each of these categories. Section
    707(b)(2)(a)(ii) allows a deduction for the debtor's actual
    expenses in these specified categories, subject to its requirement
    that payment of debt not be included. Several of the IRS categories
    deal with debt repayment and so are not included in the forms.
    Several other categories deal with expense items that are more
    expansively addressed by specific statutory allowances. Subpart A
    sets out the remaining categories of "Other Necessary Expenses" in
    individual entry lines. Instructions in these entry lines reflect
    limitations imposed by the IRS and the need to avoid inclusion of
    items deducted elsewhere on the forms.
      Subpart A concludes with a subtotal of the deductions allowed
    under the IRS standards.
      2. Additional statutory expense deductions
      In addition to the expense deductions allowed under the IRS
    standards, the means test makes provision - in subclauses (I),
    (II), (IV), and (V) of Sec. 707(b)(2)(A)(ii) - for six special
    expense deductions. Each of these additional expense items is set
    out on a separate entry line in Subpart B, introduced by an
    instruction that there should not be double counting of any expense
    already included in the IRS deductions. Contributions to tax-exempt
    charities provide another statutory expense deduction. Section
    1325(b)(2)(A)(ii) expressly allows a deduction from CMI for such
    contributions (up to 15% of the debtor's gross income), and Sec.
    707(b)(1) provides that in considering whether a Chapter 7 filing
    is an abuse, the court may not take into consideration "whether a
    debtor . . . continues to make [tax-exempt] charitable
    contributions." Accordingly, Subpart B also includes an entry line
    for charitable contributions. The subpart concludes with a subtotal
    of the additional statutory expense deductions.
      3. Deductions for payment of debt
      Subpart C of the forms deals with the means test's deductions
    from CMI for payment of secured and priority debt, as well as a
    deduction for administrative fees that would be incurred if the
    debtor paid debts through a Chapter 13 plan. In accord with Sec.
    707(b)(2)(A)(iii), the deduction for secured debt is divided into
    two entry lines - one for payments that are contractually due
    during the 60 months following the bankruptcy filing, the other for
    amounts needed to retain necessary collateral securing debts in
    default. In each situation, the instructions for the entry lines
    require dividing the total payment amount by 60, as the statute
    directs. Priority debt, deductible pursuant to Sec.
    707(b)(2)(A)(iv), is treated on a single entry line, also requiring
    division by 60. The defined deduction for the expenses of
    administering a Chapter 13 plan is allowed by Sec.
    707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(III) only for debtors eligible for Chapter 13. The
    forms treat this deduction in an entry line requiring the eligible
    debtor to state the amount of the prospective Chapter 13 plan
    payment and multiply that payment amount by the percentage fee
    established for the debtor's district by the Executive Office for
    United States Trustees. The forms refer debtors to the website of
    the U.S. Trustee Program to obtain this percentage fee. The subpart
    concludes with a subtotal of debt payment deductions.
      4. Total deductions
      Finally, the forms direct that the subtotals from Subparts A, B,
    and C be added together to arrive at the total of allowed
    deductions from CMI under the means test.
      5. Additional claimed deductions
      The forms do not provide for means test deductions from CMI for
    expenses in categories that are not specifically identified as
    "Other Necessary Expenses" in the Internal Revenue Manual. However,
    debtors may wish to claim expenses that do not fall within the
    categories listed as "Other Necessary Expenses" in the forms. Part
    VII of the Chapter 7 form and Part VI of the Chapter 13 form
    provide for such expenses to be identified and totaled. Although
    expenses listed in these sections are not deducted from CMI for
    purposes of the means test calculation, the listing provides a
    basis for debtors to assert that these expenses should be deducted
    from CMI under Sec. 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I), and that the results of
    the forms' calculation, therefore, should be modified.

    D. The chapter-specific forms
      1. Chapter 7
      The Chapter 7 form has several unique aspects. The form includes,
    in the upper right corner of the first page, a check box directing
    the debtor to state whether or not the calculations required by the
    form result in a presumption of abuse. The debtor is not bound by
    this statement and may argue, in response to a motion brought under
    Sec. 707(b)(1), that there should be no presumption despite the
    calculations required by the form. The check box is intended to
    give clerks of court a conspicuous indication of the cases for
    which they are required to provide notice of a presumption of abuse
    pursuant to Sec. 342(d).
      Part I of the form implements the provision of Sec. 707(b)(2)(D)
    that excludes certain disabled veterans from all means testing,
    making it unnecessary to compute the CMI of such veterans. Debtors
    who declare under penalty of perjury that they are disabled
    veterans within the statutory definition are directed to verify
    their declaration in Part VII, to check the "no presumption" box at
    the beginning of the form, and to disregard the remaining parts of
    the form.
      Part II of the form is the computation of CMI. Section 707(b)(7)
    eliminates standing to assert the means test's presumption of abuse
    if the debtor's annualized CMI does not exceed a defined median
    state income. For this purpose, the statute directs that CMI of the
    debtor's spouse be combined with the debtor's CMI even if the
    debtor's spouse is not a joint debtor, unless the debtor declares
    under penalty of perjury that the spouses are legally separated or
    living separately other than for purposes of evading the means
    test. Accordingly, the calculation of CMI in Part II directs a
    computation of the CMI of the debtor's spouse not only in joint
    cases, but also in cases of married debtors who do not make the
    specified declaration, and the CMI of both spouses in these cases
    is combined for purposes of determining standing under Sec.
    707(b)(7).
      Part III of the form provides for the comparison of the debtor's
    CMI to the applicable state median income for purposes of Sec.
    707(b)(7). It then directs debtors whose income does not exceed the
    applicable median to verify the form, to check the "no presumption"
    box at the beginning of the form, and not to complete the remaining
    parts of the form. Debtors whose CMI does exceed the applicable
    state median are required to complete the remaining parts of the
    form.
      Part IV of the form provides for an adjustment to the CMI of a
    married debtor, not filing jointly, whose spouse's CMI was combined
    with the debtor's for purposes of determining standing to assert
    the means test presumption. The means test itself does not charge a
    married debtor in a non-joint case with the income of the non-
    filing spouse, but rather only with contributions made by that
    spouse to the household expenses of the debtor or the debtor's
    dependents, as provided in the definition of CMI in Sec. 101(10A).
    Accordingly, Part IV calls for the combined CMI of Part II to be
    reduced by the amount of the non-filing spouse's income that was
    not contributed to the household expenses of the debtor or the
    debtor's dependents.
      Part V of the form provides for a calculation of the means test's
    deductions from the debtor's CMI, as described above.
      Part VI provides for a determination of whether the debtor's CMI,
    less the allowed deductions, gives rise to a presumption of abuse
    under Sec. 707(b)(2)(A). Depending on the outcome of this
    determination, the debtor is directed to check the appropriate box
    at the beginning of the form and to sign the verification in Part
    VIII. Part VII allows the debtor to claim additional deductions, as
    discussed above.
      2. Chapter 11
      The Chapter 11 form is the simplest of the three, since the means-
    test deductions of Sec. 707(b)(2) are not employed in determining
    the extent of an individual Chapter 11 debtor's disposable income.
    Section 1129(a)(15) requires payments of disposable income "as
    defined in section 1325(b)(2)," and that paragraph allows
    calculation of disposable income under judicially-determined
    standards, rather than pursuant to the means test deductions,
    specified for higher income Chapter 13 debtors by Sec. 1325(b)(3).
    However, Sec. 1325(b)(2) does require that CMI be used as the
    starting point in the judicial determination of disposable income,
    and so the Chapter 11 form requires this calculation (in Part I of
    the form), as described above, together with a verification (in
    Part II).
      3. Chapter 13
      Like the Chapter 7 form, the form for Chapter 13 debtors contains
    a number of special provisions. The upper right corner of the first
    page includes check boxes requiring the debtor to state whether,
    under the calculations required by the statement, the applicable
    commitment period under Sec. 1325(b)(4) is three years or five
    years and whether the means test deductions are required by Sec.
    1325(b)(3) to be used in determining the debtor's disposable
    income. The check box is intended to inform standing trustees and
    other interested parties about these items, but does not prevent
    the debtor from arguing that the calculations required by the form
    do not accurately reflect the debtor's disposable income.
      Part I of the form is a report of income to be used for
    determining CMI. Section 1325(b)(4) imposes a five-year applicable
    commitment period - rather than a three-year period - if the
    debtor's annualized CMI is not less than a defined median state
    income. For this purpose, as under Sec. 707(b)(4), the CMI of the
    debtor's spouse is required by the statute to be combined with the
    debtor's CMI, and there is no exception for spouses who are legally
    separated or living separately. Accordingly, the report of income
    in Part I directs a combined reporting of the income of both
    spouses in all cases of married debtors.
      Part II of the form computes the applicable commitment period by
    annualizing the income calculated in Part I and comparing it to the
    applicable state median. The form allows debtors to contend that
    the income of a non-filing spouse should not be treated as CMI and
    permits debtors to claim a deduction for any income of a non-filing
    spouse to the extent that this income was not contributed to the
    household expenses of the debtor or the debtor's dependents. The
    debtor is directed to check the appropriate box at the beginning of
    the form, stating the applicable commitment period.
      Part III of the form compares the debtor's CMI to the applicable
    state median, allowing a determination of whether the means-test
    deductions must be used, pursuant to Sec. 1325(b)(3), in
    calculating disposable income. For this purpose, since Sec.
    1325(b)(3) does not provide for including the income of the
    debtor's spouse, the form directs a deduction of the income of a
    non-filing spouse that is not contributed to the household expenses
    of the debtor or the debtor's dependents. Again, the debtor is
    directed to check the appropriate box at the beginning of the form,
    indicating whether the means test deductions are applicable. If so,
    the debtor is directed to complete the remainder of the form. If
    not, the debtor is directed to complete the verification in Part
    VII but not complete the other parts of the form.
      Part IV provides for calculation of the means-test deductions
    provided in Sec. 707(b)(2), described above, as incorporated by
    Sec. 1325(b)(3) for debtors with CMI above the applicable state
    median.
      Part V provides for three adjustments required by special
    provisions affecting disposable income in Chapter 13. First, Sec.
    1325(b)(2) itself excludes from the CMI used in determining
    disposable income certain "child support payments, foster care
    payments, [and] disability payments for a dependent child." Because
    payments of this kind are included in the definition of CMI in Sec.
    101(10A), a line entry for deduction of these payments is provided.
    Second, a line entry is provided for deduction of contributions by
    the debtor to certain retirement plans, listed in Sec.
    541(b)(7)(B), since that provision states that such contributions
    "shall not constitute disposable income, as defined in section
    1325(b)." Third, the same line entry also allows a deduction from
    disposable income for payments on loans from retirement accounts
    that are excepted from the automatic stay by Sec. 362(b)(19), since
    Sec. 1322(f) provides that for a "loan described in section
    362(b)(19) . . . any amounts required to repay such loan shall not
    constitute 'disposable income' under section 1325."
      The Chapter 13 form does not provide a deduction from disposable
    income for the Chapter 13 debtor's anticipated attorney fees. There
    is no specific statutory allowance for such a deduction, and none
    appears necessary. Section 1325(b)(1)(B) requires that disposable
    income contributed to a Chapter 13 plan be used to pay "unsecured
    creditors." A debtor's attorney who has not taken a security
    interest in the debtor's property is an unsecured creditor who may
    be paid from disposable income.
      Part VI of the form allows the debtor to claim additional
    deductions, as described above, and Part VII is the verification.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2006 AMENDMENT             

      Forms [sic] 22A, Line 43, and Form 22C, Line 48, are amended to
    delete the phrase "in default" with respect to "Other payments on
    secured claims." A debtor may be required to make other payments to
    the creditor even when the debt is not in default, such as to
    retain collateral. Form 22C, Line 17, also is amended to require
    all chapter 13 debtors, including those whose income falls below
    the applicable median income, to determine their disposable income
    under Sec. 1325(b)(3) of the Code by completing Part III of the
    form. Both forms contain stylistic amendments to conform the
    wording more closely to that used in the 2005 Act [Bankruptcy Abuse
    Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. 109-8, Apr.
    20, 2005, 119 Stat. 23].
              COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2005-2008 AMENDMENT          

      [The 2005-2007 [sic] Committee Note incorporates Committee Notes
    previously published in 2005 and 2006.]
    A. Overview
      Among the changes introduced by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention
    and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 was a set of interlocking
    provisions defining "current monthly income" and establishing a
    means test to determine whether relief under Chapter 7 should be
    presumed abusive. Current monthly income ("CMI") is defined in Sec.
    101(10A) of the Code, and the means test is set out in Sec.
    707(b)(2). These provisions have a variety of applications. In
    Chapter 7, if the debtor's CMI exceeds a defined level the debtor
    is subject to the means test, and Sec. 707(b)(2)(C) specifically
    requires debtors to file a statement of CMI and calculations to
    determine the applicability of the means test presumption. In
    Chapters 11 and 13, CMI provides the starting point for determining
    the disposable income that debtors may be required to pay to
    unsecured creditors. Moreover, Chapter 13 debtors with CMI above
    defined median income levels are required by Sec. 1325(b)(3) to use
    the deductions from income prescribed by the means test in order to
    determine what part of their income is "disposable," and pursuant
    to Sec. 1325(b)(4), the level of CMI determines the "applicable
    commitment period" over which projected disposable income must be
    paid to unsecured creditors.
      To provide for the reporting and calculation of CMI and for the
    completion of the means test where required, three separate
    official forms have been created - one for Chapter 7, one for
    Chapter 11, and one for Chapter 13. This note first describes the
    calculation of CMI that is common to all three of the forms, next
    describes the means test deductions set out in the Chapter 7 and 13
    forms, and finally addresses particular issues that are unique to
    each of the separate forms.

    B. Calculation of CMI
      Although Chapters 7, 11, and 13 use CMI for different purposes,
    the basic computation is the same in each. As defined in Sec.
    101(10A), CMI is the monthly average of certain income that the
    debtor (and in a joint case, the debtor's spouse) received in the
    six calendar months before the bankruptcy filing. The definition
    includes in this average (1) income from all sources, whether or
    not taxable, and (2) any amount paid by an entity other than the
    debtor (or the debtor's spouse in a joint case) on a regular basis
    for the household expenses of the debtor, the debtor's dependents,
    and (in a joint case) the debtor's spouse if not otherwise a
    dependent. At the same time, the definition excludes from the
    averaged income "benefits received under the Social Security Act"
    and certain payments to victims of terrorism, war crimes, and
    crimes against humanity.
      Each of the three forms provides for reporting income items
    constituting CMI. The items are reported in a set of entry lines -
    Part II of the form for Chapter 7 and Part I of the forms for
    Chapter 11 and Chapter 13 - that include separate columns for
    reporting income of the debtor and of the debtor's spouse. The
    first of these entry lines includes a set of instructions and check
    boxes indicating when the "debtor's spouse" column must be
    completed. The instructions also direct the required averaging of
    reported income.
      The subsequent entry lines for income reporting specify several
    common types of income and are followed by a "catch-all" line for
    other income. The entry lines address (a) gross wages; (b) business
    income; (c) rental income; (d) interest, dividends, and royalties;
    (e) pension and retirement income; (f) regular payments of the
    household expenses of the debtor or the debtor's dependents; (g)
    unemployment compensation, and (h) all other forms of income (the
    "catch-all" line).
      Gross wages (before taxes) are required to be entered. However,
    consistent with usage in the Internal Revenue Manual and the
    American Community Survey of the Census Bureau, business and rental
    income are defined as gross receipts less ordinary and necessary
    expenses.
      Unemployment compensation is given special treatment. Because the
    federal government provides funding for state unemployment
    compensation under the Social Security Act, there may be a dispute
    about whether unemployment compensation is a "benefit received
    under the Social Security Act." The forms take no position on the
    merits of this argument, but give debtors the option of reporting
    unemployment compensation separately from the CMI calculation. This
    separate reporting allows parties in interest to determine the
    materiality of an exclusion of unemployment compensation and to
    challenge it.
      Alimony and child support are also given special treatment. Child
    support is not generally considered "income" to the recipient. See
    26 U.S.C. Sec. 71(c). Thus, child support is only part of CMI if it
    is paid on a regular basis for the household expenses of the debtor
    or the debtor's dependents. On the other hand, alimony and other
    forms of spousal support are considered income to the recipient,
    and thus are within CMI regardless of the regularity and use of the
    payments. To address this distinction, the instruction in the entry
    line for regular payments of household expenses directs that the
    entry include regular child support payments used for household
    expenses of the debtor or the debtor's dependents, and the
    instruction for the "catch-all" line directs inclusion of all
    spousal support payments that are not otherwise reported as spousal
    income.
      The forms provide for totaling the income reporting lines.

    C. The means test: deductions from current monthly income
      The means test operates by deducting from CMI defined allowances
    for living expenses and payment of secured and priority debt,
    leaving disposable income presumptively available to pay unsecured
    non-priority debt. These deductions from CMI are set out in the
    Code at Sec. 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)-(iv). The forms for Chapter 7 and
    Chapter 13 have similar sections (Parts V and IV, respectively) for
    calculating these deductions. The calculations are divided into
    subparts reflecting three different kinds of allowed deductions.
      1. Deductions under IRS standards
      Subpart A deals with deductions from CMI, set out in Sec.
    707(b)(2)(A)(ii), for "the debtor's applicable monthly expense
    amounts specified under the National Standards and Local Standards,
    and the debtor's actual monthly expenses for the categories
    specified as Other Necessary Expenses issued by the Internal
    Revenue Service for the area in which the debtor resides." The
    forms provide entry lines for each of the specified expense
    deductions under the IRS standards, and instructions on the entry
    lines identify the website of the U.S. Trustee Program, where the
    relevant IRS allowances can be found. As with all of the deductions
    in Sec. 707(b)(2)(A)(ii), deductions under the IRS standards are
    subject to the proviso that they not include "any payments for
    debts."
      National Standards. The IRS National Standards provide a single
    allowance for food, clothing, household supplies, personal care,
    and miscellany, depending on household size, which can be entered
    directly from a table supplied by the IRS. There is also a National
    Standard for out-of-pocket health care expenses, which provides two
    different per-person allowances, depending on age group: the
    allowance for persons 65 or older is greater than the allowance for
    those under 65. Accordingly, the forms direct debtors to compute
    the National Standard allowance for health care by first
    multiplying each of the two age-group allowances by the number of
    household members within that age group and then adding subtotals
    for the two age groups to obtain the total allowance.
      Local Standards. The IRS Local Standards provide one set of
    deductions for housing and utilities and another set for
    transportation expenses, with different amounts for different areas
    of the country, depending on the size of the debtor's household and
    the number of the debtor's vehicles. Each of the amounts specified
    in the Local Standards are treated by the IRS as a cap on actual
    expenses, but because Sec. 707(b)(2)(A)(ii) provides for deductions
    in the "amounts specified under the . . . Local Standards," the
    forms treat these amounts as allowed deductions.
      The Local Standards for housing and utilities, as published by
    the IRS for its internal purposes, present single amounts covering
    all housing expenses; however, for bankruptcy purposes, the IRS has
    provided the Executive Office for United States Trustees with
    information allowing a division of these amounts into a non-
    mortgage component and a mortgage/rent component. The non-mortgage
    component covers a variety of expenses involved in maintaining a
    residence, such as utilities, repairs and maintenance. The
    mortgage/rent component covers the cost of acquiring the residence.
    The forms take no position on the question of whether the debtor
    must actually be making payments on a home in order to claim a
    mortgage/rent allowance. For homeowners with mortgages, the
    mortgage/rent allowance involves debt payment, since the cost of a
    mortgage is the basis for the allowance. Accordingly, the forms
    require debtors to deduct from the mortgage/rent allowance their
    average monthly mortgage payment, up to the full amount of the IRS
    mortgage/rent allowance, and instruct debtors that this average
    monthly payment is the one reported on the separate line of the
    forms for deductions of secured debt under Sec. 707(b)(2)(a)(iii).
    The forms allow debtors to challenge the appropriateness of this
    method of computing the Local Standards allowance for housing and
    utilities and to claim any additional housing allowance to which
    they contend they are entitled, but the forms require specification
    of the basis for such a contention.
      The IRS issues Local Standards for transportation in two
    components for its internal purposes as well as for bankruptcy: one
    component covers vehicle operation/public transportation expense
    and the other ownership/lease expense. The amount of the vehicle
    operation/public transportation allowance depends on the number of
    vehicles the debtor operates; debtors who do not operate vehicles
    are given a public transportation allowance, regardless of whether
    they actually use public transportation. It is not clear whether
    the public transportation allowance may also be claimed by debtors
    who do make use of public transportation but also operate vehicles.
    The forms permit debtors to claim both a public transportation and
    vehicle operating allowance, but take no position as to whether it
    is appropriate to claim both allowances. No debt payment is
    involved in the vehicle operation/public transportation component
    of the Local Standards for transportation.
      The ownership/lease component, on the other hand, may involve
    debt payment. Accordingly, the forms require debtors to reduce the
    allowance for ownership/lease expense by the average monthly loan
    payment amount (principal and interest), up to the full amount of
    the IRS ownership/lease expense amount. This average payment is as
    reported on the separate line of the forms for deductions of
    secured debt under Sec. 707(b)(2)(a)(iii). The forms take no
    position on the question of whether the debtor must actually be
    making payments on a vehicle in order to claim the ownership/lease
    allowance.
      Other Necessary Expenses. The IRS does not set out specific
    dollar allowances for "Other Necessary Expenses." Rather, it
    specifies a number of categories for such expenses, and describes
    the nature of the expenses that may be deducted in each of these
    categories. Section 707(b)(2)(a)(ii) allows a deduction for the
    debtor's actual expenses in these specified categories, subject to
    its requirement that payment of debt not be included. Several of
    the IRS categories deal with debt repayment and so are not included
    in the forms. Several other categories deal with expense items that
    are more expansively addressed by specific statutory allowances.
    Subpart A sets out the remaining categories of "Other Necessary
    Expenses" in individual entry lines. Instructions in these entry
    lines reflect limitations imposed by the IRS and the need to avoid
    inclusion of items deducted elsewhere on the forms.
      Subpart A concludes with a subtotal of the deductions allowed
    under the IRS standards.
      2. Additional statutory expense deductions
      In addition to the expense deductions allowed under the IRS
    standards, the means test makes provision - in subclauses (I),
    (II), (IV), and (V) of Sec. 707(b)(2)(A)(ii) - for six special
    expense deductions. Each of these additional expense items is set
    out on a separate entry line in Subpart B, introduced by an
    instruction that tracks the statutory language and provides that
    there should not be double counting of any expense already included
    in the IRS deductions.
      One of these special expense deductions presents a problem of
    statutory construction. Section 707(b)(2)A)(ii)(I) [sic], after
    directing the calculation of the debtor's monthly expenses under
    the IRS standards, states, "Such expenses shall include reasonably
    necessary health insurance, disability insurance, and health saving
    account expenses . . . ." There is no express statutory limitation
    to expenses actually incurred by the debtor, and so the provision
    appears to allow a reasonable "monthly expense" deduction for
    health and disability insurance or a health savings account even if
    the debtor does not make such payments, similar to the way in which
    the National Standards give an allowance for food, clothing and
    personal care expenses without regard to the debtor's actual
    expenditures. However, the statutory language might also be read as
    providing that the debtor's "Other Necessary Expenses" should
    include reasonable insurance and health savings account payments.
    Since "Other Necessary Expenses" are limited to actual
    expenditures, such a limitation could be implied here. The forms
    deal with this ambiguity by allowing the debtor to claim a
    deduction for reasonable insurance and health savings account
    expenses even if not made, but also require a statement of the
    amount actually expended in these categories, thus allowing a
    challenge by any party who believes that only actual expenditures
    are properly deductible.
      Contributions to tax-exempt charities provide another statutory
    expense deduction. Section 707(b)(1) provides that in considering
    whether a Chapter 7 filing is an abuse, the court may not take into
    consideration "whether a debtor . . . continues to make [tax-
    exempt] charitable contributions." Section 1325(b)(2)(A)(ii)
    expressly allows a deduction from CMI for such contributions that
    are "reasonably necessary" (up to 15% of the debtor's gross
    income), and the Religious Liberty and Charitable Donation
    Clarification Act of 2005 [2006] added language to Sec. 1325(b)(3)
    to provide the same deduction for above-median income debtors whose
    disposable income is determined using means test deductions.
    Accordingly, Subpart B of both the Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 forms
    includes an entry line for charitable contributions, employing the
    different statutory deductions allowed in each context.
      The Subpart B concludes with a subtotal of the additional
    statutory expense deductions.
      3. Deductions for payment of debt
      Subpart C deals with the means test's deductions from CMI for
    payment of secured and priority debt, as well as a deduction for
    administrative fees that would be incurred if the debtor paid debts
    through a Chapter 13 plan.
      In accord with Sec. 707(b)(2)(A)(iii), the deduction for secured
    debt is divided into two entry lines - one for payments that are
    contractually due during the 60 months following the bankruptcy
    filing, the other for amounts needed to retain necessary collateral
    securing debts in default. In each situation, the instructions for
    the entry lines require dividing the total payment amount by 60, as
    the statute directs. The forms recognize another ambiguity in this
    connection: "payments contractually due" might either be understood
    as limited to payments of principal and interest (payable to
    secured creditor) or, in the context of a mortgage with an escrow,
    might be understood as including payments of property taxes and
    insurance (ultimately paid to taxing bodies and insurers, but
    initially payable to the mortgagee). The forms require the debtor
    to specify whether the amount deducted includes taxes and
    insurance, allowing a party in interest to inquire into the
    deduction and raise an objection.
      Priority debt, deductible pursuant to Sec. 707(b)(2)(A)(iv), is
    treated on a single entry line, also requiring division by 60. The
    instruction for this line makes clear that only past due priority
    debt - not anticipated debts - should be included. Thus, future
    support or tax obligations, and future fees that might be payable
    to a Chapter 13 debtor's attorney, are not included.
      The defined deduction for the expenses of administering a Chapter
    13 plan is allowed by Sec. 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(III) only for debtors
    eligible for Chapter 13. The forms treat this deduction in an entry
    line requiring the eligible debtor to state the amount of the
    prospective Chapter 13 plan payment and multiply that payment
    amount by the percentage fee established for the debtor's district
    by the Executive Office for United States Trustees. The forms refer
    debtors to the website of the U.S. Trustee Program to obtain this
    percentage fee.
      The subpart concludes with a subtotal of debt payment deductions.
      4. Total deductions
      Finally, the forms direct that the subtotals from Subparts A, B,
    and C be added together to arrive at the total of allowed
    deductions from CMI under the means test.
      5. Additional claimed deductions
      The forms do not provide for means test deductions from CMI for
    expenses in categories that are not specifically identified as
    "Other Necessary Expenses" in the Internal Revenue Manual. However,
    debtors may wish to claim expenses that do not fall within the
    categories listed as "Other Necessary Expenses" in the forms. Part
    VII of the Chapter 7 form and Part VI of the Chapter 13 form
    provide for such expenses to be identified and totaled. Although
    expenses listed in these sections are not deducted from CMI for
    purposes of the means test calculation, the listing provides a
    basis for debtors to assert that these expenses should be deducted
    from CMI under Sec. 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I), and that the results of
    the forms' calculation should therefore be modified.

    D. The chapter-specific forms
      1. Chapter 7
      The Chapter 7 form has several unique aspects. The form includes,
    in the upper right corner of the first page, a check box directing
    the debtor to state whether or not the calculations required by the
    form result in a presumption of abuse. The debtor is not bound by
    this statement and may argue, in response to a motion brought under
    Sec. 707(b)(1), that there should be no presumption despite the
    calculations required by the form. The check box is intended to
    give clerks of court a conspicuous indication of the cases for
    which they are required to provide notice of a presumption of abuse
    pursuant to Sec. 342(d).
      Part I implements the provision of Sec. 707(b)(2)(D) that
    excludes certain disabled veterans from all means testing, making
    it unnecessary to compute the CMI of such veterans. Debtors who
    declare under penalty of perjury that they are disabled veterans
    within the statutory definition are directed to verify their
    declaration in Part VII, to check the "no presumption" box at the
    beginning of the form, and to disregard the remaining parts of the
    form.
      Part I also provides an exclusion for debtors who do not have
    primarily consumer debts. These debtors are not subject to any of
    the provisions of Sec. 707(b) - including the requirement of Sec.
    707(b)(2)(C) for filing a CMI statement - since Sec. 707(b)
    applies, by its terms, only to "an individual debtor . . . whose
    debts are primarily consumer debts." However, a debtor may be found
    to have asserted non-consumer status incorrectly. Unless such a
    debtor has filed the CMI form within the 45 days after filing the
    case, the case could be subject to automatic dismissal under Sec.
    521(i). To avoid this possibility, debtors asserting principally
    non-consumer status may complete the appropriate portions of Part
    I, claim an exclusion from the balance of the form, and promptly
    file the form. If it is subsequently determined that the debtor
    does have primarily consumer debts, the form will have been filed
    within the deadline established by Sec. 521(i), and can be amended
    to include the necessary CMI and means test information.
      Part II computes CMI for purposes of the safe harbor of Sec.
    707(b)(7). Section 707(b)(7) prohibits a motion to dismiss based on
    the means test's presumption of abuse if the debtor's annualized
    CMI does not exceed a defined median state income. For this
    purpose, the statute directs that CMI of the debtor's spouse be
    combined with the debtor's CMI even if the debtor's spouse is not a
    joint debtor, unless the debtor declares under penalty of perjury
    that the spouses are legally separated or living separately other
    than for purposes of evading the means test.Accordingly, the
    calculation of CMI in Part II directs a computation of the CMI of
    the debtor's spouse not only in joint cases, but also in cases of
    married debtors who do not make the specified declaration, and the
    CMI of both spouses in these cases is combined for purposes of
    determining standing under Sec. 707(b)(7).
      Part III compares the debtor's CMI to the applicable state median
    income for purposes of Sec. 707(b)(7). It then directs debtors
    whose income does not exceed the applicable median to verify the
    form, to check the "no presumption" box at the beginning of the
    form, and not to complete the remaining parts of the form. Debtors
    whose CMI does exceed the applicable state median are required to
    complete the remaining parts of the form.
      Part IV adjusts the CMI of a married debtor, not filing jointly,
    whose spouse's CMI was combined with the debtor's in Part II. The
    means test itself does not charge a married debtor in a non-joint
    case with the income of the non-filing spouse, but only with
    payments regularly made by that spouse for the household expenses
    of the debtor or the debtor's dependents, as provided in the
    definition of CMI in Sec. 101(10A). Accordingly, Part IV calls for
    the combined CMI of Part II to be reduced by the amount of the non-
    filing spouse's income that was not regularly paid for the
    household expenses of the debtor or the debtor's dependents. The
    form requires that the alternative uses of the spouse's income be
    specified.
      Part V of the form provides for a calculation of the means test's
    deductions from the debtor's CMI, as described above in Sec. C.
      Part VI provides for a determination of whether the debtor's CMI,
    less the allowed deductions, gives rise to a presumption of abuse
    under Sec. 707(b)(2)(A). Depending on the outcome of this
    determination, the debtor is directed to check the appropriate box
    at the beginning of the form and to sign the verification in Part
    VIII. Part VII allows the debtor to claim additional deductions, as
    discussed above in Sec. C.5.
      2. Chapter 11
      The Chapter 11 form is the simplest of the three, since the means-
    test deductions of Sec. 707(b)(2) are not employed in determining
    the extent of an individual Chapter 11 debtor's disposable income.
    Section 1129(a)(15) requires payments of disposable income "as
    defined in section 1325(b)(2)," and that paragraph allows
    calculation of disposable income under judicially-determined
    standards, rather than pursuant to the means test deductions,
    specified for higher income Chapter 13 debtors by Sec. 1325(b)(3).
    However, Sec. 1325(b)(2) does require that CMI be used as the
    starting point in the judicial determination of disposable income,
    and so the Chapter 11 form requires this calculation (in Part I of
    the form), as described above, together with a verification (in
    Part II).
      3. Chapter 13
      Like the Chapter 7 form, the form for Chapter 13 debtors contains
    a number of special provisions. The upper right corner of the first
    page includes check boxes requiring the debtor to state whether,
    under the calculations required by the statement, the applicable
    commitment period under Sec. 1325(b)(4) is three years or five
    years and whether Sec. 1325(b)(3) requires the means-test
    deductions to be used in determining the debtor's disposable
    income. The check box is intended to inform standing trustees and
    other interested parties about these items, but does not prevent
    the debtor from arguing that the calculations required by the form
    do not accurately reflect the debtor's disposable income.
      Part I is a report of income to be used for determining CMI. In
    the absence of full payment of allowed unsecured claims, Sec.
    1325(b)(4) imposes a five-year applicable commitment period -
    rather than a three-year period - if the debtor's annualized CMI is
    not less than a defined median state income. For this purpose, as
    under Sec. 707(b)(7), Sec. 1325(b)(4) requires that the CMI of the
    debtor's spouse be combined with the debtor's CMI, but, unlike Sec.
    707(b)(7), no exception is made for spouses who are legally
    separated or living separately. Accordingly, the report of income
    in Part I directs a combined reporting of the income of both
    spouses in all cases of married debtors.
      Part II computes the applicable commitment period by annualizing
    the income calculated in Part I and comparing it to the applicable
    state median. The form allows debtors to contend that the income of
    a non-filing spouse should not be treated as CMI and permits
    debtors to claim a deduction for any income of a non-filing spouse
    to the extent that this income was not regularly paid for the
    household expenses of the debtor or the debtor's dependents (with
    the alternative uses specified). The debtor is directed to check
    the appropriate box at the beginning of the form, stating the
    applicable commitment period. The check box does not prevent a
    debtor from proposing an applicable commitment period of less than
    three or five years in conjunction with a plan that pays all
    allowed unsecured claims in full.
      Part III compares the debtor's CMI to the applicable state
    median, allowing a determination of whether the means-test
    deductions must be used, pursuant to Sec. 1325(b)(3), in
    calculating disposable income. For this purpose, since Sec.
    1325(b)(3) does not provide for including the income of the
    debtor's spouse, the form directs a deduction of the income of a
    nonfiling spouse that was not contributed to the household expenses
    of the debtor or the debtor's dependents. Again, the debtor is
    directed to check the appropriate box at the beginning of the form,
    indicating whether the means test deductions are applicable. If so,
    the debtor is directed to complete the remainder of the form. If
    not, the debtor is directed to complete the verification in Part
    VII but not complete the other parts of the form.
      Part IV provides for calculation of the means-test deductions
    provided in Sec. 707(b)(2), described above in Sec. C, as
    incorporated by Sec. 1325(b)(3) for debtors with CMI above the
    applicable state median.
      Part V provides for four adjustments required by special
    provisions affecting disposable income in Chapter 13. First, Sec.
    1325(b)(2) itself excludes from the CMI used in determining
    disposable income certain "child support payments, foster care
    payments, [and] disability payments for a dependent child." Because
    payments of this kind are included in the definition of CMI in Sec.
    101(10A), a line entry for deduction of these payments is provided.
    Second, a line entry is provided for deduction of contributions by
    the debtor to certain retirement plans, listed in Sec.
    541(b)(7)(B), since that provision states that such contributions
    "shall not constitute disposable income, as defined in section
    1325(b)." Third, the same line entry also allows a deduction from
    disposable income for payments on loans from retirement accounts
    that are excepted from the automatic stay by Sec. 362(b)(19), since
    Sec. 1322(f) provides that for a "loan described in section
    362(b)(19) . . . any amounts required to repay such loan shall not
    constitute 'disposable income' under section 1325." Finally, Sec.
    1325(b)(3) requires that deductions from income for above-median
    income debtors be determined not only in accordance with the means
    test deductions, set out in subparagraph (A) of Sec. 707(b)(2), but
    also in accordance with subparagraph (B), which sets out the
    grounds for rebutting a presumption of abuse based on a
    demonstration of additional expenses justified by special
    circumstances. Part V includes an entry line for such additional
    expenses, with a warning that the debtor will be required (as
    provided by Sec. 707(b)(2)(B)) to document the expenses and provide
    a detailed explanation of the special circumstances that make them
    reasonable and necessary.
      The Chapter 13 form does not provide a deduction from disposable
    income for the Chapter 13 debtor's anticipated attorney fees. No
    specific statutory allowance for such a deduction exists, and none
    appears necessary. Section 1325(b)(1)(B) requires that disposable
    income contributed to a Chapter 13 plan be used to pay "unsecured
    creditors." A debtor's attorney who has not taken a security
    interest in the debtor's property is an unsecured creditor who may
    be paid from disposable income.
      Part VI allows the debtor to declare expenses not allowed under
    the form without deducting them from CMI, as described above in
    Sec. C.5.
                 COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008 AMENDMENT             

      The chapter 7 form is amended to implement the temporary
    exclusion from means testing created by the National Guard and
    Reservists Debt Relief Act of 2008. That law amended Sec.
    707(b)(2)(D) for a period of three years by adding a new subsection
    (ii) to provide a temporary exclusion from the application of the
    means test for certain members of the National Guard and reserve
    components of the Armed Forces. The new temporary exclusion would
    last for the period that the qualifying debtor is on active duty or
    is performing a homeland defense activity, and for 540 days
    thereafter.
      Because the exclusion for Reservists and National Guard members
    applies only for a defined period of time, it may expire during the
    course of the chapter 7 case filed by a debtor initially entitled
    to the exclusion. For that reason, a new check box is added to the
    top of the form that states that the "presumption is temporarily
    inapplicable." A debtor who is entitled to claim the Reservists and
    National Guard exclusion at the commencement of the chapter 7 case
    may check that box.
      The new exclusion applies only to a debtor who satisfies all of
    the requirements of Sec. 707(b)(2)(D)(ii), and its expiration date
    depends on facts specific to each debtor. Therefore, in a joint
    case in which the exclusion in part 1C is claimed by either or both
    filers, each joint filer must complete a separate statement. If
    only one joint debtor qualifies for the exclusion in part IC [sic],
    the other joint debtor must complete the form.
      Part 1C is added to the form to allow qualifying debtors to claim
    the temporary exclusion under Sec. 707(b)(2)(D)(ii). Debtors who
    declare under penalty of perjury that they satisfy all of the
    requirements of that provision are directed to verify their
    declaration in Part VIII and to check the "temporary presumption"
    box at the beginning of the form. They are not required to complete
    the remaining parts of the form for so long as the exclusion
    remains applicable.
      A debtor who is or has been a Reservist or a National Guard
    member may qualify for the exclusion described in part 1C by being
    called to active duty service after September 11, 2001, for a
    period of at least 90 days, or while performing homeland defense
    activity for a period of at least 90 days. After the debtor has
    been released from active duty or has ceased performing homeland
    defense activity, the exclusion applies for a period of 540 days
    after the release date or cessation of homeland defense activity.
    Under those circumstances the debtor must state the date of release
    from active duty or the date on which the performance of homeland
    defense activity terminated.
      If the Reservist and National Guard exclusion terminates during
    the course of a chapter 7 case - because of the expiration of the
    540 day period following the release from active duty or the
    cessation of homeland defense activity - then the debtor may be
    required to complete the remaining parts of the form that are
    applicable to the debtor. If the exclusion terminates while a
    timely motion to dismiss under Sec. 707(b)(2) may still be filed,
    Interim Rule 1007-I(n) requires that the debtor complete the
    remaining parts of the form no later than 14 days after the
    termination. If the obligation to complete the form arises in these
    circumstances and the debtor has not previously completed the form,
    the clerk is required to give the debtor notice of the obligation.

    Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-8,
    119 Stat. 23 (April 20, 2005). This form for a small business

    debtor (whether an individual or an artificial entity) is a small
    business debtor under Sec. 101(51D) of the Code. The form is
    intended to be used in conjunction with the small business chapter

                      COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES - 2008                  

      This form is new. It implements Sec. 433 of the Bankruptcy Abuse
    Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-8,
    119 Stat. 23 (April 20, 2005), which provides for an official form
    for a disclosure statement that may be used in cases where the
    debtor (whether an individual or an artificial entity) is a small
    business debtor under Sec. 101(51D) of the Code. The form provides
    a format for disseminating information to parties in interest about
    the plan of reorganization in a small business debtor's chapter 11
    case, so that a party can make a reasonably informed judgment
    whether to accept, reject, or object to a proposed plan of
    reorganization or liquidation.
      The form is intended to be used in conjunction with the form
    small business chapter 11 plan (Official Form 25A). As required by
    Sec. 433 of the 2005 Act, the form seeks to strike a practical
    balance between the reasonable needs of the courts, the United
    States trustee, creditors, and other parties in interest for
    reasonably complete information, on the one hand, and economy and
    simplicity for debtors, on the other. The form includes
    instructions and examples of the types of information needed to
    complete it.
      Because the relevant legal requirements for, and effect of, a
    plan's confirmation may vary depending on the nature of the debtor
    and the details of the proposed plan, this form is intended to
    provide an illustrative format for disclosure, rather than a
    specific prescription for the language or content of a particular
    disclosure statement. The form highlights the factual and legal
    disclosures required for adequate disclosure under Sec. 1125 of the
    Code. The form is not intended to restrict a plan proponent from
    providing additional information where that would be useful. Plan
    proponents are encouraged to present material information in as
    clear a manner as possible, including, where feasible, by providing
    an accompanying executive summary, approved by the court, that
    highlights particular creditors' or interest holders' voting status
    and treatment under the plan.
      Rule 3016 specifies the manner in which the disclosure statement
    is to be filed. Rule 3017 specifies the manner in which the court
    will consider it. Rule 3017.1 specifies special procedures for the
    court's conditional approval of a disclosure statement in a small
    business case.

      This form is new. It implements Secs. 434 and 435 of the
    Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005,
    Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23 (April 20, 2005), which provided
    for rules and an official form to assist small business debtors in
    chapter 11 cases to fulfill their responsibilities under Sec. 308
    of the Code, a provision added by the 2005 Act. The form directs
    the debtor to disclose the information required under Sec. 308 and
    resembles those developed earlier by the United States trustees for
    use in supervising debtors in possession in chapter 11 cases.

      This form is new. It gathers certain financial information,
    including information necessary for the court to determine whether
    a reaffirmation agreement creates a presumption of undue hardship
    under Sec. 524(m) of the Code, and it allows the debtor to provide
    additional information that may rebut such a presumption.
      To implement the requirements of Bankruptcy Rule 4008(b), the
    form also provides for a disclosure of any differences between the
    income and expenses reported on schedules I and J and the income
    and expenses reported in the debtor's statement in support of the
    reaffirmation agreement, together with an explanation of any such
    differences.
      Finally, the form requires a certification that the information
    supplied is true and correct.
