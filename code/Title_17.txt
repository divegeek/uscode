    title, the following terms and their variant forms mean the
    following:
        An "anonymous work" is a work on the copies or phonorecords of
      which no natural person is identified as author.
        An "architectural work" is the design of a building as embodied
      in any tangible medium of expression, including a building,
      architectural plans, or drawings. The work includes the overall
      form as well as the arrangement and composition of spaces and
      elements in the design, but does not include individual standard
      features.
        "Audiovisual works" are works that consist of a series of
      related images which are intrinsically intended to be shown by
      the use of machines, or devices such as projectors, viewers, or
      electronic equipment, together with accompanying sounds, if any,
      regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as films
      or tapes, in which the works are embodied.
        The "Berne Convention" is the Convention for the Protection of
      Literary and Artistic Works, signed at Berne, Switzerland, on
      September 9, 1886, and all acts, protocols, and revisions
      thereto.
        The "best edition" of a work is the edition, published in the
      United States at any time before the date of deposit, that the
      Library of Congress determines to be most suitable for its
      purposes.
        A person's "children" are that person's immediate offspring,
      whether legitimate or not, and any children legally adopted by
      that person.
        A "collective work" is a work, such as a periodical issue,
      anthology, or encyclopedia, in which a number of contributions,
      constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
      assembled into a collective whole.
        A "compilation" is a work formed by the collection and
      assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are selected,
      coordinated, or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as
      a whole constitutes an original work of authorship. The term
      "compilation" includes collective works.
        A "computer program" is a set of statements or instructions to
      be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring
      about a certain result.
        "Copies" are material objects, other than phonorecords, in
      which a work is fixed by any method now known or later developed,
      and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or
      otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a
      machine or device. The term "copies" includes the material
      object, other than a phonorecord, in which the work is first
      fixed.
        "Copyright owner", with respect to any one of the exclusive
      rights comprised in a copyright, refers to the owner of that
      particular right.
        A "Copyright Royalty Judge" is a Copyright Royalty Judge
      appointed under section 802 of this title, and includes any
      individual serving as an interim Copyright Royalty Judge under
      such section.
        A work is "created" when it is fixed in a copy or phonorecord
      for the first time; where a work is prepared over a period of
      time, the portion of it that has been fixed at any particular
      time constitutes the work as of that time, and where the work has
      been prepared in different versions, each version constitutes a
      separate work.
        A "derivative work" is a work based upon one or more
      preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
      dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound
      recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
      other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or
      adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations,
      elaborations, or other modifications which, as a whole, represent
      an original work of authorship, is a "derivative work".
        A "device", "machine", or "process" is one now known or later
      developed.
        A "digital transmission" is a transmission in whole or in part
      in a digital or other non-analog format.
        To "display" a work means to show a copy of it, either directly
      or by means of a film, slide, television image, or any other
      device or process or, in the case of a motion picture or other
      audiovisual work, to show individual images nonsequentially.
        An "establishment" is a store, shop, or any similar place of
      business open to the general public for the primary purpose of
      selling goods or services in which the majority of the gross
      square feet of space that is nonresidential is used for that
      purpose, and in which nondramatic musical works are performed
      publicly.
        The term "financial gain" includes receipt, or expectation of
      receipt, of anything of value, including the receipt of other
      copyrighted works.
        A work is "fixed" in a tangible medium of expression when its
      embodiment in a copy or phonorecord, by or under the authority of
      the author, is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to
      be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period
      of more than transitory duration. A work consisting of sounds,
      images, or both, that are being transmitted, is "fixed" for
      purposes of this title if a fixation of the work is being made
      simultaneously with its transmission.
        A "food service or drinking establishment" is a restaurant,
      inn, bar, tavern, or any other similar place of business in which
      the public or patrons assemble for the primary purpose of being
      served food or drink, in which the majority of the gross square
      feet of space that is nonresidential is used for that purpose,
      and in which nondramatic musical works are performed publicly.
        The "Geneva Phonograms Convention" is the Convention for the

      Duplication of Their Phonograms, concluded at Geneva,
      Switzerland, on October 29, 1971.
        The "gross square feet of space" of an establishment means the
      entire interior space of that establishment, and any adjoining
      outdoor space used to serve patrons, whether on a seasonal basis
      or otherwise.

      the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable
      or interdependent parts of a unitary whole.
        "Literary works" are works, other than audiovisual works,
      expressed in words, numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols

      tapes, disks, or cards, in which they are embodied.
        The term "motion picture exhibition facility" means a movie
      theater, screening room, or other venue that is being used
      primarily for the exhibition of a copyrighted motion picture, if
      such exhibition is open to the public or is made to an assembled
      group of viewers outside of a normal circle of a family and its
      social acquaintances.
        "Motion pictures" are audiovisual works consisting of a series
      of related images which, when shown in succession, impart an
      impression of motion, together with accompanying sounds, if any.
        To "perform" a work means to recite, render, play, dance, or
      act it, either directly or by means of any device or process or,
      in the case of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to
      show its images in any sequence or to make the sounds
      accompanying it audible.
        A "performing rights society" is an association, corporation,
      or other entity that licenses the public performance of
      nondramatic musical works on behalf of copyright owners of such
      works, such as the American Society of Composers, Authors and
      Publishers (ASCAP), Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI), and SESAC, Inc.
        "Phonorecords" are material objects in which sounds, other than
      those accompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual work,
      are fixed by any method now known or later developed, and from
      which the sounds can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise
      communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or
      device. The term "phonorecords" includes the material object in
      which the sounds are first fixed.
        "Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works" include two-
      dimensional and three-dimensional works of fine, graphic, and
      applied art, photographs, prints and art reproductions, maps,
      globes, charts, diagrams, models, and technical drawings,
      including architectural plans. Such works shall include works of
      artistic craftsmanship insofar as their form but not their
      mechanical or utilitarian aspects are concerned; the design of a
      useful article, as defined in this section, shall be considered a
      pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work only if, and only to the
      extent that, such design incorporates pictorial, graphic, or
      sculptural features that can be identified separately from, and
      are capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects
      of the article.
        For purposes of section 513, a "proprietor" is an individual,
      corporation, partnership, or other entity, as the case may be,
      that owns an establishment or a food service or drinking

      audiovisual service or programmer now known or as may be
      developed in the future, commercial subscription music service,
      or owner or operator of any other transmission service, shall
      under any circumstances be deemed to be a proprietor.
        A "pseudonymous work" is a work on the copies or phonorecords
      of which the author is identified under a fictitious name.
        "Publication" is the distribution of copies or phonorecords of
      a work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or
      by rental, lease, or lending. The offering to distribute copies
      or phonorecords to a group of persons for purposes of further
      distribution, public performance, or public display, constitutes
      publication. A public performance or display of a work does not
      of itself constitute publication.
        To perform or display a work "publicly" means - 
          (1) to perform or display it at a place open to the public or
        at any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a
        normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is
        gathered; or
          (2) to transmit or otherwise communicate a performance or
        display of the work to a place specified by clause (1) or to
        the public, by means of any device or process, whether the
        members of the public capable of receiving the performance or
        display receive it in the same place or in separate places and
        at the same time or at different times.

        "Registration", for purposes of sections 205(c)(2), 405, 406,
      410(d), 411, 412, and 506(e), means a registration of a claim in
      the original or the renewed and extended term of copyright.
        "Sound recordings" are works that result from the fixation of a
      series of musical, spoken, or other sounds, but not including the
      sounds accompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual work,
      regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as disks,
      tapes, or other phonorecords, in which they are embodied.
        "State" includes the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth
      of Puerto Rico, and any territories to which this title is made
      applicable by an Act of Congress.
        A "transfer of copyright ownership" is an assignment, mortgage,
      exclusive license, or any other conveyance, alienation, or
      hypothecation of a copyright or of any of the exclusive rights
      comprised in a copyright, whether or not it is limited in time or
      place of effect, but not including a nonexclusive license.
        A "transmission program" is a body of material that, as an
      aggregate, has been produced for the sole purpose of transmission
      to the public in sequence and as a unit.
        To "transmit" a performance or display is to communicate it by
      any device or process whereby images or sounds are received
      beyond the place from which they are sent.
        A "treaty party" is a country or intergovernmental organization
      other than the United States that is a party to an international
      agreement.
        The "United States", when used in a geographical sense,
      comprises the several States, the District of Columbia and the
      Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the organized territories under
      the jurisdiction of the United States Government.
        For purposes of section 411, a work is a "United States work"
      only if - 
          (1) in the case of a published work, the work is first
        published - 
            (A) in the United States;
            (B) simultaneously in the United States and another treaty
          party or parties, whose law grants a term of copyright
          protection that is the same as or longer than the term
          provided in the United States;
            (C) simultaneously in the United States and a foreign
          nation that is not a treaty party; or
            (D) in a foreign nation that is not a treaty party, and all
          of the authors of the work are nationals, domiciliaries, or
          habitual residents of, or in the case of an audiovisual work
          legal entities with headquarters in, the United States;

          (2) in the case of an unpublished work, all the authors of
        the work are nationals, domiciliaries, or habitual residents of
        the United States, or, in the case of an unpublished
        audiovisual work, all the authors are legal entities with
        headquarters in the United States; or
          (3) in the case of a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work
        incorporated in a building or structure, the building or
        structure is located in the United States.

        A "useful article" is an article having an intrinsic
      utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance
      of the article or to convey information. An article that is
      normally a part of a useful article is considered a "useful
      article".
        The author's "widow" or "widower" is the author's surviving
      spouse under the law of the author's domicile at the time of his
      or her death, whether or not the spouse has later remarried.

      concluded at Geneva, Switzerland, on December 20, 1996.
        The "WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty" is the WIPO
      Performances and Phonograms Treaty concluded at Geneva,
      Switzerland, on December 20, 1996.
        A "work of visual art" is - 
          (1) a painting, drawing, print, or sculpture, existing in a
        single copy, in a limited edition of 200 copies or fewer that
        are signed and consecutively numbered by the author, or, in the
        case of a sculpture, in multiple cast, carved, or fabricated
        sculptures of 200 or fewer that are consecutively numbered by
        the author and bear the signature or other identifying mark of
        the author; or
          (2) a still photographic image produced for exhibition
        purposes only, existing in a single copy that is signed by the
        author, or in a limited edition of 200 copies or fewer that are
        signed and consecutively numbered by the author.

      A work of visual art does not include - 
          (A)(i) any poster, map, globe, chart, technical drawing,
        diagram, model, applied art, motion picture or other
        audiovisual work, book, magazine, newspaper, periodical, data
        base, electronic information service, electronic publication,
        or similar publication;
          (ii) any merchandising item or advertising, promotional,
        descriptive, covering, or packaging material or container;
          (iii) any portion or part of any item described in clause (i)
        or (ii);
          (B) any work made for hire; or
          (C) any work not subject to copyright protection under this
        title.

        A "work of the United States Government" is a work prepared by
      an officer or employee of the United States Government as part of
      that person's official duties.
        A "work made for hire" is - 
          (1) a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or
        her employment; or
          (2) a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a
        contribution to a collective work, as a part of a motion
        picture or other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a
        supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional text,
        as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas, if
        the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by
        them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire.
        For the purpose of the foregoing sentence, a "supplementary
        work" is a work prepared for publication as a secondary adjunct
        to a work by another author for the purpose of introducing,
        concluding, illustrating, explaining, revising, commenting
        upon, or assisting in the use of the other work, such as
        forewords, afterwords, pictorial illustrations, maps, charts,
        tables, editorial notes, musical arrangements, answer material
        for tests, bibliographies, appendixes, and indexes, and an
        "instructional text" is a literary, pictorial, or graphic work
        prepared for publication and with the purpose of use in
        systematic instructional activities.

      In determining whether any work is eligible to be considered a
      work made for hire under paragraph (2), neither the amendment
      contained in section 1011(d) of the Intellectual Property and
      Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999, as enacted by section
      1000(a)(9) of Public Law 106-113, nor the deletion of the words
      added by that amendment - 
          (A) shall be considered or otherwise given any legal
        significance, or
          (B) shall be interpreted to indicate congressional approval
        or disapproval of, or acquiescence in, any judicial
        determination,

      by the courts or the Copyright Office. Paragraph (2) shall be
      interpreted as if both section 2(a)(1) of the Work Made For Hire
      and Copyright Corrections Act of 2000 and section 1011(d) of the
      Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of
      1999, as enacted by section 1000(a)(9) of Public Law 106-113,
      were never enacted, and without regard to any inaction or
      awareness by the Congress at any time of any judicial
      determinations.
        The terms "WTO Agreement" and "WTO member country" have the
      meanings given those terms in paragraphs (9) and (10),
      respectively, of section 2 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Copyright protection subsists, in accordance with this title,
    in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of
    expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be
    perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly
    or with the aid of a machine or device. Works of authorship include
    the following categories:
        (1) literary works;
        (2) musical works, including any accompanying words;
        (3) dramatic works, including any accompanying music;
        (4) pantomimes and choreographic works;
        (5) pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works;
        (6) motion pictures and other audiovisual works;
        (7) sound recordings; and
        (8) architectural works.

      (b) In no case does copyright protection for an original work of
    authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method
    of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the
    form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied
    in such work.

      Original Works of Authorship. The two fundamental criteria of
    copyright protection - originality and fixation in tangible form
    are restated in the first sentence of this cornerstone provision.
    The phrase "original works or authorship," which is purposely left
    undefined, is intended to incorporate without change the standard
    of originality established by the courts under the present
    copyright statute. This standard does not include requirements of
    novelty, ingenuity, or esthetic merit, and there is no intention to
    enlarge the standard of copyright protection to require them.
      In using the phrase "original works of authorship," rather than
    "all the writings of an author" now in section 4 of the statute
    [section 4 of former title 17], the committee's purpose is to avoid
    exhausting the constitutional power of Congress to legislate in
    this field, and to eliminate the uncertainties arising from the
    latter phrase. Since the present statutory language is
    substantially the same as the empowering language of the
    Constitution [Const. Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 8], a recurring question
    has been whether the statutory and the constitutional provisions
    are coextensive. If so, the courts would be faced with the
    alternative of holding copyrightable something that Congress
    clearly did not intend to protect, or of holding constitutionally
    incapable of copyright something that Congress might one day want
    to protect. To avoid these equally undesirable results, the courts
    have indicated that "all the writings of an author" under the
    present statute is narrower in scope than the "writings" of
    "authors" referred to in the Constitution. The bill avoids this
    dilemma by using a different phrase - "original works of
    authorship" - in characterizing the general subject matter of
    statutory copyright protection.
      The history of copyright law has been one of gradual expansion in
    the types of works accorded protection, and the subject matter
    affected by this expansion has fallen into two general categories.
    In the first, scientific discoveries and technological developments
    have made possible new forms of creative expression that never
    existed before. In some of these cases the new expressive forms -
    electronic music, filmstrips, and computer programs, for example -
    could be regarded as an extension of copyrightable subject matter
    Congress had already intended to protect, and were thus considered
    copyrightable from the outset without the need of new legislation.
    In other cases, such as photographs, sound recordings, and motion
    pictures, statutory enactment was deemed necessary to give them
    full recognition as copyrightable works.
      Authors are continually finding new ways of expressing
    themselves, but it is impossible to foresee the forms that these
    new expressive methods will take. The bill does not intend either
    to freeze the scope of copyrightable subject matter at the present
    stage of communications technology or to allow unlimited expansion
    into areas completely outside the present congressional intent.
    Section 102 implies neither that that subject matter is unlimited
    nor that new forms of expression within that general area of
    subject matter would necessarily be unprotected.
      The historic expansion of copyright has also applied to forms of
    expression which, although in existence for generations or
    centuries, have only gradually come to be recognized as creative
    and worthy of protection. The first copyright statute in this
    country, enacted in 1790, designated only "maps, charts, and
    books"; major forms of expression such as music, drama, and works
    of art achieved specific statutory recognition only in later
    enactments. Although the coverage of the present statute is very
    broad, and would be broadened further by the explicit recognition
    of all forms of choreography, there are unquestionably other areas
    of existing subject matter that this bill does not propose to
    protect but that future Congresses may want to.
      Fixation in Tangible Form. As a basic condition of copyright
    protection, the bill perpetuates the existing requirement that a
    work be fixed in a "tangible medium of expression," and adds that
    this medium may be one "now known or later developed," and that the
    fixation is sufficient if the work "can be perceived, reproduced,
    or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a
    machine or device." This broad language is intended to avoid the
    artificial and largely unjustifiable distinctions, derived from
    cases such as White-Smith Publishing Co. v. Apollo Co., 209 U.S. 1
    (1908) [28 S.Ct. 319, 52 L.Ed. 655], under which statutory
    copyrightability in certain cases has been made to depend upon the
    form or medium in which the work is fixed. Under the bill it makes
    no difference what the form, manner, or medium of fixation may be -
    whether it is in words, numbers, notes, sounds, pictures, or any
    other graphic or symbolic indicia, whether embodied in a physical
    object in written, printed, photographic, sculptural, punched,
    magnetic, or any other stable form, and whether it is capable of
    perception directly or by means of any machine or device "now known
    or later developed."
      Under the bill, the concept of fixation is important since it not
    only determines whether the provisions of the statute apply to a
    work, but it also represents the dividing line between common law
    and statutory protection. As will be noted in more detail in
    connection with section 301, an unfixed work of authorship, such as
    an improvisation or an unrecorded choreographic work, performance,
    or broadcast, would continue to be subject to protection under
    State common law or statute, but would not be eligible for Federal
    statutory protection under section 102.
      The bill seeks to resolve, through the definition of "fixation"
    in section 101, the status of live broadcasts - sports, news
    coverage, live performances of music, etc. - that are reaching the
    public in unfixed form but that are simultaneously being recorded.
    When a football game is being covered by four television cameras,
    with a director guiding the activities of the four cameramen and
    choosing which of their electronic images are sent out to the
    public and in what order, there is little doubt that what the
    cameramen and the director are doing constitutes "authorship." The
    further question to be considered is whether there has been a
    fixation. If the images and sounds to be broadcast are first
    recorded (on a video tape, film, etc.) and then transmitted, the
    recorded work would be considered a "motion picture" subject to
    statutory protection against unauthorized reproduction or
    retransmission of the broadcast. If the program content is
    transmitted live to the public while being recorded at the same
    time, the case would be treated the same; the copyright owner would
    not be forced to rely on common law rather than statutory rights in
    proceeding against an infringing user of the live broadcast.
      Thus, assuming it is copyrightable - as a "motion picture" or
    "sound recording," for example - the content of a live transmission
    should be regarded as fixed and should be accorded statutory
    protection if it is being recorded simultaneously with its
    transmission. On the other hand, the definition of "fixation" would
    exclude from the concept purely evanescent or transient
    reproductions such as those projected briefly on a screen, shown
    electronically on a television or other cathode ray tube, or
    captured momentarily in the "memory" of a computer.
      Under the first sentence of the definition of "fixed" in section
    101, a work would be considered "fixed in a tangible medium of
    expression" if there has been an authorized embodiment in a copy or
    phonorecord and if that embodiment "is sufficiently permanent or
    stable" to permit the work "to be perceived, reproduced, or
    otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory
    duration." The second sentence makes clear that, in the case of "a
    work consisting of sounds, images, or both, that are being
    transmitted," the work is regarded as "fixed" if a fixation is
    being made at the same time as the transmission.
      Under this definition "copies" and "phonorecords" together will
    comprise all of the material objects in which copyrightable works
    are capable of being fixed. The definitions of these terms in
    section 101, together with their usage in section 102 and
    throughout the bill, reflect a fundamental distinction between the
    "original work" which is the product of "authorship" and the
    multitude of material objects in which it can be embodied. Thus, in
    the sense of the bill, a "book" is not a work of authorship, but is
    a particular kind of "copy." Instead, the author may write a
    "literary work," which in turn can be embodied in a wide range of
    "copies" and "phonorecords," including books, periodicals, computer
    punch cards, microfilm, tape recordings, and so forth. It is
    possible to have an "original work of authorship" without having a
    "copy" or "phonorecord" embodying it, and it is also possible to
    have a "copy" or "phonorecord" embodying something that does not
    qualify as an "original work of authorship." The two essential
    elements - original work and tangible object - must merge through
    fixation in order to produce subject matter copyrightable under the
    statute.
      Categories of Copyrightable Works. The second sentence of section
    102 lists seven broad categories which the concept of "works of
    authorship" is said to "include". The use of the word "include," as
    defined in section 101, makes clear that the listing is
    "illustrative and not limitative," and that the seven categories do
    not necessarily exhaust the scope of "original works of authorship"
    that the bill is intended to protect. Rather, the list sets out the
    general area of copyrightable subject matter, but with sufficient
    flexibility to free the courts from rigid or outmoded concepts of
    the scope of particular categories. The items are also overlapping
    in the sense that a work falling within one class may encompass
    works coming within some or all of the other categories. In the
    aggregate, the list covers all classes of works now specified in
    section 5 of title 17 [section 5 of former title 17]; in addition,
    it specifically enumerates "pantomimes and choreographic works".
      Of the seven items listed, four are defined in section 101. The
    three undefined categories - "musical works," "dramatic works," and
    "pantomimes and choreographic works" - have fairly settled
    meanings. There is no need, for example, to specify the
    copyrightability of electronic or concrete music in the statute
    since the form of a work would no longer be of any importance, nor
    is it necessary to specify that "choreographic works" do not
    include social dance steps and simple routines.
      The four items defined in section 101 are "literary works,"
    "pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works," "motion pictures and
    audiovisual works", and "sound recordings". In each of these cases,
    definitions are needed not only because the meaning of the term
    itself is unsettled but also because the distinction between "work"
    and "material object" requires clarification. The term "literary
    works" does not connote any criterion of literary merit or
    qualitative value: it includes catalogs, directories, and similar
    factual, reference, or instructional works and compilations of
    data. It also includes computer data bases, and computer programs
    to the extent that they incorporate authorship in the programmer's
    expression of original ideas, as distinguished from the ideas
    themselves.
      Correspondingly, the definition of "pictorial, graphic, and
    sculptural works" carries with it no implied criterion of artistic
    taste, aesthetic value, or intrinsic quality. The term is intended
    to comprise not only "works of art" in the traditional sense but
    also works of graphic art and illustration, art reproductions,
    plans and drawings, photographs and reproductions of them, maps,
    charts, globes, and other cartographic works, works of these kinds
    intended for use in advertising and commerce, and works of "applied
    art." There is no intention whatever to narrow the scope of the
    subject matter now characterized in section 5(k) [section 5(k) of
    former title 17] as "prints or labels used for articles of
    merchandise." However, since this terminology suggests the material
    object in which a work is embodied rather than the work itself, the
    bill does not mention this category separately.
      In accordance with the Supreme Court's decision in Mazer v.
    Stein, 347 U.S. 201 (1954) [74 S.Ct. 460, 98 L. Ed. 630, rehearing
    denied 74 S.Ct. 637, 347 U.S. 949, 98 L.Ed. 1096], works of
    "applied art" encompass all original pictorial, graphic, and
    sculptural works that are intended to be or have been embodied in
    useful articles, regardless of factors such as mass production,
    commercial exploitation, and the potential availability of design
    patent protection. The scope of exclusive rights in these works is
    given special treatment in section 113, to be discussed below.
      The Committee has added language to the definition of "pictorial,
    graphic, and sculptural works" in an effort to make clearer the
    distinction between works of applied art protectable under the bill
    and industrial designs not subject to copyright protection. The
    declaration that "pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works" include
    "works of artistic craftsmanship insofar as their form but not
    their mechanical or utilitarian aspects are concerned" is classic
    language; it is drawn from Copyright Office regulations promulgated
    in the 1940's and expressly endorsed by the Supreme Court in the
    Mazer case.
      The second part of the amendment states that "the design of a
    useful article * * * shall be considered a pictorial, graphic, or
    sculptural work only if, and only to the extent that, such design
    incorporates pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features that can be
    identified separately from, and are capable of existing
    independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article." A
    "useful article" is defined as "an article having an intrinsic
    utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance
    of the article or to convey information." This part of the
    amendment is an adaptation of language added to the Copyright
    Office Regulations in the mid-1950's in an effort to implement the
    Supreme Court's decision in the Mazer case.
      In adopting this amendatory language, the Committee is seeking to
    draw as clear a line as possible between copyrightable works of
    applied art and uncopyrighted works of industrial design. A two-
    dimensional painting, drawing, or graphic work is still capable of
    being identified as such when it is printed on or applied to
    utilitarian articles such as textile fabrics, wallpaper,
    containers, and the like. The same is true when a statue or carving
    is used to embellish an industrial product or, as in the Mazer
    case, is incorporated into a product without losing its ability to
    exist independently as a work of art. On the other hand, although
    the shape of an industrial product may be aesthetically satisfying
    and valuable, the Committee's intention is not to offer it
    copyright protection under the bill. Unless the shape of an
    automobile, airplane, ladies' dress, food processor, television
    set, or any other industrial product contains some element that,
    physically or conceptually, can be identified as separable from the
    utilitarian aspects of that article, the design would not be
    copyrighted under the bill. The test of separability and
    independence from "the utilitarian aspects of the article" does not
    depend upon the nature of the design - that is, even if the
    appearance of an article is determined by aesthetic (as opposed to
    functional) considerations, only elements, if any, which can be
    identified separately from the useful article as such are
    copyrightable. And, even if the three-dimensional design contains
    some such element (for example, a carving on the back of a chair or
    a floral relief design on silver flatware), copyright protection
    would extend only to that element, and would not cover the over-all
    configuration of the utilitarian article as such.
      A special situation is presented by architectural works. An
    architect's plans and drawings would, of course, be protected by
    copyright, but the extent to which that protection would extend to
    the structure depicted would depend on the circumstances. Purely
    nonfunctional or monumental structures would be subject to full
    copyright protection under the bill, and the same would be true of
    artistic sculpture or decorative ornamentation or embellishment
    added to a structure. On the other hand, where the only elements of
    shape in an architectural design are conceptually inseparable from
    the utilitarian aspects of the structure, copyright protection for
    the design would not be available.
      The Committee has considered, but chosen to defer, the
    possibility of protecting the design of typefaces. A "typeface" can
    be defined as a set of letters, numbers, or other symbolic
    characters, whose forms are related by repeating design elements
    consistently applied in a notational system and are intended to be
    embodied in articles whose intrinsic utilitarian function is for
    use in composing text or other cognizable combinations of
    characters. The Committee does not regard the design of typeface,
    as thus defined, to be a copyrightable "pictorial, graphic, or
    sculptural work" within the meaning of this bill and the
    application of the dividing line in section 101.
      Enactment of Public Law 92-140 in 1971 [Pub. L. 92-140, Oct. 15,
    1971, 85 Stat. 391, which amended sections 1, 5, 19, 20, 26, and
    101 of former title 17, and enacted provisions set out as a note
    under section 1 of former title 17] marked the first recognition in
    American copyright law of sound recordings as copyrightable works.
    As defined in section 101, copyrightable "sound recordings" are
    original works of authorship comprising an aggregate of musical,
    spoken, or other sounds that have been fixed in tangible form. The
    copyrightable work comprises the aggregation of sounds and not the
    tangible medium of fixation. Thus, "sound recordings" as
    copyrightable subject matter are distinguished from "phonorecords,"
    the latter being physical objects in which sounds are fixed. They
    are also distinguished from any copyrighted literary, dramatic, or
    musical works that may be reproduced on a "phonorecord."
      As a class of subject matter, sound recordings are clearly within
    the scope of the "writings of an author" capable of protection
    under the Constitution [Const. Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 8], and the
    extension of limited statutory protection to them was too long
    delayed. Aside from cases in which sounds are fixed by some purely
    mechanical means without originality of any kind, the copyright
    protection that would prevent the reproduction and distribution of
    unauthorized phonorecords of sound recordings is clearly justified.
      The copyrightable elements in a sound recording will usually,
    though not always, involve "authorship" both on the part of the
    performers whose performance is captured and on the part of the
    record producer responsible for setting up the recording session,
    capturing and electronically processing the sounds, and compiling
    and editing them to make the final sound recording. There may,
    however, be cases where the record producer's contribution is so
    minimal that the performance is the only copyrightable element in
    the work, and there may be cases (for example, recordings of
    birdcalls, sounds of racing cars, et cetera) where only the record
    producer's contribution is copyrightable.
      Sound tracks of motion pictures, long a nebulous area in American
    copyright law, are specifically included in the definition of
    "motion pictures," and excluded in the definition of "sound
    recordings." To be a "motion picture," as defined, requires three
    elements: (1) a series of images, (2) the capability of showing the
    images in certain successive order, and (3) an impression of motion
    when the images are thus shown. Coupled with the basic requirements
    of original authorship and fixation in tangible form, this
    definition encompasses a wide range of cinematographic works
    embodied in films, tapes, video disks, and other media. However, it
    would not include: (1) unauthorized fixations of live performances
    or telecasts, (2) live telecasts that are not fixed simultaneously
    with their transmission, or (3) filmstrips and slide sets which,
    although consisting of a series of images intended to be shown in
    succession, are not capable of conveying an impression of motion.
      On the other hand, the bill equates audiovisual materials such as
    filmstrips, slide sets, and sets of transparencies with "motion
    pictures" rather than with "pictorial, graphic, and sculptural
    works." Their sequential showing is closer to a "performance" than
    to a "display," and the definition of "audiovisual works," which
    applies also to "motion pictures," embraces works consisting of a
    series of related images that are by their nature, intended for
    showing by means of projectors or other devices.
      Nature of Copyright. Copyright does not preclude others from
    using the ideas or information revealed by the author's work. It
    pertains to the literary, musical, graphic, or artistic form in
    which the author expressed intellectual concepts. Section 102(b)
    makes clear that copyright protection does not extend to any idea,
    procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept,
    principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is
    described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.
      Some concern has been expressed lest copyright in computer
    programs should extend protection to the methodology or processes
    adopted by the programmer, rather than merely to the "writing"
    expressing his ideas. Section 102(b) is intended, among other
    things, to make clear that the expression adopted by the programmer
    is the copyrightable element in a computer program, and that the
    actual processes or methods embodied in the program are not within
    the scope of the copyright law.
      Section 102(b) in no way enlarges or contracts the scope of
    copyright protection under the present law. Its purpose is to
    restate, in the context of the new single Federal system of
    copyright, that the basic dichotomy between expression and idea
    remains unchanged.

    Sec. 103. Subject matter of copyright: Compilations and derivative
      works

-STATUTE-
      (a) The subject matter of copyright as specified by section 102
    includes compilations and derivative works, but protection for a
    work employing preexisting material in which copyright subsists
    does not extend to any part of the work in which such material has
    been used unlawfully.
      (b) The copyright in a compilation or derivative work extends
    only to the material contributed by the author of such work, as
    distinguished from the preexisting material employed in the work,
    and does not imply any exclusive right in the preexisting material.
    The copyright in such work is independent of, and does not affect
    or enlarge the scope, duration, ownership, or subsistence of, any
    copyright protection in the preexisting material.

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      Section 103 complements section 102: A compilation or derivative
    work is copyrightable if it represents an "original work of
    authorship" and falls within one or more of the categories listed
    in section 102. Read together, the two sections make plain that the
    criteria of copyrightable subject matter stated in section 102
    apply with full force to works that are entirely original and to
    those containing preexisting material. Section 103(b) is also
    intended to define, more sharply and clearly than does section 7 of
    the present law [section 7 of former title 17], the important
    interrelationship and correlation between protection of preexisting
    and of "new" material in a particular work. The most important
    point here is one that is commonly misunderstood today: copyright
    in a "new version" covers only the material added by the later
    author, and has no effect one way or the other on the copyright or
    public domain status of the preexisting material.
      Between them the terms "compilations" and "derivative works"
    which are defined in section 101 comprehend every copyrightable
    work that employs preexisting material or data of any kind. There
    is necessarily some overlapping between the two, but they basically
    represent different concepts. A "compilation" results from a
    process of selecting, bringing together, organizing, and arranging
    previously existing material of all kinds, regardless of whether
    the individual items in the material have been or ever could have
    been subject to copyright. A "derivative work," on the other hand,
    requires a process of recasting, transforming, or adapting "one or
    more preexisting works"; the "preexisting work" must come within
    the general subject matter of copyright set forth in section 102,
    regardless of whether it is or was ever copyrighted.
      The second part of the sentence that makes up section 103(a)
    deals with the status of a compilation or derivative work
    unlawfully employing preexisting copyrighted material. In providing
    that protection does not extend to "any part of the work in which
    such material has been used unlawfully," the bill prevents an
    infringer from benefiting, through copyright protection, from
    committing an unlawful act, but preserves protection for those
    parts of the work that do not employ the preexisting work. Thus, an
    unauthorized translation of a novel could not be copyrighted at
    all, but the owner of copyright in an anthology of poetry could sue
    someone who infringed the whole anthology, even though the
    infringer proves that publication of one of the poems was
    unauthorized. Under this provision, copyright could be obtained as
    long as the use of the preexisting work was not "unlawful," even
    though the consent of the copyright owner had not been obtained.
    For instance, the unauthorized reproduction of a work might be
    "lawful" under the doctrine of fair use or an applicable foreign
    law, and if so the work incorporating it could be copyrighted.

    TITLE 17 - COPYRIGHTS
    CHAPTER 1 - SUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE OF COPYRIGHT

-HEAD-
    Sec. 104. Subject matter of copyright: National origin

-STATUTE-
      (a) Unpublished Works. - The works specified by sections 102 and
    103, while unpublished, are subject to protection under this title
    without regard to the nationality or domicile of the author.
      (b) Published Works. - The works specified by sections 102 and
    103, when published, are subject to protection under this title if -
     
        (1) on the date of first publication, one or more of the
      authors is a national or domiciliary of the United States, or is
      a national, domiciliary, or sovereign authority of a treaty
      party, or is a stateless person, wherever that person may be
      domiciled; or
        (2) the work is first published in the United States or in a
      foreign nation that, on the date of first publication, is a
      treaty party; or
        (3) the work is a sound recording that was first fixed in a
      treaty party; or
        (4) the work is a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work that
      is incorporated in a building or other structure, or an
      architectural work that is embodied in a building and the
      building or structure is located in the United States or a treaty
      party; or
        (5) the work is first published by the United Nations or any of
      its specialized agencies, or by the Organization of American
      States; or
        (6) the work comes within the scope of a Presidential
      proclamation. Whenever the President finds that a particular
      foreign nation extends, to works by authors who are nationals or
      domiciliaries of the United States or to works that are first
      published in the United States, copyright protection on
      substantially the same basis as that on which the foreign nation
      extends protection to works of its own nationals and
      domiciliaries and works first published in that nation, the
      President may by proclamation extend protection under this title
      to works of which one or more of the authors is, on the date of
      first publication, a national, domiciliary, or sovereign
      authority of that nation, or which was first published in that
      nation. The President may revise, suspend, or revoke any such
      proclamation or impose any conditions or limitations on
      protection under a proclamation.

    For purposes of paragraph (2), a work that is published in the
    United States or a treaty party within 30 days after publication in
    a foreign nation that is not a treaty party shall be considered to
    be first published in the United States or such treaty party, as
    the case may be.
      (c) Effect of Berne Convention. - No right or interest in a work
    eligible for protection under this title may be claimed by virtue
    of, or in reliance upon, the provisions of the Berne Convention, or
    the adherence of the United States thereto. Any rights in a work
    eligible for protection under this title that derive from this
    title, other Federal or State statutes, or the common law, shall
    not be expanded or reduced by virtue of, or in reliance upon, the
    provisions of the Berne Convention, or the adherence of the United
    States thereto.
      (d) Effect of Phonograms Treaties. - Notwithstanding the
    provisions of subsection (b), no works other than sound recordings
    shall be eligible for protection under this title solely by virtue
    of the adherence of the United States to the Geneva Phonograms
    Convention or the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty.

      Section 104 of the bill [this section], which sets forth the
    basic criteria under which works of foreign origin can be protected
    under the U.S. copyright law, divides all works coming within the
    scope of sections 102 and 103 into two categories: unpublished and
    published. Subsection (a) imposes no qualifications of nationality
    and domicile with respect to unpublished works. Subsection (b)
    would make published works subject to protection under any one of
    four conditions:
        (1) The author is a national or domiciliary of the United
      States or of a country with which the United States has copyright
      relations under a treaty, or is a stateless person;
        (2) The work is first published in the United States or in a
      country that is a party to the Universal Copyright Convention;
        (3) The work is first published by the United Nations, by any
      of its specialized agencies, or by the Organization of American
      States; or
        (4) The work is covered by a Presidential proclamation
      extending protection to works originating in a specified country
      which extends protection to U.S. works "on substantially the same
      basis" as to its own works.
      The third of these conditions represents a treaty obligation of
    the United States. Under the Second Protocol of the Universal
    Copyright Convention, protection under U.S. Copyright law is
    expressly required for works published by the United Nations, by
    U.N. specialized agencies and by the Organization of American
    States.

    owned by United States nationals at the commencement of or during
    the state of war between Germany and the United States of America
    which were transferred, seized, requisitioned, revoked or otherwise

      WHEREAS, by virtue of a proclamation by the President of the
    United States of America dated May 25, 1922, 42 Stat. 2271, German

    on or after September 3, 1939, and on or before May 5, 1956, by an
    author or other owner who was then a German citizen; or (b) where
    the work was subject to renewal of copyright under the laws of the
    United States of America on or after September 3, 1939, and on or
    before May 5, 1956, by an author or other person specified in
    Sections 24 and 25 of the aforesaid Title 17 [sections 24 and 25 of
    former Title 17], who was then a German citizen, there has existed
    during several years of the aforementioned period such disruption
    and suspension of facilities essential to compliance with
    conditions and formalities prescribed with respect to such works by
    the copyright law of the United States of America as to bring such
    works within the terms of Section 9(b) of the aforesaid Title 17

    the time within which persons who are presently German citizens may
    comply with such conditions and formalities with respect to such
    works is hereby extended for one year after the date of this

      It shall be understood that the term of copyright in any case is
    not and cannot be altered or affected by this proclamation. It

-HEAD-
    Sec. 104A. Copyright in restored works

-STATUTE-
      (a) Automatic Protection and Term. - 
        (1) Term. - 
          (A) Copyright subsists, in accordance with this section, in
        restored works, and vests automatically on the date of
        restoration.
          (B) Any work in which copyright is restored under this
        section shall subsist for the remainder of the term of
        copyright that the work would have otherwise been granted in
        the United States if the work never entered the public domain
        in the United States.

        (2) Exception. - Any work in which the copyright was ever owned
      or administered by the Alien Property Custodian and in which the
      restored copyright would be owned by a government or
      instrumentality thereof, is not a restored work.

      (b) Ownership of Restored Copyright. - A restored work vests
    initially in the author or initial rightholder of the work as
    determined by the law of the source country of the work.
      (c) Filing of Notice of Intent to Enforce Restored Copyright
    Against Reliance Parties. - On or after the date of restoration,
    any person who owns a copyright in a restored work or an exclusive
    right therein may file with the Copyright Office a notice of intent
    to enforce that person's copyright or exclusive right or may serve
    such a notice directly on a reliance party. Acceptance of a notice
    by the Copyright Office is effective as to any reliance parties but
    shall not create a presumption of the validity of any of the facts
    stated therein. Service on a reliance party is effective as to that
    reliance party and any other reliance parties with actual knowledge
    of such service and of the contents of that notice.
      (d) Remedies for Infringement of Restored Copyrights. - 
        (1) Enforcement of copyright in restored works in the absence
      of a reliance party. - As against any party who is not a reliance
      party, the remedies provided in chapter 5 of this title shall be
      available on or after the date of restoration of a restored
      copyright with respect to an act of infringement of the restored
      copyright that is commenced on or after the date of restoration.
        (2) Enforcement of copyright in restored works as against
      reliance parties. - As against a reliance party, except to the
      extent provided in paragraphs (3) and (4), the remedies provided
      in chapter 5 of this title shall be available, with respect to an
      act of infringement of a restored copyright, on or after the date
      of restoration of the restored copyright if the requirements of
      either of the following subparagraphs are met:
          (A)(i) The owner of the restored copyright (or such owner's
        agent) or the owner of an exclusive right therein (or such
        owner's agent) files with the Copyright Office, during the 24-
        month period beginning on the date of restoration, a notice of
        intent to enforce the restored copyright; and
          (ii)(I) the act of infringement commenced after the end of
        the 12-month period beginning on the date of publication of the
        notice in the Federal Register;
          (II) the act of infringement commenced before the end of the
        12-month period described in subclause (I) and continued after
        the end of that 12-month period, in which case remedies shall
        be available only for infringement occurring after the end of
        that 12-month period; or
          (III) copies or phonorecords of a work in which copyright has
        been restored under this section are made after publication of
        the notice of intent in the Federal Register.
          (B)(i) The owner of the restored copyright (or such owner's
        agent) or the owner of an exclusive right therein (or such
        owner's agent) serves upon a reliance party a notice of intent
        to enforce a restored copyright; and
          (ii)(I) the act of infringement commenced after the end of
        the 12-month period beginning on the date the notice of intent
        is received;
          (II) the act of infringement commenced before the end of the
        12-month period described in subclause (I) and continued after
        the end of that 12-month period, in which case remedies shall
        be available only for the infringement occurring after the end
        of that 12-month period; or
          (III) copies or phonorecords of a work in which copyright has
        been restored under this section are made after receipt of the
        notice of intent.

      In the event that notice is provided under both subparagraphs (A)
      and (B), the 12-month period referred to in such subparagraphs
      shall run from the earlier of publication or service of notice.
        (3) Existing derivative works. - (A) In the case of a
      derivative work that is based upon a restored work and is created
      - 
          (i) before the date of the enactment of the Uruguay Round
        Agreements Act, if the source country of the restored work is
        an eligible country on such date, or
          (ii) before the date on which the source country of the
        restored work becomes an eligible country, if that country is
        not an eligible country on such date of enactment,

      a reliance party may continue to exploit that derivative work for
      the duration of the restored copyright if the reliance party pays
      to the owner of the restored copyright reasonable compensation
      for conduct which would be subject to a remedy for infringement
      but for the provisions of this paragraph.
        (B) In the absence of an agreement between the parties, the
      amount of such compensation shall be determined by an action in
      United States district court, and shall reflect any harm to the
      actual or potential market for or value of the restored work from
      the reliance party's continued exploitation of the work, as well
      as compensation for the relative contributions of expression of
      the author of the restored work and the reliance party to the
      derivative work.
        (4) Commencement of infringement for reliance parties. - For
      purposes of section 412, in the case of reliance parties,
      infringement shall be deemed to have commenced before
      registration when acts which would have constituted infringement
      had the restored work been subject to copyright were commenced
      before the date of restoration.

      (e) Notices of Intent To Enforce a Restored Copyright. - 
        (1) Notices of intent filed with the copyright office. - (A)(i)
      A notice of intent filed with the Copyright Office to enforce a
      restored copyright shall be signed by the owner of the restored
      copyright or the owner of an exclusive right therein, who files
      the notice under subsection (d)(2)(A)(i) (hereafter in this
      paragraph referred to as the "owner"), or by the owner's agent,
      shall identify the title of the restored work, and shall include
      an English translation of the title and any other alternative
      titles known to the owner by which the restored work may be
      identified, and an address and telephone number at which the
      owner may be contacted. If the notice is signed by an agent, the
      agency relationship must have been constituted in a writing
      signed by the owner before the filing of the notice. The
      Copyright Office may specifically require in regulations other
      information to be included in the notice, but failure to provide
      such other information shall not invalidate the notice or be a
      basis for refusal to list the restored work in the Federal
      Register.
        (ii) If a work in which copyright is restored has no formal
      title, it shall be described in the notice of intent in detail
      sufficient to identify it.
        (iii) Minor errors or omissions may be corrected by further
      notice at any time after the notice of intent is filed. Notices
      of corrections for such minor errors or omissions shall be
      accepted after the period established in subsection (d)(2)(A)(i).
      Notices shall be published in the Federal Register pursuant to
      subparagraph (B).
        (B)(i) The Register of Copyrights shall publish in the Federal
      Register, commencing not later than 4 months after the date of
      restoration for a particular nation and every 4 months thereafter
      for a period of 2 years, lists identifying restored works and the
      ownership thereof if a notice of intent to enforce a restored
      copyright has been filed.
        (ii) Not less than 1 list containing all notices of intent to
      enforce shall be maintained in the Public Information Office of
      the Copyright Office and shall be available for public inspection
      and copying during regular business hours pursuant to sections
      705 and 708.
        (C) The Register of Copyrights is authorized to fix reasonable
      fees based on the costs of receipt, processing, recording, and
      publication of notices of intent to enforce a restored copyright
      and corrections thereto.
        (D)(i) Not later than 90 days before the date the Agreement on
      Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property referred to in
      section 101(d)(15) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act enters
      into force with respect to the United States, the Copyright
      Office shall issue and publish in the Federal Register
      regulations governing the filing under this subsection of notices
      of intent to enforce a restored copyright.
        (ii) Such regulations shall permit owners of restored
      copyrights to file simultaneously for registration of the
      restored copyright.
        (2) Notices of intent served on a reliance party. - (A) Notices
      of intent to enforce a restored copyright may be served on a
      reliance party at any time after the date of restoration of the
      restored copyright.
        (B) Notices of intent to enforce a restored copyright served on
      a reliance party shall be signed by the owner or the owner's
      agent, shall identify the restored work and the work in which the
      restored work is used, if any, in detail sufficient to identify
      them, and shall include an English translation of the title, any
      other alternative titles known to the owner by which the work may
      be identified, the use or uses to which the owner objects, and an
      address and telephone number at which the reliance party may
      contact the owner. If the notice is signed by an agent, the
      agency relationship must have been constituted in writing and
      signed by the owner before service of the notice.
        (3) Effect of material false statements. - Any material false
      statement knowingly made with respect to any restored copyright
      identified in any notice of intent shall make void all claims and
      assertions made with respect to such restored copyright.

      (f) Immunity From Warranty and Related Liability. - 
        (1) In general. - Any person who warrants, promises, or
      guarantees that a work does not violate an exclusive right
      granted in section 106 shall not be liable for legal, equitable,
      arbitral, or administrative relief if the warranty, promise, or
      guarantee is breached by virtue of the restoration of copyright
      under this section, if such warranty, promise, or guarantee is
      made before January 1, 1995.
        (2) Performances. - No person shall be required to perform any
      act if such performance is made infringing by virtue of the
      restoration of copyright under the provisions of this section, if
      the obligation to perform was undertaken before January 1, 1995.

      (g) Proclamation of Copyright Restoration. - Whenever the
    President finds that a particular foreign nation extends, to works
    by authors who are nationals or domiciliaries of the United States,
    restored copyright protection on substantially the same basis as
    provided under this section, the President may by proclamation
    extend restored protection provided under this section to any work -
     
        (1) of which one or more of the authors is, on the date of
      first publication, a national, domiciliary, or sovereign
      authority of that nation; or

-HEAD-
    Sec. 105. Subject matter of copyright: United States Government
      works

-STATUTE-
      Copyright protection under this title is not available for any
    work of the United States Government, but the United States
    Government is not precluded from receiving and holding copyrights
    transferred to it by assignment, bequest, or otherwise.

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      Scope of the Prohibition. The basic premise of section 105 of the
    bill is the same as that of section 8 of the present law [section 8
    of former title 17] - that works produced for the U.S. Government
    by its officers and employees should not be subject to copyright.
    The provision applies the principle equally to unpublished and
    published works.
      The general prohibition against copyright in section 105 applies
    to "any work of the United States Government," which is defined in
    section 101 as "a work prepared by an officer or employee of the
    United States Government as part of that person's official duties."
    Under this definition a Government official or employee would not
    be prevented from securing copyright in a work written at that
    person's own volition and outside his or her duties, even though
    the subject matter involves the Government work or professional
    field of the official or employee. Although the wording of the
    definition of "work of the United States Government" differs
    somewhat from that of the definition of "work made for hire," the
    concepts are intended to be construed in the same way.
      A more difficult and far-reaching problem is whether the
    definition should be broadened to prohibit copyright in works
    prepared under U.S. Government contract or grant. As the bill is
    written, the Government agency concerned could determine in each
    case whether to allow an independent contractor or grantee, to
    secure copyright in works prepared in whole or in part with the use
    of Government funds. The argument that has been made against
    allowing copyright in this situation is that the public should not
    be required to pay a "double subsidy," and that it is inconsistent
    to prohibit copyright in works by Government employees while
    permitting private copyrights in a growing body of works created by
    persons who are paid with Government funds. Those arguing in favor
    of potential copyright protection have stressed the importance of
    copyright as an incentive to creation and dissemination in this
    situation, and the basically different policy considerations,
    applicable to works written by Government employees and those
    applicable to works prepared by private organizations with the use
    of Federal funds.
      The bill deliberately avoids making any sort of outright,
    unqualified prohibition against copyright in works prepared under
    Government contract or grant. There may well be cases where it
    would be in the public interest to deny copyright in the writings
    generated by Government research contracts and the like; it can be
    assumed that, where a Government agency commissions a work for its
    own use merely as an alternative to having one of its own employees
    prepare the work, the right to secure a private copyright would be
    withheld. However, there are almost certainly many other cases
    where the denial of copyright protection would be unfair or would
    hamper the production and publication of important works. Where,
    under the particular circumstances, Congress or the agency involved
    finds that the need to have a work freely available outweighs the
    need of the private author to secure copyright, the problem can be
    dealt with by specific legislation, agency regulations, or
    contractual restrictions.
      The prohibition on copyright protection for United States
    Government works is not intended to have any effect on protection
    of these works abroad. Works of the governments of most other
    countries are copyrighted. There are no valid policy reasons for
    denying such protection to United States Government works in
    foreign countries, or for precluding the Government from making
    licenses for the use of its works abroad.
      The effect of section 105 is intended to place all works of the
    United States Government, published or unpublished, in the public
    domain. This means that the individual Government official or
    employee who wrote the work could not secure copyright in it or
    restrain its dissemination by the Government or anyone else, but it
    also means that, as far as the copyright law is concerned, the
    Government could not restrain the employee or official from
    disseminating the work if he or she chooses to do so. The use of
    the term "work of the United States Government" does not mean that
    a work falling within the definition of that term is the property
    of the U.S. Government.

       LIMITED EXCEPTION FOR NATIONAL TECHNICAL INFORMATION SERVICE   
      At the House hearings in 1975 the U.S. Department of Commerce
    called attention to its National Technical Information Service
    (NTIS), which has a statutory mandate, under Chapter 23 [Sec. 1151
    et seq.] of Title 15 of the U.S. Code, to operate a clearinghouse
    for the collection and dissemination of scientific, technical and
    engineering information. Under its statute, NTIS is required to be
    as self-sustaining as possible, and not to force the general public
    to bear publishing costs that are for private benefit. The
    Department urged an amendment to section 105 that would allow it to
    secure copyright in NTIS publications both in the United States and
    abroad, noting that a precedent exists in the Standard Reference
    Data Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 290(e) [Sec. 290e]).
      In response to this request the Committee adopted a limited
    exception to the general prohibition in section 105, permitting the
    Secretary of Commerce to "secure copyright for a limited term not
    to exceed five years, on behalf of the United States as author or
    copyright owner" in any NTIS publication disseminated pursuant to
    15 U.S.C. Chapter 23 [Sec. 1151 et seq.]. In order to "secure
    copyright" in a work under this amendment the Secretary would be
    required to publish the work with a copyright notice, and the five-
    year term would begin upon the date of first publication.
      Proposed Saving Clause. Section 8 of the statute now in effect
    [section 8 of former title 17] includes a saving clause intended to
    make clear that the copyright protection of a private work is not
    affected if the work is published by the Government. This provision
    serves a real purpose in the present law because of the ambiguity
    of the undefined term "any publication of the United States
    Government." Section 105 of the bill, however, uses the operative
    term "work of the United States Government" and defines it in such
    a way that privately written works are clearly excluded from the
    prohibition; accordingly, a saving clause becomes superfluous.
      Retention of a saving clause has been urged on the ground that
    the present statutory provision is frequently cited, and that
    having the provision expressly stated in the law would avoid
    questions and explanations. The committee here observes: (1) there
    is nothing in section 105 that would relieve the Government of its
    obligation to secure permission in order to publish a copyrighted
    work; and (2) publication or other use by the Government of a
    private work would not affect its copyright protection in any way.
    The question of use of copyrighted material in documents published
    by the Congress and its Committees is discussed below in connection
    with section 107.
      Works of the United States Postal Service. The intent of section
    105 [this section] is to restrict the prohibition against
    Government copyright to works written by employees of the United
    States Government within the scope of their official duties. In
    accordance with the objectives of the Postal Reorganization Act of
    1970 [Pub. L. 91-375, which enacted title 39, Postal Service], this
    section does not apply to works created by employees of the United
    States Postal Service. In addition to enforcing the criminal
    statutes proscribing the forgery or counterfeiting of postage
    stamps, the Postal Service could, if it chooses, use the copyright
    law to prevent the reproduction of postage stamp designs for
    private or commercial non-postal services (for example, in
    philatelic publications and catalogs, in general advertising, in
    art reproductions, in textile designs, and so forth). However, any
    copyright claimed by the Postal Service in its works, including
    postage stamp designs, would be subject to the same conditions,
    formalities, and time limits as other copyrightable works.

      General Scope of Copyright. The five fundamental rights that the
    bill gives to copyright owners - the exclusive rights of
    reproduction, adaptation, publication, performance, and display -
    are stated generally in section 106. These exclusive rights, which
    comprise the so-called "bundle of rights" that is a copyright, are
    cumulative and may overlap in some cases. Each of the five
    enumerated rights may be subdivided indefinitely and, as discussed
    below in connection with section 201, each subdivision of an
    exclusive right may be owned and enforced separately.
      The approach of the bill is to set forth the copyright owner's
    exclusive rights in broad terms in section 106, and then to provide
    various limitations, qualifications, or exemptions in the 12
    sections that follow. Thus, everything in section 106 is made
    "subject to sections 107 through 118", and must be read in
    conjunction with those provisions.
      The exclusive rights accorded to a copyright owner under section
    106 are "to do and to authorize" any of the activities specified in
    the five numbered clauses. Use of the phrase "to authorize" is
    intended to avoid any questions as to the liability of contributory
    infringers. For example, a person who lawfully acquires an
    authorized copy of a motion picture would be an infringer if he or
    she engages in the business of renting it to others for purposes of
    unauthorized public performance.
      Rights of Reproduction, Adaptation, and Publication. The first
    three clauses of section 106, which cover all rights under a
    copyright except those of performance and display, extend to every
    kind of copyrighted work. The exclusive rights encompassed by these
    clauses, though closely related, are independent; they can
    generally be characterized as rights of copying, recording,
    adaptation, and publishing. A single act of infringement may
    violate all of these rights at once, as where a publisher
    reproduces, adapts, and sells copies of a person's copyrighted work
    as part of a publishing venture. Infringement takes place when any
    one of the rights is violated: where, for example, a printer
    reproduces copies without selling them or a retailer sells copies
    without having anything to do with their reproduction. The
    references to "copies or phonorecords," although in the plural, are
    intended here and throughout the bill to include the singular (1
    U.S.C. Sec. 1).
      Reproduction. - Read together with the relevant definitions in
    section 101, the right "to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies
    or phonorecords" means the right to produce a material object in
    which the work is duplicated, transcribed, imitated, or simulated
    in a fixed form from which it can be "perceived, reproduced, or
    otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a
    machine or device." As under the present law, a copyrighted work
    would be infringed by reproducing it in whole or in any substantial
    part, and by duplicating it exactly or by imitation or simulation.
    Wide departures or variations from the copyrighted work would still
    be an infringement as long as the author's "expression" rather than
    merely the author's "ideas" are taken. An exception to this general
    principle, applicable to the reproduction of copyrighted sound
    recordings, is specified in section 114.
      "Reproduction" under clause (1) of section 106 is to be
    distinguished from "display" under clause (5). For a work to be
    "reproduced," its fixation in tangible form must be "sufficiently
    permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or
    otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory
    duration." Thus, the showing of images on a screen or tube would
    not be a violation of clause (1), although it might come within the
    scope of clause (5).
      Preparation of Derivative Works. - The exclusive right to prepare
    derivative works, specified separately in clause (2) of section
    106, overlaps the exclusive right of reproduction to some extent.
    It is broader than that right, however, in the sense that
    reproduction requires fixation in copies or phonorecords, whereas
    the preparation of a derivative work, such as a ballet, pantomime,
    or improvised performance, may be an infringement even though
    nothing is ever fixed in tangible form.
      To be an infringement the "derivative work" must be "based upon
    the copyrighted work," and the definition in section 101 refers to
    "a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
    fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art
    reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which
    a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted." Thus, to constitute
    a violation of section 106(2), the infringing work must incorporate
    a portion of the copyrighted work in some form; for example, a
    detailed commentary on a work or a programmatic musical composition
    inspired by a novel would not normally constitute infringements
    under this clause.
      Use in Information Storage and Retrieval Systems. - As section
    117 declares explicitly, the bill is not intended to alter the
    present law with respect to the use of copyrighted works in
    computer systems.
      Public Distribution. - Clause (3) of section 106 establishes the
    exclusive right of publication: The right "to distribute copies or
    phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other
    transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending." Under this
    provision the copyright owner would have the right to control the
    first public distribution of an authorized copy or phonorecord of
    his work, whether by sale, gift, loan, or some rental or lease
    arrangement. Likewise, any unauthorized public distribution of
    copies or phonorecords that were unlawfully made would be an
    infringement. As section 109 makes clear, however, the copyright
    owner's rights under section 106(3) cease with respect to a
    particular copy or phonorecord once he has parted with ownership of
    it.
      Rights of Public Performance and Display. Performing Rights and
    the "For Profit" Limitation. - The right of public performance
    under section 106(4) extends to "literary, musical, dramatic, and
    choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other
    audiovisual works and sound recordings" and, unlike the equivalent
    provisions now in effect, is not limited by any "for profit"
    requirement. The approach of the bill, as in many foreign laws, is
    first to state the public performance right in broad terms, and
    then to provide specific exemptions for educational and other
    nonprofit uses.
      This approach is more reasonable than the outright exemption of
    the 1909 statute. The line between commercial and "nonprofit"
    organizations is increasingly difficult to draw. Many "non-profit"
    organizations are highly subsidized and capable of paying
    royalties, and the widespread public exploitation of copyrighted
    works by public broadcasters and other noncommercial organizations
    is likely to grow. In addition to these trends, it is worth noting
    that performances and displays are continuing to supplant markets
    for printed copies and that in the future a broad "not for profit"
    exemption could not only hurt authors but could dry up their
    incentive to write.
      The exclusive right of public performance is expanded to include
    not only motion pictures, including works recorded on film, video
    tape, and video disks, but also audiovisual works such as
    filmstrips and sets of slides. This provision of section 106(4),
    which is consistent with the assimilation of motion pictures to
    audiovisual works throughout the bill, is also related to
    amendments of the definitions of "display" and "perform" discussed
    below. The important issue of performing rights in sound recordings
    is discussed in connection with section 114.
      Right of Public Display. - Clause (5) of section 106 represents
    the first explicit statutory recognition in American copyright law
    of an exclusive right to show a copyrighted work, or an image of
    it, to the public. The existence or extent of this right under the
    present statute is uncertain and subject to challenge. The bill
    would give the owners of copyright in "literary, musical, dramatic,
    and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or
    sculptural works", including the individual images of a motion
    picture or other audiovisual work, the exclusive right "to display
    the copyrighted work publicly."
      Definitions. Under the definitions of "perform," "display,"
    "publicly," and "transmit" in section 101, the concepts of public
    performance and public display cover not only the initial rendition
    or showing, but also any further act by which that rendition or
    showing is transmitted or communicated to the public. Thus, for
    example: a singer is performing when he or she sings a song; a
    broadcasting network is performing when it transmits his or her
    performance (whether simultaneously or from records); a local
    broadcaster is performing when it transmits the network broadcast;
    a cable television system is performing when it retransmits the
    broadcast to its subscribers; and any individual is performing
    whenever he or she plays a phonorecord embodying the performance or
    communicates the performance by turning on a receiving set.
    Although any act by which the initial performance or display is
    transmitted, repeated, or made to recur would itself be a
    "performance" or "display" under the bill, it would not be
    actionable as an infringement unless it were done "publicly," as
    defined in section 101. Certain other performances and displays, in
    addition to those that are "private," are exempted or given
    qualified copyright control under sections 107 through 118.
      To "perform" a work, under the definition in section 101,
    includes reading a literary work aloud, singing or playing music,
    dancing a ballet or other choreographic work, and acting out a
    dramatic work or pantomime. A performance may be accomplished
    "either directly or by means of any device or process," including
    all kinds of equipment for reproducing or amplifying sounds or
    visual images, any sort of transmitting apparatus, any type of
    electronic retrieval system, and any other techniques and systems
    not yet in use or even invented.
      The definition of "perform" in relation to "a motion picture or
    other audiovisual work" is "to show its images in any sequence or
    to make the sounds accompanying it audible." The showing of
    portions of a motion picture, filmstrip, or slide set must
    therefore be sequential to constitute a "performance" rather than a
    "display", but no particular order need be maintained. The purely
    aural performance of a motion picture sound track, or of the sound
    portions of an audiovisual work, would constitute a performance of
    the "motion picture or other audiovisual work"; but, where some of
    the sounds have been reproduced separately on phonorecords, a
    performance from the phonorecord would not constitute performance
    of the motion picture or audiovisual work.
      The corresponding definition of "display" covers any showing of a
    "copy" of the work, "either directly or by means of a film, slide,
    television image, or any other device or process." Since "copies"
    are defined as including the material object "in which the work is
    first fixed," the right of public display applies to original works
    of art as well as to reproductions of them. With respect to motion
    pictures and other audiovisual works, it is a "display" (rather
    than a "performance") to show their "individual images
    nonsequentially." In addition to the direct showings of a copy of a
    work, "display" would include the projection of an image on a
    screen or other surface by any method, the transmission of an image
    by electronic or other means, and the showing of an image on a
    cathode ray tube, or similar viewing apparatus connected with any
    sort of information storage and retrieval system.
      Under clause (1) of the definition of "publicly" in section 101,
    a performance or display is "public" if it takes place "at a place
    open to the public or at any place where a substantial number of
    persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social
    acquaintances is gathered." One of the principal purposes of the
    definition was to make clear that, contrary to the decision in
    Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Distributing Corp. v. Wyatt, 21 C.O.Bull. 203
    (D.Md.1932), performances in "semipublic" places such as clubs,
    lodges, factories, summer camps, and schools are "public
    performances" subject to copyright control. The term "a family" in
    this context would include an individual living alone, so that a
    gathering confined to the individual's social acquaintances would
    normally be regarded as private. Routine meetings of businesses and
    governmental personnel would be excluded because they do not
    represent the gathering of a "substantial number of persons."
      Clause (2) of the definition of "publicly" in section 101 makes
    clear that the concepts of public performance and public display
    include not only performances and displays that occur initially in
    a public place, but also acts that transmit or otherwise
    communicate a performance or display of the work to the public by
    means of any device or process. The definition of "transmit" - to
    communicate a performance or display "by any device or process
    whereby images or sound are received beyond the place from which
    they are sent" - is broad enough to include all conceivable forms
    and combinations of wired or wireless communications media,
    including but by no means limited to radio and television
    broadcasting as we know them. Each and every method by which the
    images or sounds comprising a performance or display are picked up
    and conveyed is a "transmission," and if the transmission reaches
    the public in my [any] form, the case comes within the scope of
    clauses (4) or (5) of section 106.
      Under the bill, as under the present law, a performance made
    available by transmission to the public at large is "public" even
    though the recipients are not gathered in a single place, and even
    if there is no proof that any of the potential recipients was
    operating his receiving apparatus at the time of the transmission.
    The same principles apply whenever the potential recipients of the
    transmission represent a limited segment of the public, such as the
    occupants of hotel rooms or the subscribers of a cable television
    service. Clause (2) of the definition of "publicly" is applicable
    "whether the members of the public capable of receiving the
    performance or display receive it in the same place or in separate
    places and at the same time or at different times."

      (a) Rights of Attribution and Integrity. - Subject to section 107
    and independent of the exclusive rights provided in section 106,
    the author of a work of visual art - 
        (1) shall have the right - 
          (A) to claim authorship of that work, and
          (B) to prevent the use of his or her name as the author of
        any work of visual art which he or she did not create;

        (2) shall have the right to prevent the use of his or her name
      as the author of the work of visual art in the event of a
      distortion, mutilation, or other modification of the work which
      would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation; and
        (3) subject to the limitations set forth in section 113(d),
      shall have the right - 
          (A) to prevent any intentional distortion, mutilation, or
        other modification of that work which would be prejudicial to
        his or her honor or reputation, and any intentional distortion,
        mutilation, or modification of that work is a violation of that
        right, and
          (B) to prevent any destruction of a work of recognized
        stature, and any intentional or grossly negligent destruction
        of that work is a violation of that right.

      (b) Scope and Exercise of Rights. - Only the author of a work of
    visual art has the rights conferred by subsection (a) in that work,
    whether or not the author is the copyright owner. The authors of a
    joint work of visual art are coowners of the rights conferred by
    subsection (a) in that work.
      (c) Exceptions. - (1) The modification of a work of visual art
    which is a result of the passage of time or the inherent nature of
    the materials is not a distortion, mutilation, or other
    modification described in subsection (a)(3)(A).
      (2) The modification of a work of visual art which is the result
    of conservation, or of the public presentation, including lighting
    and placement, of the work is not a destruction, distortion,
    mutilation, or other modification described in subsection (a)(3)
    unless the modification is caused by gross negligence.
      (3) The rights described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection
    (a) shall not apply to any reproduction, depiction, portrayal, or
    other use of a work in, upon, or in any connection with any item
    described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of the definition of "work of
    visual art" in section 101, and any such reproduction, depiction,
    portrayal, or other use of a work is not a destruction, distortion,
    mutilation, or other modification described in paragraph (3) of
    subsection (a).
      (d) Duration of Rights. - (1) With respect to works of visual art
    created on or after the effective date set forth in section 610(a)
    of the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990, the rights conferred by
    subsection (a) shall endure for a term consisting of the life of
    the author.
      (2) With respect to works of visual art created before the
    effective date set forth in section 610(a) of the Visual Artists
    Rights Act of 1990, but title to which has not, as of such
    effective date, been transferred from the author, the rights
    conferred by subsection (a) shall be coextensive with, and shall
    expire at the same time as, the rights conferred by section 106.
      (3) In the case of a joint work prepared by two or more authors,
    the rights conferred by subsection (a) shall endure for a term
    consisting of the life of the last surviving author.
      (4) All terms of the rights conferred by subsection (a) run to
    the end of the calendar year in which they would otherwise expire.
      (e) Transfer and Waiver. - (1) The rights conferred by subsection
    (a) may not be transferred, but those rights may be waived if the
    author expressly agrees to such waiver in a written instrument
    signed by the author. Such instrument shall specifically identify
    the work, and uses of that work, to which the waiver applies, and
    the waiver shall apply only to the work and uses so identified. In
    the case of a joint work prepared by two or more authors, a waiver
    of rights under this paragraph made by one such author waives such
    rights for all such authors.
      (2) Ownership of the rights conferred by subsection (a) with
    respect to a work of visual art is distinct from ownership of any
    copy of that work, or of a copyright or any exclusive right under a
    copyright in that work. Transfer of ownership of any copy of a work
    of visual art, or of a copyright or any exclusive right under a
    copyright, shall not constitute a waiver of the rights conferred by
    subsection (a). Except as may otherwise be agreed by the author in
    a written instrument signed by the author, a waiver of the rights
    conferred by subsection (a) with respect to a work of visual art
    shall not constitute a transfer of ownership of any copy of that
    work, or of ownership of a copyright or of any exclusive right
    under a copyright in that work.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use

-STATUTE-
      Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair
    use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in
    copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that
    section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,
    teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use),
    scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In
    determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case
    is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include - 
        (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether
      such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
      educational purposes;
        (2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
        (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in
      relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
        (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or
      value of the copyrighted work.

    The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding
    of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the
    above factors.

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      General Background of the Problem. The judicial doctrine of fair
    use, one of the most important and well-established limitations on
    the exclusive right of copyright owners, would be given express
    statutory recognition for the first time in section 107. The claim
    that a defendant's acts constituted a fair use rather than an
    infringement has been raised as a defense in innumerable copyright
    actions over the years, and there is ample case law recognizing the
    existence of the doctrine and applying it. The examples enumerated
    at page 24 of the Register's 1961 Report, while by no means
    exhaustive, give some idea of the sort of activities the courts
    might regard as fair use under the circumstances: "quotation of
    excerpts in a review or criticism for purposes of illustration or
    comment; quotation of short passages in a scholarly or technical
    work, for illustration or clarification of the author's
    observations; use in a parody of some of the content of the work
    parodied; summary of an address or article, with brief quotations,
    in a news report; reproduction by a library of a portion of a work
    to replace part of a damaged copy; reproduction by a teacher or
    student of a small part of a work to illustrate a lesson;
    reproduction of a work in legislative or judicial proceedings or
    reports; incidental and fortuitous reproduction, in a newsreel or
    broadcast, of a work located in the scene of an event being
    reported."
      Although the courts have considered and ruled upon the fair use
    doctrine over and over again, no real definition of the concept has
    ever emerged. Indeed, since the doctrine is an equitable rule of
    reason, no generally applicable definition is possible, and each
    case raising the question must be decided on its own facts. On the
    other hand, the courts have evolved a set of criteria which, though
    in no case definitive or determinative, provide some gauge for
    balancing the equities. These criteria have been stated in various
    ways, but essentially they can all be reduced to the four standards
    which have been adopted in section 107: "(1) the purpose and
    character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial
    nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the nature of
    the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the
    portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
    (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of
    the copyrighted work."
      These criteria are relevant in determining whether the basic
    doctrine of fair use, as stated in the first sentence of section
    107, applies in a particular case: "Notwithstanding the provisions
    of section 106, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such
    use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means
    specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment,
    news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom
    use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of
    copyright."
      The specific wording of section 107 as it now stands is the
    result of a process of accretion, resulting from the long
    controversy over the related problems of fair use and the
    reproduction (mostly by photocopying) of copyrighted material for
    educational and scholarly purposes. For example, the reference to
    fair use "by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other
    means" is mainly intended to make clear that the doctrine has as
    much application to photocopying and taping as to older forms of
    use; it is not intended to give these kinds of reproduction any
    special status under the fair use provision or to sanction any
    reproduction beyond the normal and reasonable limits of fair use.
    Similarly, the newly-added reference to "multiple copies for
    classroom use" is a recognition that, under the proper
    circumstances of fairness, the doctrine can be applied to
    reproductions of multiple copies for the members of a class.
      The Committee has amended the first of the criteria to be
    considered - "the purpose and character of the use" - to state
    explicitly that this factor includes a consideration of "whether
    such use is of a commercial nature or is for non-profit educational
    purposes." This amendment is not intended to be interpreted as any
    sort of not-for-profit limitation on educational uses of
    copyrighted works. It is an express recognition that, as under the
    present law, the commercial or non-profit character of an activity,
    while not conclusive with respect to fair use, can and should be
    weighed along with other factors in fair use decisions.
      General Intention Behind the Provision. The statement of the fair
    use doctrine in section 107 offers some guidance to users in
    determining when the principles of the doctrine apply. However, the
    endless variety of situations and combinations of circumstances
    that can rise in particular cases precludes the formulation of
    exact rules in the statute. The bill endorses the purpose and
    general scope of the judicial doctrine of fair use, but there is no
    disposition to freeze the doctrine in the statute, especially
    during a period of rapid technological change. Beyond a very broad
    statutory explanation of what fair use is and some of the criteria
    applicable to it, the courts must be free to adapt the doctrine to
    particular situations on a case-by-case basis. Section 107 is
    intended to restate the present judicial doctrine of fair use, not
    to change, narrow, or enlarge it in any way.
      Intention as to Classroom Reproduction. Although the works and
    uses to which the doctrine of fair use is applicable are as broad
    as the copyright law itself, most of the discussion of section 107
    has centered around questions of classroom reproduction,
    particularly photocopying. The arguments on the question are
    summarized at pp. 30-31 of this Committee's 1967 report (H.R. Rep.
    No. 83, 90th Cong., 1st Sess.), and have not changed materially in
    the intervening years.
      The Committee also adheres to its earlier conclusion, that "a
    specific exemption freeing certain reproductions of copyrighted
    works for educational and scholarly purposes from copyright control
    is not justified." At the same time the Committee recognizes, as it
    did in 1967, that there is a "need for greater certainty and
    protection for teachers." In an effort to meet this need the
    Committee has not only adopted further amendments to section 107,
    but has also amended section 504(c) to provide innocent teachers
    and other non-profit users of copyrighted material with broad
    insulation against unwarranted liability for infringement. The
    latter amendments are discussed below in connection with Chapter 5
    of the bill [Sec. 501 et seq. of this title].
      In 1967 the Committee also sought to approach this problem by
    including, in its report, a very thorough discussion of "the
    considerations lying behind the four criteria listed in the amended
    section 107, in the context of typical classroom situations arising
    today." This discussion appeared on pp. 32-35 of the 1967 report,
    and with some changes has been retained in the Senate report on S.
    22 (S. Rep. No. 94-473, pp. 63-65). The Committee has reviewed this
    discussion, and considers that it still has value as an analysis of
    various aspects of the problem.
      At the Judiciary Subcommittee hearings in June 1975, Chairman
    Kastenmeier and other members urged the parties to meet together
    independently in an effort to achieve a meeting of the minds as to
    permissible educational uses of copyrighted material. The response
    to these suggestions was positive, and a number of meetings of
    three groups, dealing respectively with classroom reproduction of
    printed material, music, and audio-visual material, were held
    beginning in September 1975.
      In a joint letter to Chairman Kastenmeier, dated March 19, 1976,
    the representatives of the Ad Hoc Committee of Educational
    Institutions and Organizations on Copyright Law Revision, and of
    the Authors League of America, Inc., and the Association of
    American Publishers, Inc., stated:
        You may remember that in our letter of March 8, 1976 we told
      you that the negotiating teams representing authors and
      publishers and the Ad Hoc Group had reached tentative agreement
      on guidelines to insert in the Committee Report covering
      educational copying from books and periodicals under Section 107
      of H.R. 2223 and S. 22 [this section], and that as part of that
      tentative agreement each side would accept the amendments to
      Sections 107 and 504 [this section and section 504 of this title]
      which were adopted by your Subcommittee on March 3, 1976.
        We are now happy to tell you that the agreement has been
      approved by the principals and we enclose a copy herewith. We had
      originally intended to translate the agreement into language
      suitable for inclusion in the legislative report dealing with
      Section 107 [this section], but we have since been advised by
      committee staff that this will not be necessary.
        As stated above, the agreement refers only to copying from
      books and periodicals, and it is not intended to apply to musical
      or audiovisual works.

      The full text of the agreement is as follows:

      AGREEMENT ON GUIDELINES FOR CLASSROOM COPYING IN NOT-FOR-PROFIT
                         EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS

                   WITH RESPECT TO BOOKS AND PERIODICALS               
        The purpose of the following guidelines is to state the minimum
      and not the maximum standards of educational fair use under
      Section 107 of H.R. 2223 [this section]. The parties agree that
      the conditions determining the extent of permissible copying for
      educational purposes may change in the future; that certain types
      of copying permitted under these guidelines may not be
      permissible in the future; and conversely that in the future
      other types of copying not permitted under these guidelines may
      be permissible under revised guidelines.
        Moreover, the following statement of guidelines is not intended
      to limit the types of copying permitted under the standards of
      fair use under judicial decision and which are stated in Section
      107 of the Copyright Revision Bill [this section]. There may be
      instances in which copying which does not fall within the
      guidelines stated below may nonetheless be permitted under the
      criteria of fair use.

                                GUIDELINES                            
      I. Single Copying for Teachers

        A single copy may be made of any of the following by or for a
      teacher at his or her individual request for his or her scholarly
      research or use in teaching or preparation to teach a class:
        A. A chapter from a book;
        B. An article from a periodical or newspaper;
        C. A short story, short essay or short poem, whether or not
      from a collective work;
        D. A chart, graph, diagram, drawing, cartoon or picture from a
      book, periodical, or newspaper;

      II. Multiple Copies for Classroom Use

        Multiple copies (not to exceed in any event more than one copy
      per pupil in a course) may be made by or for the teacher giving
      the course for classroom use or discussion; provided that:
        A. The copying meets the tests of brevity and spontaneity as
      defined below; and,
        B. Meets the cumulative effect test as defined below; and
        C. Each copy includes a notice of copyright.

      Definitions
          Brevity
        (i) Poetry: (a) A complete poem if less than 250 words and if
      printed on not more than two pages or, (b) from a longer poem, an
      excerpt of not more than 250 words.
        (ii) Prose: (a) Either a complete article, story or essay of
      less than 2,500 words, or (b) an excerpt from any prose work of
      not more than 1,000 words or 10% of the work, whichever is less,
      but in any event a minimum of 500 words.
        [Each of the numerical limits stated in "i" and "ii" above may
      be expanded to permit the completion of an unfinished line of a
      poem or of an unfinished prose paragraph.]
        (iii) Illustration: One chart, graph, diagram, drawing, cartoon
      or picture per book or per periodical issue.
        (iv) "Special" works: Certain works in poetry, prose or in
      "poetic prose" which often combine language with illustrations
      and which are intended sometimes for children and at other times
      for a more general audience fall short of 2,500 words in their
      entirety. Paragraph "ii" above notwithstanding such "special
      works" may not be reproduced in their entirety; however, an
      excerpt comprising not more than two of the published pages of
      such special work and containing not more than 10% of the words
      found in the text thereof, may be reproduced.

          Spontaneity
        (i) The copying is at the instance and inspiration of the
      individual teacher, and
        (ii) The inspiration and decision to use the work and the
      moment of its use for maximum teaching effectiveness are so close
      in time that it would be unreasonable to expect a timely reply to

                                          Chairman, Copyright Committee.

      In a joint letter dated April 30, 1976, representatives of the
    Music Publishers' Association of the United States, Inc., the
    National Music Publishers' Association, Inc., the Music Teachers
    National Association, the Music Educators National Conference, the
    National Association of Schools of Music, and the Ad Hoc Committee
    on Copyright Law Revision, wrote to Chairman Kastenmeier as
    follows:
        During the hearings on H.R. 2223 in June 1975, you and several
      of your subcommittee members suggested that concerned groups
      should work together in developing guidelines which would be
      helpful to clarify Section 107 of the bill [this section].
        Representatives of music educators and music publishers delayed
      their meetings until guidelines had been developed relative to
      books and periodicals. Shortly after that work was completed and
      those guidelines were forwarded to your subcommittee,
      representatives of the undersigned music organizations met
      together with representatives of the Ad Hoc Committee on
      Copyright Law Revision to draft guidelines relative to music.
        We are very pleased to inform you that the discussions thus
      have been fruitful on the guidelines which have been developed.
      Since private music teachers are an important factor in music
      education, due consideration has been given to the concerns of
      that group.
        We trust that this will be helpful in the report on the bill to
      clarify Fair Use as it applies to music.
      The text of the guidelines accompanying this letter is as
    follows:

                 GUIDELINES FOR EDUCATIONAL USES OF MUSIC             
        The purpose of the following guidelines is to state the minimum
      and not the maximum standards of educational fair use under
      Section 107 of H.R. 2223 [this section]. The parties agree that
      the conditions determining the extent of permissible copying for
      educational purposes may change in the future; that certain types
      of copying permitted under these guidelines may not be
      permissible in the future, and conversely that in the future
      other types of copying not permitted under these guidelines may
      be permissible under revised guidelines.
        Moreover, the following statement of guidelines is not intended
      to limit the types of copying permitted under the standards of
      fair use under judicial decision and which are stated in Section
      107 of the Copyright Revision Bill [this section]. There may be
      instances in which copying which does not fall within the
      guidelines stated below may nonetheless be permitted under the
      criteria of fair use.

      A. Permissible Uses

        1. Emergency copying to replace purchased copies which for any
      reason are not available for an imminent performance provided
      purchased replacement copies shall be substituted in due course.
        2. (a) For academic purposes other than performance, multiple
      copies of excerpts of works may be made, provided that the
      excerpts do not comprise a part of the whole which would
      constitute a performable unit such as a section, movement or
      aria, but in no case more than 10% of the whole work. The number
      of copies shall not exceed one copy per pupil.
        (b) For academic purposes other than performance, a single copy
      of an entire performable unit (section, movement, aria, etc.)
      that is, (1) confirmed by the copyright proprietor to be out of
      print or (2) unavailable except in a larger work, may be made by
      or for a teacher solely for the purpose of his or her scholarly
      research or in preparation to teach a class.
        3. Printed copies which have been purchased may be edited or
      simplified provided that the fundamental character of the work is
      not distorted or the lyrics, if any, altered or lyrics added if
      none exist.
        4. A single copy of recordings of performances by students may
      be made for evaluation or rehearsal purposes and may be retained
      by the educational institution or individual teacher.
        5. A single copy of a sound recording (such as a tape, disc or
      cassette) of copyrighted music may be made from sound recordings
      owned by an educational institution or an individual teacher for
      the purpose of constructing aural exercises or examinations and
      may be retained by the educational institution or individual
      teacher. (This pertains only to the copyright of the music itself
      and not to any copyright which may exist in the sound recording.)

      B. Prohibitions

        1. Copying to create or replace or substitute for anthologies,
      compilations or collective works.
        2. Copying of or from works intended to be "consumable" in the
      course of study or of teaching such as workbooks, exercises,
      standardized tests and answer sheets and like material.
        3. Copying for the purpose of performance, except as in A(1)
      above.
        4. Copying for the purpose of substituting for the purchase of
      music, except as in A(1) and A(2) above.
        5. Copying without inclusion of the copyright notice which
      appears on the printed copy.
      The problem of off-the-air taping for nonprofit classroom use of
    copyrighted audiovisual works incorporated in radio and television
    broadcasts has proved to be difficult to resolve. The Committee
    believes that the fair use doctrine has some limited application in
    this area, but it appears that the development of detailed
    guidelines will require a more thorough exploration than has so far
    been possible of the needs and problems of a number of different
    interests affected, and of the various legal problems presented.
    Nothing in section 107 or elsewhere in the bill is intended to
    change or prejudge the law on the point. On the other hand, the
    Committee is sensitive to the importance of the problem, and urges
    the representatives of the various interests, if possible under the
    leadership of the Register of Copyrights, to continue their
    discussions actively and in a constructive spirit. If it would be
    helpful to a solution, the Committee is receptive to undertaking
    further consideration of the problem in a future Congress.
      The Committee appreciates and commends the efforts and the
    cooperative and reasonable spirit of the parties who achieved the
    agreed guidelines on books and periodicals and on music.
    Representatives of the American Association of University
    Professors and of the Association of American Law Schools have
    written to the Committee strongly criticizing the guidelines,
    particularly with respect to multiple copying, as being too
    restrictive with respect to classroom situations at the university
    and graduate level. However, the Committee notes that the Ad Hoc
    group did include representatives of higher education, that the
    stated "purpose of the * * * guidelines is to state the minimum and
    not the maximum standards of educational fair use" and that the
    agreement acknowledges "there may be instances in which copying
    which does not fall within the guidelines * * * may nonetheless be
    permitted under the criteria of fair use."
      The Committee believes the guidelines are a reasonable
    interpretation of the minimum standards of fair use. Teachers will
    know that copying within the guidelines is fair use. Thus, the
    guidelines serve the purpose of fulfilling the need for greater
    certainty and protection for teachers. The Committee expresses the
    hope that if there are areas where standards other than these
    guidelines may be appropriate, the parties will continue their
    efforts to provide additional specific guidelines in the same
    spirit of good will and give and take that has marked the
    discussion of this subject in recent months.
      Reproduction and Uses for Other Purposes. The concentrated
    attention given the fair use provision in the context of classroom
    teaching activities should not obscure its application in other
    areas. It must be emphasized again that the same general standards
    of fair use are applicable to all kinds of uses of copyrighted
    material, although the relative weight to be given them will differ
    from case to case.
      The fair use doctrine would be relevant to the use of excerpts
    from copyrighted works in educational broadcasting activities not
    exempted under section 110(2) or 112, and not covered by the
    licensing provisions of section 118. In these cases the factors to
    be weighed in applying the criteria of this section would include
    whether the performers, producers, directors, and others
    responsible for the broadcast were paid, the size and nature of the
    audience, the size and number of excerpts taken and, in the case of
    recordings made for broadcast, the number of copies reproduced and
    the extent of their reuse or exchange. The availability of the fair
    use doctrine to educational broadcasters would be narrowly
    circumscribed in the case of motion pictures and other audiovisual
    works, but under appropriate circumstances it could apply to the
    nonsequential showing of an individual still or slide, or to the
    performance of a short excerpt from a motion picture for criticism
    or comment.
      Another special instance illustrating the application of the fair
    use doctrine pertains to the making of copies or phonorecords of
    works in the special forms needed for the use of blind persons.
    These special forms, such as copies in Braille and phonorecords of
    oral readings (talking books), are not usually made by the
    publishers for commercial distribution. For the most part, such
    copies and phonorecords are made by the Library of Congress'
    Division for the Blind and Physically Handicapped with permission
    obtained from the copyright owners, and are circulated to blind
    persons through regional libraries covering the nation. In
    addition, such copies and phonorecords are made locally by
    individual volunteers for the use of blind persons in their
    communities, and the Library of Congress conducts a program for
    training such volunteers. While the making of multiple copies or
    phonorecords of a work for general circulation requires the
    permission of the copyright owner, a problem addressed in section
    710 of the bill, the making of a single copy or phonorecord by an
    individual as a free service for blind persons would properly be
    considered a fair use under section 107.
      A problem of particular urgency is that of preserving for
    posterity prints of motion pictures made before 1942. Aside from
    the deplorable fact that in a great many cases the only existing
    copy of a film has been deliberately destroyed, those that remain
    are in immediate danger of disintegration; they were printed on
    film stock with a nitrate base that will inevitably decompose in
    time. The efforts of the Library of Congress, the American Film
    Institute, and other organizations to rescue and preserve this
    irreplaceable contribution to our cultural life are to be
    applauded, and the making of duplicate copies for purposes of
    archival preservation certainly falls within the scope of "fair
    use."
      When a copyrighted work contains unfair, inaccurate, or
    derogatory information concerning an individual or institution, the
    individual or institution may copy and reproduce such parts of the
    work as are necessary to permit understandable comment on the
    statements made in the work.
      The Committee has considered the question of publication, in
    Congressional hearings and documents, of copyrighted material.
    Where the length of the work or excerpt published and the number of
    copies authorized are reasonable under the circumstances, and the
    work itself is directly relevant to a matter of legitimate
    legislative concern, the Committee believes that the publication
    would constitute fair use.
      During the consideration of the revision bill in the 94th
    Congress it was proposed that independent newsletters, as
    distinguished from house organs and publicity or advertising
    publications, be given separate treatment. It is argued that
    newsletters are particularly vulnerable to mass photocopying, and
    that most newsletters have fairly modest circulations. Whether the
    copying of portions of a newsletter is an act of infringement or a
    fair use will necessarily turn on the facts of the individual case.
    However, as a general principle, it seems clear that the scope of
    the fair use doctrine should be considerably narrower in the case
    of newsletters than in that of either mass-circulation periodicals
    or scientific journals. The commercial nature of the user is a
    significant factor in such cases: Copying by a profit-making user
    of even a small portion of a newsletter may have a significant
    impact on the commercial market for the work.
      The Committee has examined the use of excerpts from copyrighted
    works in the art work of calligraphers. The committee believes that
    a single copy reproduction of an excerpt from a copyrighted work by
    a calligrapher for a single client does not represent an
    infringement of copyright. Likewise, a single reproduction of
    excerpts from a copyrighted work by a student calligrapher or
    teacher in a learning situation would be a fair use of the
    copyrighted work.
      The Register of Copyrights has recommended that the committee
    report describe the relationship between this section and the
    provisions of section 108 relating to reproduction by libraries and
    archives. The doctrine of fair use applies to library photocopying,
    and nothing contained in section 108 "in any way affects the right
    of fair use." No provision of section 108 is intended to take away
    any rights existing under the fair use doctrine. To the contrary,
    section 108 authorizes certain photocopying practices which may not
    qualify as a fair use.
      The criteria of fair use are necessarily set forth in general
    terms. In the application of the criteria of fair use to specific
    photocopying practices of libraries, it is the intent of this
    legislation to provide an appropriate balancing of the rights of
    creators, and the needs of users.

    TITLE 17 - COPYRIGHTS
    CHAPTER 1 - SUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE OF COPYRIGHT

-HEAD-
    Sec. 108. Limitations on exclusive rights: Reproduction by
      libraries and archives

-STATUTE-
      (a) Except as otherwise provided in this title and
    notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is not an
    infringement of copyright for a library or archives, or any of its
    employees acting within the scope of their employment, to reproduce
    no more than one copy or phonorecord of a work, except as provided
    in subsections (b) and (c), or to distribute such copy or
    phonorecord, under the conditions specified by this section, if - 
        (1) the reproduction or distribution is made without any
      purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage;
        (2) the collections of the library or archives are (i) open to
      the public, or (ii) available not only to researchers affiliated
      with the library or archives or with the institution of which it
      is a part, but also to other persons doing research in a
      specialized field; and
        (3) the reproduction or distribution of the work includes a
      notice of copyright that appears on the copy or phonorecord that
      is reproduced under the provisions of this section, or includes a
      legend stating that the work may be protected by copyright if no
      such notice can be found on the copy or phonorecord that is
      reproduced under the provisions of this section.

      (b) The rights of reproduction and distribution under this
    section apply to three copies or phonorecords of an unpublished
    work duplicated solely for purposes of preservation and security or
    for deposit for research use in another library or archives of the
    type described by clause (2) of subsection (a), if - 
        (1) the copy or phonorecord reproduced is currently in the
      collections of the library or archives; and
        (2) any such copy or phonorecord that is reproduced in digital
      format is not otherwise distributed in that format and is not
      made available to the public in that format outside the premises
      of the library or archives.

      (c) The right of reproduction under this section applies to three
    copies or phonorecords of a published work duplicated solely for
    the purpose of replacement of a copy or phonorecord that is
    damaged, deteriorating, lost, or stolen, or if the existing format
    in which the work is stored has become obsolete, if - 
        (1) the library or archives has, after a reasonable effort,
      determined that an unused replacement cannot be obtained at a
      fair price; and
        (2) any such copy or phonorecord that is reproduced in digital
      format is not made available to the public in that format outside
      the premises of the library or archives in lawful possession of
      such copy.

    For purposes of this subsection, a format shall be considered
    obsolete if the machine or device necessary to render perceptible a
    work stored in that format is no longer manufactured or is no
    longer reasonably available in the commercial marketplace.
      (d) The rights of reproduction and distribution under this
    section apply to a copy, made from the collection of a library or
    archives where the user makes his or her request or from that of
    another library or archives, of no more than one article or other
    contribution to a copyrighted collection or periodical issue, or to
    a copy or phonorecord of a small part of any other copyrighted
    work, if - 
        (1) the copy or phonorecord becomes the property of the user,
      and the library or archives has had no notice that the copy or
      phonorecord would be used for any purpose other than private
      study, scholarship, or research; and
        (2) the library or archives displays prominently, at the place
      where orders are accepted, and includes on its order form, a
      warning of copyright in accordance with requirements that the
      Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.

      (e) The rights of reproduction and distribution under this
    section apply to the entire work, or to a substantial part of it,
    made from the collection of a library or archives where the user
    makes his or her request or from that of another library or
    archives, if the library or archives has first determined, on the
    basis of a reasonable investigation, that a copy or phonorecord of
    the copyrighted work cannot be obtained at a fair price, if - 
        (1) the copy or phonorecord becomes the property of the user,
      and the library or archives has had no notice that the copy or
      phonorecord would be used for any purpose other than private
      study, scholarship, or research; and
        (2) the library or archives displays prominently, at the place
      where orders are accepted, and includes on its order form, a
      warning of copyright in accordance with requirements that the
      Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.

      (f) Nothing in this section - 
        (1) shall be construed to impose liability for copyright
      infringement upon a library or archives or its employees for the
      unsupervised use of reproducing equipment located on its
      premises: Provided, That such equipment displays a notice that
      the making of a copy may be subject to the copyright law;
        (2) excuses a person who uses such reproducing equipment or who
      requests a copy or phonorecord under subsection (d) from
      liability for copyright infringement for any such act, or for any
      later use of such copy or phonorecord, if it exceeds fair use as
      provided by section 107;
        (3) shall be construed to limit the reproduction and
      distribution by lending of a limited number of copies and
      excerpts by a library or archives of an audiovisual news program,
      subject to clauses (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (a); or
        (4) in any way affects the right of fair use as provided by
      section 107, or any contractual obligations assumed at any time
      by the library or archives when it obtained a copy or phonorecord
      of a work in its collections.

      (g) The rights of reproduction and distribution under this
    section extend to the isolated and unrelated reproduction or
    distribution of a single copy or phonorecord of the same material
    on separate occasions, but do not extend to cases where the library
    or archives, or its employee - 
        (1) is aware or has substantial reason to believe that it is
      engaging in the related or concerted reproduction or distribution
      of multiple copies or phonorecords of the same material, whether
      made on one occasion or over a period of time, and whether
      intended for aggregate use by one or more individuals or for
      separate use by the individual members of a group; or
        (2) engages in the systematic reproduction or distribution of
      single or multiple copies or phonorecords of material described
      in subsection (d): Provided, That nothing in this clause prevents
      a library or archives from participating in interlibrary
      arrangements that do not have, as their purpose or effect, that
      the library or archives receiving such copies or phonorecords for
      distribution does so in such aggregate quantities as to
      substitute for a subscription to or purchase of such work.

      (h)(1) For purposes of this section, during the last 20 years of
    any term of copyright of a published work, a library or archives,
    including a nonprofit educational institution that functions as
    such, may reproduce, distribute, display, or perform in facsimile
    or digital form a copy or phonorecord of such work, or portions
    thereof, for purposes of preservation, scholarship, or research, if
    such library or archives has first determined, on the basis of a
    reasonable investigation, that none of the conditions set forth in
    subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph (2) apply.
      (2) No reproduction, distribution, display, or performance is
    authorized under this subsection if - 
        (A) the work is subject to normal commercial exploitation;
        (B) a copy or phonorecord of the work can be obtained at a
      reasonable price; or
        (C) the copyright owner or its agent provides notice pursuant
      to regulations promulgated by the Register of Copyrights that
      either of the conditions set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B)
      applies.

      (3) The exemption provided in this subsection does not apply to
    any subsequent uses by users other than such library or archives.
      (i) The rights of reproduction and distribution under this
    section do not apply to a musical work, a pictorial, graphic or
    sculptural work, or a motion picture or other audiovisual work
    other than an audiovisual work dealing with news, except that no
    such limitation shall apply with respect to rights granted by
    subsections (b), (c), and (h), or with respect to pictorial or
    graphic works published as illustrations, diagrams, or similar
    adjuncts to works of which copies are reproduced or distributed in
    accordance with subsections (d) and (e).

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      Notwithstanding the exclusive rights of the owners of copyright,
    section 108 provides that under certain conditions it is not an
    infringement of copyright for a library or archives, or any of its
    employees acting within the scope of their employment, to reproduce
    or distribute not more than one copy or phonorecord of a work,
    provided (1) the reproduction or distribution is made without any
    purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage and (2) the
    collections of the library or archives are open to the public or
    available not only to researchers affiliated with the library or
    archives, but also to other persons doing research in a specialized
    field, and (3) the reproduction or distribution of the work
    includes a notice of copyright.
      Under this provision, a purely commercial enterprise could not
    establish a collection of copyrighted works, call itself a library
    or archive, and engage in for-profit reproduction and distribution
    of photocopies. Similarly, it would not be possible for a non-
    profit institution, by means of contractual arrangements with a
    commercial copying enterprise, to authorize the enterprise to carry
    out copying and distribution functions that would be exempt if
    conducted by the non-profit institution itself.
      The reference to "indirect commercial advantage" has raised
    questions as to the status of photocopying done by or for libraries
    or archival collections within industrial, profit-making, or
    proprietary institutions (such as the research and development
    departments of chemical, pharmaceutical, automobile, and oil
    corporations, the library of a proprietary hospital, the
    collections owned by a law or medical partnership, etc.).
      There is a direct interrelationship between this problem and the
    prohibitions against "multiple" and "systematic" photocopying in
    section 108(g)(1) and (2). Under section 108, a library in a
    profitmaking organization would not be authorized to:
        (a) use a single subscription or copy to supply its employees
      with multiple copies of material relevant to their work; or
        (b) use a single subscription or copy to supply its employees,
      on request, with single copies of material relevant to their
      work, where the arrangement is ''systematic" in the sense of
      deliberately substituting photocopying for subscription or
      purchase; or
        (c) use "interlibrary loan" arrangements for obtaining
      photocopies in such aggregate quantities as to substitute for
      subscriptions or purchase of material needed by employees in
      their work.
    Moreover, a library in a profit-making organization could not evade
    these obligations by installing reproducing equipment on its
    premises for unsupervised use by the organization's staff.
      Isolated, spontaneous making of single photocopies by a library
    in a for-profit organization, without any systematic effort to
    substitute photocopying for subscriptions or purchases, would be
    covered by section 108, even though the copies are furnished to the
    employees of the organization for use in their work. Similarly, for-
    profit libraries could participate in interlibrary arrangements
    for exchange of photocopies, as long as the reproduction or
    distribution was not "systematic." These activities, by themselves,
    would ordinarily not be considered "for direct or indirect
    commercial advantage," since the "advantage" referred to in this
    clause must attach to the immediate commercial motivation behind
    the reproduction or distribution itself, rather than to the
    ultimate profit-making motivation behind the enterprise in which
    the library is located. On the other hand, section 108 would not
    excuse reproduction or distribution if there were a commercial
    motive behind the actual making or distributing of the copies, if
    multiple copies were made or distributed, or if the photocopying
    activities were "systematic" in the sense that their aim was to
    substitute for subscriptions or purchases.
      The rights of reproduction and distribution under section 108
    apply in the following circumstances:
      Archival Reproduction. Subsection (b) authorizes the reproduction
    and distribution of a copy or phonorecord of an unpublished work
    duplicated in facsimile form solely for purposes of preservation
    and security, or for deposit for research use in another library or
    archives, if the copy or phonorecord reproduced is currently in the
    collections of the first library or archives. Only unpublished
    works could be reproduced under this exemption, but the right would
    extend to any type of work, including photographs, motion pictures
    and sound recordings. Under this exemption, for example, a
    repository could make photocopies of manuscripts by microfilm or
    electrostatic process, but could not reproduce the work in "machine-
    readable" language for storage in an information system.
      Replacement of Damaged Copy. Subsection (c) authorizes the
    reproduction of a published work duplicated in facsimile form
    solely for the purpose of replacement of a copy or phonorecord that
    is damaged, deteriorating, lost or stolen, if the library or
    archives has, after a reasonable effort, determined that an unused
    replacement cannot be obtained at a fair price. The scope and
    nature of a reasonable investigation to determine that an unused
    replacement cannot be obtained will vary according to the
    circumstances of a particular situation. It will always require
    recourse to commonly-known trade sources in the United States, and
    in the normal situation also to the publisher or other copyright
    owner (if such owner can be located at the address listed in the
    copyright registration), or an authorized reproducing service.
      Articles and Small Excerpts. Subsection (d) authorizes the
    reproduction and distribution of a copy of not more than one
    article or other contribution to a copyrighted collection or
    periodical issue, or of a copy or phonorecord of a small part of
    any other copyrighted work. The copy or phonorecord may be made by
    the library where the user makes his request or by another library
    pursuant to an interlibrary loan. It is further required that the
    copy become the property of the user, that the library or archives
    have no notice that the copy would be used for any purposes other
    than private study, scholarship or research, and that the library
    or archives display prominently at the place where reproduction
    requests are accepted, and includes in its order form, a warning of
    copyright in accordance with requirements that the Register of
    Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.
      Out-of-Print Works. Subsection (e) authorizes the reproduction
    and distribution of a copy or phonorecord of an entire work under
    certain circumstances, if it has been established that a copy
    cannot be obtained at a fair price. The copy may be made by the
    library where the user makes his request or by another library
    pursuant to an interlibrary loan. The scope and nature of a
    reasonable investigation to determine that an unused copy cannot be
    obtained will vary according to the circumstances of a particular
    situation. It will always require recourse to commonly-known trade
    sources in the United States, and in the normal situation also to
    the publisher or other copyright owner (if the owner can be located
    at the address listed in the copyright registration), or an
    authorized reproducing service. It is further required that the
    copy become the property of the user, that the library or archives
    have no notice that the copy would be used for any purpose other
    than private study, scholarship, or research, and that the library
    or archives display prominently at the place where reproduction
    requests are accepted, and include on its order form, a warning of
    copyright in accordance with requirements that the Register of
    Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.
      General Exemptions. Clause (1) of subsection (f) specifically
    exempts a library or archives or its employees from liability for
    the unsupervised use of reproducing equipment located on its
    premises, provided that the reproducing equipment displays a notice
    that the making of a copy may be subject to the copyright law.
    Clause (2) of subsection (f) makes clear that this exemption of the
    library or archives does not extend to the person using such
    equipment or requesting such copy if the use exceeds fair use.
    Insofar as such person is concerned the copy or phonorecord made is
    not considered "lawfully" made for purposes of sections 109, 110 or
    other provisions of the title.
      Clause (3) provides that nothing in section 108 is intended to
    limit the reproduction and distribution by lending of a limited
    number of copies and excerpts of an audiovisual news program. This
    exemption is intended to apply to the daily newscasts of the
    national television networks, which report the major events of the
    day. It does not apply to documentary (except documentary programs
    involving news reporting as that term is used in section 107),
    magazine-format or other public affairs broadcasts dealing with
    subjects of general interest to the viewing public.
      The clause was first added to the revision bill in 1974 by the
    adoption of an amendment proposed by Senator Baker. It is intended
    to permit libraries and archives, subject to the general conditions
    of this section, to make off-the-air videotape recordings of daily
    network news casts for limited distribution to scholars and
    researchers for use in research purposes. As such, it is an adjunct
    to the American Television and Radio Archive established in Section
    113 of the Act [2 U.S.C. 170] which will be the principal
    repository for television broadcast material, including news
    broadcasts, the inclusion of language indicating that such material
    may only be distributed by lending by the library or archive is
    intended to preclude performance, copying, or sale, whether or not
    for profit, by the recipient of a copy of a television broadcast
    taped off-the-air pursuant to this clause.
      Clause (4), in addition to asserting that nothing contained in
    section 108 "affects the right of fair use as provided by section
    107", also provides that the right of reproduction granted by this
    section does not override any contractual arrangements assumed by a
    library or archives when it obtained a work for its collections:
    For example, if there is an express contractual prohibition against
    reproduction for any purpose, this legislation shall not be
    construed as justifying a violation of the contract. This clause is
    intended to encompass the situation where an individual makes
    papers, manuscripts or other works available to a library with the
    understanding that they will not be reproduced.
      It is the intent of this legislation that a subsequent unlawful
    use by a user of a copy or phonorecord of a work lawfully made by a
    library, shall not make the library liable for such improper use.
      Multiple Copies and Systematic Reproduction. Subsection (g)
    provides that the rights granted by this section extend only to the
    "isolated and unrelated reproduction of a single copy or
    phonorecord of the same material on separate occasions." However,
    this section does not authorize the related or concerted
    reproduction of multiple copies or phonorecords of the same
    material, whether made on one occasion or over a period of time,
    and whether intended for aggregate use by one individual or for
    separate use by the individual members of a group.
      With respect to material described in subsection (d) - articles
    or other contributions to periodicals or collections, and small
    parts of other copyrighted works - subsection (g)(2) provides that
    the exemptions of section 108 do not apply if the library or
    archive engages in "systematic reproduction or distribution of
    single or multiple copies or phonorecords." This provision in S. 22
    provoked a storm of controversy, centering around the extent to
    which the restrictions on "systematic" activities would prevent the
    continuation and development of interlibrary networks and other
    arrangements involving the exchange of photocopies. After thorough
    consideration, the Committee amended section 108(g)(2) to add the
    following proviso:
        Provided, that nothing in this clause prevents a library or
      archives from participating in interlibrary arrangements that do
      not have, as their purpose or effect, that the library or
      archives receiving such copies or phonorecords for distribution
      does so in such aggregate quantities as to substitute for a
      subscription to or purchase of such work.

      In addition, the Committee added a new subsection (i) to section
    108 [this section], requiring the Register of Copyrights, five
    years from the effective date of the new Act and at five-year
    intervals thereafter, to report to Congress upon "the extent to
    which this section has achieved the intended statutory balancing of
    the rights of creators, and the needs of users," and to make
    appropriate legislative or other recommendations. As noted in
    connection with section 107, the Committee also amended section
    504(c) in a way that would insulate librarians from unwarranted
    liability for copyright infringement; this amendment is discussed
    below.
      The key phrases in the Committee's amendment of section 108(g)(2)
    are "aggregate quantities" and "substitute for a subscription to or
    purchase of" a work. To be implemented effectively in practice,
    these provisions will require the development and implementation of
    more-or-less specific guidelines establishing criteria to govern
    various situations.
      The National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted
    Works (CONTU) offered to provide good offices in helping to develop
    these guidelines. This offer was accepted and, although the final
    text of guidelines has not yet been achieved, the Committee has
    reason to hope that, within the next month, some agreement can be
    reached on an initial set of guidelines covering practices under
    section 108(g)(2).
      Works Excluded. Subsection (h) provides that the rights of
    reproduction and distribution under this section do not apply to a
    musical work, a pictorial, graphic or sculptural work, or a motion
    picture or other audiovisual work other than "an audiovisual work
    dealing with news." The latter term is intended as the equivalent
    in meaning of the phrase "audiovisual news program" in section
    108(f)(3). The exclusions under subsection (h) do not apply to
    archival reproduction under subsection (b), to replacement of
    damaged or lost copies or phonorecords under subsection (c), or to
    "pictorial or graphic works published as illustrations, diagrams,
    or similar adjuncts to works of which copies are reproduced or
    distributed in accordance with subsections (d) and (e)."
      Although subsection (h) generally removes musical, graphic, and
    audiovisual works from the specific exemptions of section 108, it
    is important to recognize that the doctrine of fair use under
    section 107 remains fully applicable to the photocopying or other
    reproduction of such works. In the case of music, for example, it
    would be fair use for a scholar doing musicological research to
    have a library supply a copy of a portion of a score or to
    reproduce portions of a phonorecord of a work. Nothing in section
    108 impairs the applicability of the fair use doctrine to a wide
    variety of situations involving photocopying or other reproduction
    by a library of copyrighted material in its collections, where the
    user requests the reproduction for legitimate scholarly or research
    purposes.

    Sec. 109. Limitations on exclusive rights: Effect of transfer of
      particular copy or phonorecord

-STATUTE-
      (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106(3), the owner
    of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title,
    or any person authorized by such owner, is entitled, without the
    authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of
    the possession of that copy or phonorecord. Notwithstanding the
    preceding sentence, copies or phonorecords of works subject to
    restored copyright under section 104A that are manufactured before
    the date of restoration of copyright or, with respect to reliance
    parties, before publication or service of notice under section
    104A(e), may be sold or otherwise disposed of without the
    authorization of the owner of the restored copyright for purposes
    of direct or indirect commercial advantage only during the 12-month
    period beginning on - 
        (1) the date of the publication in the Federal Register of the
      notice of intent filed with the Copyright Office under section
      104A(d)(2)(A), or
        (2) the date of the receipt of actual notice served under
      section 104A(d)(2)(B),

    whichever occurs first.
      (b)(1)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a),
    unless authorized by the owners of copyright in the sound recording
    or the owner of copyright in a computer program (including any
    tape, disk, or other medium embodying such program), and in the
    case of a sound recording in the musical works embodied therein,
    neither the owner of a particular phonorecord nor any person in
    possession of a particular copy of a computer program (including
    any tape, disk, or other medium embodying such program), may, for
    the purposes of direct or indirect commercial advantage, dispose
    of, or authorize the disposal of, the possession of that
    phonorecord or computer program (including any tape, disk, or other
    medium embodying such program) by rental, lease, or lending, or by
    any other act or practice in the nature of rental, lease, or
    lending. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall apply to the
    rental, lease, or lending of a phonorecord for nonprofit purposes
    by a nonprofit library or nonprofit educational institution. The
    transfer of possession of a lawfully made copy of a computer
    program by a nonprofit educational institution to another nonprofit
    educational institution or to faculty, staff, and students does not
    constitute rental, lease, or lending for direct or indirect
    commercial purposes under this subsection.
      (B) This subsection does not apply to - 
        (i) a computer program which is embodied in a machine or
      product and which cannot be copied during the ordinary operation
      or use of the machine or product; or
        (ii) a computer program embodied in or used in conjunction with
      a limited purpose computer that is designed for playing video
      games and may be designed for other purposes.

      (C) Nothing in this subsection affects any provision of chapter 9
    of this title.
      (2)(A) Nothing in this subsection shall apply to the lending of a
    computer program for nonprofit purposes by a nonprofit library, if
    each copy of a computer program which is lent by such library has
    affixed to the packaging containing the program a warning of
    copyright in accordance with requirements that the Register of
    Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.
      (B) Not later than three years after the date of the enactment of
    the Computer Software Rental Amendments Act of 1990, and at such
    times thereafter as the Register of Copyrights considers
    appropriate, the Register of Copyrights, after consultation with
    representatives of copyright owners and librarians, shall submit to
    the Congress a report stating whether this paragraph has achieved
    its intended purpose of maintaining the integrity of the copyright
    system while providing nonprofit libraries the capability to
    fulfill their function. Such report shall advise the Congress as to
    any information or recommendations that the Register of Copyrights
    considers necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection.
      (3) Nothing in this subsection shall affect any provision of the
    antitrust laws. For purposes of the preceding sentence, "antitrust

      (4) Any person who distributes a phonorecord or a copy of a
    computer program (including any tape, disk, or other medium
    embodying such program) in violation of paragraph (1) is an

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      Effect on Further Disposition of Copy or Phonorecord. Section
    109(a) restates and confirms the principle that, where the
    copyright owner has transferred ownership of a particular copy or
    phonorecord of a work, the person to whom the copy or phonorecord
    is transferred is entitled to dispose of it by sale, rental, or any
    other means. Under this principle, which has been established by
    the court decisions and section 27 of the present law [section 27
    of former title 17], the copyright owner's exclusive right of
    public distribution would have no effect upon anyone who owns "a
    particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title" and
    who wishes to transfer it to someone else or to destroy it.
      Thus, for example, the outright sale of an authorized copy of a
    book frees it from any copyright control over its resale price or
    other conditions of its future disposition. A library that has
    acquired ownership of a copy is entitled to lend it under any
    conditions it chooses to impose. This does not mean that conditions
    on future disposition of copies or phonorecords, imposed by a
    contract between their buyer and seller, would be unenforceable
    between the parties as a breach of contract, but it does mean that
    they could not be enforced by an action for infringement of
    copyright. Under section 202 however, the owner of the physical
    copy or phonorecord cannot reproduce or perform the copyrighted
    work publicly without the copyright owner's consent.
      To come within the scope of section 109(a), a copy or phonorecord
    must have been "lawfully made under this title," though not
    necessarily with the copyright owner's authorization. For example,
    any resale of an illegally "pirated" phonorecord would be an
    infringement, but the disposition of a phonorecord legally made
    under the compulsory licensing provisions of section 115 would not.
      Effect on Display of Copy. Subsection (b) of section 109 deals
    with the scope of the copyright owner's exclusive right to control
    the public display of a particular "copy" of a work (including the
    original or prototype copy in which the work was first fixed).
    Assuming, for example, that a painter has sold the only copy of an
    original work of art without restrictions, would it be possible for
    him to restrain the new owner from displaying it publicly in
    galleries, shop windows, on a projector, or on television?
      Section 109(b) adopts the general principle that the lawful owner
    of a copy of a work should be able to put his copy on public
    display without the consent of the copyright owner. As in cases
    arising under section 109(a), this does not mean that contractual
    restrictions on display between a buyer and seller would be
    unenforceable as a matter of contract law.
      The exclusive right of public display granted by section 106(5)
    would not apply where the owner of a copy wishes to show it
    directly to the public, as in a gallery or display case, or
    indirectly, as through an opaque projector. Where the copy itself
    is intended for projection, as in the case of a photographic slide,
    negative, or transparency, the public projection of a single image
    would be permitted as long as the viewers are "present at the place
    where the copy is located."
      On the other hand, section 109(b) takes account of the
    potentialities of the new communications media, notably television,
    cable and optical transmission devices, and information storage and
    retrieval devices, for replacing printed copies with visual images.
    First of all, the public display of an image of a copyrighted work
    would not be exempted from copyright control if the copy from which
    the image was derived were outside the presence of the viewers. In
    other words, the display of a visual image of a copyrighted work
    would be an infringement if the image were transmitted by any
    method (by closed or open circuit television, for example, or by a
    computer system) from one place to members of the public located
    elsewhere.
      Moreover, the exemption would extend only to public displays that
    are made "either directly or by the projection of no more than one
    image at a time." Thus, even where the copy and the viewers are
    located at the same place, the simultaneous projection of multiple
    images of the work would not be exempted. For example, where each
    person in a lecture hall is supplied with a separate viewing
    apparatus, the copyright owner's permission would generally be
    required in order to project an image of a work on each individual
    screen at the same time.
      The committee's intention is to preserve the traditional
    privilege of the owner of a copy to display it directly, but to
    place reasonable restrictions on the ability to display it
    indirectly in such a way that the copyright owner's market for
    reproduction and distribution of copies would be affected. Unless
    it constitutes a fair use under section 107, or unless one of the
    special provisions of section 110 or 111 is applicable, projection
    of more than one image at a time, or transmission of an image to
    the public over television or other communication channels, would
    be an infringement for the same reasons that reproduction in copies
    would be. The concept of "the place where the copy is located" is
    generally intended to refer to a situation in which the viewers are
    present in the same physical surroundings as the copy, even though
    they cannot see the copy directly.
      Effect of Mere Possession of Copy or Phonorecord. Subsection (c)
    of section 109 qualifies the privileges specified in subsections
    (a) and (b) by making clear that they do not apply to someone who
    merely possesses a copy or phonorecord without having acquired
    ownership of it. Acquisition of an object embodying a copyrighted
    work by rental, lease, loan, or bailment carries with it no
    privilege to dispose of the copy under section 109(a) or to display
    it publicly under section 109(b). To cite a familiar example, a
    person who has rented a print of a motion picture from the
    copyright owner would have no right to rent it to someone else
    without the owner's permission.
      Burden of Proof in Infringement Actions. During the course of its
    deliberations on this section, the Committee's attention was
    directed to a recent court decision holding that the plaintiff in
    an infringement action had the burden of establishing that the
    allegedly infringing copies in the defendant's possession were not
    lawfully made or acquired under section 27 of the present law
    [section 27 of former title 17]. American International Pictures,
    Inc. v. Foreman, 400 F.Supp. 928 (S.D.Alabama 1975). The Committee
    believes that the court's decision, if followed, would place a
    virtually impossible burden on copyright owners. The decision is
    also inconsistent with the established legal principle that the
    burden of proof should not be placed upon a litigant to establish
    facts particularly within the knowledge of his adversary. The
    defendant in such actions clearly has the particular knowledge of
    how possession of the particular copy was acquired, and should have
    the burden of providing this evidence to the court. It is the
    intent of the Committee, therefore, that in an action to determine
    whether a defendant is entitled to the privilege established by
    section 109(a) and (b), the burden of proving whether a particular
    copy was lawfully made or acquired should rest on the defendant.

      to instruction, unless, in the case of a motion picture or other
      audiovisual work, the performance, or the display of individual
      images, is given by means of a copy that was not lawfully made
      under this title, and that the person responsible for the
      performance knew or had reason to believe was not lawfully made;
        (2) except with respect to a work produced or marketed

      portions of any other work, or display of a work in an amount
      comparable to that which is typically displayed in the course of
      a live classroom session, by or in the course of a transmission,
      if - 
          (A) the performance or display is made by, at the direction
        of, or under the actual supervision of an instructor as an
        integral part of a class session offered as a regular part of
        the systematic mediated instructional activities of a

          staff members that accurately describe, and promote
          compliance with, the laws of the United States relating to
          copyright, and provides notice to students that materials
          used in connection with the course may be subject to

              recipients of the transmission from the transmitting body
              or institution for longer than the class session; and

            further dissemination;

        (3) performance of a nondramatic literary or musical work or of
      a dramatico-musical work of a religious nature, or display of a
      work, in the course of services at a place of worship or other

      otherwise than in a transmission to the public, without any
      purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage and without
      payment of any fee or other compensation for the performance to

        private financial gain, except where the copyright owner has
        served notice of objection to the performance under the
        following conditions:
            (i) the notice shall be in writing and signed by the
          copyright owner or such owner's duly authorized agent; and
            (ii) the notice shall be served on the person responsible
          for the performance at least seven days before the date of
          the performance, and shall state the reasons for the
          objection; and
            (iii) the notice shall comply, in form, content, and manner
          of service, with requirements that the Register of Copyrights
          shall prescribe by regulation;

        (5)(A) except as provided in subparagraph (B), communication of

      licensed as such by the Federal Communications Commission, or, if
      an audiovisual transmission, by a cable system or satellite
      carrier, if - 
          (i) in the case of an establishment other than a food service
        or drinking establishment, either the establishment in which
        the communication occurs has less than 2,000 gross square feet
        of space (excluding space used for customer parking and for no
        other purpose), or the establishment in which the communication
        occurs has 2,000 or more gross square feet of space (excluding
        space used for customer parking and for no other purpose) and -

        (6) performance of a nondramatic musical work by a governmental
      body or a nonprofit agricultural or horticultural organization,
      in the course of an annual agricultural or horticultural fair or
      exhibition conducted by such body or organization; the exemption
      provided by this clause shall extend to any liability for
      copyright infringement that would otherwise be imposed on such
      body or organization, under doctrines of vicarious liability or
      related infringement, for a performance by a concessionnaire,(!1)
      business establishment, or other person at such fair or

        (7) performance of a nondramatic musical work by a vending
      establishment open to the public at large without any direct or

      transmitted beyond the place where the establishment is located
      and is within the immediate area where the sale is occurring;
        (8) performance of a nondramatic literary work, by or in the
      course of a transmission specifically designed for and primarily
      directed to blind or other handicapped persons who are unable to
      read normal printed material as a result of their handicap, or
      deaf or other handicapped persons who are unable to hear the
      aural signals accompanying a transmission of visual signals, if
      the performance is made without any purpose of direct or indirect
      commercial advantage and its transmission is made through the
      facilities of: (i) a governmental body; or (ii) a noncommercial
      educational broadcast station (as defined in section 397 of title
      47); or (iii) a radio subcarrier authorization (as defined in 47
      CFR 73.293-73.295 and 73.593-73.595); or (iv) a cable system (as
      defined in section 111(f));
        (9) performance on a single occasion of a dramatic literary
      work published at least ten years before the date of the
      performance, by or in the course of a transmission specifically
      designed for and primarily directed to blind or other handicapped
      persons who are unable to read normal printed material as a
      result of their handicap, if the performance is made without any
      purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage and its
      transmission is made through the facilities of a radio subcarrier
      authorization referred to in clause (8)(iii), Provided, That the
      provisions of this clause shall not be applicable to more than
      one performance of the same work by the same performers or under
      the auspices of the same organization;
        (10) notwithstanding paragraph (4), the following is not an
      infringement of copyright: performance of a nondramatic literary
      or musical work in the course of a social function which is
      organized and promoted by a nonprofit veterans' organization or a
      nonprofit fraternal organization to which the general public is
      not invited, but not including the invitees of the organizations,
      if the proceeds from the performance, after deducting the
      reasonable costs of producing the performance, are used
      exclusively for charitable purposes and not for financial gain.
      For purposes of this section the social functions of any college
      or university fraternity or sorority shall not be included unless
      the social function is held solely to raise funds for a specific
      charitable purpose; and
        (11) the making imperceptible, by or at the direction of a
      member of a private household, of limited portions of audio or
      video content of a motion picture, during a performance in or
      transmitted to that household for private home viewing, from an
      authorized copy of the motion picture, or the creation or
      provision of a computer program or other technology that enables
      such making imperceptible and that is designed and marketed to be
      used, at the direction of a member of a private household, for
      such making imperceptible, if no fixed copy of the altered
      version of the motion picture is created by such computer program
      or other technology.

    The exemptions provided under paragraph (5) shall not be taken into
    account in any administrative, judicial, or other governmental
    proceeding to set or adjust the royalties payable to copyright
    owners for the public performance or display of their works.
    Royalties payable to copyright owners for any public performance or
    display of their works other than such performances or displays as
    are exempted under paragraph (5) shall not be diminished in any
    respect as a result of such exemption.
        In paragraph (2), the term "mediated instructional activities"
      with respect to the performance or display of a work by digital
      transmission under this section refers to activities that use
      such work as an integral part of the class experience, controlled
      by or under the actual supervision of the instructor and
      analogous to the type of performance or display that would take
      place in a live classroom setting. The term does not refer to
      activities that use, in 1 or more class sessions of a single
      course, such works as textbooks, course packs, or other material
      in any media, copies or phonorecords of which are typically
      purchased or acquired by the students in higher education for
      their independent use and retention or are typically purchased or
      acquired for elementary and secondary students for their
      possession and independent use.
        For purposes of paragraph (2), accreditation - 
          (A) with respect to an institution providing post-secondary
        education, shall be as determined by a regional or national
        accrediting agency recognized by the Council on Higher
        Education Accreditation or the United States Department of
        Education; and
          (B) with respect to an institution providing elementary or
        secondary education, shall be as recognized by the applicable
        state certification or licensing procedures.

        For purposes of paragraph (2), no governmental body or
      accredited nonprofit educational institution shall be liable for
      infringement by reason of the transient or temporary storage of
      material carried out through the automatic technical process of a
      digital transmission of the performance or display of that
      material as authorized under paragraph (2). No such material
      stored on the system or network controlled or operated by the
      transmitting body or institution under this paragraph shall be
      maintained on such system or network in a manner ordinarily
      accessible to anyone other than anticipated recipients. No such
      copy shall be maintained on the system or network in a manner
      ordinarily accessible to such anticipated recipients for a longer
      period than is reasonably necessary to facilitate the
      transmissions for which it was made.
        For purposes of paragraph (11), the term "making imperceptible"
      does not include the addition of audio or video content that is
      performed or displayed over or in place of existing content in a
      motion picture.
        Nothing in paragraph (11) shall be construed to imply further
      rights under section 106 of this title, or to have any effect on
      defenses or limitations on rights granted under any other section
      of this title or under any other paragraph of this section.

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      Clauses (1) through (4) of section 110 deal with performances and
    exhibitions that are now generally exempt under the "for profit"
    limitation or other provisions of the copyright law, and that are
    specifically exempted from copyright liability under this
    legislation. Clauses (1) and (2) between them are intended to cover
    all of the various methods by which performances or displays in the
    course of systematic instruction take place.
      Face-to-Face Teaching Activities. Clause (1) of section 110 is
    generally intended to set out the conditions under which
    performances or displays, in the course of instructional activities
    other than educational broadcasting, are to be exempted from
    copyright control. The clause covers all types of copyrighted
    works, and exempts their performance or display "by instructors or
    pupils in the course of face-to-face teaching activities of a
    nonprofit educational institution," where the activities take place
    "in a classroom or similar place devoted to instruction."
      There appears to be no need for a statutory definition of "face-
    to-face" teaching activities to clarify the scope of the
    provision. "Face-to-face teaching activities" under clause (1)
    embrace instructional performances and displays that are not
    "transmitted." The concept does not require that the teacher and
    students be able to see each other, although it does require their
    simultaneous presence in the same general place. Use of the phrase
    "in the course of face-to-face teaching activities" is intended to
    exclude broadcasting or other transmissions from an outside
    location into classrooms, whether radio or television and whether
    open or closed circuit. However, as long as the instructor and
    pupils are in the same building or general area, the exemption
    would extend to the use of devices for amplifying or reproducing
    sound and for projecting visual images. The "teaching activities"
    exempted by the clause encompass systematic instruction of a very
    wide variety of subjects, but they do not include performances or
    displays, whatever their cultural value or intellectual appeal,
    that are given for the recreation or entertainment of any part of
    their audience.
      Works Affected. - Since there is no limitation on the types of
    works covered by the exemption, teachers or students would be free
    to perform or display anything in class as long as the other
    conditions of the clause are met. They could read aloud from
    copyrighted text material, act out a drama, play or sing a musical
    work, perform a motion picture or filmstrip, or display text or
    pictorial material to the class by means of a projector. However,
    nothing in this provision is intended to sanction the unauthorized
    reproduction of copies or phonorecords for the purpose of classroom
    performance or display, and the clause contains a special exception
    dealing with performances from unlawfully made copies of motion
    pictures and other audiovisual works, to be discussed below.
      Instructors or Pupils. - To come within clause (1), the
    performance or display must be "by instructors or pupils," thus
    ruling out performances by actors, singers, or instrumentalists
    brought in from outside the school to put on a program. However,
    the term "instructors" would be broad enough to include guest
    lecturers if their instructional activities remain confined to
    classroom situations. In general, the term "pupils" refers to the
    enrolled members of a class.
      Nonprofit Educational Institution. - Clause (1) makes clear that
    it applies only to the teaching activities "of a nonprofit
    educational institution," thus excluding from the exemption
    performances or displays in profit-making institutions such as
    dance studios and language schools.
      Classroom or Similar Place. - The teaching activities exempted by
    the clause must take place "in a classroom or similar place devoted
    to instruction." For example, performances in an auditorium or
    stadium during a school assembly, graduation ceremony, class play,
    or sporting event, where the audience is not confined to the
    members of a particular class, would fall outside the scope of
    clause (1), although in some cases they might be exempted by clause
    (4) of section 110. The "similar place" referred to in clause (1)
    is a place which is "devoted to instruction" in the same way a
    classroom is; common examples would include a studio, a workshop, a
    gymnasium, a training field, a library, the stage of an auditorium,
    or the auditorium itself, if it is actually used as a classroom for
    systematic instructional activities.
      Motion Pictures and Other Audiovisual Works. - The final
    provision of clause (1) deals with the special problem of
    performances from unlawfully-made copies of motion pictures and
    other audiovisual works. The exemption is lost where the copy being
    used for a classroom performance was "not lawfully made under this
    title" and the person responsible for the performance knew or had
    reason to suspect as much. This special exception to the exemption
    would not apply to performances from lawfully-made copies, even if
    the copies were acquired from someone who had stolen or converted
    them, or if the performances were in violation of an agreement.
    However, though the performance would be exempt under section
    110(1) in such cases, the copyright owner might have a cause of
    action against the unauthorized distributor under section 106(3),
    or against the person responsible for the performance, for breach
    of contract.
      Projection Devices. - As long as there is no transmission beyond
    the place where the copy is located, both section 109(b) and
    section 110(1) would permit the classroom display of a work by
    means of any sort of projection device or process.
      Instructional Broadcasting. Works Affected. - The exemption for
    instructional broadcasting provided by section 110(2) would apply
    only to "performance of a nondramatic literary or musical work or
    display of a work." Thus, the copyright owner's permission would be
    required for the performance on educational television or radio of
    a dramatic work, of a dramatico-musical work such as an opera or
    musical comedy, or of a motion picture. Since, as already
    explained, audiovisual works such as filmstrips are equated with
    motion pictures, their sequential showing would be regarded as a
    performance rather than a display and would not be exempt under
    section 110(2). The clause is not intended to limit in any way the
    copyright owner's exclusive right to make dramatizations,
    adaptations, or other derivative works under section 106(2). Thus,
    for example, a performer could read a nondramatic literary work
    aloud under section 110(2), but the copyright owner's permission
    would be required for him to act it out in dramatic form.
      Systematic Instructional Activities. - Under section 110(2) a
    transmission must meet three specified conditions in order to be
    exempted from copyright liability. The first of these, as provided
    by subclause (A), is that the performance or display must be "a
    regular part of the systematic instructional activities of a
    governmental body or a nonprofit educational institution." The
    concept of "systematic instructional activities" is intended as the
    general equivalent of "curriculums," but it could be broader in a
    case such as that of an institution using systematic teaching
    methods not related to specific course work. A transmission would
    be a regular part of these activities if it is in accordance with
    the pattern of teaching established by the governmental body or
    institution. The use of commercial facilities, such as those of a
    cable service, to transmit the performance or display, would not
    affect the exemption as long as the actual performance or display
    was for nonprofit purposes.
      Content of Transmission. - Subclause (B) requires that the
    performance or display be directly related and of material
    assistance to the teaching content of the transmission.
      Intended Recipients. - Subclause (C) requires that the
    transmission is made primarily for:
        (i) Reception in classrooms or similar places normally devoted
      to instruction, or
        (ii) Reception by persons to whom the transmission is directed
      because their disabilities or other special circumstances prevent
      their attendance in classrooms or similar places normally devoted
      to instruction, or
        (iii) Reception by officers or employees of governmental bodies
      as a part of their official duties or employment.
      In all three cases, the instructional transmission need only be
    made "primarily" rather than "solely" to the specified recipients
    to be exempt. Thus, the transmission could still be exempt even
    though it is capable of reception by the public at large.
    Conversely, it would not be regarded as made "primarily" for one of
    the required groups of recipients if the principal purpose behind
    the transmission is reception by the public at large, even if it is
    cast in the form of instruction and is also received in classrooms.
    Factors to consider in determining the "primary" purpose of a
    program would include its subject matter, content, and the time of
    its transmission.
      Paragraph (i) of subclause (C) generally covers what are known as
    "in-school" broadcasts, whether open- or closed-circuit. The
    reference to "classrooms or similar places" here is intended to
    have the same meaning as that of the phrase as used in section
    110(1). The exemption in paragraph (ii) is intended to exempt
    transmissions providing systematic instruction to individuals who
    cannot be reached in classrooms because of "their disabilities or
    other special circumstances." Accordingly, the exemption is
    confined to instructional broadcasting that is an adjunct to the
    actual classwork of nonprofit schools or is primarily for people
    who cannot be brought together in classrooms such as preschool
    children, displaced workers, illiterates, and shut-ins.
      There has been some question as to whether or not the language in
    this section of the bill is intended to include instructional
    television college credit courses. These telecourses are aimed at
    undergraduate and graduate students in earnest pursuit of higher
    educational degrees who are unable to attend daytime classes
    because of daytime employment, distance from campus, or some other
    intervening reason. So long as these broadcasts are aimed at
    regularly enrolled students and conducted by recognized higher
    educational institutions, the committee believes that they are
    clearly within the language of section 110(2)(C)(ii). Like night
    school and correspondence courses before them, these telecourses
    are fast becoming a valuable adjunct of the normal college
    curriculum.
      The third exemption in subclause (C) is intended to permit the
    use of copyrighted material, in accordance with the other
    conditions of section 110(2), in the course of instructional
    transmissions for Government personnel who are receiving training
    "as a part of their official duties or employment."
      Religious Services. The exemption in clause (3) of section 110
    covers performances of a nondramatic literary or musical work, and
    also performances "of dramatico-musical works of a religious
    nature"; in addition, it extends to displays of works of all kinds.
    The exemption applies where the performance or display is "in the
    course of services at a place of worship or other religious
    assembly." The scope of the clause does not cover the sequential
    showing of motion pictures and other audiovisual works.
      The exemption, which to some extent has its counterpart in
    sections 1 and 104 of the present law [sections 1 and 104 of former
    title 17], applies to dramatico-musical works "of a religious
    nature." The purpose here is to exempt certain performances of
    sacred music that might be regarded as "dramatic" in nature, such
    as oratorios, cantatas, musical settings of the mass, choral
    services, and the like. The exemption is not intended to cover
    performances of secular operas, musical plays, motion pictures, and
    the like, even if they have an underlying religious or
    philosophical theme and take place "in the course of [religious]
    services."
      To be exempted under section 110(3) a performance or display must
    be "in the course of services," thus excluding activities at a
    place of worship that are for social, educational, fund raising, or
    entertainment purposes. Some performances of these kinds could be
    covered by the exemption in section 110(4), discussed next. Since
    the performance or display must also occur "at a place of worship
    or other religious assembly," the exemption would not extend to
    religious broadcasts or other transmissions to the public at large,
    even where the transmissions were sent from the place of worship.
    On the other hand, as long as services are being conducted before a
    religious gathering, the exemption would apply if they were
    conducted in places such as auditoriums, outdoor theaters, and the
    like.
      Certain Other Nonprofit Performances. In addition to the
    educational and religious exemptions provided by clauses (1)
    through (3) of section 110, clause (4) contains a general exception
    to the exclusive right of public performance that would cover some,
    though not all, of the same ground as the present "for profit"
    limitation.
      Scope of Exemption. - The exemption in clause (4) applies to the
    same general activities and subject matter as those covered by the
    "for profit" limitation today: public performances of nondramatic
    literary and musical works. However, the exemption would be limited
    to public performances given directly in the presence of an
    audience whether by means of living performers, the playing of
    phonorecords, or the operation of a receiving apparatus, and would
    not include a "transmission to the public." Unlike the clauses (1)
    through (3) and (5) of section 110, but like clauses (6) through
    (8), clause (4) applies only to performing rights in certain works,
    and does not affect the exclusive right to display a work in
    public.
      No Profit Motive. - In addition to the other conditions specified
    by the clause, the performance must be "without any purpose of
    direct or indirect commercial advantage." This provision expressly
    adopts the principle established by the court decisions construing
    the "for profit" limitation: that public performances given or
    sponsored in connection with any commercial or profit-making
    enterprises are subject to the exclusive rights of the copyright
    owner even though the public is not charged for seeing or hearing
    the performance.
      No Payment for Performance. - An important condition for this
    exemption is that the performance be given "without payment of any
    fee or other compensation for the performance to any of its
    performers, promoters, or organizers." The basic purpose of this
    requirement is to prevent the free use of copyrighted material
    under the guise of charity where fees or percentages are paid to
    performers, promoters, producers, and the like. However, the
    exemption would not be lost if the performers, directors, or
    producers of the performance, instead of being paid directly "for
    the performance," are paid a salary for duties encompassing the
    performance. Examples are performances by a school orchestra
    conducted by a music teacher who receives an annual salary, or by a
    service band whose members and conductors perform as part of their
    assigned duties and who receive military pay. The committee
    believes that performances of this type should be exempt, assuming
    the other conditions in clause (4) are met, and has not adopted the
    suggestion that the word "salary" be added to the phrase referring
    to the "payment of any fee or other compensation."
      Admission Charge. - Assuming that the performance involves no
    profit motive and no one responsible for it gets paid a fee, it
    must still meet one of two alternative conditions to be exempt. As
    specified in subclauses (A) and (B) of section 110(4), these
    conditions are: (1) that no direct or indirect admission charge is
    made, or (2) that the net proceeds are "used exclusively for
    educational, religious, or charitable purposes and not for private
    financial gain."
      Under the second of these conditions, a performance meeting the
    other conditions of clause (4) would be exempt even if an admission
    fee is charged, provided any amounts left "after deducting the
    reasonable costs of producing the performance" are used solely for
    bona fide educational, religious, or charitable purposes. In cases
    arising under this second condition and as provided in subclause
    (B), where there is an admission charge, the copyright owner is
    given an opportunity to decide whether and under what conditions
    the copyrighted work should be performed; otherwise, owners could
    be compelled to make involuntary donations to the fund-raising
    activities of causes to which they are opposed. The subclause would
    thus permit copyright owners to prevent public performances of
    their works under section 110(4)(B) by serving notice of objection,
    with the reasons therefor, at least seven days in advance.
      Mere Reception in Public. Unlike the first four clauses of
    section 110, clause (5) is not to any extent a counterpart of the
    "for profit" limitation of the present statute. It applies to
    performances and displays of all types of works, and its purpose is
    to exempt from copyright liability anyone who merely turns on, in a
    public place, an ordinary radio or television receiving apparatus
    of a kind commonly sold to members of the public for private use.
      The basic rationale of this clause is that the secondary use of
    the transmission by turning on an ordinary receiver in public is so
    remote and minimal that no further liability should be imposed. In
    the vast majority of these cases no royalties are collected today,
    and the exemption should be made explicit in the statute. This
    clause has nothing to do with cable television systems and the
    exemptions would be denied in any case where the audience is
    charged directly to see or hear the transmission.
      With respect to section 110(5), the conference substitute
    conforms to the language in the Senate bill. It is the intent of
    the conferees that a small commercial establishment of the type
    involved in Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S. 151
    (1975), [95 S.Ct. 2040, 45 L.Ed.2d 84], which merely augmented a
    home-type receiver and which was not of sufficient size to justify,
    as a practical matter, a subscription to a commercial background
    music service, would be exempt. However, where the public
    communication was by means of something other than a home-type
    receiving apparatus, or where the establishment actually makes a
    further transmission to the public, the exemption would not apply.
      On June 17, 1975, the Supreme Court handed down a decision in
    Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 95 S.Ct. 2040 [422 U.S.
    151, 45 L.Ed.2d 84], that raised fundamental questions about the
    proper interpretation of section 110(5). The defendant, owner and
    operator of a fast-service food shop in downtown Pittsburgh, had "a
    radio with outlets to four speakers in the ceiling," which he
    apparently turned on and left on throughout the business day.
    Lacking any performing license, he was sued for copyright
    infringement by two ASCAP members. He lost in the District Court,
    won a reversal in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and finally
    prevailed, by a margin of 7-2, in the Supreme Court.
      The Aiken decision is based squarely on the two Supreme Court
    decisions dealing with cable television. In Fortnightly Corp. v.
    United Artists, 392 U.S. 390 [88 S.Ct. 2084, 20 L.Ed.2d 1176,
    rehearing denied 89 S.Ct. 65, 393 U.S. 902, 21 L.Ed.2d 190], and
    again in Teleprompter Corp. v. CBS, 415 U.S. 394 [94 S.Ct. 1129, 39
    L.Ed.2d 415], the Supreme Court has held that a CATV operator was
    not "performing" within the meaning of the 1909 statute, when it
    picked up broadcast signals off the air and retransmitted them to
    subscribers by cable. The Aiken decision extends this
    interpretation of the scope of the 1909 statute's right of "public
    performance for profit" to a situation outside the CATV context
    and, without expressly overruling the decision in Buck v. Jewell-
    LaSalle Realty Co., 283 U.S. 191 (1931) [51 S.Ct. 410, 75 L.Ed.
    971], effectively deprives it of much meaning under the present
    law. For more than forty years the Jewell-LaSalle rule was thought
    to require a business establishment to obtain copyright licenses
    before it could legally pick up any broadcasts off the air and
    retransmit them to its guests and patrons. As reinterpreted by the
    Aiken decision, the rule of Jewell-LaSalle applies only if the
    broadcast being retransmitted was itself unlicensed.
      The majority of the Supreme Court in the Aiken case based its
    decision on a narrow construction of the word "perform" in the 1909
    statute. This basis for the decision is completely overturned by
    the present bill and its broad definition of "perform" in section
    101. The Committee has adopted the language of section 110(5) with
    an amendment expressly denying the exemption in situations where
    "the performance or display is further transmitted beyond the place
    where the receiving apparatus is located"; in doing so, it accepts
    the traditional, pre-Aiken, interpretation of the Jewell-LaSalle
    decision, under which public communication by means other than a
    home receiving set, or further transmission of a broadcast to the
    public, is considered an infringing act.
      Under the particular fact situation in the Aiken case, assuming a
    small commercial establishment and the use of a home receiver with
    four ordinary loudspeakers grouped within a relatively narrow
    circumference from the set, it is intended that the performances
    would be exempt under clause (5). However, the Committee considers
    this fact situation to represent the outer limit of the exemption,
    and believes that the line should be drawn at that point. Thus, the
    clause would exempt small commercial establishments whose
    proprietors merely bring onto their premises standard radio or
    television equipment and turn it on for their customers' enjoyment,
    but it would impose liability where the proprietor has a commercial
    "sound system" installed or converts a standard home receiving
    apparatus (by augmenting it with sophisticated or extensive
    amplification equipment) into the equivalent of a commercial sound
    system. Factors to consider in particular cases would include the
    size, physical arrangement, and noise level of the areas within the
    establishment where the transmissions are made audible or visible,
    and the extent to which the receiving apparatus is altered or
    augmented for the purpose of improving the aural or visual quality
    of the performance for individual members of the public using those
    areas.
      Agricultural Fairs. The Committee also amended clause (6) of
    section 110 of S. 22 as adopted by the Senate. As amended, the
    provision would exempt "performance of a nondramatic musical work
    by a governmental body or a nonprofit agricultural or horticultural
    organization, in the course of an annual agricultural or
    horticultural fair or exhibition conducted by such body or
    organization." The exemption extends only to the governmental body
    or nonprofit organization sponsoring the fair; the amendment makes
    clear that, while such a body or organization cannot itself be held
    vicariously liable for infringements by concessionaires at the
    fair, the concessionaires themselves enjoy no exemption under the
    clause.
      Retail Sale of Phonorecords. Clause (7) provides that the
    performance of a nondramatic musical work or of a sound recording
    by a vending establishment open to the public at large without any
    direct or indirect admission charge, where the sole purpose of the
    performance is to promote the retail sale of copies or phonorecords
    of the work, is not an infringement of copyright. This exemption
    applies only if the performance is not transmitted beyond the place
    where the establishment is located and is within the immediate area
    where the sale is occurring.
      Transmission to Handicapped Audiences. The new clause (8) of
    subsection 110, which had been added to S. 22 by the Senate
    Judiciary Committee when it reported the bill on November 20, 1975,
    and had been adopted by the Senate on February 19, 1976, was
    substantially amended by the Committee. Under the amendment, the
    exemption would apply only to performances of "nondramatic literary
    works" by means of "a transmission specifically designed for and
    primarily directed to" one or the other of two defined classes of
    handicapped persons: (1) "blind or other handicapped persons who
    are unable to read normal printed material as a result of their
    handicap" or (2) "deaf or other handicapped persons who are unable
    to hear the aural signals accompanying a transmission." Moreover,
    the exemption would be applicable only if the performance is
    "without any purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage,"
    and if the transmission takes place through government facilities
    or through the facilities of a noncommercial educational broadcast
    station, a radio subcarrier authorization (SCA), or a cable system.

    Sec. 111. Limitations on exclusive rights: Secondary transmissions
      of broadcast programming by cable

-STATUTE-
      (a) Certain Secondary Transmissions Exempted. - The secondary
    transmission of a performance or display of a work embodied in a
    primary transmission is not an infringement of copyright if - 
        (1) the secondary transmission is not made by a cable system,
      and consists entirely of the relaying, by the management of a
      hotel, apartment house, or similar establishment, of signals
      transmitted by a broadcast station licensed by the Federal
      Communications Commission, within the local service area of such
      station, to the private lodgings of guests or residents of such
      establishment, and no direct charge is made to see or hear the
      secondary transmission; or
        (2) the secondary transmission is made solely for the purpose
      and under the conditions specified by paragraph (2) of section
      110; or
        (3) the secondary transmission is made by any carrier who has
      no direct or indirect control over the content or selection of
      the primary transmission or over the particular recipients of the
      secondary transmission, and whose activities with respect to the
      secondary transmission consist solely of providing wires, cables,
      or other communications channels for the use of others: Provided,
      That the provisions of this paragraph extend only to the
      activities of said carrier with respect to secondary
      transmissions and do not exempt from liability the activities of
      others with respect to their own primary or secondary
      transmissions;
        (4) the secondary transmission is made by a satellite carrier
      pursuant to a statutory license under section 119 or section 122;
        (5) the secondary transmission is not made by a cable system
      but is made by a governmental body, or other nonprofit
      organization, without any purpose of direct or indirect
      commercial advantage, and without charge to the recipients of the
      secondary transmission other than assessments necessary to defray
      the actual and reasonable costs of maintaining and operating the
      secondary transmission service.

      (b) Secondary Transmission of Primary Transmission to Controlled
    Group. - Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (c),
    the secondary transmission to the public of a performance or
    display of a work embodied in a primary transmission is actionable
    as an act of infringement under section 501, and is fully subject
    to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506, if the
    primary transmission is not made for reception by the public at
    large but is controlled and limited to reception by particular
    members of the public: Provided, however, That such secondary
    transmission is not actionable as an act of infringement if - 
        (1) the primary transmission is made by a broadcast station
      licensed by the Federal Communications Commission; and
        (2) the carriage of the signals comprising the secondary
      transmission is required under the rules, regulations, or
      authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission; and
        (3) the signal of the primary transmitter is not altered or
      changed in any way by the secondary transmitter.

      (c) Secondary Transmissions by Cable Systems. - 
        (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (2), (3), and (4)
      of this subsection and section 114(d), secondary transmissions to
      the public by a cable system of a performance or display of a
      work embodied in a primary transmission made by a broadcast
      station licensed by the Federal Communications Commission or by
      an appropriate governmental authority of Canada or Mexico shall
      be subject to statutory licensing upon compliance with the
      requirements of subsection (d) where the carriage of the signals
      comprising the secondary transmission is permissible under the
      rules, regulations, or authorizations of the Federal
      Communications Commission.
        (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this
      subsection, the willful or repeated secondary transmission to the
      public by a cable system of a primary transmission made by a
      broadcast station licensed by the Federal Communications
      Commission or by an appropriate governmental authority of Canada
      or Mexico and embodying a performance or display of a work is
      actionable as an act of infringement under section 501, and is
      fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through
      506, in the following cases:
          (A) where the carriage of the signals comprising the
        secondary transmission is not permissible under the rules,
        regulations, or authorizations of the Federal Communications
        Commission; or
          (B) where the cable system has not deposited the statement of
        account and royalty fee required by subsection (d).

        (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this
      subsection and subject to the provisions of subsection (e) of
      this section, the secondary transmission to the public by a cable
      system of a performance or display of a work embodied in a
      primary transmission made by a broadcast station licensed by the
      Federal Communications Commission or by an appropriate
      governmental authority of Canada or Mexico is actionable as an
      act of infringement under section 501, and is fully subject to
      the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506 and section
      510, if the content of the particular program in which the
      performance or display is embodied, or any commercial advertising
      or station announcements transmitted by the primary transmitter
      during, or immediately before or after, the transmission of such
      program, is in any way willfully altered by the cable system
      through changes, deletions, or additions, except for the
      alteration, deletion, or substitution of commercial
      advertisements performed by those engaged in television
      commercial advertising market research: Provided, That the
      research company has obtained the prior consent of the advertiser
      who has purchased the original commercial advertisement, the
      television station broadcasting that commercial advertisement,
      and the cable system performing the secondary transmission: And
      provided further, That such commercial alteration, deletion, or
      substitution is not performed for the purpose of deriving income
      from the sale of that commercial time.
        (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this
      subsection, the secondary transmission to the public by a cable
      system of a performance or display of a work embodied in a
      primary transmission made by a broadcast station licensed by an
      appropriate governmental authority of Canada or Mexico is
      actionable as an act of infringement under section 501, and is
      fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through
      506, if (A) with respect to Canadian signals, the community of
      the cable system is located more than 150 miles from the United
      States-Canadian border and is also located south of the forty-
      second parallel of latitude, or (B) with respect to Mexican
      signals, the secondary transmission is made by a cable system
      which received the primary transmission by means other than
      direct interception of a free space radio wave emitted by such
      broadcast television station, unless prior to April 15, 1976,
      such cable system was actually carrying, or was specifically
      authorized to carry, the signal of such foreign station on the
      system pursuant to the rules, regulations, or authorizations of
      the Federal Communications Commission.

      (d) Statutory License for Secondary Transmissions by Cable
    Systems. - 
        (1) Statement of account and royalty fees. - Subject to
      paragraph (5), a cable system whose secondary transmissions have
      been subject to statutory licensing under subsection (c) shall,
      on a semiannual basis, deposit with the Register of Copyrights,
      in accordance with requirements that the Register shall prescribe
      by regulation the following:
          (A) A statement of account, covering the six months next
        preceding, specifying the number of channels on which the cable
        system made secondary transmissions to its subscribers, the
        names and locations of all primary transmitters whose
        transmissions were further transmitted by the cable system, the
        total number of subscribers, the gross amounts paid to the
        cable system for the basic service of providing secondary
        transmissions of primary broadcast transmitters, and such other
        data as the Register of Copyrights may from time to time
        prescribe by regulation. In determining the total number of
        subscribers and the gross amounts paid to the cable system for
        the basic service of providing secondary transmissions of
        primary broadcast transmitters, the system shall not include
        subscribers and amounts collected from subscribers receiving
        secondary transmissions pursuant to section 119. Such statement
        shall also include a special statement of account covering any
        non-network television programming that was carried by the
        cable system in whole or in part beyond the local service area
        of the primary transmitter, under rules, regulations, or
        authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission
        permitting the substitution or addition of signals under
        certain circumstances, together with logs showing the times,
        dates, stations, and programs involved in such substituted or
        added carriage.
          (B) Except in the case of a cable system whose royalty fee is
        specified in subparagraph (E) or (F), a total royalty fee
        payable to copyright owners pursuant to paragraph (3) for the
        period covered by the statement, computed on the basis of
        specified percentages of the gross receipts from subscribers to
        the cable service during such period for the basic service of
        providing secondary transmissions of primary broadcast
        transmitters, as follows:
            (i) 1.064 percent of such gross receipts for the privilege
          of further transmitting, beyond the local service area of
          such primary transmitter, any non-network programming of a
          primary transmitter in whole or in part, such amount to be
          applied against the fee, if any, payable pursuant to clauses
          (ii) through (iv);
            (ii) 1.064 percent of such gross receipts for the first
          distant signal equivalent;
            (iii) 0.701 percent of such gross receipts for each of the
          second, third, and fourth distant signal equivalents; and
            (iv) 0.330 percent of such gross receipts for the fifth
          distant signal equivalent and each distant signal equivalent
          thereafter.

          (C) In computing amounts under clauses (ii) through (iv) of
        subparagraph (B) - 
            (i) any fraction of a distant signal equivalent shall be
          computed at its fractional value;
            (ii) in the case of any cable system located partly within
          and partly outside of the local service area of a primary
          transmitter, gross receipts shall be limited to those gross
          receipts derived from subscribers located outside of the
          local service area of such primary transmitter; and
            (iii) if a cable system provides a secondary transmission
          of a primary transmitter to some but not all communities
          served by that cable system - 
              (I) the gross receipts and the distant signal equivalent
            values for such secondary transmission shall be derived
            solely on the basis of the subscribers in those communities
            where the cable system provides such secondary
            transmission; and
              (II) the total royalty fee for the period paid by such
            system shall not be less than the royalty fee calculated
            under subparagraph (B)(i) multiplied by the gross receipts
            from all subscribers to the system.

          (D) A cable system that, on a statement submitted before the
        date of the enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and
        Localism Act of 2010, computed its royalty fee consistent with
        the methodology under subparagraph (C)(iii), or that amends a
        statement filed before such date of enactment to compute the
        royalty fee due using such methodology, shall not be subject to
        an action for infringement, or eligible for any royalty refund
        or offset, arising out of its use of such methodology on such
        statement.
          (E) If the actual gross receipts paid by subscribers to a
        cable system for the period covered by the statement for the
        basic service of providing secondary transmissions of primary
        broadcast transmitters are $263,800 or less - 
            (i) gross receipts of the cable system for the purpose of
          this paragraph shall be computed by subtracting from such
          actual gross receipts the amount by which $263,800 exceeds
          such actual gross receipts, except that in no case shall a
          cable system's gross receipts be reduced to less than
          $10,400; and
            (ii) the royalty fee payable under this paragraph to
          copyright owners pursuant to paragraph (3) shall be 0.5
          percent, regardless of the number of distant signal
          equivalents, if any.

          (F) If the actual gross receipts paid by subscribers to a
        cable system for the period covered by the statement for the
        basic service of providing secondary transmissions of primary
        broadcast transmitters are more than $263,800 but less than
        $527,600, the royalty fee payable under this paragraph to
        copyright owners pursuant to paragraph (3) shall be - 
            (i) 0.5 percent of any gross receipts up to $263,800,
          regardless of the number of distant signal equivalents, if
          any; and
            (ii) 1 percent of any gross receipts in excess of $263,800,
          but less than $527,600, regardless of the number of distant
          signal equivalents, if any.

          (G) A filing fee, as determined by the Register of Copyrights
        pursuant to section 708(a).

        (2) Handling of fees. - The Register of Copyrights shall
      receive all fees (including the filing fee specified in paragraph
      (1)(G)) deposited under this section and, after deducting the
      reasonable costs incurred by the Copyright Office under this
      section, shall deposit the balance in the Treasury of the United
      States, in such manner as the Secretary of the Treasury directs.
      All funds held by the Secretary of the Treasury shall be invested
      in interest-bearing United States securities for later
      distribution with interest by the Librarian of Congress upon
      authorization by the Copyright Royalty Judges.
        (3) Distribution of royalty fees to copyright owners. - The
      royalty fees thus deposited shall, in accordance with the
      procedures provided by clause (4), be distributed to those among
      the following copyright owners who claim that their works were
      the subject of secondary transmissions by cable systems during
      the relevant semiannual period:
          (A) Any such owner whose work was included in a secondary
        transmission made by a cable system of a non-network television
        program in whole or in part beyond the local service area of
        the primary transmitter.
          (B) Any such owner whose work was included in a secondary
        transmission identified in a special statement of account
        deposited under clause (1)(A).
          (C) Any such owner whose work was included in non-network
        programming consisting exclusively of aural signals carried by
        a cable system in whole or in part beyond the local service
        area of the primary transmitter of such programs.

        (4) Procedures for royalty fee distribution. - The royalty fees
      thus deposited shall be distributed in accordance with the
      following procedures:
          (A) During the month of July in each year, every person
        claiming to be entitled to statutory license fees for secondary
        transmissions shall file a claim with the Copyright Royalty
        Judges, in accordance with requirements that the Copyright
        Royalty Judges shall prescribe by regulation. Notwithstanding
        any provisions of the antitrust laws, for purposes of this
        clause any claimants may agree among themselves as to the
        proportionate division of statutory licensing fees among them,
        may lump their claims together and file them jointly or as a
        single claim, or may designate a common agent to receive
        payment on their behalf.
          (B) After the first day of August of each year, the Copyright
        Royalty Judges shall determine whether there exists a
        controversy concerning the distribution of royalty fees. If the
        Copyright Royalty Judges determine that no such controversy
        exists, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall authorize the
        Librarian of Congress to proceed to distribute such fees to the
        copyright owners entitled to receive them, or to their
        designated agents, subject to the deduction of reasonable
        administrative costs under this section. If the Copyright
        Royalty Judges find the existence of a controversy, the
        Copyright Royalty Judges shall, pursuant to chapter 8 of this
        title, conduct a proceeding to determine the distribution of
        royalty fees.
          (C) During the pendency of any proceeding under this
        subsection, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall have the
        discretion to authorize the Librarian of Congress to proceed to
        distribute any amounts that are not in controversy.

        (5) 3.75 percent rate and syndicated exclusivity surcharge not
      applicable to multicast streams. - The royalty rates specified in
      sections 256.2(c) and 256.2(d) of title 37, Code of Federal
      Regulations (commonly referred to as the "3.75 percent rate" and
      the "syndicated exclusivity surcharge", respectively), as in
      effect on the date of the enactment of the Satellite Television
      Extension and Localism Act of 2010, as such rates may be
      adjusted, or such sections redesignated, thereafter by the
      Copyright Royalty Judges, shall not apply to the secondary
      transmission of a multicast stream.
        (6) Verification of accounts and fee payments. - The Register
      of Copyrights shall issue regulations to provide for the
      confidential verification by copyright owners whose works were
      embodied in the secondary transmissions of primary transmissions
      pursuant to this section of the information reported on the
      semiannual statements of account filed under this subsection for
      accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2010, in
      order that the auditor designated under subparagraph (A) is able
      to confirm the correctness of the calculations and royalty
      payments reported therein. The regulations shall - 
          (A) establish procedures for the designation of a qualified
        independent auditor - 
            (i) with exclusive authority to request verification of
          such a statement of account on behalf of all copyright owners
          whose works were the subject of secondary transmissions of
          primary transmissions by the cable system (that deposited the
          statement) during the accounting period covered by the
          statement; and
            (ii) who is not an officer, employee, or agent of any such
          copyright owner for any purpose other than such audit;

          (B) establish procedures for safeguarding all non-public
        financial and business information provided under this
        paragraph;
          (C)(i) require a consultation period for the independent
        auditor to review its conclusions with a designee of the cable
        system;
          (ii) establish a mechanism for the cable system to remedy any
        errors identified in the auditor's report and to cure any
        underpayment identified; and
          (iii) provide an opportunity to remedy any disputed facts or
        conclusions;
          (D) limit the frequency of requests for verification for a
        particular cable system and the number of audits that a
        multiple system operator can be required to undergo in a single
        year; and
          (E) permit requests for verification of a statement of
        account to be made only within 3 years after the last day of
        the year in which the statement of account is filed.

        (7) Acceptance of additional deposits. - Any royalty fee
      payments received by the Copyright Office from cable systems for
      the secondary transmission of primary transmissions that are in
      addition to the payments calculated and deposited in accordance
      with this subsection shall be deemed to have been deposited for
      the particular accounting period for which they are received and
      shall be distributed as specified under this subsection.

      (e) Nonsimultaneous Secondary Transmissions by Cable Systems. - 
        (1) Notwithstanding those provisions of the (!1) subsection
      (f)(2) relating to nonsimultaneous secondary transmissions by a
      cable system, any such transmissions are actionable as an act of
      infringement under section 501, and are fully subject to the
      remedies provided by sections 502 through 506 and section 510,
      unless - 

          (A) the program on the videotape is transmitted no more than
        one time to the cable system's subscribers;
          (B) the copyrighted program, episode, or motion picture
        videotape, including the commercials contained within such
        program, episode, or picture, is transmitted without deletion
        or editing;
          (C) an owner or officer of the cable system (i) prevents the
        duplication of the videotape while in the possession of the
        system, (ii) prevents unauthorized duplication while in the
        possession of the facility making the videotape for the system
        if the system owns or controls the facility, or takes
        reasonable precautions to prevent such duplication if it does
        not own or control the facility, (iii) takes adequate
        precautions to prevent duplication while the tape is being
        transported, and (iv) subject to paragraph (2), erases or
        destroys, or causes the erasure or destruction of, the
        videotape;
          (D) within forty-five days after the end of each calendar
        quarter, an owner or officer of the cable system executes an
        affidavit attesting (i) to the steps and precautions taken to
        prevent duplication of the videotape, and (ii) subject to
        paragraph (2), to the erasure or destruction of all videotapes
        made or used during such quarter;
          (E) such owner or officer places or causes each such
        affidavit, and affidavits received pursuant to paragraph
        (2)(C), to be placed in a file, open to public inspection, at
        such system's main office in the community where the
        transmission is made or in the nearest community where such
        system maintains an office; and
          (F) the nonsimultaneous transmission is one that the cable
        system would be authorized to transmit under the rules,
        regulations, and authorizations of the Federal Communications
        Commission in effect at the time of the nonsimultaneous
        transmission if the transmission had been made simultaneously,
        except that this subparagraph shall not apply to inadvertent or
        accidental transmissions.

        (2) If a cable system transfers to any person a videotape of a
      program nonsimultaneously transmitted by it, such transfer is
      actionable as an act of infringement under section 501, and is
      fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through
      506, except that, pursuant to a written, nonprofit contract
      providing for the equitable sharing of the costs of such
      videotape and its transfer, a videotape nonsimultaneously
      transmitted by it, in accordance with paragraph (1), may be
      transferred by one cable system in Alaska to another system in
      Alaska, by one cable system in Hawaii permitted to make such
      nonsimultaneous transmissions to another such cable system in
      Hawaii, or by one cable system in Guam, the Northern Mariana
      Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of
      Palau, or the Republic of the Marshall Islands, to another cable
      system in any of those five entities, if - 
          (A) each such contract is available for public inspection in
        the offices of the cable systems involved, and a copy of such
        contract is filed, within thirty days after such contract is
        entered into, with the Copyright Office (which Office shall
        make each such contract available for public inspection);
          (B) the cable system to which the videotape is transferred
        complies with paragraph (1)(A), (B), (C)(i), (iii), and (iv),
        and (D) through (F); and
          (C) such system provides a copy of the affidavit required to
        be made in accordance with paragraph (1)(D) to each cable
        system making a previous nonsimultaneous transmission of the
        same videotape.

        (3) This subsection shall not be construed to supersede the
      exclusivity protection provisions of any existing agreement, or
      any such agreement hereafter entered into, between a cable system
      and a television broadcast station in the area in which the cable
      system is located, or a network with which such station is
      affiliated.
        (4) As used in this subsection, the term "videotape" means the
      reproduction of the images and sounds of a program or programs
      broadcast by a television broadcast station licensed by the
      Federal Communications Commission, regardless of the nature of
      the material objects, such as tapes or films, in which the
      reproduction is embodied.

      (f) Definitions. - As used in this section, the following terms
    mean the following:
        (1) Primary transmission. - A "primary transmission" is a
      transmission made to the public by a transmitting facility whose
      signals are being received and further transmitted by a secondary
      transmission service, regardless of where or when the performance
      or display was first transmitted. In the case of a television
      broadcast station, the primary stream and any multicast streams
      transmitted by the station constitute primary transmissions.
        (2) Secondary transmission. - A "secondary transmission" is the
      further transmitting of a primary transmission simultaneously
      with the primary transmission, or nonsimultaneously with the
      primary transmission if by a cable system not located in whole or
      in part within the boundary of the forty-eight contiguous States,
      Hawaii, or Puerto Rico: Provided, however, That a nonsimultaneous
      further transmission by a cable system located in Hawaii of a
      primary transmission shall be deemed to be a secondary
      transmission if the carriage of the television broadcast signal
      comprising such further transmission is permissible under the
      rules, regulations, or authorizations of the Federal
      Communications Commission.
        (3) Cable system. - A "cable system" is a facility, located in
      any State, territory, trust territory, or possession of the
      United States, that in whole or in part receives signals
      transmitted or programs broadcast by one or more television
      broadcast stations licensed by the Federal Communications
      Commission, and makes secondary transmissions of such signals or
      programs by wires, cables, microwave, or other communications
      channels to subscribing members of the public who pay for such
      service. For purposes of determining the royalty fee under
      subsection (d)(1), two or more cable systems in contiguous
      communities under common ownership or control or operating from
      one headend shall be considered as one system.
        (4) Local service area of a primary transmitter. - The "local
      service area of a primary transmitter", in the case of both the
      primary stream and any multicast streams transmitted by a primary
      transmitter that is a television broadcast station, comprises the
      area where such primary transmitter could have insisted upon its
      signal being retransmitted by a cable system pursuant to the
      rules, regulations, and authorizations of the Federal
      Communications Commission in effect on April 15, 1976, or such
      station's television market as defined in section 76.55(e) of
      title 47, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on September
      18, 1993), or any modifications to such television market made,
      on or after September 18, 1993, pursuant to section 76.55(e) or
      76.59 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or within the
      noise-limited contour as defined in 73.622(e)(1) of title 47,
      Code of Federal Regulations, or in the case of a television
      broadcast station licensed by an appropriate governmental
      authority of Canada or Mexico, the area in which it would be
      entitled to insist upon its signal being retransmitted if it were
      a television broadcast station subject to such rules,
      regulations, and authorizations. In the case of a low power
      television station, the "local service area of a primary
      transmitter" comprises the area within 35 miles of the
      transmitter site, except that in the case of such a station
      located in a standard metropolitan statistical area which has one
      of the 50 largest populations of all standard metropolitan
      statistical areas (based on the 1980 decennial census of
      population taken by the Secretary of Commerce), the number of
      miles shall be 20 miles. The "local service area of a primary
      transmitter", in the case of a radio broadcast station, comprises
      the primary service area of such station, pursuant to the rules
      and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission.
        (5) Distant signal equivalent. - 
          (A) In general. - Except as provided under subparagraph (B),
        a "distant signal equivalent" - 
            (i) is the value assigned to the secondary transmission of
          any non-network television programming carried by a cable
          system in whole or in part beyond the local service area of
          the primary transmitter of such programming; and
            (ii) is computed by assigning a value of one to each
          primary stream and to each multicast stream (other than a
          simulcast) that is an independent station, and by assigning a
          value of one-quarter to each primary stream and to each
          multicast stream (other than a simulcast) that is a network
          station or a noncommercial educational station.

          (B) Exceptions. - The values for independent, network, and
        noncommercial educational stations specified in subparagraph
        (A) are subject to the following:
            (i) Where the rules and regulations of the Federal
          Communications Commission require a cable system to omit the
          further transmission of a particular program and such rules
          and regulations also permit the substitution of another
          program embodying a performance or display of a work in place
          of the omitted transmission, or where such rules and
          regulations in effect on the date of the enactment of the
          Copyright Act of 1976 (!2) permit a cable system, at its
          election, to effect such omission and substitution of a
          nonlive program or to carry additional programs not
          transmitted by primary transmitters within whose local
          service area the cable system is located, no value shall be
          assigned for the substituted or additional program.

            (ii) Where the rules, regulations, or authorizations of the
          Federal Communications Commission in effect on the date of
          the enactment of the Copyright Act of 1976 (!2) permit a
          cable system, at its election, to omit the further
          transmission of a particular program and such rules,
          regulations, or authorizations also permit the substitution
          of another program embodying a performance or display of a
          work in place of the omitted transmission, the value assigned
          for the substituted or additional program shall be, in the
          case of a live program, the value of one full distant signal
          equivalent multiplied by a fraction that has as its numerator
          the number of days in the year in which such substitution
          occurs and as its denominator the number of days in the year.
            (iii) In the case of the secondary transmission of a
          primary transmitter that is a television broadcast station
          pursuant to the late-night or specialty programming rules of
          the Federal Communications Commission, or the secondary
          transmission of a primary transmitter that is a television
          broadcast station on a part-time basis where full-time
          carriage is not possible because the cable system lacks the
          activated channel capacity to retransmit on a full-time basis
          all signals that it is authorized to carry, the values for
          independent, network, and noncommercial educational stations
          set forth in subparagraph (A), as the case may be, shall be
          multiplied by a fraction that is equal to the ratio of the
          broadcast hours of such primary transmitter retransmitted by
          the cable system to the total broadcast hours of the primary
          transmitter.
            (iv) No value shall be assigned for the secondary
          transmission of the primary stream or any multicast streams
          of a primary transmitter that is a television broadcast
          station in any community that is within the local service
          area of the primary transmitter.

        (6) Network station. - 
          (A) Treatment of primary stream. - The term "network station"
        shall be applied to a primary stream of a television broadcast
        station that is owned or operated by, or affiliated with, one
        or more of the television networks in the United States
        providing nationwide transmissions, and that transmits a
        substantial part of the programming supplied by such networks
        for a substantial part of the primary stream's typical
        broadcast day.
          (B) Treatment of multicast streams. - The term "network
        station" shall be applied to a multicast stream on which a
        television broadcast station transmits all or substantially all
        of the programming of an interconnected program service that - 
            (i) is owned or operated by, or affiliated with, one or
          more of the television networks described in subparagraph
          (A); and
            (ii) offers programming on a regular basis for 15 or more
          hours per week to at least 25 of the affiliated television
          licensees of the interconnected program service in 10 or more
          States.

        (7) Independent station. - The term "independent station" shall
      be applied to the primary stream or a multicast stream of a
      television broadcast station that is not a network station or a
      noncommercial educational station.
        (8) Noncommercial educational station. - The term
      "noncommercial educational station" shall be applied to the
      primary stream or a multicast stream of a television broadcast
      station that is a noncommercial educational broadcast station as
      defined in section 397 of the Communications Act of 1934, as in
      effect on the date of the enactment of the Satellite Television
      Extension and Localism Act of 2010.
        (9) Primary stream. - A "primary stream" is - 
          (A) the single digital stream of programming that, before
        June 12, 2009, was substantially duplicating the programming
        transmitted by the television broadcast station as an analog
        signal; or
          (B) if there is no stream described in subparagraph (A), then
        the single digital stream of programming transmitted by the
        television broadcast station for the longest period of time.

        (10) Primary transmitter. - A "primary transmitter" is a
      television or radio broadcast station licensed by the Federal
      Communications Commission, or by an appropriate governmental
      authority of Canada or Mexico, that makes primary transmissions
      to the public.
        (11) Multicast stream. - A "multicast stream" is a digital
      stream of programming that is transmitted by a television
      broadcast station and is not the station's primary stream.
        (12) Simulcast. - A "simulcast" is a multicast stream of a
      television broadcast station that duplicates the programming
      transmitted by the primary stream or another multicast stream of
      such station.
        (13) Subscriber; subscribe. - 
          (A) Subscriber. - The term "subscriber" means a person or
        entity that receives a secondary transmission service from a
        cable system and pays a fee for the service, directly or
        indirectly, to the cable system.
          (B) Subscribe. - The term "subscribe" means to elect to
        become a subscriber.

      Introduction and General Summary. The complex and economically
    important problem of "secondary transmissions" is considered in
    section 111. For the most part, the section is directed at the
    operation of cable television systems and the terms and conditions
    of their liability for the retransmission of copyrighted works.
    However, other forms of secondary transmissions are also
    considered, including apartment house and hotel systems, wired
    instructional systems, common carriers, nonprofit "boosters" and
    translators, and secondary transmissions of primary transmissions
    to controlled groups.
      Cable television systems are commercial subscription services
    that pick up broadcasts of programs originated by others and
    retransmit them to paying subscribers. A typical system consists of
    a central antenna which receives and amplifies television signals
    and a network of cables through which the signals are transmitted
    to the receiving sets of individual subscribers. In addition to an
    installation charge, the subscribers pay a monthly charge for the
    basic service averaging about six dollars. A large number of these
    systems provide automated programing. A growing number of CATV
    systems also originate programs, such as movies and sports, and
    charge additional fees for this service (pay-cable).
      The number of cable systems has grown very rapidly since their
    introduction in 1950, and now total about 3,450 operating systems,
    servicing 7,700 communities. Systems currently in operation reach
    about 10.8 million homes. It is reported that the 1975 total
    subscriber revenues of the cable industry were approximately $770
    million.
      Pursuant to two decisions of the Supreme Court (Fortnightly Corp.
    v. United Artist Television, Inc., 392 U.S. 390 (1968) [88 S.Ct.
    2084, 20 L.Ed.2d 1176, rehearing denied 89 S.Ct. 65, 393 U.S. 902,
    21 L.Ed.2d 190], and Teleprompter Corp. v. CBS, Inc., 415 U.S. 394
    (1974)) [94 S.Ct. 1129, 39 L.Ed.2d 415], under the 1909 copyright
    law, the cable television industry has not been paying copyright
    royalties for its retransmission of over-the-air broadcast signals.
    Both decisions urged the Congress, however, to consider and
    determine the scope and extent of such liability in the pending
    revision bill.
      The difficult problem of determining the copyright liability of
    cable television systems has been before the Congress since 1965.
    In 1967, this Committee sought to address and resolve the issues in
    H.R. 2512, an early version of the general revision bill (see H.R.
    Rep. No. 83, 90th Cong., 1st Sess.). However, largely because of
    the cable-copyright impasse, the bill died in the Senate.
      The history of the attempts to find a solution to the problem
    since 1967 has been explored thoroughly in the voluminous hearings
    and testimony on the general revision bill, and has also been
    succinctly summarized by the Register of Copyrights in her Second
    Supplementary Report, Chapter V.
      The Committee now has before it the Senate bill which contains a
    series of detailed and complex provisions which attempt to resolve
    the question of the copyright liability of cable television
    systems. After extensive consideration of the Senate bill, the
    arguments made during and after the hearings, and of the issues
    involved, this Committee has also concluded that there is no simple
    answer to the cable-copyright controversy. In particular, any
    statutory scheme that imposes copyright liability on cable
    television systems must take account of the intricate and
    complicated rules and regulations adopted by the Federal
    Communications Commission to govern the cable television industry.
    While the Committee has carefully avoided including in the bill any
    provisions which would interfere with the FCC's rules or which
    might be characterized as affecting "communications policy", the
    Committee has been cognizant of the interplay between the copyright
    and the communications elements of the legislation.
      We would, therefore, caution the Federal Communications
    Commission, and others who make determinations concerning
    communications policy, not to rely upon any action of this
    Committee as a basis for any significant changes in the delicate
    balance of regulation in areas where the Congress has not resolved
    the issue. Specifically, we would urge the Federal Communications
    Commission to understand that it was not the intent of this bill to
    touch on issues such as pay cable regulation or increased use of
    imported distant signals. These matters are ones of communications
    policy and should be left to the appropriate committees in the
    Congress for resolution.
      In general, the Committee believes that cable systems are
    commercial enterprises whose basic retransmission operations are
    based on the carriage of copyrighted program material and that
    copyright royalties should be paid by cable operators to the
    creators of such programs. The Committee recognizes, however, that
    it would be impractical and unduly burdensome to require every
    cable system to negotiate with every copyright owner whose work was
    retransmitted by a cable system. Accordingly, the Committee has
    determined to maintain the basic principle of the Senate bill to
    establish a compulsory copyright license for the retransmission of
    those over-the-air broadcast signals that a cable system is
    authorized to carry pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
    FCC.
      The compulsory license is conditioned, however, on certain
    requirements and limitations. These include compliance with
    reporting requirements, payment of the royalty fees established in
    the bill, a ban on the substitution or deletion of commercial
    advertising, and geographic limits on the compulsory license for
    copyrighted programs broadcast by Canadian or Mexican stations.
    Failure to comply with these requirements and limitations subjects
    a cable system to a suit for copyright infringement and the
    remedies provided under the bill for such actions.
      In setting a royalty fee schedule for the compulsory license, the
    Committee determined that the initial schedule should be
    established in the bill. It recognized, however, that adjustments
    to the schedule would be required from time to time. Accordingly,
    the Copyright Royalty Commission, established in chapter 8 [Sec.
    801 et seq. of this title], is empowered to make the adjustments in
    the initial rates, at specified times, based on standards and
    conditions set forth in the bill.
      In setting an initial fee schedule, the Senate bill based the
    royalty fee on a sliding scale related to the gross receipts of a
    cable system for providing the basic retransmission service and
    rejected a statutory scheme that would distinguish between "local"
    and "distant" signals. The Committee determined, however, that
    there was no evidence that the retransmission of "local" broadcast
    signals by a cable operator threatens the existing market for
    copyright program owners. Similarly, the retransmission of network
    programing, including network programing which is broadcast in
    "distant" markets, does not injure the copyright owner. The
    copyright owner contracts with the network on the basis of his
    programing reaching all markets served by the network and is
    compensated accordingly.
      By contrast, their retransmission of distant non-network
    programing by cable systems causes damage to the copyright owner by
    distributing the program in an area beyond which it has been
    licensed. Such retransmission adversely affects the ability of the
    copyright owner to exploit the work in the distant market. It is
    also of direct benefit to the cable system by enhancing its ability
    to attract subscribers and increase revenues. For these reasons,
    the Committee has concluded that the copyright liability of cable
    television systems under the compulsory license should be limited
    to the retransmission of distant non-network programing.
      In implementing this conclusion, the Committee generally followed
    a proposal submitted by the cable and motion picture industries,
    the two industries most directly affected by the establishment of
    copyright royalties for cable television systems. Under the
    proposal, the royalty fee is determined by a two step computation.
    First, a value called a "distant signal equivalent" is assigned to
    all "distant" signals. Distant signals are defined as signals
    retransmitted by a cable system, in whole or in part, outside the
    local service area of the primary transmitter. Different values are
    assigned to independent, network, and educational stations because
    of the different amounts of viewing of non-network programing
    carried by such stations. For example, the viewing of non-network
    programs on network stations is considered to approximate 25
    percent. These values are then combined and a scale of percentages
    is applied to the cumulative total.
      The Committee also considered various proposals to exempt certain
    categories of cable systems from royalty payments altogether. The
    Committee determined that the approach of the Senate bill to
    require some payment by every cable system is sound, but
    established separate fee schedules for cable systems whose gross
    receipts for the basic retransmission service do not exceed either
    $80,000 or $160,000 semiannually. It is the Committee's view that
    the fee schedules adopted for these systems are now appropriate,
    based on their relative size and the services performed.
      All the royalty payments required under the bill are paid on a
    semiannual basis to the Register of Copyrights. Each year they are
    distributed by the Copyright Royalty Commission to those copyright
    owners who may validly claim that their works were the subject of
    distant non-network retransmissions by cable systems.
      Based on current estimates supplied to the Committee, the total
    royalty fees paid under the initial schedule established in the
    bill should approximate $8.7 million. Compared with the present
    number of cable television subscribers, calculated at 10.8 million,
    copyright payments under the bill would therefore approximate 81
    cents per subscriber per year. The Committee believes that such
    payments are modest and will not retard the orderly development of
    the cable television industry or the service it provides to its
    subscribers.
      Analysis of Provisions. Throughout section 111, the operative
    terms are "primary transmission" and "secondary transmission."
    These terms are defined in subsection (f) entirely in relation to
    each other. In any particular case, the "primary" transmitter is
    the one whose signals are being picked up and further transmitted
    by a "secondary" transmitter which in turn, is someone engaged in
    "the further transmitting of a primary transmission simultaneously
    with the primary transmission." With one exception provided in
    subsection (f) and limited by subsection (e), the section does not
    cover or permit a cable system, or indeed any person, to tape or
    otherwise record a program off-the-air and later to transmit the
    program from the tape or record to the public. The one exception
    involves cable systems located outside the continental United
    States, but not including cable systems in Puerto Rico, or, with
    limited exceptions, Hawaii. These systems are permitted to record
    and retransmit programs under the compulsory license, subject to
    the restrictive conditions of subsection (e), because off-the-air
    signals are generally not available in the offshore areas.
      General Exemptions. Certain secondary transmissions are given a
    general exemption under clause (1) of section 111(a). The first of
    these applies to secondary transmissions consisting "entirely of
    the relaying, by the management of a hotel, apartment house, or
    similar establishment" of a transmission to the private lodgings of
    guests or residents and provided "no direct charge is made to see
    or hear the secondary transmission."
      The exemption would not apply if the secondary transmission
    consists of anything other than the mere relay of ordinary
    broadcasts. The cutting out of advertising, the running in of new
    commercials, or any other change in the signal relayed would
    subject the secondary transmitter to full liability. Moreover, the
    term "private lodgings" is limited to rooms used as living quarters
    or for private parties, and does not include dining rooms, meeting
    halls, theatres, ballrooms, or similar places that are outside of a
    normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances. No special
    exception is needed to make clear that the mere placing of an
    ordinary radio or television set in a private hotel room does not
    constitute an infringement.
      Secondary Transmissions of Instructional Broadcasts. Clause (2)
    of section 111(a) is intended to make clear that an instructional
    transmission within the scope of section 110(2) is exempt whether
    it is a "primary transmission" or a "secondary transmission."
      Carriers. The general exemption under section 111 extends to
    secondary transmitters that act solely as passive carriers. Under
    clause (3), a carrier is exempt if it "has no direct or indirect
    control over the content or selection of the primary transmission
    or over the particular recipients of the secondary transmission."
    For this purpose its activities must "consist solely of providing
    wires, cables, or other communications channels for the use of
    others."
      Clause (4) would exempt the activities of secondary transmitters
    that operate on a completely nonprofit basis. The operations of
    nonprofit "translators" or "boosters," which do nothing more than
    amplify broadcast signals and retransmit them to everyone in an
    area for free reception, would be exempt if there is no "purpose of
    direct or indirect commercial advantage," and if there is no charge
    to the recipients "other than assessments necessary to defray the
    actual and reasonable costs of maintaining and operating the
    secondary transmission service." This exemption does not apply to a
    cable television system.
      Secondary Transmissions of Primary Transmissions to Controlled
    Group. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (c),
    the secondary transmission to the public of a primary transmission
    embodying a performance or display is actionable as an act of
    infringement if the primary transmission is not made for reception
    by the public at large but is controlled and limited to reception
    by particular members of the public. Examples of transmissions not
    intended for the general public are background music services such
    as MUZAK, closed circuit broadcasts to theatres, pay television
    (STV) or pay-cable.
      The Senate bill contains a provision, however, stating that the
    secondary transmission does not constitute an act of infringement
    if the carriage of the signals comprising the secondary
    transmission is required under the rules and regulations of the
    FCC. The exclusive purpose of this provision is to exempt a cable
    system from copyright liability if the FCC should require cable
    systems to carry to their subscribers a "scrambled" pay signal of a
    subscription television station.
      The Committee is concerned, however, that the Senate bill is not
    clearly limited to the situation where a cable system is required
    by the FCC to carry a "scrambled" pay television signal. The
    Committee believes that the provision should not include any
    authority or permission to "unscramble" the signal. Further, the
    Senate bill does not make clear that the exception would not apply
    if the primary transmission is made by a cable system or cable
    system network transmitting its own originated program, e.g., pay-
    cable. For these reasons, the subsection was amended to provide
    that the exception would only apply if (1) the primary transmission
    to a controlled group is made by a broadcast station licensed by
    the FCC; (2) the carriage of the signal is required by FCC rules
    and regulations; and (3) the signal of the primary transmitter is
    not altered or changed in any way by the secondary transmitter.
      Compulsory License. Section 111(c) establishes the compulsory
    license for cable systems generally. It provides that, subject to
    the provisions of clauses (2), (3) and (4), the secondary
    transmission to the public by a cable system of a primary
    transmission made by a broadcast station licensed by the FCC or by
    an appropriate governmental authority of Canada or Mexico is
    subject to compulsory licensing upon compliance with the provisions
    of subsection (d) where the carriage of the signals comprising the
    secondary transmission is permissible under the rules and
    regulations of the FCC. The compulsory license applies, therefore,
    to the carriage of over-the-air broadcast signals and is
    inapplicable to the secondary transmission of any nonbroadcast
    primary transmission such as a program originated by a cable system
    or a cable network. The latter would be subject to full copyright
    liability under other sections of the legislation.
      Limitations on the Compulsory License. Sections 111(c)(2), (3)
    and (4) establish limitations on the scope of the compulsory
    license, and provide that failure to comply with these limitations
    subjects a cable system to a suit for infringement and all the
    remedies provided in the legislation for such actions.
      Section 111(c)(2) provides that the "willful or repeated"
    carriage of signals not permissible under the rules and regulations
    of the FCC subjects a cable system to full copyright liability. The
    words "willful or repeated" are used to prevent a cable system from
    being subjected to severe penalties for innocent or casual acts
    ("Repeated" does not mean merely "more than once," of course;
    rather, it denotes a degree of aggravated negligence which borders
    on willfulness. Such a condition would not exist in the case of an
    innocent mistake as to what signals or programs may properly be
    carried under the FCC's complicated rules). Section 111(c)(2) also
    provides that a cable system is subject to full copyright liability
    where the cable system has not recorded the notice, deposited the
    statement of account, or paid the royalty fee required by
    subsection (d). The Committee does not intend, however, that a good
    faith error by the cable system in computing the amount due would
    subject it to full liability as an infringer. The Committee expects
    that in most instances of this type the parties would be able to
    work out the problem without resort to the courts.
      Commercial Substitution. Section 111(c)(3) provides that a cable
    system is fully subject to the remedies provided in this
    legislation for copyright infringement if the cable system
    willfully alters, through changes, deletions, or additions, the
    content of a particular program or any commercial advertising or
    station announcements transmitted by the primary transmitter
    during, or immediately before or after, the transmission of the
    program. In the Committee's view, any willful deletion,
    substitution, or insertion of commercial advertisements of any
    nature by a cable system or changes in the program content of the
    primary transmission, significantly alters the basic nature of the
    cable retransmission service, and makes its function similar to
    that of a broadcaster. Further, the placement of substitute
    advertising in a program by a cable system on a "local" signal
    harms the advertiser and, in turn, the copyright owner, whose
    compensation for the work is directly related to the size of the
    audience that the advertiser's message is calculated to reach. On a
    "distant" signal, the placement of substitute advertising harms the
    local broadcaster in the distant market because the cable system is
    then competing for local advertising dollars without having
    comparable program costs. The Committee has therefore attempted
    broadly to proscribe the availability of the compulsory license if
    a cable system substitutes commercial messages. Included in the
    prohibition are commercial messages and station announcements not
    only during, but also immediately before or after the program, so
    as to insure a continuous ban on commercial substitution from one
    program to another. In one situation, however, the Committee has
    permitted such substitution when the commercials are inserted by
    those engaged in television commercial advertising market research.
    This exception is limited to those situations where the research
    company has obtained the consent of the advertiser who purchased
    the original commercial advertisement, the television station whose
    signal is retransmitted, and the cable system, and provided further
    that no income is derived from the sale of such commercial time.
      Canadian and Mexican Signals. Section 111(c)(4) provides
    limitations on the compulsory license with respect to foreign
    signals carried by cable systems from Canada or Mexico. Under the
    Senate bill, the carriage of any foreign signals by a cable system
    would have been subject to full copyright liability, because the
    compulsory license was limited to the retransmission of broadcast
    stations licensed by the FCC. The Committee recognized, however,
    that cable systems primarily along the northern and southern border
    have received authorization from the FCC to carry broadcast signals
    of certain Canadian and Mexican stations.
      In the Committee's view, the authorization by the FCC to a cable
    system to carry a foreign signal does not resolve the copyright
    question of the royalty payment that should be made for copyrighted
    programs originating in the foreign country. The latter raises
    important international questions of the protection to be accorded
    foreign copyrighted works in the United States. While the Committee
    has established a general compulsory licensing scheme for the
    retransmission of copyrighted works of U.S. nationals, a broad
    compulsory license scheme for all foreign works does not appear
    warranted or justified. Thus, for example, if in the future the
    signal of a British, French, or Japanese station were retransmitted
    in the United States by a cable system, full copyright liability
    would apply.
      With respect to Canadian and Mexican signals, the Committee found
    that a special situation exists regarding the carriage of these
    signals by U.S. cable systems on the northern and southern borders,
    respectively. The Committee determined, therefore, that with
    respect to Canadian signals the compulsory license would apply in
    an area located 150 miles from the U.S.-Canadian border, or south
    from the border to the 42nd parallel of latitude, whichever
    distance is greater. Thus the cities of Detroit, Pittsburgh,
    Cleveland, Green Bay and Seattle would be included within the
    compulsory license area, while cities such as New York,
    Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco would be located outside
    the area.
      With respect to Mexican signals, the Commission determined that
    the compulsory license would apply only in the area in which such
    signals may be received by a U.S. cable system by means of direct
    interception of a free space radio wave. Thus, full copyright
    liability would apply if a cable system were required to use any
    equipment or device other than a receiving antenna to bring the
    signal to the community of the cable system.
      Further, to take account of those cable systems that are
    presently carrying or are specifically authorized to carry Canadian
    or Mexican signals, pursuant to FCC rules and regulations, and
    whether or not within the zones established, the Committee
    determined to grant a compulsory license for the carriage of those
    specific signals on those cable systems as in effect on April 15,
    1976.
      The Committee wishes to stress that cable systems operating
    within these zones are fully subject to the payment of royalty fees
    under the compulsory license for those foreign signals
    retransmitted. The copyright owners of the works transmitted may
    appear before the Copyright Royalty Commission and, pursuant to the
    provisions of this legislation, file claims to their fair share of
    the royalties collected. Outside the zones, however, full copyright
    liability would apply as would all the remedies of the legislation
    for any act of infringement.
      Requirements for a Compulsory License. The compulsory license
    provided for in section 111(c) is contingent upon fulfillment of
    the requirements set forth in section 111(d). Subsection (d)(1)
    directs that at least one month before the commencement of
    operations, or within 180 days after the enactment of this act
    [Oct. 19, 1976], whichever is later, a cable system must record in
    the Copyright Office a notice, including a statement giving the
    identity and address of the person who owns or operates the
    secondary transmission service or who has power to exercise primary
    control over it, together with the name and location of the primary
    transmitter whose signals are regularly carried by the cable
    system. Signals "regularly carried" by the system mean those
    signals which the Federal Communications Commission has
    specifically authorized the cable system to carry, and which are
    actually carried by the system on a regular basis. It is also
    required that whenever the ownership or control or regular signal
    carriage complement of the system changes, the cable system must
    within 30 days record any such changes in the Copyright Office.
    Cable systems must also record such further information as the
    Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.
      Subsection (d)(2) directs cable systems whose secondary
    transmissions have been subject to compulsory licensing under
    subsection (c) to deposit with the Register of Copyrights a semi-
    annual statement of account. The dates for filing such statements
    of account and the six-month period which they are to cover are to
    be determined by the Register of Copyrights after consultation with
    the Copyright Royalty Commission. In addition to other such
    information that the Register may prescribe by regulation, the
    statements of account are to specify the number of channels on
    which the cable system made secondary transmissions to its
    subscribers, the names and locations of all primary transmitters
    whose transmissions were carried by the system, the total number of
    subscribers to the system, and the gross amounts paid to the system
    for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions. If any
    non-network television programming was retransmitted by the cable
    system beyond the local service area of the primary transmitter,
    pursuant to the rules of the Federal Communications Commission,
    which under certain circumstances permit the substitution or
    addition of television signals not regularly carried, the cable
    system must deposit a special statement of account listing the
    times, dates, stations and programs involved in such substituted or
    added carriage.
      Copyright Royalty Payments. Subsection (d)(2)(B), (C) and (D)
    require cable systems to deposit royalty fee payments for the
    period covered by the statements of account. These payments are to
    be computed on the basis of specified percentages of the gross
    receipts from cable subscribers during the period covered by the
    statement. For purposes of computing royalty payments, only
    receipts for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions
    of primary broadcast transmitters are to be considered. Other
    receipts from subscribers, such as those for pay-cable services or
    installation charges, are not included in gross receipts.
      Subsection (d)(2)(B) provides that, except in the case of a cable
    system that comes within the gross receipts limitations of
    subclauses (C) and (D), the royalty fee is computed in the
    following manner:
      Every cable system pays .675 of 1 percent of its gross receipts
    for the privilege of retransmitting distant non-network
    programming, such amount to be applied against the fee, if any,
    payable under the computation for "distant signal equivalents." The
    latter are determined by adding together the values assigned to the
    actual number of distant television stations carried by a cable
    system. The purpose of this initial rate, applicable to all cable
    systems in this class, is to establish a basic payment, whether or
    not a particular cable system elects to transmit distant non-
    network programming. It is not a payment for the retransmission of
    purely "local" signals, as is evident from the provision that it
    applies to and is deductible from the fee payable for any "distant
    signal equivalents."
      The remaining provisions of subclause (B) establish the following
    rates for "distant signal equivalents:"
      The rate from zero to one distant signal equivalent is .675 of 1
    percent of gross subscriber revenues. An additional .425 of 1
    percent of gross subscriber revenues is to be paid for each of the
    second, third and fourth distant signal equivalents that are
    carried. A further payment of .2 of 1 percent of gross subscriber
    revenues is to be made for each distant signal equivalent after the
    fourth. Any fraction of a distant signal equivalent is to be
    computed at its fractional value and where a cable system is
    located partly within and partly without the local service area of
    a primary transmitter, the gross receipts subject to the percentage
    payment are limited to those gross receipts derived from
    subscribers located without the local service area of such primary
    transmitter.
      Pursuant to the foregoing formula, copyright payments as a
    percentage of gross receipts increase as the number of distant
    television signals carried by a cable system increases. Because
    many smaller cable systems carry a large number of distant signals,
    especially those located in areas where over-the-air television
    service is sparse, and because smaller cable systems may be less
    able to shoulder the burden of copyright payments than larger
    systems, the Committee decided to give special consideration to
    cable systems with semi-annual gross subscriber receipts of less
    than $160,000 ($320,000 annually). The royalty fee schedules for
    cable systems in this category are specified in subclauses (C) and
    (D).
      In lieu of the payments required in subclause (B), systems
    earning less than $80,000, semi-annually, are to pay a royalty fee
    of .5 of 1 percent of gross receipts. Gross receipts under this
    provision are computed, however, by subtracting from actual gross
    receipts collected during the payment period the amount by which
    $80,000 exceeds such actual gross receipts. Thus, if the actual
    gross receipts of the cable system for the period covered are
    $60,000, the fee is determined by subtracting $20,000 (the amount
    by which $80,000 exceeds actual gross receipts) from $60,000 and
    applying .5 of 1 percent to the $40,000 result. However, gross
    receipts in no case are to be reduced to less than $3,000.
      Under subclause (D), cable systems with semi-annual gross
    subscriber receipts of between $80,000 and $160,000 are to pay
    royalty fees of .5 of 1 percent of such actual gross receipts up to
    $80,000, and 1 percent of any actual gross receipts in excess of
    $80,000. The royalty fee payments under both subclauses (C) and (D)
    are to be determined without regard to the number of distant signal
    equivalents, if any, carried by the subject cable systems.
      Copyright Royalty Distribution. Section 111(d)(3) provides that
    the royalty fees paid by cable systems under the compulsory license
    shall be received by the Register of Copyrights and, after
    deducting the reasonable costs incurred by the Copyright Office,
    deposited in the Treasury of the United States. The fees are
    distributed subsequently, pursuant to the determination of the
    Copyright Royalty Commission under chapter 8 [Sec. 801 et seq. of
    this title].
      The copyright owners entitled to participate in the distribution
    of the royalty fees paid by cable systems under the compulsory
    license are specified in section 111(d)(4). Consistent with the
    Committee's view that copyright royalty fees should be made only
    for the retransmission of distant non-network programming, the
    claimants are limited to (1) copyright owners whose works were
    included in a secondary transmission made by a cable system of a
    distant non-network television program; (2) any copyright owner
    whose work is included in a secondary transmission identified in a
    special statement of account deposited under section 111(d)(2)(A);
    and (3) any copyright owner whose work was included in distant non-
    network programming consisting exclusively of aural signals. Thus,
    no royalty fees may be claimed or distributed to copyright owners
    for the retransmission of either "local" or "network" programs.
      The Committee recognizes that the bill does not include specific
    provisions to guide the Copyright Royalty Commission in determining
    the appropriate division among competing copyright owners of the
    royalty fees collected from cable systems under Section 111. The
    Committee concluded that it would not be appropriate to specify
    particular, limiting standards for distribution. Rather, the
    Committee believes that the Copyright Royalty Commission should
    consider all pertinent data and considerations presented by the
    claimants.
      Should disputes arise, however, between the different classes of
    copyright claimants, the Committee believes that the Copyright
    Royalty Commission should consider that with respect to the
    copyright owners of "live" programs identified by the special
    statement of account deposited under Section 111(d)(2)(A), a
    special payment is provided in Section 111(f).
      Section 111(d)(5) sets forth the procedure for the distribution
    of the royalty fees paid by cable systems. During the month of July
    of each year, every person claiming to be entitled to compulsory
    license fees must file a claim with the Copyright Royalty
    Commission, in accordance with such provisions as the Commission
    shall establish. In particular, the Commission may establish the
    relevant period covered by such claims after giving adequate time
    for copyright owners to review and consider the statements of
    account filed by cable systems. Notwithstanding any provisions of
    the antitrust laws, the claimants may agree among themselves as to
    the division and distribution of such fees. After the first day of
    August of each year, the Copyright Royalty Commission shall
    determine whether a controversy exists concerning the distribution
    of royalty fees. If no controversy exists, the Commission, after
    deducting its reasonable administrative costs, shall distribute the
    fees to the copyright owners entitled or their agents. If the
    Commission finds the existence of a controversy, it shall, pursuant
    to the provisions of chapter 8 [Sec. 801 et seq. of this title],
    conduct a proceeding to determine the distribution of royalty fees.
      Off-Shore Taping by Cable Systems. Section 111(e) establishes the
    conditions and limitation upon which certain cable systems located
    outside the continental United States, and specified in subsection
    (f), may make tapes of copyrighted programs and retransmit the
    taped programs to their subscribers upon payment of the compulsory
    license fee. These conditions and limitations include compliance
    with detailed transmission, record keeping, and other requirements.
    Their purpose is to control carefully the use of any tapes made
    pursuant to the limited recording and retransmission authority
    established in subsection (f), and to insure that the limited
    objective of assimilating offshore cable systems to systems within
    the United States for purposes of the compulsory license is not
    exceeded. Any secondary transmission by a cable system entitled to
    the benefits of the taping authorization that does not comply with
    the requirements of section 111(e) is an act of infringement and is
    fully subject to all the remedies provided in the legislation for
    such actions.
      Definitions. Section 111(f) contains a series of definitions.
    These definitions are found in subsection (f) rather than in
    section 101 because of their particular application to secondary
    transmissions by cable systems.
      Primary and Secondary Transmissions. The definitions of "primary
    transmission" and "secondary transmission" have been discussed
    above. The definition of "secondary transmission" also contains a
    provision permitting the nonsimultaneous retransmission of a
    primary transmission if by a cable system "not located in whole or
    in part within the boundary of the forty-eight contiguous states,
    Hawaii or Puerto Rico." Under a proviso, however, a cable system in
    Hawaii may make a nonsimultaneous retransmission of a primary
    transmission if the carriage of the television broadcast signal
    comprising such further transmission is permissible under the
    rules, regulations or authorizations of the FCC.
      The effect of this definition is to permit certain cable systems
    in offshore areas, but not including cable systems in the offshore
    area of Puerto Rico and to a limited extent only in Hawaii, to tape
    programs and retransmit them to subscribers under the compulsory
    license. Puerto Rico was excluded based upon a communication the
    Committee received from the Governor of Puerto Rico stating that
    the particular television broadcasting problems which the
    definition seeks to solve for cable systems in other noncontiguous
    areas do not exist in Puerto Rico. He therefore requested that
    Puerto Rico be excluded from the scope of the definition. All cable
    systems covered by the definition are subject to the conditions and
    limitations for nonsimultaneous transmissions established in
    section 111(e).
      Cable System. The definition of a "cable system" establishes that
    it is a facility that in whole or in part receives signals of one
    or more television broadcast stations licensed by the FCC and makes
    secondary transmissions of such signals to subscribing members of
    the public who pay for such service. A closed circuit wire system
    that only originates programs and does not carry television
    broadcast signals would not come within the definition. Further,
    the definition provides that, in determining the applicable royalty
    fee and system classification under subsection (d)(2)(B), (C), or
    (D) cable systems in contiguous communities under common ownership
    or control or operating from one headend are considered as one
    system.
      Local Service Area of a Primary Transmitter. The definition of
    "local service area of a primary transmitter" establishes the
    difference between "local" and "distant" signals and therefore the
    line between signals which are subject to payment under the
    compulsory license and those that are not. It provides that the
    local service area of a television broadcast station is the area in
    which the station is entitled to insist upon its signal being
    retransmitted by a cable system pursuant to FCC rules and
    regulations. Under FCC rules and regulations this so-called "must
    carry" area is defined based on the market size and position of
    cable systems in 47 C.F.R. Secs. 76.57, 76.59, 76.61 and 76.63. The
    definition is limited, however, to the FCC rules in effect on April
    15, 1976. The purpose of this limitation is to insure that any
    subsequent rule amendments by the FCC that either increase or
    decrease the size of the local service area for its purposes do not
    change the definition for copyright purposes. The Committee
    believes that any such change for copyright purposes, which would
    materially affect the royalty fee payments provided in the
    legislation, should only be made by an amendment to the statute.
      The "local service area of a primary transmitter" of a Canadian
    or Mexican television station is defined as the area in which such
    station would be entitled to insist upon its signals being
    retransmitted if it were a television broadcast station subject to
    FCC rules and regulations. Since the FCC does not permit a
    television station licensed in a foreign country to assert a claim
    to carriage by a U.S. cable system, the local service area of such
    foreign station is considered to be the same area as if it were a
    U.S. station.
      The local service area for a radio broadcast station is defined
    to mean "the primary service area of such station pursuant to the
    rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission."
    The term "primary service area" is defined precisely by the FCC
    with regard to AM stations in Section 73.11(a) of the FCC's rules.
    In the case of FM stations, "primary service area" is regarded by
    the FCC as the area included within the field strength contours
    specified in Section 73.311 of its rules.
      Distant Signal Equivalent. The definition of a "distant signal
    equivalent" is central to the computation of the royalty fees
    payable under the compulsory license. It is the value assigned to
    the secondary transmission of any non-network television
    programming carried by a cable system, in whole or in part, beyond
    the local service area of the primary transmitter of such
    programming. It is computed by assigning a value of one (1) to each
    distant independent station and a value of one-quarter ( 1/4 ) to
    each distant network station and distant noncommercial educational
    station carried by a cable system, pursuant to the rules and
    regulations of the FCC. Thus, a cable system carrying two distant
    independent stations, two distant network stations and one distant
    noncommercial educational station would have a total of 2.75
    distant signal equivalents.
      The values assigned to independent, network and noncommercial
    educational stations are subject, however, to certain exceptions
    and limitations. Two of these relate to the mandatory and
    discretionary program deletion and substitution rules of the FCC.
    Where the FCC rules require a cable system to omit certain programs
    (e.g., the syndicated program exclusivity rules) and also permit
    the substitution of another program in place of the omitted
    program, no additional value is assigned for the substituted or
    additional program. Further, where the FCC rules on the date of
    enactment of this legislation permit a cable system, at its
    discretion, to make such deletions or substitutions or to carry
    additional programs not transmitted by primary transmitters within
    whose local service area the cable system is located, no additional
    value is assigned for the substituted or additional programs.
    However, the latter discretionary exception is subject to a
    condition that if the substituted or additional program is a "live"
    program (e.g., a sports event), then an additional value is
    assigned to the carriage of the distant signal computed as a
    fraction of one distant signal equivalent. The fraction is
    determined by assigning to the numerator the number of days in the
    year on which the "live" substitution occurs, and by assigning to
    the denominator the number of days in the year. Further, the
    discretionary exception is limited to those FCC rules in effect on
    the date of enactment of this legislation [Oct. 19, 1976]. If
    subsequent FCC rule amendments or individual authorizations enlarge
    the discretionary ability of cable systems to delete and substitute
    programs, such deletions and substitutions would be counted at the
    full value assigned the particular type of station provided above.
      Two further exceptions pertain to the late-night or specialty
    programming rules of the FCC or to a station carried on a part-time
    basis where full-time carriage is not possible because the cable
    system lacks the activated channel capacity to retransmit on a full-
    time basis all signals which it is authorized to carry. In this
    event, the values for independent, network and noncommercial,
    educational stations set forth above, as the case may be, are
    determined by multiplying each by a fraction which is equal to the
    ratio of the broadcast hours of such station carried by the cable
    system to the total broadcast hours of the station.
      Network Station. A "network station" is defined as a television
    broadcast station that is owned or operated by, or affiliated with,
    one or more of the U.S. television networks providing nationwide
    transmissions and that transmits a substantial part of the
    programming supplied by such networks for a substantial part of
    that station's typical broadcast day. To qualify as a network
    station, all the conditions of the definition must be met. Thus,
    the retransmission of a Canadian station affiliated with a Canadian
    network would not qualify under the definition. Further, a station
    affiliated with a regional network would not qualify, since a
    regional network would not provide nationwide transmissions.
    However, a station affiliated with a network providing nationwide
    transmissions that also occasionally carries regional programs
    would qualify as a "network station," if the station transmits a
    substantial part of the programming supplied by the network for a
    substantial part of the station's typical broadcast day.
      Independent Station. An "independent station" is defined as a
    commercial television broadcast station other than a network
    station. Any commercial station that does not fall within the
    definition of "network station" is classified as an "independent
    station."
      Noncommercial Educational Station. A "noncommercial educational
    station" is defined as a television station that is a noncommercial
    educational broadcast station within the meaning of section 397 of
    title 47 [47 U.S.C. 397].

    CHAPTER 1 - SUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE OF COPYRIGHT

-HEAD-
    Sec. 112. Limitations on exclusive rights: Ephemeral recordings

-STATUTE-
      (a)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, and except
    in the case of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, it is
    not an infringement of copyright for a transmitting organization
    entitled to transmit to the public a performance or display of a
    work, under a license, including a statutory license under section
    114(f), or transfer of the copyright or under the limitations on
    exclusive rights in sound recordings specified by section 114(a),
    or for a transmitting organization that is a broadcast radio or
    television station licensed as such by the Federal Communications
    Commission and that makes a broadcast transmission of a performance
    of a sound recording in a digital format on a nonsubscription
    basis, to make no more than one copy or phonorecord of a particular
    transmission program embodying the performance or display, if - 
        (A) the copy or phonorecord is retained and used solely by the
      transmitting organization that made it, and no further copies or
      phonorecords are reproduced from it; and
        (B) the copy or phonorecord is used solely for the transmitting
      organization's own transmissions within its local service area,
      or for purposes of archival preservation or security; and
        (C) unless preserved exclusively for archival purposes, the
      copy or phonorecord is destroyed within six months from the date
      the transmission program was first transmitted to the public.

      (2) In a case in which a transmitting organization entitled to
    make a copy or phonorecord under paragraph (1) in connection with
    the transmission to the public of a performance or display of a
    work is prevented from making such copy or phonorecord by reason of
    the application by the copyright owner of technical measures that
    prevent the reproduction of the work, the copyright owner shall
    make available to the transmitting organization the necessary means
    for permitting the making of such copy or phonorecord as permitted
    under that paragraph, if it is technologically feasible and
    economically reasonable for the copyright owner to do so. If the
    copyright owner fails to do so in a timely manner in light of the
    transmitting organization's reasonable business requirements, the
    transmitting organization shall not be liable for a violation of
    section 1201(a)(1) of this title for engaging in such activities as
    are necessary to make such copies or phonorecords as permitted
    under paragraph (1) of this subsection.
      (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is not an
    infringement of copyright for a governmental body or other
    nonprofit organization entitled to transmit a performance or
    display of a work, under section 110(2) or under the limitations on
    exclusive rights in sound recordings specified by section 114(a),
    to make no more than thirty copies or phonorecords of a particular
    transmission program embodying the performance or display, if - 
        (1) no further copies or phonorecords are reproduced from the
      copies or phonorecords made under this clause; and
        (2) except for one copy or phonorecord that may be preserved
      exclusively for archival purposes, the copies or phonorecords are
      destroyed within seven years from the date the transmission
      program was first transmitted to the public.

      (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is not an
    infringement of copyright for a governmental body or other
    nonprofit organization to make for distribution no more than one
    copy or phonorecord, for each transmitting organization specified
    in clause (2) of this subsection, of a particular transmission
    program embodying a performance of a nondramatic musical work of a
    religious nature, or of a sound recording of such a musical work,
    if - 
        (1) there is no direct or indirect charge for making or
      distributing any such copies or phonorecords; and
        (2) none of such copies or phonorecords is used for any
      performance other than a single transmission to the public by a
      transmitting organization entitled to transmit to the public a
      performance of the work under a license or transfer of the
      copyright; and
        (3) except for one copy or phonorecord that may be preserved
      exclusively for archival purposes, the copies or phonorecords are
      all destroyed within one year from the date the transmission
      program was first transmitted to the public.

      (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is not an
    infringement of copyright for a governmental body or other
    nonprofit organization entitled to transmit a performance of a work
    under section 110(8) to make no more than ten copies or
    phonorecords embodying the performance, or to permit the use of any
    such copy or phonorecord by any governmental body or nonprofit
    organization entitled to transmit a performance of a work under
    section 110(8), if - 
        (1) any such copy or phonorecord is retained and used solely by
      the organization that made it, or by a governmental body or
      nonprofit organization entitled to transmit a performance of a
      work under section 110(8), and no further copies or phonorecords
      are reproduced from it; and
        (2) any such copy or phonorecord is used solely for
      transmissions authorized under section 110(8), or for purposes of
      archival preservation or security; and
        (3) the governmental body or nonprofit organization permitting
      any use of any such copy or phonorecord by any governmental body
      or nonprofit organization under this subsection does not make any
      charge for such use.

      (e) Statutory License. - (1) A transmitting organization entitled
    to transmit to the public a performance of a sound recording under
    the limitation on exclusive rights specified by section
    114(d)(1)(C)(iv) or under a statutory license in accordance with
    section 114(f) is entitled to a statutory license, under the
    conditions specified by this subsection, to make no more than 1
    phonorecord of the sound recording (unless the terms and conditions
    of the statutory license allow for more), if the following
    conditions are satisfied:
        (A) The phonorecord is retained and used solely by the
      transmitting organization that made it, and no further
      phonorecords are reproduced from it.
        (B) The phonorecord is used solely for the transmitting
      organization's own transmissions originating in the United States
      under a statutory license in accordance with section 114(f) or
      the limitation on exclusive rights specified by section
      114(d)(1)(C)(iv).
        (C) Unless preserved exclusively for purposes of archival
      preservation, the phonorecord is destroyed within 6 months from
      the date the sound recording was first transmitted to the public
      using the phonorecord.
        (D) Phonorecords of the sound recording have been distributed
      to the public under the authority of the copyright owner or the
      copyright owner authorizes the transmitting entity to transmit
      the sound recording, and the transmitting entity makes the
      phonorecord under this subsection from a phonorecord lawfully
      made and acquired under the authority of the copyright owner.

      (2) Notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws, any
    copyright owners of sound recordings and any transmitting
    organizations entitled to a statutory license under this subsection
    may negotiate and agree upon royalty rates and license terms and
    conditions for making phonorecords of such sound recordings under
    this section and the proportionate division of fees paid among
    copyright owners, and may designate common agents to negotiate,
    agree to, pay, or receive such royalty payments.
      (3) Proceedings under chapter 8 shall determine reasonable rates
    and terms of royalty payments for the activities specified by
    paragraph (1) during the 5-year period beginning on January 1 of
    the second year following the year in which the proceedings are to
    be commenced, or such other period as the parties may agree. Such
    rates shall include a minimum fee for each type of service offered
    by transmitting organizations. Any copyright owners of sound
    recordings or any transmitting organizations entitled to a
    statutory license under this subsection may submit to the Copyright
    Royalty Judges licenses covering such activities with respect to
    such sound recordings. The parties to each proceeding shall bear
    their own costs.
      (4) The schedule of reasonable rates and terms determined by the
    Copyright Royalty Judges shall, subject to paragraph (5), be
    binding on all copyright owners of sound recordings and
    transmitting organizations entitled to a statutory license under
    this subsection during the 5-year period specified in paragraph
    (3), or such other period as the parties may agree. Such rates
    shall include a minimum fee for each type of service offered by
    transmitting organizations. The Copyright Royalty Judges shall
    establish rates that most clearly represent the fees that would
    have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and
    a willing seller. In determining such rates and terms, the
    Copyright Royalty Judges shall base their decision on economic,
    competitive, and programming information presented by the parties,
    including - 
        (A) whether use of the service may substitute for or may
      promote the sales of phonorecords or otherwise interferes with or
      enhances the copyright owner's traditional streams of revenue;
      and
        (B) the relative roles of the copyright owner and the
      transmitting organization in the copyrighted work and the service
      made available to the public with respect to relative creative
      contribution, technological contribution, capital investment,
      cost, and risk.

    In establishing such rates and terms, the Copyright Royalty Judges
    may consider the rates and terms under voluntary license agreements
    described in paragraphs (2) and (3). The Copyright Royalty Judges
    shall also establish requirements by which copyright owners may
    receive reasonable notice of the use of their sound recordings
    under this section, and under which records of such use shall be
    kept and made available by transmitting organizations entitled to
    obtain a statutory license under this subsection.
      (5) License agreements voluntarily negotiated at any time between
    1 or more copyright owners of sound recordings and 1 or more
    transmitting organizations entitled to obtain a statutory license
    under this subsection shall be given effect in lieu of any decision
    by the Librarian of Congress or determination by the Copyright
    Royalty Judges.
      (6)(A) Any person who wishes to make a phonorecord of a sound
    recording under a statutory license in accordance with this
    subsection may do so without infringing the exclusive right of the
    copyright owner of the sound recording under section 106(1) - 
        (i) by complying with such notice requirements as the Copyright
      Royalty Judges shall prescribe by regulation and by paying
      royalty fees in accordance with this subsection; or
        (ii) if such royalty fees have not been set, by agreeing to pay
      such royalty fees as shall be determined in accordance with this
      subsection.

      (B) Any royalty payments in arrears shall be made on or before
    the 20th day of the month next succeeding the month in which the
    royalty fees are set.
      (7) If a transmitting organization entitled to make a phonorecord
    under this subsection is prevented from making such phonorecord by
    reason of the application by the copyright owner of technical
    measures that prevent the reproduction of the sound recording, the
    copyright owner shall make available to the transmitting
    organization the necessary means for permitting the making of such
    phonorecord as permitted under this subsection, if it is
    technologically feasible and economically reasonable for the
    copyright owner to do so. If the copyright owner fails to do so in
    a timely manner in light of the transmitting organization's
    reasonable business requirements, the transmitting organization
    shall not be liable for a violation of section 1201(a)(1) of this
    title for engaging in such activities as are necessary to make such
    phonorecords as permitted under this subsection.
      (8) Nothing in this subsection annuls, limits, impairs, or
    otherwise affects in any way the existence or value of any of the
    exclusive rights of the copyright owners in a sound recording,
    except as otherwise provided in this subsection, or in a musical
    work, including the exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute a
    sound recording or musical work, including by means of a digital
    phonorecord delivery, under sections 106(1), 106(3), and 115, and
    the right to perform publicly a sound recording or musical work,
    including by means of a digital audio transmission, under sections
    106(4) and 106(6).
      (f)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, and without
    limiting the application of subsection (b), it is not an
    infringement of copyright for a governmental body or other
    nonprofit educational institution entitled under section 110(2) to
    transmit a performance or display to make copies or phonorecords of
    a work that is in digital form and, solely to the extent permitted
    in paragraph (2), of a work that is in analog form, embodying the
    performance or display to be used for making transmissions
    authorized under section 110(2), if - 
        (A) such copies or phonorecords are retained and used solely by
      the body or institution that made them, and no further copies or
      phonorecords are reproduced from them, except as authorized under
      section 110(2); and
        (B) such copies or phonorecords are used solely for
      transmissions authorized under section 110(2).

      (2) This subsection does not authorize the conversion of print or
    other analog versions of works into digital formats, except that
    such conversion is permitted hereunder, only with respect to the
    amount of such works authorized to be performed or displayed under
    section 110(2), if - 
        (A) no digital version of the work is available to the
      institution; or
        (B) the digital version of the work that is available to the
      institution is subject to technological protection measures that
      prevent its use for section 110(2).

      (g) The transmission program embodied in a copy or phonorecord
    made under this section is not subject to protection as a
    derivative work under this title except with the express consent of
    the owners of copyright in the preexisting works employed in the
    program.

-MISC1-
                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      Section 112 of the bill concerns itself with a special problem
    that is not dealt with in the present statutes but is the subject
    of provisions in a number of foreign statutes and in the revisions
    of the Berne Convention since 1948. This is the problem of what are
    commonly called "ephemeral recordings": copies or phonorecords of a
    work made for purposes of later transmission by a broadcasting
    organization legally entitled to transmit the work. In other words,
    where a broadcaster has the privilege of performing or displaying a
    work either because he is licensed or because the performance or
    display is exempted under the statute, the question is whether he
    should be given the additional privilege of recording the
    performance or display to facilitate its transmission. The need for
    a limited exemption in these cases because of the practical
    exigencies of broadcasting has been generally recognized, but the
    scope of the exemption has been a controversial issue.
      Recordings for Licensed Transmissions. Under subsection (a) of
    section 112, an organization that has acquired the right to
    transmit any work (other than a motion picture or other audiovisual
    work), or that is free to transmit a sound recording under section
    114, may make a single copy or phonorecord of a particular program
    embodying the work, if the copy or phonorecord is used solely for
    the organization's own transmissions within its own area; after 6
    months it must be destroyed or preserved solely for archival
    purposes.
      Organizations Covered. - The ephemeral recording privilege is
    given by subsection (a) to "a transmitting organization entitled to
    transmit to the public a performance or display of a work."
    Assuming that the transmission meets the other conditions of the
    provision, it makes no difference what type of public transmission
    the organization is making: commercial radio and television
    broadcasts, public radio and television broadcasts not exempted by
    section 110(2), pay-TV, closed circuit, background music, and so
    forth. However, to come within the scope of subsection (a), the
    organization must have the right to make the transmission "under a
    license or transfer of the copyright or under the limitations on
    exclusive rights in sound recordings specified by section 114(a)."
    Thus, except in the case of copyrighted sound recordings (which
    have no exclusive performing rights under the bill), the
    organization must be a transferee or licensee (including compulsory
    licensee) of performing rights in the work in order to make an
    ephemeral recording of it.
      Some concern has been expressed by authors and publishers lest
    the term "organization" be construed to include a number of
    affiliated broadcasters who could exchange the recording without
    restrictions. The term is intended to cover a broadcasting network,
    or a local broadcaster or individual transmitter; but, under
    clauses (1) and (2) of the subsection, the ephemeral recording must
    be "retained and used solely by the transmitting organization that
    made it," and must be used solely for that organization's own
    transmissions within its own area. Thus, an ephemeral recording
    made by one transmitter, whether it be a network or local
    broadcaster, could not be made available for use by another
    transmitter. Likewise, this subsection does not apply to those
    nonsimultaneous transmissions by cable systems not located within a
    boundary of the forty-eight contiguous States that are granted a
    compulsory license under section 111.
      Scope of the Privilege. - Subsection (a) permits the transmitting
    organization to make "no more than one copy or phonorecord of a
    particular transmission program embodying the performance or
    display." A "transmission program" is defined in section 101 as a
    body of material produced for the sole purpose of transmission as a
    unit. Thus, under section 112(a), a transmitter could make only one
    copy or phonorecord of a particular "transmission program"
    containing a copyrighted work, but would not be limited as to the
    number of times the work itself could be duplicated as part of
    other "transmission programs."
      Three specific limitations on the scope of the ephemeral
    recording privilege are set out in subsection (a), and unless all
    are met the making of an "ephemeral recording" becomes fully
    actionable as an infringement. The first requires that the copy or
    phonorecord be "retained and used solely by the transmitting
    organization that made it," and that "no further copies or
    phonorecords are reproduced from it." This means that a
    transmitting organization would have no privilege of exchanging
    ephemeral recordings with other transmitters or of allowing them to
    duplicate their own ephemeral recordings from the copy or
    phonorecord it has made. There is nothing in the provision to
    prevent a transmitting organization from having an ephemeral
    recording made by means of facilities other than its own, although
    it would not be permissible for a person or organization other than
    a transmitting organization to make a recording on its own
    initiative for possible sale or lease to a broadcaster. The
    ephemeral recording privilege would extend to copies or
    phonorecords made in advance for later broadcast, as well as
    recordings of a program that are made while it is being transmitted
    and are intended for deferred transmission or preservation.
      Clause (2) of section 112(a) provides that, to be exempt from
    copyright, the copy or phonorecord must be "used solely for the
    transmitting organization's own transmissions within its local
    service area, or for purposes of archival preservation or
    security". The term "local service area" is defined in section
    111(f).
      Clause (3) of section 112(a) provides that, unless preserved
    exclusively for archival purposes, the copy or phonorecord of a
    transmission program must be destroyed within six months from the
    date the transmission program was first transmitted to the public.
      Recordings for Instructional Transmissions. Section 112(b)
    represents a response to the arguments of instructional
    broadcasters and other educational groups for special recording
    privileges, although it does not go as far as these groups
    requested. In general, it permits a nonprofit organization that is
    free to transmit a performance or display of a work, under section
    110(2) or under the limitations on exclusive rights in sound
    recordings specified by section 114(a), to make not more than
    thirty copies or phonorecords and to use the ephemeral recordings
    for transmitting purposes for not more than seven years after the
    initial transmission.
      Organizations Covered. - The privilege of making ephemeral
    recordings under section 112(b) extends to a "governmental body or
    other nonprofit organization entitled to transmit a performance or
    display of a work under section 110(2) or under the limitations on
    exclusive rights in sound recordings specified by section 114(a)."
    Aside from phonorecords of copyrighted sound recordings, the
    ephemeral recordings made by an instructional broadcaster under
    subsection (b) must embody a performance or display that meets all
    of the qualifications for exemption under section 110(2). Copies or
    phonorecords made for educational broadcasts of a general cultural
    nature, or for transmission as part of an information storage and
    retrieval system, would not be exempted from copyright protection
    under section 112(b).
      Motion Pictures and Other Audiovisual Works. - Since the
    performance exemption provided by section 110(2) applies only to
    nondramatic literary and musical works, there was no need to
    exclude motion pictures and other audiovisual works explicitly from
    the scope of section 112(b). Another point stressed by the
    producers of educational films in this connection, however, was
    that ephemeral recordings made by instructional broadcasters are in
    fact audiovisual works that often compete for exactly the same
    market. They argued that it is unfair to allow instructional
    broadcasters to reproduce multiple copies of films and tapes, and
    to exchange them with other broadcasters, without paying any
    copyright royalties, thereby directly injuring the market of
    producers of audiovisual works who now pay substantial fees to
    authors for the same uses. These arguments are persuasive and
    justify the placing of reasonable limits on the recording
    privilege.
      Scope of the Privilege. - Under subsection (b) an instructional
    broadcaster may make "no more than thirty copies or phonorecords of
    a particular transmission program embodying the performance or
    display." No further copies or phonorecords can be reproduced from
    those made under section 112(b), either by the nonprofit
    organization that made them or by anyone else.
      On the other hand, if the nonprofit organization does nothing
    directly or indirectly to authorize, induce, or encourage others to
    duplicate additional copies or phonorecords of an ephemeral
    recording in excess of the limit of thirty, it would not be held
    responsible as participating in the infringement in such a case,
    and the unauthorized copies would not be counted against the
    organization's total of thirty.
      Unlike ephemeral recordings made under subsection (a), exchanges
    of recordings among instructional broadcasters are permitted. An
    organization that has made copies or phonorecords under subsection
    (b) may use one of them for purposes of its own transmissions that
    are exempted by section 110(2), and it may also transfer the other
    29 copies to other instructional broadcasters for use in the same
    way.
      As in the case of ephemeral recordings made under section 112(a),
    a copy or phonorecord made for instructional broadcasting could be
    reused in any number of transmissions within the time limits
    specified in the provision. Because of the special problems of
    instructional broadcasters resulting from the scheduling of courses
    and the need to prerecord well in advance of transmission, the
    period of use has been extended to seven years from the date the
    transmission program was first transmitted to the public.
      Religious Broadcasts. - Section 112(c) provides that it is not an
    infringement of copyright for certain nonprofit organizations to
    make no more than one copy for each transmitting organization of a
    broadcast program embodying a performance of a nondramatic musical
    work of a religious nature or of a sound recording of such a
    musical work. In order for this exception to be applicable there
    must be no charge for the distribution of the copies, none of the
    copies may be used for any performance other than a single
    transmission by an organization possessing a license to transmit a
    copyrighted work, and, other than for one copy that may be
    preserved for archival purposes, the remaining copies must be
    destroyed within one year from the date the program was first
    transmitted to the public.
      Despite objections by music copyright owners, the Committee found
    this exemption to be justified by the special circumstances under
    which many religious programs are broadcast. These programs are
    produced on tape or disk for distribution by mail of one copy only
    to each broadcast station carrying the program. None of the
    programs are prepared for profit, and the program producer either
    pays the station to carry the program or furnishes it free of
    charge. The stations have performing licenses, so the copyright
    owners receive compensation. Following the performance, the tape is
    returned or the disk destroyed. It seems likely that, as has been
    alleged, to require a second payment for the mechanical
    reproduction under these circumstances would simply have the effect
    of driving some of the copyrighted music off the air.
      Ephemeral Recordings for Transmissions to Handicapped Audiences.
    As a counterpart to its amendment of section 110(8), the Committee
    adopted a new provision, subsection (d) of section 112, to provide
    an ephemeral recording exemption in the case of transmissions to
    the blind and deaf. New subsection would permit the making of one
    recording of a performance exempted under section 110(8), and its
    retention for an unlimited period. It would not permit the making
    of further reproductions or their exchange with other
    organizations.
      Copyright Status of Ephemeral Recordings. A program reproduced in
    an ephemeral recording made under section 112 in many cases will
    constitute a motion picture, a sound recording, or some other kind
    of derivative work, and will thus be potentially copyrightable
    under section 103. In section 112(e) it is provided that ephemeral
    recordings are not to be copyrightable as derivative works except
    with the consent of the owners of the copyrighted material employed
    in them.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 113. Scope of exclusive rights in pictorial, graphic, and
      sculptural works

-STATUTE-
      (a) Subject to the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this
    section, the exclusive right to reproduce a copyrighted pictorial,
    graphic, or sculptural work in copies under section 106 includes
    the right to reproduce the work in or on any kind of article,
    whether useful or otherwise.
      (b) This title does not afford, to the owner of copyright in a
    work that portrays a useful article as such, any greater or lesser
    rights with respect to the making, distribution, or display of the
    useful article so portrayed than those afforded to such works under
    the law, whether title 17 or the common law or statutes of a State,
    in effect on December 31, 1977, as held applicable and construed by
    a court in an action brought under this title.
      (c) In the case of a work lawfully reproduced in useful articles
    that have been offered for sale or other distribution to the
    public, copyright does not include any right to prevent the making,
    distribution, or display of pictures or photographs of such
    articles in connection with advertisements or commentaries related
    to the distribution or display of such articles, or in connection
    with news reports.
      (d)(1) In a case in which - 
        (A) a work of visual art has been incorporated in or made part
      of a building in such a way that removing the work from the
      building will cause the destruction, distortion, mutilation, or
      other modification of the work as described in section
      106A(a)(3), and
        (B) the author consented to the installation of the work in the
      building either before the effective date set forth in section
      610(a) of the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990, or in a written
      instrument executed on or after such effective date that is
      signed by the owner of the building and the author and that
      specifies that installation of the work may subject the work to
      destruction, distortion, mutilation, or other modification, by
      reason of its removal,

    then the rights conferred by paragraphs (2) and (3) of section
    106A(a) shall not apply.
      (2) If the owner of a building wishes to remove a work of visual
    art which is a part of such building and which can be removed from
    the building without the destruction, distortion, mutilation, or
    other modification of the work as described in section 106A(a)(3),
    the author's rights under paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 106A(a)
    shall apply unless - 
        (A) the owner has made a diligent, good faith attempt without
      success to notify the author of the owner's intended action
      affecting the work of visual art, or
        (B) the owner did provide such notice in writing and the person
      so notified failed, within 90 days after receiving such notice,
      either to remove the work or to pay for its removal.

    For purposes of subparagraph (A), an owner shall be presumed to
    have made a diligent, good faith attempt to send notice if the
    owner sent such notice by registered mail to the author at the most
    recent address of the author that was recorded with the Register of
    Copyrights pursuant to paragraph (3). If the work is removed at the
    expense of the author, title to that copy of the work shall be
    deemed to be in the author.
      (3) The Register of Copyrights shall establish a system of
    records whereby any author of a work of visual art that has been
    incorporated in or made part of a building, may record his or her
    identity and address with the Copyright Office. The Register shall
    also establish procedures under which any such author may update
    the information so recorded, and procedures under which owners of
    buildings may record with the Copyright Office evidence of their
    efforts to comply with this subsection.

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      Section 113 deals with the extent of copyright protection in
    "works of applied art." The section takes as its starting point the
    Supreme Court's decision in Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201 (1954) [74
    S.Ct. 460, 98 L.Ed. 630, rehearing denied 74 S.Ct. 637, 347 U.S.
    949, 98 L.Ed. 1096], and the first sentence of subsection (a)
    restates the basic principle established by that decision. The rule
    of Mazer, as affirmed by the bill, is that copyright in a
    pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work will not be affected if the
    work is employed as the design of a useful article, and will afford
    protection to the copyright owner against the unauthorized
    reproduction of his work in useful as well as nonuseful articles.
    The terms "pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works" and "useful
    article" are defined in section 101, and these definitions are
    discussed above in connection with section 102.
      The broad language of section 106(1) and of subsection (a) of
    section 113 raises questions as to the extent of copyright
    protection for a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work that
    portrays, depicts, or represents an image of a useful article in
    such a way that the utilitarian nature of the article can be seen.
    To take the example usually cited, would copyright in a drawing or
    model of an automobile give the artist the exclusive right to make
    automobiles of the same design?
      The 1961 Report of the Register of Copyrights stated, on the
    basis of judicial precedent, that "copyright in a pictorial,
    graphic, or sculptural work, portraying a useful article as such,
    does not extend to the manufacture of the useful article itself,"
    and recommended specifically that "the distinctions drawn in this
    area by existing court decisions" not be altered by the statute.
    The Register's Supplementary Report, at page 48, cited a number of
    these decisions, and explained the insuperable difficulty of
    finding "any statutory formulation that would express the
    distinction satisfactorily." Section 113(b) reflects the Register's
    conclusion that "the real need is to make clear that there is no
    intention to change the present law with respect to the scope of
    protection in a work portraying a useful article as such."
      Section 113(c) provides that it would not be an infringement of
    copyright, where a copyright work has been lawfully published as
    the design of useful articles, to make, distribute or display
    pictures of the articles in advertising, in feature stories about
    the articles, or in the news reports.
      In conformity with its deletion from the bill of Title II,
    relating to the protection of ornamental designs of useful
    articles, the Committee has deleted subsections (b), (c), and (d)
    of section 113 of S. 22 as adopted by the Senate, since they are no
    longer relevant.

    CHAPTER 1 - SUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE OF COPYRIGHT

-HEAD-
    Sec. 114. Scope of exclusive rights in sound recordings

-STATUTE-
      (a) The exclusive rights of the owner of copyright in a sound
    recording are limited to the rights specified by clauses (1), (2),
    (3) and (6) of section 106, and do not include any right of
    performance under section 106(4).
      (b) The exclusive right of the owner of copyright in a sound
    recording under clause (1) of section 106 is limited to the right
    to duplicate the sound recording in the form of phonorecords or
    copies that directly or indirectly recapture the actual sounds
    fixed in the recording. The exclusive right of the owner of
    copyright in a sound recording under clause (2) of section 106 is
    limited to the right to prepare a derivative work in which the
    actual sounds fixed in the sound recording are rearranged, remixed,
    or otherwise altered in sequence or quality. The exclusive rights
    of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clauses (1)
    and (2) of section 106 do not extend to the making or duplication
    of another sound recording that consists entirely of an independent
    fixation of other sounds, even though such sounds imitate or
    simulate those in the copyrighted sound recording. The exclusive
    rights of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clauses
    (1), (2), and (3) of section 106 do not apply to sound recordings
    included in educational television and radio programs (as defined
    in section 397 of title 47) distributed or transmitted by or
    through public broadcasting entities (as defined by section
    118(f)): Provided, That copies or phonorecords of said programs are
    not commercially distributed by or through public broadcasting
    entities to the general public.
      (c) This section does not limit or impair the exclusive right to
    perform publicly, by means of a phonorecord, any of the works
    specified by section 106(4).
      (d) Limitations on Exclusive Right. - Notwithstanding the
    provisions of section 106(6) - 
        (1) Exempt transmissions and retransmissions. - The performance
      of a sound recording publicly by means of a digital audio
      transmission, other than as a part of an interactive service, is
      not an infringement of section 106(6) if the performance is part
      of - 
          (A) a nonsubscription broadcast transmission;
          (B) a retransmission of a nonsubscription broadcast
        transmission: Provided, That, in the case of a retransmission
        of a radio station's broadcast transmission - 
            (i) the radio station's broadcast transmission is not
          willfully or repeatedly retransmitted more than a radius of
          150 miles from the site of the radio broadcast transmitter,
          however - 
              (I) the 150 mile limitation under this clause shall not
            apply when a nonsubscription broadcast transmission by a
            radio station licensed by the Federal Communications
            Commission is retransmitted on a nonsubscription basis by a
            terrestrial broadcast station, terrestrial translator, or
            terrestrial repeater licensed by the Federal Communications
            Commission; and
              (II) in the case of a subscription retransmission of a
            nonsubscription broadcast retransmission covered by
            subclause (I), the 150 mile radius shall be measured from
            the transmitter site of such broadcast retransmitter;

            (ii) the retransmission is of radio station broadcast
          transmissions that are - 
              (I) obtained by the retransmitter over the air;
              (II) not electronically processed by the retransmitter to
            deliver separate and discrete signals; and
              (III) retransmitted only within the local communities
            served by the retransmitter;

            (iii) the radio station's broadcast transmission was being
          retransmitted to cable systems (as defined in section 111(f))
          by a satellite carrier on January 1, 1995, and that
          retransmission was being retransmitted by cable systems as a
          separate and discrete signal, and the satellite carrier
          obtains the radio station's broadcast transmission in an
          analog format: Provided, That the broadcast transmission
          being retransmitted may embody the programming of no more
          than one radio station; or
            (iv) the radio station's broadcast transmission is made by
          a noncommercial educational broadcast station funded on or
          after January 1, 1995, under section 396(k) of the
          Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 396(k)), consists
          solely of noncommercial educational and cultural radio
          programs, and the retransmission, whether or not
          simultaneous, is a nonsubscription terrestrial broadcast
          retransmission; or

          (C) a transmission that comes within any of the following
        categories - 
            (i) a prior or simultaneous transmission incidental to an
          exempt transmission, such as a feed received by and then
          retransmitted by an exempt transmitter: Provided, That such
          incidental transmissions do not include any subscription
          transmission directly for reception by members of the public;
            (ii) a transmission within a business establishment,
          confined to its premises or the immediately surrounding
          vicinity;
            (iii) a retransmission by any retransmitter, including a
          multichannel video programming distributor as defined in
          section 602(12) (!1) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47
          U.S.C. 522(12)), of a transmission by a transmitter licensed
          to publicly perform the sound recording as a part of that
          transmission, if the retransmission is simultaneous with the
          licensed transmission and authorized by the transmitter; or

            (iv) a transmission to a business establishment for use in
          the ordinary course of its business: Provided, That the
          business recipient does not retransmit the transmission
          outside of its premises or the immediately surrounding
          vicinity, and that the transmission does not exceed the sound
          recording performance complement. Nothing in this clause
          shall limit the scope of the exemption in clause (ii).

        (2) Statutory licensing of certain transmissions. - The
      performance of a sound recording publicly by means of a
      subscription digital audio transmission not exempt under
      paragraph (1), an eligible nonsubscription transmission, or a
      transmission not exempt under paragraph (1) that is made by a
      preexisting satellite digital audio radio service shall be
      subject to statutory licensing, in accordance with subsection (f)
      if - 
          (A)(i) the transmission is not part of an interactive
        service;
          (ii) except in the case of a transmission to a business
        establishment, the transmitting entity does not automatically
        and intentionally cause any device receiving the transmission
        to switch from one program channel to another; and
          (iii) except as provided in section 1002(e), the transmission
        of the sound recording is accompanied, if technically feasible,
        by the information encoded in that sound recording, if any, by
        or under the authority of the copyright owner of that sound
        recording, that identifies the title of the sound recording,
        the featured recording artist who performs on the sound
        recording, and related information, including information
        concerning the underlying musical work and its writer;
          (B) in the case of a subscription transmission not exempt
        under paragraph (1) that is made by a preexisting subscription
        service in the same transmission medium used by such service on
        July 31, 1998, or in the case of a transmission not exempt
        under paragraph (1) that is made by a preexisting satellite
        digital audio radio service - 
            (i) the transmission does not exceed the sound recording
          performance complement; and
            (ii) the transmitting entity does not cause to be published
          by means of an advance program schedule or prior announcement
          the titles of the specific sound recordings or phonorecords
          embodying such sound recordings to be transmitted; and

          (C) in the case of an eligible nonsubscription transmission
        or a subscription transmission not exempt under paragraph (1)
        that is made by a new subscription service or by a preexisting
        subscription service other than in the same transmission medium
        used by such service on July 31, 1998 - 
            (i) the transmission does not exceed the sound recording
          performance complement, except that this requirement shall
          not apply in the case of a retransmission of a broadcast
          transmission if the retransmission is made by a transmitting
          entity that does not have the right or ability to control the
          programming of the broadcast station making the broadcast
          transmission, unless - 
              (I) the broadcast station makes broadcast transmissions -
            
                (aa) in digital format that regularly exceed the sound
              recording performance complement; or
                (bb) in analog format, a substantial portion of which,
              on a weekly basis, exceed the sound recording performance
              complement; and

              (II) the sound recording copyright owner or its
            representative has notified the transmitting entity in
            writing that broadcast transmissions of the copyright
            owner's sound recordings exceed the sound recording
            performance complement as provided in this clause;

            (ii) the transmitting entity does not cause to be
          published, or induce or facilitate the publication, by means
          of an advance program schedule or prior announcement, the
          titles of the specific sound recordings to be transmitted,
          the phonorecords embodying such sound recordings, or, other
          than for illustrative purposes, the names of the featured
          recording artists, except that this clause does not
          disqualify a transmitting entity that makes a prior
          announcement that a particular artist will be featured within
          an unspecified future time period, and in the case of a
          retransmission of a broadcast transmission by a transmitting
          entity that does not have the right or ability to control the
          programming of the broadcast transmission, the requirement of
          this clause shall not apply to a prior oral announcement by
          the broadcast station, or to an advance program schedule
          published, induced, or facilitated by the broadcast station,
          if the transmitting entity does not have actual knowledge and
          has not received written notice from the copyright owner or
          its representative that the broadcast station publishes or
          induces or facilitates the publication of such advance
          program schedule, or if such advance program schedule is a
          schedule of classical music programming published by the
          broadcast station in the same manner as published by that
          broadcast station on or before September 30, 1998;
            (iii) the transmission - 
              (I) is not part of an archived program of less than 5
            hours duration;
              (II) is not part of an archived program of 5 hours or
            greater in duration that is made available for a period
            exceeding 2 weeks;
              (III) is not part of a continuous program which is of
            less than 3 hours duration; or
              (IV) is not part of an identifiable program in which
            performances of sound recordings are rendered in a
            predetermined order, other than an archived or continuous
            program, that is transmitted at - 
                (aa) more than 3 times in any 2-week period that have
              been publicly announced in advance, in the case of a
              program of less than 1 hour in duration, or
                (bb) more than 4 times in any 2-week period that have
              been publicly announced in advance, in the case of a
              program of 1 hour or more in duration,

            except that the requirement of this subclause shall not
            apply in the case of a retransmission of a broadcast
            transmission by a transmitting entity that does not have
            the right or ability to control the programming of the
            broadcast transmission, unless the transmitting entity is
            given notice in writing by the copyright owner of the sound
            recording that the broadcast station makes broadcast
            transmissions that regularly violate such requirement;

            (iv) the transmitting entity does not knowingly perform the
          sound recording, as part of a service that offers
          transmissions of visual images contemporaneously with
          transmissions of sound recordings, in a manner that is likely
          to cause confusion, to cause mistake, or to deceive, as to
          the affiliation, connection, or association of the copyright
          owner or featured recording artist with the transmitting
          entity or a particular product or service advertised by the
          transmitting entity, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or
          approval by the copyright owner or featured recording artist
          of the activities of the transmitting entity other than the
          performance of the sound recording itself;
            (v) the transmitting entity cooperates to prevent, to the
          extent feasible without imposing substantial costs or
          burdens, a transmission recipient or any other person or
          entity from automatically scanning the transmitting entity's
          transmissions alone or together with transmissions by other
          transmitting entities in order to select a particular sound
          recording to be transmitted to the transmission recipient,
          except that the requirement of this clause shall not apply to
          a satellite digital audio service that is in operation, or
          that is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, on
          or before July 31, 1998;
            (vi) the transmitting entity takes no affirmative steps to
          cause or induce the making of a phonorecord by the
          transmission recipient, and if the technology used by the
          transmitting entity enables the transmitting entity to limit
          the making by the transmission recipient of phonorecords of
          the transmission directly in a digital format, the
          transmitting entity sets such technology to limit such making
          of phonorecords to the extent permitted by such technology;
            (vii) phonorecords of the sound recording have been
          distributed to the public under the authority of the
          copyright owner or the copyright owner authorizes the
          transmitting entity to transmit the sound recording, and the
          transmitting entity makes the transmission from a phonorecord
          lawfully made under the authority of the copyright owner,
          except that the requirement of this clause shall not apply to
          a retransmission of a broadcast transmission by a
          transmitting entity that does not have the right or ability
          to control the programming of the broadcast transmission,
          unless the transmitting entity is given notice in writing by
          the copyright owner of the sound recording that the broadcast
          station makes broadcast transmissions that regularly violate
          such requirement;
            (viii) the transmitting entity accommodates and does not
          interfere with the transmission of technical measures that
          are widely used by sound recording copyright owners to
          identify or protect copyrighted works, and that are
          technically feasible of being transmitted by the transmitting
          entity without imposing substantial costs on the transmitting
          entity or resulting in perceptible aural or visual
          degradation of the digital signal, except that the
          requirement of this clause shall not apply to a satellite
          digital audio service that is in operation, or that is
          licensed under the authority of the Federal Communications
          Commission, on or before July 31, 1998, to the extent that
          such service has designed, developed, or made commitments to
          procure equipment or technology that is not compatible with
          such technical measures before such technical measures are
          widely adopted by sound recording copyright owners; and
            (ix) the transmitting entity identifies in textual data the
          sound recording during, but not before, the time it is
          performed, including the title of the sound recording, the
          title of the phonorecord embodying such sound recording, if
          any, and the featured recording artist, in a manner to permit
          it to be displayed to the transmission recipient by the
          device or technology intended for receiving the service
          provided by the transmitting entity, except that the
          obligation in this clause shall not take effect until 1 year
          after the date of the enactment of the Digital Millennium
          Copyright Act and shall not apply in the case of a
          retransmission of a broadcast transmission by a transmitting
          entity that does not have the right or ability to control the
          programming of the broadcast transmission, or in the case in
          which devices or technology intended for receiving the
          service provided by the transmitting entity that have the
          capability to display such textual data are not common in the
          marketplace.

        (3) Licenses for transmissions by interactive services. - 
          (A) No interactive service shall be granted an exclusive
        license under section 106(6) for the performance of a sound
        recording publicly by means of digital audio transmission for a
        period in excess of 12 months, except that with respect to an
        exclusive license granted to an interactive service by a
        licensor that holds the copyright to 1,000 or fewer sound
        recordings, the period of such license shall not exceed 24
        months: Provided, however, That the grantee of such exclusive
        license shall be ineligible to receive another exclusive
        license for the performance of that sound recording for a
        period of 13 months from the expiration of the prior exclusive
        license.
          (B) The limitation set forth in subparagraph (A) of this
        paragraph shall not apply if - 
            (i) the licensor has granted and there remain in effect
          licenses under section 106(6) for the public performance of
          sound recordings by means of digital audio transmission by at
          least 5 different interactive services: Provided, however,
          That each such license must be for a minimum of 10 percent of
          the copyrighted sound recordings owned by the licensor that
          have been licensed to interactive services, but in no event
          less than 50 sound recordings; or
            (ii) the exclusive license is granted to perform publicly
          up to 45 seconds of a sound recording and the sole purpose of
          the performance is to promote the distribution or performance
          of that sound recording.

          (C) Notwithstanding the grant of an exclusive or nonexclusive
        license of the right of public performance under section
        106(6), an interactive service may not publicly perform a sound
        recording unless a license has been granted for the public
        performance of any copyrighted musical work contained in the
        sound recording: Provided, That such license to publicly
        perform the copyrighted musical work may be granted either by a
        performing rights society representing the copyright owner or
        by the copyright owner.
          (D) The performance of a sound recording by means of a
        retransmission of a digital audio transmission is not an
        infringement of section 106(6) if - 
            (i) the retransmission is of a transmission by an
          interactive service licensed to publicly perform the sound
          recording to a particular member of the public as part of
          that transmission; and
            (ii) the retransmission is simultaneous with the licensed
          transmission, authorized by the transmitter, and limited to
          that particular member of the public intended by the
          interactive service to be the recipient of the transmission.

          (E) For the purposes of this paragraph - 
            (i) a "licensor" shall include the licensing entity and any
          other entity under any material degree of common ownership,
          management, or control that owns copyrights in sound
          recordings; and
            (ii) a "performing rights society" is an association or
          corporation that licenses the public performance of
          nondramatic musical works on behalf of the copyright owner,
          such as the American Society of Composers, Authors and
          Publishers, Broadcast Music, Inc., and SESAC, Inc.

        (4) Rights not otherwise limited. - 
          (A) Except as expressly provided in this section, this
        section does not limit or impair the exclusive right to perform
        a sound recording publicly by means of a digital audio
        transmission under section 106(6).
          (B) Nothing in this section annuls or limits in any way - 
            (i) the exclusive right to publicly perform a musical work,
          including by means of a digital audio transmission, under
          section 106(4);
            (ii) the exclusive rights in a sound recording or the
          musical work embodied therein under sections 106(1), 106(2)
          and 106(3); or
            (iii) any other rights under any other clause of section
          106, or remedies available under this title, as such rights
          or remedies exist either before or after the date of
          enactment of the Digital Performance Right in Sound
          Recordings Act of 1995.

          (C) Any limitations in this section on the exclusive right
        under section 106(6) apply only to the exclusive right under
        section 106(6) and not to any other exclusive rights under
        section 106. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
        annul, limit, impair or otherwise affect in any way the ability
        of the owner of a copyright in a sound recording to exercise
        the rights under sections 106(1), 106(2) and 106(3), or to
        obtain the remedies available under this title pursuant to such
        rights, as such rights and remedies exist either before or
        after the date of enactment of the Digital Performance Right in
        Sound Recordings Act of 1995.

      (e) Authority for Negotiations. - 
        (1) Notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws, in
      negotiating statutory licenses in accordance with subsection (f),
      any copyright owners of sound recordings and any entities
      performing sound recordings affected by this section may
      negotiate and agree upon the royalty rates and license terms and
      conditions for the performance of such sound recordings and the
      proportionate division of fees paid among copyright owners, and
      may designate common agents on a nonexclusive basis to negotiate,
      agree to, pay, or receive payments.
        (2) For licenses granted under section 106(6), other than
      statutory licenses, such as for performances by interactive
      services or performances that exceed the sound recording
      performance complement - 
          (A) copyright owners of sound recordings affected by this
        section may designate common agents to act on their behalf to
        grant licenses and receive and remit royalty payments:
        Provided, That each copyright owner shall establish the royalty
        rates and material license terms and conditions unilaterally,
        that is, not in agreement, combination, or concert with other
        copyright owners of sound recordings; and
          (B) entities performing sound recordings affected by this
        section may designate common agents to act on their behalf to
        obtain licenses and collect and pay royalty fees: Provided,
        That each entity performing sound recordings shall determine
        the royalty rates and material license terms and conditions
        unilaterally, that is, not in agreement, combination, or
        concert with other entities performing sound recordings.

      (f) Licenses for Certain Nonexempt Transmissions. - 
        (1)(A) Proceedings under chapter 8 shall determine reasonable
      rates and terms of royalty payments for subscription
      transmissions by preexisting subscription services and
      transmissions by preexisting satellite digital audio radio
      services specified by subsection (d)(2) during the 5-year period
      beginning on January 1 of the second year following the year in
      which the proceedings are to be commenced, except in the case of
      a different transitional period provided under section 6(b)(3) of
      the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004, or
      such other period as the parties may agree. Such terms and rates
      shall distinguish among the different types of digital audio
      transmission services then in operation. Any copyright owners of
      sound recordings, preexisting subscription services, or
      preexisting satellite digital audio radio services may submit to
      the Copyright Royalty Judges licenses covering such subscription
      transmissions with respect to such sound recordings. The parties
      to each proceeding shall bear their own costs.
        (B) The schedule of reasonable rates and terms determined by
      the Copyright Royalty Judges shall, subject to paragraph (3), be
      binding on all copyright owners of sound recordings and entities
      performing sound recordings affected by this paragraph during the
      5-year period specified in subparagraph (A), a transitional
      period provided under section 6(b)(3) of the Copyright Royalty
      and Distribution Reform Act of 2004, or such other period as the
      parties may agree. In establishing rates and terms for
      preexisting subscription services and preexisting satellite
      digital audio radio services, in addition to the objectives set
      forth in section 801(b)(1), the Copyright Royalty Judges may
      consider the rates and terms for comparable types of subscription
      digital audio transmission services and comparable circumstances
      under voluntary license agreements described in subparagraph (A).
        (C) The procedures under subparagraphs (A) and (B) also shall
      be initiated pursuant to a petition filed by any copyright owners
      of sound recordings, any preexisting subscription services, or
      any preexisting satellite digital audio radio services indicating
      that a new type of subscription digital audio transmission
      service on which sound recordings are performed is or is about to
      become operational, for the purpose of determining reasonable
      terms and rates of royalty payments with respect to such new type
      of transmission service for the period beginning with the
      inception of such new type of service and ending on the date on
      which the royalty rates and terms for subscription digital audio
      transmission services most recently determined under subparagraph
      (A) or (B) and chapter 8 expire, or such other period as the
      parties may agree.
        (2)(A) Proceedings under chapter 8 shall determine reasonable
      rates and terms of royalty payments for public performances of
      sound recordings by means of eligible nonsubscription
      transmission services and new subscription services specified by
      subsection (d)(2) during the 5-year period beginning on January 1
      of the second year following the year in which the proceedings
      are to be commenced, except in the case of a different
      transitional period provided under section 6(b)(3) of the
      Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004, or such
      other period as the parties may agree. Such rates and terms shall
      distinguish among the different types of eligible nonsubscription
      transmission services and new subscription services then in
      operation and shall include a minimum fee for each such type of
      service. Any copyright owners of sound recordings or any entities
      performing sound recordings affected by this paragraph may submit
      to the Copyright Royalty Judges licenses covering such eligible
      nonsubscription transmissions and new subscription services with
      respect to such sound recordings. The parties to each proceeding
      shall bear their own costs.
        (B) The schedule of reasonable rates and terms determined by
      the Copyright Royalty Judges shall, subject to paragraph (3), be
      binding on all copyright owners of sound recordings and entities
      performing sound recordings affected by this paragraph during the
      5-year period specified in subparagraph (A), a transitional
      period provided under section 6(b)(3) of the Copyright Royalty
      and Distribution (!2) Act of 2004, or such other period as the
      parties may agree. Such rates and terms shall distinguish among
      the different types of eligible nonsubscription transmission
      services then in operation and shall include a minimum fee for
      each such type of service, such differences to be based on
      criteria including, but not limited to, the quantity and nature
      of the use of sound recordings and the degree to which use of the
      service may substitute for or may promote the purchase of
      phonorecords by consumers. In establishing rates and terms for
      transmissions by eligible nonsubscription services and new
      subscription services, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall
      establish rates and terms that most clearly represent the rates
      and terms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace
      between a willing buyer and a willing seller. In determining such
      rates and terms, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall base their
      decision on economic, competitive and programming information
      presented by the parties, including - 

          (i) whether use of the service may substitute for or may
        promote the sales of phonorecords or otherwise may interfere
        with or may enhance the sound recording copyright owner's other
        streams of revenue from its sound recordings; and
          (ii) the relative roles of the copyright owner and the
        transmitting entity in the copyrighted work and the service
        made available to the public with respect to relative creative
        contribution, technological contribution, capital investment,
        cost, and risk.

      In establishing such rates and terms, the Copyright Royalty
      Judges may consider the rates and terms for comparable types of
      digital audio transmission services and comparable circumstances
      under voluntary license agreements described in subparagraph (A).
        (C) The procedures under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall also
      be initiated pursuant to a petition filed by any copyright owners
      of sound recordings or any eligible nonsubscription service or
      new subscription service indicating that a new type of eligible
      nonsubscription service or new subscription service on which
      sound recordings are performed is or is about to become
      operational, for the purpose of determining reasonable terms and
      rates of royalty payments with respect to such new type of
      service for the period beginning with the inception of such new
      type of service and ending on the date on which the royalty rates
      and terms for eligible nonsubscription services and new
      subscription services, as the case may be, most recently
      determined under subparagraph (A) or (B) and chapter 8 expire, or
      such other period as the parties may agree.
        (3) License agreements voluntarily negotiated at any time
      between 1 or more copyright owners of sound recordings and 1 or
      more entities performing sound recordings shall be given effect
      in lieu of any decision by the Librarian of Congress or
      determination by the Copyright Royalty Judges.
        (4)(A) The Copyright Royalty Judges shall also establish
      requirements by which copyright owners may receive reasonable
      notice of the use of their sound recordings under this section,
      and under which records of such use shall be kept and made
      available by entities performing sound recordings. The notice and
      recordkeeping rules in effect on the day before the effective
      date of the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004
      shall remain in effect unless and until new regulations are
      promulgated by the Copyright Royalty Judges. If new regulations
      are promulgated under this subparagraph, the Copyright Royalty
      Judges shall take into account the substance and effect of the
      rules in effect on the day before the effective date of the
      Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004 and shall,
      to the extent practicable, avoid significant disruption of the
      functions of any designated agent authorized to collect and
      distribute royalty fees.
        (B) Any person who wishes to perform a sound recording publicly
      by means of a transmission eligible for statutory licensing under
      this subsection may do so without infringing the exclusive right
      of the copyright owner of the sound recording - 
          (i) by complying with such notice requirements as the
        Copyright Royalty Judges shall prescribe by regulation and by
        paying royalty fees in accordance with this subsection; or
          (ii) if such royalty fees have not been set, by agreeing to
        pay such royalty fees as shall be determined in accordance with
        this subsection.

        (C) Any royalty payments in arrears shall be made on or before
      the twentieth day of the month next succeeding the month in which
      the royalty fees are set.
        (5)(A) Notwithstanding section 112(e) and the other provisions
      of this subsection, the receiving agent may enter into agreements
      for the reproduction and performance of sound recordings under
      section 112(e) and this section by any 1 or more commercial
      webcasters or noncommercial webcasters for a period of not more
      than 11 years beginning on January 1, 2005, that, once published
      in the Federal Register pursuant to subparagraph (B), shall be
      binding on all copyright owners of sound recordings and other
      persons entitled to payment under this section, in lieu of any
      determination by the Copyright Royalty Judges. Any such agreement
      for commercial webcasters may include provisions for payment of
      royalties on the basis of a percentage of revenue or expenses, or
      both, and include a minimum fee. Any such agreement may include
      other terms and conditions, including requirements by which
      copyright owners may receive notice of the use of their sound
      recordings and under which records of such use shall be kept and
      made available by commercial webcasters or noncommercial
      webcasters. The receiving agent shall be under no obligation to
      negotiate any such agreement. The receiving agent shall have no
      obligation to any copyright owner of sound recordings or any
      other person entitled to payment under this section in
      negotiating any such agreement, and no liability to any copyright
      owner of sound recordings or any other person entitled to payment
      under this section for having entered into such agreement.
        (B) The Copyright Office shall cause to be published in the
      Federal Register any agreement entered into pursuant to
      subparagraph (A). Such publication shall include a statement
      containing the substance of subparagraph (C). Such agreements
      shall not be included in the Code of Federal Regulations.
      Thereafter, the terms of such agreement shall be available, as an
      option, to any commercial webcaster or noncommercial webcaster
      meeting the eligibility conditions of such agreement.
        (C) Neither subparagraph (A) nor any provisions of any
      agreement entered into pursuant to subparagraph (A), including
      any rate structure, fees, terms, conditions, or notice and
      recordkeeping requirements set forth therein, shall be admissible
      as evidence or otherwise taken into account in any
      administrative, judicial, or other government proceeding
      involving the setting or adjustment of the royalties payable for
      the public performance or reproduction in ephemeral phonorecords
      or copies of sound recordings, the determination of terms or
      conditions related thereto, or the establishment of notice or
      recordkeeping requirements by the Copyright Royalty Judges under
      paragraph (4) or section 112(e)(4). It is the intent of Congress
      that any royalty rates, rate structure, definitions, terms,
      conditions, or notice and recordkeeping requirements, included in
      such agreements shall be considered as a compromise motivated by
      the unique business, economic and political circumstances of
      webcasters, copyright owners, and performers rather than as
      matters that would have been negotiated in the marketplace
      between a willing buyer and a willing seller, or otherwise meet
      the objectives set forth in section 801(b). This subparagraph
      shall not apply to the extent that the receiving agent and a
      webcaster that is party to an agreement entered into pursuant to
      subparagraph (A) expressly authorize the submission of the
      agreement in a proceeding under this subsection.
        (D) Nothing in the Webcaster Settlement Act of 2008, the
      Webcaster Settlement Act of 2009, or any agreement entered into
      pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be taken into account by the
      United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
      Circuit in its review of the determination by the Copyright
      Royalty Judges of May 1, 2007, of rates and terms for the digital
      performance of sound recordings and ephemeral recordings,
      pursuant to sections 112 and 114.
        (E) As used in this paragraph - 
          (i) the term "noncommercial webcaster" means a webcaster that
        - 
            (I) is exempt from taxation under section 501 of the
          Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501);
            (II) has applied in good faith to the Internal Revenue
          Service for exemption from taxation under section 501 of the
          Internal Revenue Code and has a commercially reasonable
          expectation that such exemption shall be granted; or
            (III) is operated by a State or possession or any
          governmental entity or subordinate thereof, or by the United
          States or District of Columbia, for exclusively public
          purposes;

          (ii) the term "receiving agent" shall have the meaning given
        that term in section 261.2 of title 37, Code of Federal
        Regulations, as published in the Federal Register on July 8,
        2002; and
          (iii) the term "webcaster" means a person or entity that has
        obtained a compulsory license under section 112 or 114 and the
        implementing regulations therefor.

        (F) The authority to make settlements pursuant to subparagraph
      (A) shall expire at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the 30th day after
      the date of the enactment of the Webcaster Settlement Act of
      2009.

      (g) Proceeds From Licensing of Transmissions. - 
        (1) Except in the case of a transmission licensed under a
      statutory license in accordance with subsection (f) of this
      section - 
          (A) a featured recording artist who performs on a sound
        recording that has been licensed for a transmission shall be
        entitled to receive payments from the copyright owner of the
        sound recording in accordance with the terms of the artist's
        contract; and
          (B) a nonfeatured recording artist who performs on a sound
        recording that has been licensed for a transmission shall be
        entitled to receive payments from the copyright owner of the
        sound recording in accordance with the terms of the nonfeatured
        recording artist's applicable contract or other applicable
        agreement.

        (2) An agent designated to distribute receipts from the
      licensing of transmissions in accordance with subsection (f)
      shall distribute such receipts as follows:
          (A) 50 percent of the receipts shall be paid to the copyright
        owner of the exclusive right under section 106(6) of this title
        to publicly perform a sound recording by means of a digital
        audio transmission.
          (B) 2 1/2  percent of the receipts shall be deposited in an
        escrow account managed by an independent administrator jointly
        appointed by copyright owners of sound recordings and the
        American Federation of Musicians (or any successor entity) to
        be distributed to nonfeatured musicians (whether or not members
        of the American Federation of Musicians) who have performed on
        sound recordings.
          (C) 2 1/2  percent of the receipts shall be deposited in an
        escrow account managed by an independent administrator jointly
        appointed by copyright owners of sound recordings and the
        American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (or any
        successor entity) to be distributed to nonfeatured vocalists
        (whether or not members of the American Federation of
        Television and Radio Artists) who have performed on sound
        recordings.
          (D) 45 percent of the receipts shall be paid, on a per sound
        recording basis, to the recording artist or artists featured on
        such sound recording (or the persons conveying rights in the
        artists' performance in the sound recordings).

        (3) A nonprofit agent designated to distribute receipts from
      the licensing of transmissions in accordance with subsection (f)
      may deduct from any of its receipts, prior to the distribution of
      such receipts to any person or entity entitled thereto other than
      copyright owners and performers who have elected to receive
      royalties from another designated agent and have notified such
      nonprofit agent in writing of such election, the reasonable costs
      of such agent incurred after November 1, 1995, in - 
          (A) the administration of the collection, distribution, and
        calculation of the royalties;
          (B) the settlement of disputes relating to the collection and
        calculation of the royalties; and
          (C) the licensing and enforcement of rights with respect to
        the making of ephemeral recordings and performances subject to
        licensing under section 112 and this section, including those
        incurred in participating in negotiations or arbitration
        proceedings under section 112 and this section, except that all
        costs incurred relating to the section 112 ephemeral recordings
        right may only be deducted from the royalties received pursuant
        to section 112.

        (4) Notwithstanding paragraph (3), any designated agent
      designated to distribute receipts from the licensing of
      transmissions in accordance with subsection (f) may deduct from
      any of its receipts, prior to the distribution of such receipts,
      the reasonable costs identified in paragraph (3) of such agent
      incurred after November 1, 1995, with respect to such copyright
      owners and performers who have entered with such agent a
      contractual relationship that specifies that such costs may be
      deducted from such royalty receipts.

      (h) Licensing to Affiliates. - 
        (1) If the copyright owner of a sound recording licenses an
      affiliated entity the right to publicly perform a sound recording
      by means of a digital audio transmission under section 106(6),
      the copyright owner shall make the licensed sound recording
      available under section 106(6) on no less favorable terms and
      conditions to all bona fide entities that offer similar services,
      except that, if there are material differences in the scope of
      the requested license with respect to the type of service, the
      particular sound recordings licensed, the frequency of use, the
      number of subscribers served, or the duration, then the copyright
      owner may establish different terms and conditions for such other
      services.
        (2) The limitation set forth in paragraph (1) of this
      subsection shall not apply in the case where the copyright owner
      of a sound recording licenses - 
          (A) an interactive service; or
          (B) an entity to perform publicly up to 45 seconds of the
        sound recording and the sole purpose of the performance is to
        promote the distribution or performance of that sound
        recording.

      (i) No Effect on Royalties for Underlying Works. - License fees
    payable for the public performance of sound recordings under
    section 106(6) shall not be taken into account in any
    administrative, judicial, or other governmental proceeding to set
    or adjust the royalties payable to copyright owners of musical
    works for the public performance of their works. It is the intent
    of Congress that royalties payable to copyright owners of musical
    works for the public performance of their works shall not be
    diminished in any respect as a result of the rights granted by
    section 106(6).
      (j) Definitions. - As used in this section, the following terms
    have the following meanings:
        (1) An "affiliated entity" is an entity engaging in digital
      audio transmissions covered by section 106(6), other than an
      interactive service, in which the licensor has any direct or
      indirect partnership or any ownership interest amounting to 5
      percent or more of the outstanding voting or non-voting stock.
        (2) An "archived program" is a predetermined program that is
      available repeatedly on the demand of the transmission recipient
      and that is performed in the same order from the beginning,
      except that an archived program shall not include a recorded
      event or broadcast transmission that makes no more than an
      incidental use of sound recordings, as long as such recorded
      event or broadcast transmission does not contain an entire sound
      recording or feature a particular sound recording.
        (3) A "broadcast" transmission is a transmission made by a
      terrestrial broadcast station licensed as such by the Federal
      Communications Commission.
        (4) A "continuous program" is a predetermined program that is
      continuously performed in the same order and that is accessed at
      a point in the program that is beyond the control of the
      transmission recipient.
        (5) A "digital audio transmission" is a digital transmission as
      defined in section 101, that embodies the transmission of a sound
      recording. This term does not include the transmission of any
      audiovisual work.
        (6) An "eligible nonsubscription transmission" is a
      noninteractive nonsubscription digital audio transmission not
      exempt under subsection (d)(1) that is made as part of a service
      that provides audio programming consisting, in whole or in part,
      of performances of sound recordings, including retransmissions of
      broadcast transmissions, if the primary purpose of the service is
      to provide to the public such audio or other entertainment
      programming, and the primary purpose of the service is not to
      sell, advertise, or promote particular products or services other
      than sound recordings, live concerts, or other music-related
      events.
        (7) An "interactive service" is one that enables a member of
      the public to receive a transmission of a program specially
      created for the recipient, or on request, a transmission of a
      particular sound recording, whether or not as part of a program,
      which is selected by or on behalf of the recipient. The ability
      of individuals to request that particular sound recordings be
      performed for reception by the public at large, or in the case of
      a subscription service, by all subscribers of the service, does
      not make a service interactive, if the programming on each
      channel of the service does not substantially consist of sound
      recordings that are performed within 1 hour of the request or at
      a time designated by either the transmitting entity or the
      individual making such request. If an entity offers both
      interactive and noninteractive services (either concurrently or
      at different times), the noninteractive component shall not be
      treated as part of an interactive service.
        (8) A "new subscription service" is a service that performs
      sound recordings by means of noninteractive subscription digital
      audio transmissions and that is not a preexisting subscription
      service or a preexisting satellite digital audio radio service.
        (9) A "nonsubscription" transmission is any transmission that
      is not a subscription transmission.
        (10) A "preexisting satellite digital audio radio service" is a
      subscription satellite digital audio radio service provided
      pursuant to a satellite digital audio radio service license
      issued by the Federal Communications Commission on or before July
      31, 1998, and any renewal of such license to the extent of the
      scope of the original license, and may include a limited number
      of sample channels representative of the subscription service
      that are made available on a nonsubscription basis in order to
      promote the subscription service.
        (11) A "preexisting subscription service" is a service that
      performs sound recordings by means of noninteractive audio-only
      subscription digital audio transmissions, which was in existence
      and was making such transmissions to the public for a fee on or
      before July 31, 1998, and may include a limited number of sample
      channels representative of the subscription service that are made
      available on a nonsubscription basis in order to promote the
      subscription service.
        (12) A "retransmission" is a further transmission of an initial
      transmission, and includes any further retransmission of the same
      transmission. Except as provided in this section, a transmission
      qualifies as a "retransmission" only if it is simultaneous with
      the initial transmission. Nothing in this definition shall be
      construed to exempt a transmission that fails to satisfy a
      separate element required to qualify for an exemption under
      section 114(d)(1).
        (13) The "sound recording performance complement" is the
      transmission during any 3-hour period, on a particular channel
      used by a transmitting entity, of no more than - 
          (A) 3 different selections of sound recordings from any one
        phonorecord lawfully distributed for public performance or sale
        in the United States, if no more than 2 such selections are
        transmitted consecutively; or
          (B) 4 different selections of sound recordings - 
            (i) by the same featured recording artist; or
            (ii) from any set or compilation of phonorecords lawfully
          distributed together as a unit for public performance or sale
          in the United States,

        if no more than three such selections are transmitted
        consecutively:

      Provided, That the transmission of selections in excess of the
      numerical limits provided for in clauses (A) and (B) from
      multiple phonorecords shall nonetheless qualify as a sound
      recording performance complement if the programming of the
      multiple phonorecords was not willfully intended to avoid the
      numerical limitations prescribed in such clauses.
        (14) A "subscription" transmission is a transmission that is
      controlled and limited to particular recipients, and for which
      consideration is required to be paid or otherwise given by or on
      behalf of the recipient to receive the transmission or a package
      of transmissions including the transmission.
        (15) A "transmission" is either an initial transmission or a
      retransmission.

                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      Subsection (a) of Section 114 specified that the exclusive rights
    of the owner of copyright in a sound recording are limited to the
    rights to reproduce the sound recording in copies or phonorecords,
    to prepare derivative works based on the copyrighted sound
    recording, and to distribute copies or phonorecords of the sound
    recording to the public. Subsection (a) states explicitly that the
    owner's rights "do not include any right of performance under
    section 106(4)." The Committee considered at length the arguments
    in favor of establishing a limited performance right, in the form
    of a compulsory license, for copyrighted sound recordings, but
    concluded that the problem requires further study. It therefore
    added a new subsection (d) to the bill requiring the Register of
    Copyrights to submit to Congress, on January 3, 1978, "a report
    setting forth recommendations as to whether this section should be
    amended to provide for performers and copyright owners * * * any
    performance rights" in copyrighted sound recordings. Under the new
    subsection, the report "should describe the status of such rights
    in foreign countries, the views of major interested parties, and
    specific legislative or other recommendations, if any."
      Subsection (b) of section 114 makes clear that statutory
    protection for sound recordings extends only to the particular
    sounds of which the recording consists, and would not prevent a
    separate recording of another performance in which those sounds are
    imitated. Thus, infringement takes place whenever all or any
    substantial portion of the actual sounds that go to make up a
    copyrighted sound recording are reproduced in phonorecords by
    repressing, transcribing, recapturing off the air, or any other
    method, or by reproducing them in the soundtrack or audio portion
    of a motion picture or other audiovisual work. Mere imitation of a
    recorded performance would not constitute a copyright infringement
    even where one performer deliberately sets out to simulate
    another's performance as exactly as possible.
      Under section 114, the exclusive right of owner of copyright in a
    sound recording to prepare derivative works based on the
    copyrighted sound recording is recognized. However, in view of the
    expressed intention not to give exclusive rights against imitative
    or simulated performances and recordings, the Committee adopted an
    amendment to make clear the scope of rights under section 106(2) in
    this context. Section 114(b) provides that the "exclusive right of
    the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clause (2) of
    section 106 is limited to the right to prepare a derivative work in
    which the actual sounds fixed in the sound recording are
    rearranged, remixed, or otherwise altered in sequence or quality."
      Another amendment deals with the use of copyrighted sound
    recordings "included in educational television and radio programs *
    * * distributed or transmitted by or through public broadcasting
    entities." This use of recordings is permissible without
    authorization from the owner of copyright in the sound recording,
    as long as "copies or phonorecords of said programs are not
    commercially distributed by or through public broadcasting entities
    to the general public."
      During the 1975 hearings, the Register of Copyrights expressed
    some concern that an invaluable segment of this country's musical
    heritage - in the form of sound recordings - had become
    inaccessible to musicologists and to others for scholarly purposes.
    Several of the major recording companies have responded to the
    Register's concern by granting blanket licenses to the Library of
    Congress to permit it to make single copy duplications of sound
    recordings maintained in the Library's archives for research
    purposes. Moreover, steps are being taken to determine the
    feasibility of additional licensing arrangements as a means of
    satisfying the needs of key regional music libraries across the
    country. The Register has agreed to report to Congress if further
    legislative consideration should be undertaken.
      Section 114(c) states explicitly that nothing in the provisions
    of section 114 should be construed to "limit or impair the
    exclusive right to perform publicly, by means of a phonorecord, any
    of the works specified by section 106(4)." This principle is
    already implicit in the bill, but it is restated to avoid the
    danger of confusion between rights in a sound recording and rights
    in the musical composition or other work embodied in the recording.

    arbitration royalty panel or decision by the Librarian of
    Congress".
      Subsec. (f)(4). Pub. L. 108-419, Sec. 5(c)(4), substituted
    "Copyright Royalty Judges" for "Librarian of Congress" in two
    places and inserted after first sentence in subpar. (A) "The notice
    and recordkeeping rules in effect on the day before the effective
    date of the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004
    shall remain in effect unless and until new regulations are

    shall take into account the substance and effect of the rules in
    effect on the day before the effective date of the Copyright
    Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004 and shall, to the
    extent practicable, avoid significant disruption of the functions
    of any designated agent authorized to collect and distribute
    royalty fees."
      2002 - Subsec. (f)(5). Pub. L. 107-321, Sec. 4, added par. (5).
      Subsec. (g)(2). Pub. L. 107-321, Sec. 5(c), amended par. (2)
    generally. Prior to amendment, par. (2) read as follows: "The
    copyright owner of the exclusive right under section 106(6) of this
    title to publicly perform a sound recording by means of a digital
    audio transmission shall allocate to recording artists in the
    following manner its receipts from the statutory licensing of
    transmission performances of the sound recording in accordance with
    subsection (f) of this section:
        "(A) 2 1/2  percent of the receipts shall be deposited in an
      escrow account managed by an independent administrator jointly
      appointed by copyright owners of sound recordings and the
      American Federation of Musicians (or any successor entity) to be
      distributed to nonfeatured musicians (whether or not members of
      the American Federation of Musicians) who have performed on sound
      recordings.
        "(B) 2 1/2  percent of the receipts shall be deposited in an
      escrow account managed by an independent administrator jointly
      appointed by copyright owners of sound recordings and the

      (whether or not members of the American Federation of Television
      and Radio Artists) who have performed on sound recordings.
        "(C) 45 percent of the receipts shall be allocated, on a per
      sound recording basis, to the recording artist or artists

      in the artists' performance in the sound recordings)."

    'interactive service' is one that enables a member of the public to
    receive, on request, a transmission of a particular sound recording
    chosen by or on behalf of the recipient. The ability of individuals
    to request that particular sound recordings be performed for
    reception by the public at large does not make a service
    interactive. If an entity offers both interactive and non-
    interactive services (either concurrently or at different times),
    the non-interactive component shall not be treated as part of an
    interactive service."

                   FINDINGS RELATING TO PUB. L. 107-321               
      Pub. L. 107-321, Sec. 2, Dec. 4, 2002, 116 Stat. 2780, provided
    that: "Congress finds the following:
        "(1) Some small webcasters who did not participate in the
      copyright arbitration royalty panel proceeding leading to the
      July 8, 2002 order of the Librarian of Congress establishing
      rates and terms for certain digital performances and ephemeral
      reproductions of sound recordings, as provided in part 261 of the
      Code of Federal Regulations (published in the Federal Register on
      July 8, 2002) (referred to in this section as 'small
      webcasters'), have expressed reservations about the fee structure
      set forth in such order, and have expressed their desire for a
      fee based on a percentage of revenue.
        "(2) Congress has strongly encouraged representatives of
      copyright owners of sound recordings and representatives of the
      small webcasters to engage in negotiations to arrive at an
      agreement that would include a fee based on a percentage of
      revenue.
        "(3) The representatives have arrived at an agreement that they
      can accept in the extraordinary and unique circumstances here
      presented, specifically as to the small webcasters, their belief
      in their inability to pay the fees due pursuant to the July 8
      order, and as to the copyright owners of sound recordings and
      performers, the strong encouragement of Congress to reach an
      accommodation with the small webcasters on an expedited basis.
        "(4) The representatives have indicated that they do not
      believe the agreement provides for or in any way approximates
      fair or reasonable royalty rates and terms, or rates and terms
      that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a
      willing buyer and a willing seller.
        "(5) Congress has made no determination as to whether the
      agreement provides for or in any way approximates fair or
      reasonable fees and terms, or rates and terms that would have
      been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a
      willing seller.
        "(6) Congress likewise has made no determination as to whether
      the July 8 order is reasonable or arbitrary, and nothing in this
      Act [amending this section and enacting provisions set out as
      notes under this section and section 101 of this title] shall be
      taken into account by the United States Court of Appeals for the
      District of Columbia Circuit in its review of such order.
        "(7) It is, nevertheless, in the public interest for the
      parties to be able to enter into such an agreement without fear
      of liability for deviating from the fees and terms of the July 8
      order, if it is clear that the agreement will not be admissible
      as evidence or otherwise taken into account in any government
      proceeding involving the setting or adjustment of the royalties
      payable to copyright owners of sound recordings for the public
      performance or reproduction in ephemeral phonorecords or copies
      of such works, the determination of terms or conditions related
      thereto, or the establishment of notice or recordkeeping
      requirements."
      Pub. L. 107-321, Sec. 5(a), Dec. 4, 2002, 116 Stat. 2783,
    provided that: "Congress finds that - 
        "(1) in the case of royalty payments from the licensing of
      digital transmissions of sound recordings under subsection (f) of
      section 114 of title 17, United States Code, the parties have
      voluntarily negotiated arrangements under which payments shall be
      made directly to featured recording artists and the
      administrators of the accounts provided in subsection (g)(2) of
      that section;
        "(2) such voluntarily negotiated payment arrangements have been
      codified in regulations issued by the Librarian of Congress,
      currently found in section 261.4 of title 37, Code of Federal
      Regulations, as published in the Federal Register on July 8,
      2002;
        "(3) other regulations issued by the Librarian of Congress were
      inconsistent with the voluntarily negotiated arrangements by such
      parties concerning the deductibility of certain costs incurred
      for licensing and arbitration, and Congress is therefore
      restoring those terms as originally negotiated among the parties;
      and
        "(4) in light of the special circumstances described in this
      subsection, the uncertainty created by the regulations issued by
      the Librarian of Congress, and the fact that all of the
      interested parties have reached agreement, the voluntarily
      negotiated arrangements agreed to among the parties are being
      codified."

                      SUSPENSION OF CERTAIN PAYMENTS                  
      Pub. L. 107-321, Sec. 3, Dec. 4, 2002, 116 Stat. 2781, provided

      webcasters for the digital performance of sound recordings under
      section 114 of title 17, United States Code, and the making of
      ephemeral phonorecords under section 112 of title 17, United
      States Code, during the period beginning on October 28, 1998, and
      ending on May 31, 2003, which have not already been paid, shall
      not be due until June 20, 2003.
        "(2) Definition. - In this subsection, the term 'noncommercial
      webcaster' has the meaning given that term in section
      114(f)(5)(E)(i) of title 17, United States Code, as added by
      section 4 of this Act.
      "(b) Small Commercial Webcasters. - 
        "(1) In general. - The receiving agent may, in a writing signed
      by an authorized representative thereof, delay the obligation of
      any 1 or more small commercial webcasters to make payments
      pursuant to sections 112 and 114 of title 17, United States Code,
      for a period determined by such entity to allow negotiations as
      permitted in section 4 of this Act [amending this section],
      except that any such period shall end no later than December 15,
      2002. The duration and terms of any such delay shall be as set
      forth in such writing.
        "(2) Definitions. - In this subsection - 
          "(A) the term 'webcaster' has the meaning given that term in
        section 114(f)(5)(E)(iii) of title 17, United States Code, as
        added by section 4 of this Act; and
          "(B) the term 'receiving agent' shall have the meaning given
        that term in section 261.2 of title 37, Code of Federal
        Regulations, as published in the Federal Register on July 8,
        2002."

                            REPORT TO CONGRESS                        
      Pub. L. 107-321, Sec. 6, Dec. 4, 2002, 116 Stat. 2785, provided
    that: "By not later than June 1, 2004, the Comptroller General of

    CHAPTER 1 - SUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE OF COPYRIGHT

-HEAD-
    Sec. 115. Scope of exclusive rights in nondramatic musical works:
      Compulsory license for making and distributing phonorecords

-STATUTE-
      In the case of nondramatic musical works, the exclusive rights
    provided by clauses (1) and (3) of section 106, to make and to
    distribute phonorecords of such works, are subject to compulsory
    licensing under the conditions specified by this section.
      (a) Availability and Scope of Compulsory License. - 
        (1) When phonorecords of a nondramatic musical work have been
      distributed to the public in the United States under the
      authority of the copyright owner, any other person, including
      those who make phonorecords or digital phonorecord deliveries,
      may, by complying with the provisions of this section, obtain a
      compulsory license to make and distribute phonorecords of the
      work. A person may obtain a compulsory license only if his or her
      primary purpose in making phonorecords is to distribute them to
      the public for private use, including by means of a digital
      phonorecord delivery. A person may not obtain a compulsory
      license for use of the work in the making of phonorecords
      duplicating a sound recording fixed by another, unless: (i) such
      sound recording was fixed lawfully; and (ii) the making of the
      phonorecords was authorized by the owner of copyright in the
      sound recording or, if the sound recording was fixed before
      February 15, 1972, by any person who fixed the sound recording
      pursuant to an express license from the owner of the copyright in
      the musical work or pursuant to a valid compulsory license for
      use of such work in a sound recording.
        (2) A compulsory license includes the privilege of making a
      musical arrangement of the work to the extent necessary to
      conform it to the style or manner of interpretation of the
      performance involved, but the arrangement shall not change the
      basic melody or fundamental character of the work, and shall not
      be subject to protection as a derivative work under this title,
      except with the express consent of the copyright owner.

      (b) Notice of Intention To Obtain Compulsory License. - 
        (1) Any person who wishes to obtain a compulsory license under
      this section shall, before or within thirty days after making,
      and before distributing any phonorecords of the work, serve
      notice of intention to do so on the copyright owner. If the
      registration or other public records of the Copyright Office do
      not identify the copyright owner and include an address at which
      notice can be served, it shall be sufficient to file the notice
      of intention in the Copyright Office. The notice shall comply, in
      form, content, and manner of service, with requirements that the
      Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.
        (2) Failure to serve or file the notice required by clause (1)
      forecloses the possibility of a compulsory license and, in the
      absence of a negotiated license, renders the making and
      distribution of phonorecords actionable as acts of infringement
      under section 501 and fully subject to the remedies provided by
      sections 502 through 506 and 509.

      (c) Royalty Payable Under Compulsory License. - 
        (1) To be entitled to receive royalties under a compulsory
      license, the copyright owner must be identified in the
      registration or other public records of the Copyright Office. The
      owner is entitled to royalties for phonorecords made and
      distributed after being so identified, but is not entitled to
      recover for any phonorecords previously made and distributed.
        (2) Except as provided by clause (1), the royalty under a
      compulsory license shall be payable for every phonorecord made
      and distributed in accordance with the license. For this purpose,
      and other than as provided in paragraph (3), a phonorecord is
      considered "distributed" if the person exercising the compulsory
      license has voluntarily and permanently parted with its
      possession. With respect to each work embodied in the
      phonorecord, the royalty shall be either two and three-fourths
      cents, or one-half of one cent per minute of playing time or
      fraction thereof, whichever amount is larger.
        (3)(A) A compulsory license under this section includes the
      right of the compulsory licensee to distribute or authorize the
      distribution of a phonorecord of a nondramatic musical work by
      means of a digital transmission which constitutes a digital
      phonorecord delivery, regardless of whether the digital
      transmission is also a public performance of the sound recording
      under section 106(6) of this title or of any nondramatic musical
      work embodied therein under section 106(4) of this title. For
      every digital phonorecord delivery by or under the authority of
      the compulsory licensee - 
          (i) on or before December 31, 1997, the royalty payable by
        the compulsory licensee shall be the royalty prescribed under
        paragraph (2) and chapter 8 of this title; and
          (ii) on or after January 1, 1998, the royalty payable by the
        compulsory licensee shall be the royalty prescribed under
        subparagraphs (B) through (E) and chapter 8 of this title.

        (B) Notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws, any
      copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and any persons
      entitled to obtain a compulsory license under subsection (a)(1)
      may negotiate and agree upon the terms and rates of royalty
      payments under this section and the proportionate division of
      fees paid among copyright owners, and may designate common agents
      on a nonexclusive basis to negotiate, agree to, pay or receive
      such royalty payments. Such authority to negotiate the terms and
      rates of royalty payments includes, but is not limited to, the
      authority to negotiate the year during which the royalty rates
      prescribed under this subparagraph and subparagraphs (C) through
      (E) and chapter 8 of this title shall next be determined.
        (C) Proceedings under chapter 8 shall determine reasonable
      rates and terms of royalty payments for the activities specified
      by this section during the period beginning with the effective
      date of such rates and terms, but not earlier than January 1 of
      the second year following the year in which the petition
      requesting the proceeding is filed, and ending on the effective
      date of successor rates and terms, or such other period as the
      parties may agree. Such terms and rates shall distinguish between
      (i) digital phonorecord deliveries where the reproduction or
      distribution of a phonorecord is incidental to the transmission
      which constitutes the digital phonorecord delivery, and (ii)
      digital phonorecord deliveries in general. Any copyright owners
      of nondramatic musical works and any persons entitled to obtain a
      compulsory license under subsection (a)(1) may submit to the
      Copyright Royalty Judges licenses covering such activities. The
      parties to each proceeding shall bear their own costs.
        (D) The schedule of reasonable rates and terms determined by
      the Copyright Royalty Judges shall, subject to subparagraph (E),
      be binding on all copyright owners of nondramatic musical works
      and persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license under
      subsection (a)(1) during the period specified in subparagraph
      (C), such other period as may be determined pursuant to
      subparagraphs (B) and (C), or such other period as the parties
      may agree. Such terms and rates shall distinguish between (i)
      digital phonorecord deliveries where the reproduction or
      distribution of a phonorecord is incidental to the transmission
      which constitutes the digital phonorecord delivery, and (ii)
      digital phonorecord deliveries in general. In addition to the
      objectives set forth in section 801(b)(1), in establishing such
      rates and terms, the Copyright Royalty Judges may consider rates
      and terms under voluntary license agreements described in
      subparagraphs (B) and (C). The royalty rates payable for a
      compulsory license for a digital phonorecord delivery under this
      section shall be established de novo and no precedential effect
      shall be given to the amount of the royalty payable by a
      compulsory licensee for digital phonorecord deliveries on or
      before December 31, 1997. The Copyright Royalty Judges shall also
      establish requirements by which copyright owners may receive
      reasonable notice of the use of their works under this section,
      and under which records of such use shall be kept and made
      available by persons making digital phonorecord deliveries.
        (E)(i) License agreements voluntarily negotiated at any time
      between one or more copyright owners of nondramatic musical works
      and one or more persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license
      under subsection (a)(1) shall be given effect in lieu of any
      determination by the Librarian of Congress and Copyright Royalty
      Judges. Subject to clause (ii), the royalty rates determined
      pursuant to subparagraph (!1) (C) and (D) shall be given effect
      as to digital phonorecord deliveries in lieu of any contrary
      royalty rates specified in a contract pursuant to which a
      recording artist who is the author of a nondramatic musical work
      grants a license under that person's exclusive rights in the
      musical work under paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 106 or
      commits another person to grant a license in that musical work
      under paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 106, to a person desiring
      to fix in a tangible medium of expression a sound recording
      embodying the musical work.

        (ii) The second sentence of clause (i) shall not apply to - 
          (I) a contract entered into on or before June 22, 1995, and
        not modified thereafter for the purpose of reducing the royalty
        rates determined pursuant to subparagraph (!1) (C) and (D) or
        of increasing the number of musical works within the scope of
        the contract covered by the reduced rates, except if a contract
        entered into on or before June 22, 1995, is modified thereafter
        for the purpose of increasing the number of musical works
        within the scope of the contract, any contrary royalty rates
        specified in the contract shall be given effect in lieu of
        royalty rates determined pursuant to subparagraph (!1) (C) and
        (D) for the number of musical works within the scope of the
        contract as of June 22, 1995; and
          (II) a contract entered into after the date that the sound
        recording is fixed in a tangible medium of expression
        substantially in a form intended for commercial release, if at
        the time the contract is entered into, the recording artist
        retains the right to grant licenses as to the musical work
        under paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 106.

        (F) Except as provided in section 1002(e) of this title, a
      digital phonorecord delivery licensed under this paragraph shall
      be accompanied by the information encoded in the sound recording,
      if any, by or under the authority of the copyright owner of that
      sound recording, that identifies the title of the sound
      recording, the featured recording artist who performs on the
      sound recording, and related information, including information
      concerning the underlying musical work and its writer.
        (G)(i) A digital phonorecord delivery of a sound recording is
      actionable as an act of infringement under section 501, and is
      fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through
      506, unless - 
          (I) the digital phonorecord delivery has been authorized by
        the copyright owner of the sound recording; and
          (II) the owner of the copyright in the sound recording or the
        entity making the digital phonorecord delivery has obtained a
        compulsory license under this section or has otherwise been
        authorized by the copyright owner of the musical work to
        distribute or authorize the distribution, by means of a digital
        phonorecord delivery, of each musical work embodied in the
        sound recording.

        (ii) Any cause of action under this subparagraph shall be in
      addition to those available to the owner of the copyright in the
      nondramatic musical work under subsection (c)(6) and section
      106(4) and the owner of the copyright in the sound recording
      under section 106(6).
        (H) The liability of the copyright owner of a sound recording
      for infringement of the copyright in a nondramatic musical work
      embodied in the sound recording shall be determined in accordance
      with applicable law, except that the owner of a copyright in a
      sound recording shall not be liable for a digital phonorecord
      delivery by a third party if the owner of the copyright in the
      sound recording does not license the distribution of a
      phonorecord of the nondramatic musical work.
        (I) Nothing in section 1008 shall be construed to prevent the
      exercise of the rights and remedies allowed by this paragraph,
      paragraph (6), and chapter 5 in the event of a digital
      phonorecord delivery, except that no action alleging infringement
      of copyright may be brought under this title against a
      manufacturer, importer or distributor of a digital audio
      recording device, a digital audio recording medium, an analog
      recording device, or an analog recording medium, or against a
      consumer, based on the actions described in such section.
        (J) Nothing in this section annuls or limits (i) the exclusive
      right to publicly perform a sound recording or the musical work
      embodied therein, including by means of a digital transmission,
      under sections 106(4) and 106(6), (ii) except for compulsory
      licensing under the conditions specified by this section, the
      exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute the sound recording
      and the musical work embodied therein under sections 106(1) and
      106(3), including by means of a digital phonorecord delivery, or
      (iii) any other rights under any other provision of section 106,
      or remedies available under this title, as such rights or
      remedies exist either before or after the date of enactment of
      the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995.
        (K) The provisions of this section concerning digital
      phonorecord deliveries shall not apply to any exempt
      transmissions or retransmissions under section 114(d)(1). The
      exemptions created in section 114(d)(1) do not expand or reduce
      the rights of copyright owners under section 106(1) through (5)
      with respect to such transmissions and retransmissions.
        (4) A compulsory license under this section includes the right
      of the maker of a phonorecord of a nondramatic musical work under
      subsection (a)(1) to distribute or authorize distribution of such
      phonorecord by rental, lease, or lending (or by acts or practices
      in the nature of rental, lease, or lending). In addition to any
      royalty payable under clause (2) and chapter 8 of this title, a
      royalty shall be payable by the compulsory licensee for every act
      of distribution of a phonorecord by or in the nature of rental,
      lease, or lending, by or under the authority of the compulsory
      licensee. With respect to each nondramatic musical work embodied
      in the phonorecord, the royalty shall be a proportion of the
      revenue received by the compulsory licensee from every such act
      of distribution of the phonorecord under this clause equal to the
      proportion of the revenue received by the compulsory licensee
      from distribution of the phonorecord under clause (2) that is
      payable by a compulsory licensee under that clause and under
      chapter 8. The Register of Copyrights shall issue regulations to
      carry out the purpose of this clause.
        (5) Royalty payments shall be made on or before the twentieth
      day of each month and shall include all royalties for the month
      next preceding. Each monthly payment shall be made under oath and
      shall comply with requirements that the Register of Copyrights
      shall prescribe by regulation. The Register shall also prescribe
      regulations under which detailed cumulative annual statements of
      account, certified by a certified public accountant, shall be
      filed for every compulsory license under this section. The
      regulations covering both the monthly and the annual statements
      of account shall prescribe the form, content, and manner of
      certification with respect to the number of records made and the
      number of records distributed.
        (6) If the copyright owner does not receive the monthly payment
      and the monthly and annual statements of account when due, the
      owner may give written notice to the licensee that, unless the
      default is remedied within thirty days from the date of the
      notice, the compulsory license will be automatically terminated.
      Such termination renders either the making or the distribution,
      or both, of all phonorecords for which the royalty has not been
      paid, actionable as acts of infringement under section 501 and
      fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through
      506.

      (d) Definition. - As used in this section, the following term has
    the following meaning: A "digital phonorecord delivery" is each
    individual delivery of a phonorecord by digital transmission of a
    sound recording which results in a specifically identifiable
    reproduction by or for any transmission recipient of a phonorecord
    of that sound recording, regardless of whether the digital
    transmission is also a public performance of the sound recording or
    any nondramatic musical work embodied therein. A digital
    phonorecord delivery does not result from a real-time, non-
    interactive subscription transmission of a sound recording where
    no reproduction of the sound recording or the musical work embodied
    therein is made from the inception of the transmission through to
    its receipt by the transmission recipient in order to make the
    sound recording audible.

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      The provisions of section 1(e) and 101(e) of the present law
    [sections 1(e) and 101(e) of former title 17], establishing a
    system of compulsory licensing for the making and distribution of
    phonorecords of copyrighted music, are retained with a number of
    modifications and clarifications in section 115 of the bill. Under
    these provisions, which represented a compromise of the most
    controversial issue of the 1909 act, a musical composition that has
    been reproduced in phonorecords with the permission of the
    copyright owner may generally be reproduced in phonorecords by
    another person, if that person notifies the copyright owner and
    pays a specified royalty.
      The fundamental question of whether to retain the compulsory
    license or to do away with it altogether was a major issue during
    earlier stages of the program for general revision of the copyright
    law. At the hearings it was apparent that the argument on this
    point had shifted, and the real issue was not whether to retain the
    compulsory license but how much the royalty rate under it should
    be. The arguments for and against retention of the compulsory
    license are outlined at pages 66-67 of this Committee's 1967 report
    (H. Rept. No. 83, 90th Cong., 1st Sess.). The Committee's
    conclusion on this point remains the same as in 1967: "that a
    compulsory licensing system is still warranted as a condition for
    the rights of reproducing and distributing phonorecords of
    copyrighted music," but "that the present system is unfair and
    unnecessarily burdensome on copyright owners, and that the present
    statutory rate is too low."
      Availability and Scope of Compulsory License. Subsection (a) of
    section 115 deals with three doubtful questions under the present
    law: (1) the nature of the original recording that will make the
    work available to others for recording under a compulsory license;
    (2) the nature of the sound recording that can be made under a
    compulsory license; and (3) the extent to which someone acting
    under a compulsory license can depart from the work as written or
    recorded without violating the copyright owner's right to make an
    "arrangement" or other derivative work. The first two of these
    questions are answered in clause (1) of section 115(a), and the
    third is the subject of clause (2).
      The present law, though not altogether clear, apparently bases
    compulsory licensing on the making or licensing of the first
    recording, even if no authorized records are distributed to the
    public. The first sentence of section 115(a)(1) would change the
    basis for compulsory licensing to authorized public distribution of
    phonorecords (including disks and audio tapes but not the sound
    tracks or other sound records accompanying a motion picture or
    other audiovisual work). Under the clause, a compulsory license
    would be available to anyone as soon as "phonorecords of a
    nondramatic musical work have been distributed to the public in the
    United States under the authority of the copyright owner."
      The second sentence of clause (1), which has been the subject of
    some debate, provides that "a person may obtain a compulsory
    license only if his or her primary purpose in making phonorecords
    is to distribute them to the public for private use." This
    provision was criticized as being discriminatory against background
    music systems, since it would prevent a background music producer
    from making recordings without the express consent of the copyright
    owner; it was argued that this could put the producer at a great
    competitive disadvantage with performing rights societies, allow
    discrimination, and destroy or prevent entry of businesses. The
    committee concluded, however, that the purpose of the compulsory
    license does not extend to manufacturers of phonorecords that are
    intended primarily for commercial use, including not only
    broadcasters and jukebox operators but also background music
    services.
      The final sentence of clause (1) provides that a person may not
    obtain a compulsory license for use of the work in the duplication
    of a sound recording made by another, unless the sound recording
    being duplicated was itself fixed lawfully and the making of
    phonorecords duplicated from it was authorized by the owner of
    copyright in the sound recording (or, if the recording was fixed
    before February 15, 1972, by the voluntary or compulsory licensee
    of the music used in the recording). The basic intent of this
    sentence is to make clear that a person is not entitled to a
    compulsory license of copyrighted musical works for the purpose of
    making an unauthorized duplication of a musical sound recording
    originally developed and produced by another. It is the view of the
    Committee that such was the original intent of the Congress in
    enacting the 1909 Copyright Act, and it has been so construed by
    the 3d, 5th, 9th and 10th Circuits in the following cases: Duchess
    Music Corp. v. Stern, 458 F.2d 1305 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 409
    U.S. 847 (1972) [93 S.Ct. 52, 34 L.Ed.2d 88]; Edward B. Marks Music
    Corp. v. Colorado Magnetics, Inc., 497 F.2d 285, aff'd on rehearing
    en banc, 497 F.2d 292 (10th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1120
    (1975) [95 S.Ct. 801, 42 L.Ed.2d 819]; Jondora Music Publishing Co.
    v. Melody Recordings, Inc., 506 F.2d 392 (3d Cir. 1974, as amended
    1975), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 1012 (1975) [95 S.Ct. 2417, 44
    L.Ed.2d 680]; and Fame Publishing Co. v. Alabama Custom Tape, Inc.,
    507 F.2d 667 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 841 (1975) [96
    S.Ct. 73, 46 L.Ed.2d 61].
      Under this provision, it would be possible to obtain a compulsory
    license for the use of copyrighted music under section 115 if the
    owner of the sound recording being duplicated authorizes its
    duplication. This does not, however, in any way require the owner
    of the original sound recording to grant a license to duplicate the
    original sound recording. It is not intended that copyright
    protection for sound recordings be circumscribed by requiring the
    owners of sound recordings to grant a compulsory license to
    unauthorized duplicators or others.
      The second clause of subsection (a) is intended to recognize the
    practical need for a limited privilege to make arrangements of
    music being used under a compulsory license, but without allowing
    the music to be perverted, distorted, or travestied. Clause (2)
    permits arrangements of a work "to the extent necessary to conform
    it to the style or manner of interpretation of the performance
    involved," so long as it does not "change the basic melody or
    fundamental character of the work." The provision also prohibits
    the compulsory licensee from claiming an independent copyright in
    his arrangement as a "derivative work" without the express consent
    of the copyright owner.
      Procedure for Obtaining Compulsory License. Section 115(b)(1)
    requires anyone who wishes to take advantage of the compulsory
    licensing provisions to serve a "notice of intention to obtain a
    compulsory license," which is much like the "notice of intention to
    use" required by the present law. Under section 115, the notice
    must be served before any phonorecords are distributed, but service
    can take place "before or within 30 days after making" any
    phonorecords. The notice is to be served on the copyright owner,
    but if the owner is not identified in the Copyright Office records,
    "it shall be sufficient to file the notice of intention in the
    Copyright Office."
      The Committee deleted clause (2) of section 115(b) of S. 22 as
    adopted by the Senate. The provision was a vestige of jukebox
    provisions in earlier bills, and its requirements no longer served
    any useful purpose.
      Clause (2) [formerly clause (3)] of section 115(b) [cl. (2) of
    subsec. (b) of this section] provides that "failure to serve or
    file the notice required by clause (1) * * * forecloses the
    possibility of a compulsory license and, in the absence of a
    negotiated license, renders the making and distribution of
    phonorecords actionable as acts of infringement under section 501
    and fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through
    506." The remedies provided in section 501 are those applicable to
    infringements generally.
      Royalty Payable Under Compulsory License. Identification of
    Copyright Owner. - Under the present law a copyright owner is
    obliged to file a "notice of use" in the Copyright Office, stating
    that the initial recording of the copyrighted work has been made or
    licensed, in order to recover against an unauthorized record
    manufacturer. This requirement has resulted in a technical loss of
    rights in some cases, and serves little or no purpose where the
    registration and assignment records of the Copyright Office already
    show the facts of ownership. Section 115(c)(1) therefore drops any
    formal "notice of use" requirements and merely provides that, "to
    be entitled to receive royalties under a compulsory license, the
    copyright owner must be identified in the registration or other
    public records of the Copyright Office." On the other hand, since
    proper identification is an important precondition of recovery, the
    bill further provides that "the owner is entitled to royalties for
    phonorecords manufactured and distributed after being so
    identified, but is not entitled to recover for any phonorecords
    previously made and distributed."
      Basis of Royalty. - Under the present statute the specified
    royalty is payable "on each such part manufactured," regardless of
    how many "parts" (i.e., records) are sold. This basis for
    calculating the royalty has been revised in section 115(c)(2) to
    provide that "the royalty under a compulsory license shall be
    payable for every phonorecord made and distributed in accordance
    with the license." This basis is more compatible with the general
    practice in negotiated licenses today. It is unjustified to require
    a compulsory licensee to pay license fees on records which merely
    go into inventory, which may later be destroyed, and from which the
    record producer gains no economic benefit.
      It is intended that the Register of Copyrights will prescribe
    regulations insuring that copyright owners will receive full and
    prompt payment for all phonorecords made and distributed. Section
    115(c)(2) states that "a phonorecord is considered 'distributed' if
    the person exercising the compulsory license has voluntarily and
    permanently parted with its possession." For this purpose, the
    concept of "distribution" comprises any act by which the person
    exercising the compulsory license voluntarily relinquishes
    possession of a phonorecord (considered as a fungible unit),
    regardless of whether the distribution is to the public, passes
    title, constitutes a gift, or is sold, rented, leased, or loaned,
    unless it is actually returned and the transaction cancelled.
    Neither involuntary relinquishment, as through theft or fire, nor
    the destruction of unwanted records, would constitute
    "distribution."
      The term "made" is intended to be broader than "manufactured,"
    and to include within its scope every possible manufacturing or
    other process capable of reproducing a sound recording in
    phonorecords. The use of the phrase "made and distributed"
    establishes the basis upon which the royalty rate for compulsory
    licensing under section 115 is to be calculated, but it is in no
    way intended to weaken the liability of record pressers and other
    manufacturers and makers of phonorecords for copyright infringement
    where the compulsory licensing requirements have not been met. As
    under the present law, even if a presser, manufacturer, or other
    maker had no role in the distribution process, that person would be
    regarded as jointly and severally liable in a case where the court
    finds that infringement has taken place because of failure to
    comply with the provisions of section 115.
      Under existing practices in the record industry, phonorecords are
    distributed to wholesalers and retailers with the privilege of
    returning unsold copies for credit or exchange. As a result, the
    number of recordings that have been "permanently" distributed will
    not usually be known until some time - six or seven months on the
    average - after the initial distribution. In recognition of this
    problem, it has become a well-established industry practice, under
    negotiated licenses, for record companies to maintain reasonable
    reserves of the mechanical royalties due the copyright owners,
    against which royalties on the returns can be offset. The Committee
    recognizes that this practice may be consistent with the statutory
    requirements for monthly compulsory license accounting reports, but
    recognizes the possibility that, without proper safeguards, the
    maintenance of such reserves could be manipulated to avoid making
    payments of the full amounts owing to copyright owners. Under these
    circumstances, the regulations prescribed by the Register of
    Copyrights should contain detailed provisions ensuring that the
    ultimate disposition of every phonorecord made under a compulsory
    license is accounted for, and that payment is made for every
    phonorecord "voluntarily and permanently" distributed. In
    particular, the Register should prescribe a point in time when, for
    accounting purposes under section 115, a phonorecord will be
    considered "permanently distributed," and should prescribe the
    situations in which a compulsory licensee is barred from
    maintaining reserves (e.g., situations in which the compulsory
    licensee has frequently failed to make payments in the past.)
      Rate of Royalty. - A large preponderance of the extensive
    testimony presented to the Committee on section 115 was devoted to
    the question of the amount of the statutory royalty rate. An
    extensive review and analysis of the testimony and arguments
    received on this question appear in the 1974 Senate report (S. Rep.
    No. 94-473) at page 71-94.
      While upon initial review it might be assumed that the rate
    established in 1909 would not be reasonable at the present time,
    the committee believes that an increase in the mechanical royalty
    rate must be justified on the basis of existing economic conditions
    and not on the mere passage of 67 years. Following a thorough
    analysis of the problem, the Committee considers that an increase
    of the present two-cent royalty to a rate of 2 3/4  cents (or .6 of
    one cent per minute or fraction of playing time) is justified. This
    rate will be subject to review by the Copyright Royalty Commission,
    as provided by section 801, in 1980 and at 10-year intervals
    thereafter.
      Accounting and Payment of Royalties; Effect of Default. Clause
    (3) of Section 115(c) provides that royalty payments are to be made
    on a monthly basis, in accordance with requirements that the
    Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation. In order to
    increase the protection of copyright proprietors against economic
    harm from companies which might refuse or fail to pay their just
    obligations, compulsory licensees will also be required to make a
    detailed cumulative annual statement of account, certified by a
    Certified Public Accountant.
      A source of criticism with respect to the compulsory licensing
    provisions of the present statute has been the rather ineffective
    sanctions against default by compulsory licensees. Clause (4) of
    section 115(c) corrects this defect by permitting the copyright
    owner to serve written notice on a defaulting licensee, and by
    providing for termination of the compulsory license if the default
    is not remedied within 30 days after notice is given. Termination
    under this clause "renders either the making or the distribution,
    or both, of all phonorecords for which the royalty had not been
    paid, actionable as acts of infringement under section 501 and
    fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through
    506."

        (1) Authority for negotiations. - Any owners of copyright in
      works to which this section applies and any operators of coin-
      operated phonorecord players may negotiate and agree upon the
      terms and rates of royalty payments for the performance of such
      works and the proportionate division of fees paid among copyright
      owners, and may designate common agents to negotiate, agree to,
      pay, or receive such royalty payments.
        (2) Chapter 8 proceeding. - Parties not subject to such a
      negotiation may have the terms and rates and the division of fees
      described in paragraph (1) determined in a proceeding in

    determination by the Copyright Royalty Judges.
      (d) Definitions. - As used in this section, the following terms
    mean the following:
        (1) A "coin-operated phonorecord player" is a machine or device
      that - 
          (A) is employed solely for the performance of nondramatic
        musical works by means of phonorecords upon being activated by
        the insertion of coins, currency, tokens, or other monetary
        units or their equivalent;
          (B) is located in an establishment making no direct or
        indirect charge for admission;
          (C) is accompanied by a list which is comprised of the titles
        of all the musical works available for performance on it, and
        is affixed to the phonorecord player or posted in the
        establishment in a prominent position where it can be readily
        examined by the public; and
          (D) affords a choice of works available for performance and
        permits the choice to be made by the patrons of the
        establishment in which it is located.

        (2) An "operator" is any person who, alone or jointly with
      others - 
          (A) owns a coin-operated phonorecord player;
          (B) has the power to make a coin-operated phonorecord player
        available for placement in an establishment for purposes of

-STATUTE-
      (a) Making of Additional Copy or Adaptation by Owner of Copy. -
    Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is not an
    infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer program to make
    or authorize the making of another copy or adaptation of that
    computer program provided:
        (1) that such a new copy or adaptation is created as an
      essential step in the utilization of the computer program in
      conjunction with a machine and that it is used in no other
      manner, or
        (2) that such new copy or adaptation is for archival purposes
      only and that all archival copies are destroyed in the event that
      continued possession of the computer program should cease to be
      rightful.

      (b) Lease, Sale, or Other Transfer of Additional Copy or
    Adaptation. - Any exact copies prepared in accordance with the
    provisions of this section may be leased, sold, or otherwise
    transferred, along with the copy from which such copies were
    prepared, only as part of the lease, sale, or other transfer of all
    rights in the program. Adaptations so prepared may be transferred
    only with the authorization of the copyright owner.
      (c) Machine Maintenance or Repair. - Notwithstanding the
    provisions of section 106, it is not an infringement for the owner
    or lessee of a machine to make or authorize the making of a copy of
    a computer program if such copy is made solely by virtue of the
    activation of a machine that lawfully contains an authorized copy
    of the computer program, for purposes only of maintenance or repair
    of that machine, if - 
        (1) such new copy is used in no other manner and is destroyed
      immediately after the maintenance or repair is completed; and
        (2) with respect to any computer program or part thereof that
      is not necessary for that machine to be activated, such program
      or part thereof is not accessed or used other than to make such
      new copy by virtue of the activation of the machine.

      (d) Definitions. - For purposes of this section - 
        (1) the "maintenance" of a machine is the servicing of the
      machine in order to make it work in accordance with its original
      specifications and any changes to those specifications authorized
      for that machine; and
        (2) the "repair" of a machine is the restoring of the machine
      to the state of working in accordance with its original
      specifications and any changes to those specifications authorized
      for that machine.

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      As the program for general revision of the copyright law has
    evolved, it has become increasingly apparent that in one major area
    the problems are not sufficiently developed for a definitive
    legislative solution. This is the area of computer uses of
    copyrighted works: the use of a work "in conjunction with automatic
    systems capable of storing, processing, retrieving, or transferring
    information." The Commission on New Technological Uses is, among
    other things, now engaged in making a thorough study of the
    emerging patterns in this field and it will, on the basis of its
    findings, recommend definitive copyright provisions to deal with
    the situation.
      Since it would be premature to change existing law on computer
    uses at present, the purpose of section 117 is to preserve the
    status quo. It is intended neither to cut off any rights that may
    now exist, nor to create new rights that might be denied under the
    Act of 1909 or under common law principles currently applicable.
      The provision deals only with the exclusive rights of a copyright
    owner with respect to computer uses, that is, the bundle of rights
    specified for other types of uses in section 106 and qualified in
    sections 107 through 116 and 118. With respect to the copyright-
    ability of computer programs, the ownership of copyrights in them,
    the term of protection, and the formal requirements of the
    remainder of the bill, the new statute would apply.
      Under section 117, an action for infringement of a copyrighted
    work by means of a computer would necessarily be a federal action
    brought under the new title 17. The court, in deciding the scope of
    exclusive rights in the computer area, would first need to
    determine the applicable law, whether State statutory or common law
    or the Act of 1909. Having determined what law was applicable, its
    decision would depend upon its interpretation of what that law was
    on the point on the day before the effective date of the new
    statute.

                                AMENDMENTS                            
      1998 - Pub. L. 105-304 designated existing provisions as subsecs.
    (a) and (b), inserted headings, and added subsecs. (c) and (d).
      1980 - Pub. L. 96-517 substituted provision respecting
    limitations on exclusive rights in connection with computer
    programs for prior provision enunciating scope of exclusive rights
    and use of the work in conjunction with computers and similar
    information systems and declaring owner of copyright in a work
    without any greater or lesser rights with respect to the use of the
    work in conjunction with automatic systems capable of storing,
    processing, retrieving, or transferring information, or in
    conjunction with any similar device, machine, or process, than
    those afforded to works under the law, whether this title or the
    common law or statutes of a State, in effect on Dec. 31, 1977, as
    held applicable and construed by the court in an action brought
    under this title.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 118. Scope of exclusive rights: Use of certain works in
      connection with noncommercial broadcasting

-STATUTE-
      (a) The exclusive rights provided by section 106 shall, with
    respect to the works specified by subsection (b) and the activities
    specified by subsection (d),(!1) be subject to the conditions and
    limitations prescribed by this section.

      (b) Notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws, any
    owners of copyright in published nondramatic musical works and
    published pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works and any public
    broadcasting entities, respectively, may negotiate and agree upon
    the terms and rates of royalty payments and the proportionate
    division of fees paid among various copyright owners, and may
    designate common agents to negotiate, agree to, pay, or receive
    payments.
        (1) Any owner of copyright in a work specified in this
      subsection or any public broadcasting entity may submit to the
      Copyright Royalty Judges proposed licenses covering such
      activities with respect to such works.
        (2) License agreements voluntarily negotiated at any time
      between one or more copyright owners and one or more public
      broadcasting entities shall be given effect in lieu of any
      determination by the Librarian of Congress or the Copyright
      Royalty Judges, if copies of such agreements are filed with the
      Copyright Royalty Judges within 30 days of execution in
      accordance with regulations that the Copyright Royalty Judges
      shall issue.
        (3) Voluntary negotiation proceedings initiated pursuant to a
      petition filed under section 804(a) for the purpose of
      determining a schedule of terms and rates of royalty payments by
      public broadcasting entities to owners of copyright in works
      specified by this subsection and the proportionate division of
      fees paid among various copyright owners shall cover the 5-year
      period beginning on January 1 of the second year following the
      year in which the petition is filed. The parties to each
      negotiation proceeding shall bear their own costs.
        (4) In the absence of license agreements negotiated under
      paragraph (2) or (3), the Copyright Royalty Judges shall,
      pursuant to chapter 8, conduct a proceeding to determine and
      publish in the Federal Register a schedule of rates and terms
      which, subject to paragraph (2), shall be binding on all owners
      of copyright in works specified by this subsection and public
      broadcasting entities, regardless of whether such copyright
      owners have submitted proposals to the Copyright Royalty Judges.
      In establishing such rates and terms the Copyright Royalty Judges
      may consider the rates for comparable circumstances under
      voluntary license agreements negotiated as provided in paragraph
      (2) or (3). The Copyright Royalty Judges shall also establish
      requirements by which copyright owners may receive reasonable
      notice of the use of their works under this section, and under
      which records of such use shall be kept by public broadcasting
      entities.

      (c) Subject to the terms of any voluntary license agreements that
    have been negotiated as provided by subsection (b)(2) or (3), a
    public broadcasting entity may, upon compliance with the provisions
    of this section, including the rates and terms established by the
    Copyright Royalty Judges under subsection (b)(4), engage in the
    following activities with respect to published nondramatic musical
    works and published pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works:
        (1) performance or display of a work by or in the course of a
      transmission made by a noncommercial educational broadcast
      station referred to in subsection (f); and
        (2) production of a transmission program, reproduction of
      copies or phonorecords of such a transmission program, and
      distribution of such copies or phonorecords, where such
      production, reproduction, or distribution is made by a nonprofit
      institution or organization solely for the purpose of
      transmissions specified in paragraph (1); and
        (3) the making of reproductions by a governmental body or a
      nonprofit institution of a transmission program simultaneously
      with its transmission as specified in paragraph (1), and the
      performance or display of the contents of such program under the
      conditions specified by paragraph (1) of section 110, but only if
      the reproductions are used for performances or displays for a
      period of no more than seven days from the date of the
      transmission specified in paragraph (1), and are destroyed before
      or at the end of such period. No person supplying, in accordance
      with paragraph (2), a reproduction of a transmission program to
      governmental bodies or nonprofit institutions under this
      paragraph shall have any liability as a result of failure of such
      body or institution to destroy such reproduction: Provided, That
      it shall have notified such body or institution of the
      requirement for such destruction pursuant to this paragraph: And
      provided further, That if such body or institution itself fails
      to destroy such reproduction it shall be deemed to have
      infringed.

      (d) Except as expressly provided in this subsection, this section
    shall have no applicability to works other than those specified in
    subsection (b). Owners of copyright in nondramatic literary works
    and public broadcasting entities may, during the course of
    voluntary negotiations, agree among themselves, respectively, as to
    the terms and rates of royalty payments without liability under the
    antitrust laws. Any such terms and rates of royalty payments shall
    be effective upon filing with the Copyright Royalty Judges, in
    accordance with regulations that the Copyright Royalty Judges shall
    prescribe as provided in section 803(b)(6).
      (e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit, beyond
    the limits of fair use as provided by section 107, the unauthorized
    dramatization of a nondramatic musical work, the production of a
    transmission program drawn to any substantial extent from a
    published compilation of pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works,
    or the unauthorized use of any portion of an audiovisual work.
      (f) As used in this section, the term "public broadcasting
    entity" means a noncommercial educational broadcast station as
    defined in section 397 of title 47 and any nonprofit institution or
    organization engaged in the activities described in paragraph (2)
    of subsection (c).

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      General Background. During its consideration of revision
    legislation in 1975, the Senate Judiciary Committee adopted an
    amendment offered by Senator Charles McC. Mathias. The amendment,
    now section 118 of the Senate bill [this section], grants to public
    broadcasting a compulsory license for use of nondramatic literary
    and musical works, as well as pictorial, graphic, and sculptural
    works, subject to payment of reasonable royalty fees to be set by
    the Copyright Royalty Tribunal established by that bill. The
    Mathias amendment requires that public broadcasters, at periodic
    intervals, file a notice with the Copyright Office containing
    information required by the Register of Copyrights and deposit a
    statement of account and the total royalty fees for the period
    covered by the statement. In July of each year all persons having a
    claim to such fees are to file their claims with the Register of
    Copyrights. If no controversy exists, the Register would distribute
    the royalties to the various copyright owners and their agents
    after deducting reasonable administrative costs; controversies are
    to be settled by the Tribunal.
      On July 10, 1975, the House Subcommittee heard testimony on the
    Mathias amendment from representatives of public broadcasters,
    authors, publishers, and music performing rights societies. The
    public broadcasters pointed to Congressional concern for the
    development of their activities as evidenced by the Public
    Broadcasting Act [47 U.S.C. 390 et seq.]. They urged that a
    compulsory license was essential to assure public broadcasting
    broad access to copyrighted materials at reasonable royalties and
    without administratively cumbersome and costly "clearance" problems
    that would impair the vitality of their operations. The opponents
    of the amendment argued that the nature of public broadcasting has
    changed significantly in the past decade, to the extent that it now
    competes with commercial broadcasting as a national entertainment
    and cultural medium. They asserted that the performing rights
    society arrangements under which copyrighted music is licensed for
    performance removed any problem in clearing music for broadcasting,
    and that voluntary agreements could adequately resolve the
    copyright problems feared by public broadcasters, at less expense
    and burden than the compulsory license, for synchronization and
    literary rights. The authors of literary works stressed that a
    compulsory licensing system would deny them the fundamental right
    to control the use of their works and protect their reputation in a
    major communications medium.
      General Policy Considerations. The Committee is cognizant of the
    intent of Congress, in enacting the Public Broadcasting Act on
    November 7, 1967 [47 U.S.C. 390 et seq.], that encouragement and
    support of noncommercial broadcasting is in the public interest. It
    is also aware that public broadcasting may encounter problems not
    confronted by commercial broadcasting enterprises, due to such
    factors as the special nature of programming, repeated use of
    programs, and, of course, limited financial resources. Thus, the
    Committee determined that the nature of public broadcasting does
    warrant special treatment in certain areas. However, the Committee
    did not feel that the broad compulsory license provided in the
    Senate bill is necessary to the continued successful operation of
    public broadcasting. In addition, the Committee believes that the
    system provided in the Senate bill for the deposit of royalty fees
    with the Copyright Office for distribution to claimants, and the
    resolution of disputes over such distribution by a statutory
    tribunal, can be replaced by payments directly between the parties,
    without the intervention of government machinery and its attendant
    administrative costs.
      In general, the Committee amended the public broadcasting
    provisions of the Senate bill toward attainment of the objective
    clearly stated in the Report of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
    namely, that copyright owners and public broadcasters be encouraged
    to reach voluntary private agreements.
      Procedures. Not later than thirty days following the publication
    by the President of the notice announcing the initial appointments
    to the Copyright Royalty Commission (specified in Chapter 8 [Sec.
    801 et seq. of this title]), the Chairman of the Commission is to
    publish notice in the Federal Register of the initiation of
    proceedings to determine "reasonable terms and rates" for certain
    uses of published nondramatic musical works and published
    pictorial, graphic and sculptural works, during a period ending on
    December 31, 1982.
      Copyright owners and public broadcasting entities that do not
    reach voluntary agreement are bound by the terms and rates
    established by the Commission, which are to be published in the
    Federal Register within six months of the notice of initiation of
    proceedings. During the period between the effective date of the
    Act [Jan. 1, 1978] and the publication of the rates and terms, the
    Committee has preserved the status quo by providing, in section
    118(b)(4), that the Act does not afford to copyright owners or
    public broadcasting entities any greater or lesser rights with
    respect to the relevant uses of nondramatic musical works and
    pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works than those afforded under
    the law in effect on December 31, 1977.
      License agreements that have been voluntarily negotiated
    supersede, as between the parties to the agreement, the terms and
    rates established by the Commission, provided that copies of the
    agreements are properly filed with the Copyright Office within 30
    days of execution. Under clause (2) of section 118(b), the
    agreements may be negotiated "at any time" - whether before,
    during, or after determinations by the Commission.
      Under section 118(c), the procedures for the Commission's
    establishing such rates and terms are to be repeated in the last
    half of 1982 and every five years thereafter.
      Establishment of Reasonable Terms and Rates. In establishing
    reasonable terms and rates for public broadcasting use of the
    specified works, the Commission, under clause (b)(1) of section 118
    is to consider proposals timely submitted to it, as well as "any
    other relevant information", including that put forward for its
    consideration "by any interested party."
      The Committee does not intend that owners of copyrighted material
    be required to subsidize public broadcasting. It is intended that
    the Commission assure a fair return to copyright owners without
    unfairly burdening public broadcasters. Section 118(b)(3) provides
    that "the Commission may consider the rates for comparable
    circumstances under voluntary license agreements." The Commission
    is also expected to consider both the general public interest in
    encouraging the growth and development of public broadcasting, and
    the "promotion of science and the useful arts" through the
    encouragement of musical and artistic creation.
      The Committee anticipates that the "terms" established by the
    Commission shall include provisions as to acceptable methods of
    payment of royalties by public broadcasting entities to copyright
    owners. For example, where the whereabouts of the copyright owner
    may not be readily known, the terms should specify the nature of
    the obligation of the public broadcasting entity to locate the
    owner, or to set aside or otherwise assure payment of appropriate
    royalties, should he or she appear and make a claim. Section
    118(b)(3) requires the Commission "to establish requirements by
    which copyright owners may receive reasonable notice of the use of
    their works." The Committee intends that these requirements shall
    not impose undue hardships on public broadcasting entities and, in
    the above illustration, shall provide for the specific termination
    of any period during which the public broadcasting entity is
    required to set aside payments. It is expected that, in some cases,
    especially in the area of pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works,
    the whereabouts of the owners of copyright may not be known and
    they may never appear to claim payment of royalties.
      The Commission is also to establish record keeping requirements
    for public broadcasting entities in order to facilitate the
    identification, calculation, allocation and payment of claims and
    royalties.
      Works Affected. Under sections 118(b) and (e) of the Committee's
    amendment, the establishment of rates and terms by the Copyright
    Royalty Commission pertains only to the use of published
    nondramatic musical works, and published pictorial, graphic, and
    sculptural works. As under the Senate bill; rights in plays,
    operas, ballet and other stage presentations, motion pictures, and
    other audiovisual works are not affected.
      Section 118(f) is intended to make clear that this section does
    not permit unauthorized use, beyond the limits of section 107, of
    individual frames from a filmstrip or any other portion of any
    audiovisual work. Additionally, the application of this section to
    pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works does not extend to the
    production of transmission programs drawn to any substantial extent
    from a compilation of such works.
      The Committee also concluded that the performance of nondramatic
    literary works should not be subject to Commission determination.
    It was particularly concerned that a compulsory license for
    literary works would result in loss of control by authors over the
    use of their work in violation of basic principles of artistic and
    creative freedom. It is recognized that copyright not only provides
    compensation to authors, but also protection as to how and where
    their works are used. The Committee was assured by representatives
    of authors and publishers that licensing arrangements for readings
    from their books, poems, and other works on public broadcasting
    programs for reasonable compensation and under reasonable
    safeguards for authors' rights could be worked out in private
    negotiation. The Committee strongly urges the parties to work
    toward mutually acceptable licenses; to facilitate their
    negotiations and aid in the possible establishment of clearance
    mechanisms and rates, the Committee's amendment provides the
    parties, in section 118(e)(1), with an appropriately limited
    exemption from the antitrust laws [15 U.S.C. 1 et seq.].
      The Committee has also provided, in paragraph (2) of clause (e),
    that on January 3, 1980, the Register of Copyrights, after
    consultation with the interested parties, shall submit a report to
    Congress on the extent to which voluntary licensing arrangements
    have been reached with respect to public broadcast use of
    nondramatic literary works, and present legislative or other
    recommendations, if warranted.
      The use of copyrighted sound recordings in educational television
    and radio programs distributed by or through public broadcasting
    entities is governed by section 114 and is discussed in connection
    with that section.
      Activities Affected. Section 118(d) specifies the activities
    which may be engaged in by public broadcasting entities under terms
    and rates established by the Commission. These include the
    performance or display of published nondramatic musical works, and
    of published pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works, in the
    course of transmissions by noncommercial educational broadcast
    stations; and the production, reproduction, and distribution of
    transmission programs including such works by nonprofit
    organizations for the purpose of such transmissions. It is the
    intent of the Committee that "interconnection" activities serving
    as a technical adjunct to such transmissions, such as the use of
    satellites or microwave equipment, be included within the specified
    activities.
      Paragraph (3) of clause (d) also includes the reproduction,
    simultaneously with transmission, of public broadcasting programs
    by governmental bodies or nonprofit institutions, and the
    performance or display of the contents of the reproduction under
    the conditions of section 110(1). However, the reproduction so made
    must be destroyed at the end of seven days from the transmission.
      This limited provision for unauthorized simultaneous or off-the-
    air reproduction is limited to nondramatic musical works and
    pictorial, graphic and sculptural works included in public
    broadcasting transmissions. It does not extend to other works
    included in the transmissions, or to the entire transmission
    program.
      It is the intent of the Committee that schools be permitted to
    engage in off-the-air reproduction to the extent and under the
    conditions provided in [section] 118(d)(3); however, in the event a
    public broadcasting station or producer makes the reproduction and
    distributes a copy to the school, the station or producer will not
    be held liable for the school's failure to destroy the
    reproduction, provided it has given notice of the requirement of
    destruction. In such a case the school itself, although it did not
    engage in the act of reproduction, is deemed an infringer fully
    subject to the remedies provided in Chapter 5 of the Act [Sec. 501
    et seq. of this title]. The establishment of standards for adequate
    notice under this provision should be considered by the Commission.
      Section 118(f) makes it clear that the rights of performance and
    other activities specified in subsection (d) do not extend to the
    unauthorized dramatization of a nondramatic musical work.

      (a) Secondary Transmissions by Satellite Carriers. - 
        (1) Non-network stations. - Subject to the provisions of
      paragraphs (4), (5), and (7) of this subsection and section
      114(d), secondary transmissions of a performance or display of a
      work embodied in a primary transmission made by a non-network
      station shall be subject to statutory licensing under this
      section if the secondary transmission is made by a satellite
      carrier to the public for private home viewing or for viewing in
      a commercial establishment, with regard to secondary
      transmissions the satellite carrier is in compliance with the
      rules, regulations, or authorizations of the Federal
      Communications Commission governing the carriage of television
      broadcast station signals, and the carrier makes a direct or
      indirect charge for each retransmission service to each
      subscriber receiving the secondary transmission or to a
      distributor that has contracted with the carrier for direct or
      indirect delivery of the secondary transmission to the public for
      private home viewing or for viewing in a commercial
      establishment.

        this subsection and section 114(d), secondary transmissions of
        a performance or display of a work embodied in a primary
        transmission made by a network station shall be subject to
        statutory licensing under this section if the secondary
        transmission is made by a satellite carrier to the public for
        private home viewing, with regard to secondary transmissions
        the satellite carrier is in compliance with the rules,
        regulations, or authorizations of the Federal Communications
        Commission governing the carriage of television broadcast
        station signals, and the carrier makes a direct or indirect
        charge for such retransmission service to each subscriber
        receiving the secondary transmission.
          (B) Secondary transmissions to unserved households. - 
            (i) In general. - The statutory license provided for in
          subparagraph (A) shall be limited to secondary transmissions

          single day for each television network to persons who reside
          in unserved households.
            (ii) Accurate determinations of eligibility. - 
              (I) Accurate predictive model. - In determining
            presumptively whether a person resides in an unserved
            household under subsection (d)(10)(A), a court shall rely
            on the Individual Location Longley-Rice model set forth by
            the Federal Communications Commission in Docket No. 98-201,
            as that model may be amended by the Commission over time
            under section 339(c)(3) of the Communications Act of 1934
            to increase the accuracy of that model.
              (II) Accurate measurements. - For purposes of site
            measurements to determine whether a person resides in an
            unserved household under subsection (d)(10)(A), a court
            shall rely on section 339(c)(4) of the Communications Act

              (III) Accurate predictive model with respect to digital
            signals. - Notwithstanding subclause (I), in determining
            presumptively whether a person resides in an unserved
            household under subsection (d)(10)(A) with respect to
            digital signals, a court shall rely on a predictive model
            set forth by the Federal Communications Commission pursuant
            to a rulemaking as provided in section 339(c)(3) of the
            Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 339(c)(3)), as that
            model may be amended by the Commission over time under such
            section to increase the accuracy of that model. Until such
            time as the Commission sets forth such model, a court shall
            rely on the predictive model as recommended by the
            Commission with respect to digital signals in its Report to
            Congress in ET Docket No. 05-182, FCC 05-199 (released

            received before any termination of such secondary
            transmissions before October 31, 1999.
              (II) Definition. - In this clause, the term "C-band
            service" means a service that is licensed by the Federal
            Communications Commission and operates in the Fixed
            Satellite Service under part 25 of title 47, Code of
            Federal Regulations.

          (C) Submission of subscriber lists to networks. - 
            (i) Initial lists. - A satellite carrier that makes
          secondary transmissions of a primary transmission made by a
          network station pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall, not later
          than 90 days after commencing such secondary transmissions,
          submit to the network that owns or is affiliated with the
          network station a list identifying (by name and address,
          including street or rural route number, city, State, and 9-
          digit zip code) all subscribers to which the satellite
          carrier makes secondary transmissions of that primary
          transmission to subscribers in unserved households.
            (ii) Monthly lists. - After the submission of the initial
          lists under clause (i), the satellite carrier shall, not
          later than the 15th of each month, submit to the network a
          list, aggregated by designated market area, identifying (by
          name and address, including street or rural route number,
          city, State, and 9-digit zip code) any persons who have been
          added or dropped as subscribers under clause (i) since the
          last submission under this subparagraph.
            (iii) Use of subscriber information. - Subscriber
          information submitted by a satellite carrier under this
          subparagraph may be used only for purposes of monitoring
          compliance by the satellite carrier with this subsection.
            (iv) Applicability. - The submission requirements of this
          subparagraph shall apply to a satellite carrier only if the
          network to which the submissions are to be made places on
          file with the Register of Copyrights a document identifying
          the name and address of the person to whom such submissions
          are to be made. The Register shall maintain for public
          inspection a file of all such documents.

      available. - 
          (A) Rules for subscribers to signals under subsection (e). - 
            (i) For those receiving distant signals. - In the case of a
          subscriber of a satellite carrier who is eligible to receive
          the secondary transmission of the primary transmission of a
          network station solely by reason of subsection (e) (in this
          subparagraph referred to as a "distant signal"), and who, as
          of October 1, 2004, is receiving the distant signal of that
          network station, the following shall apply:
              (I) In a case in which the satellite carrier makes
            available to the subscriber the secondary transmission of
            the primary transmission of a local network station
            affiliated with the same television network pursuant to the
            statutory license under section 122, the statutory license
            under paragraph (2) shall apply only to secondary
            transmissions by that satellite carrier to that subscriber
            of the distant signal of a station affiliated with the same
            television network - 
                (aa) if, within 60 days after receiving the notice of
              the satellite carrier under section 338(h)(1) of the
              Communications Act of 1934, the subscriber elects to
              retain the distant signal; but
                (bb) only until such time as the subscriber elects to
              receive such local signal.

              (II) Notwithstanding subclause (I), the statutory license
            under paragraph (2) shall not apply with respect to any
            subscriber who is eligible to receive the distant signal of
            a television network station solely by reason of subsection
            (e), unless the satellite carrier, within 60 days after the
            date of the enactment of the Satellite Home Viewer
            Extension and Reauthorization Act of 2004, submits to that
            television network a list, aggregated by designated market
            area (as defined in section 122(j)(2)(C)), that - 
                (aa) identifies that subscriber by name and address
              (street or rural route number, city, State, and zip code)
              and specifies the distant signals received by the
              subscriber; and
                (bb) states, to the best of the satellite carrier's
              knowledge and belief, after having made diligent and good
              faith inquiries, that the subscriber is eligible under
              subsection (e) to receive the distant signals.

            (ii) For those not receiving distant signals. - In the case
          of any subscriber of a satellite carrier who is eligible to
          receive the distant signal of a network station solely by
          reason of subsection (e) and who did not receive a distant
          signal of a station affiliated with the same network on
          October 1, 2004, the statutory license under paragraph (2)
          shall not apply to secondary transmissions by that satellite
          carrier to that subscriber of the distant signal of a station
          affiliated with the same network.

          (B) Rules for lawful subscribers as of date of enactment of
        2010 act. - In the case of a subscriber of a satellite carrier
        who, on the day before the date of the enactment of the
        Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010, was
        lawfully receiving the secondary transmission of the primary
        transmission of a network station under the statutory license
        under paragraph (2) (in this subparagraph referred to as the
        "distant signal"), other than subscribers to whom subparagraph
        (A) applies, the statutory license under paragraph (2) shall
        apply to secondary transmissions by that satellite carrier to
        that subscriber of the distant signal of a station affiliated
        with the same television network, and the subscriber's
        household shall continue to be considered to be an unserved
        household with respect to such network, until such time as the
        subscriber elects to terminate such secondary transmissions,
        whether or not the subscriber elects to subscribe to receive
        the secondary transmission of the primary transmission of a
        local network station affiliated with the same network pursuant
        to the statutory license under section 122.
          (C) Future applicability. - 
            (i) When local signal available at time of subscription. -
          The statutory license under paragraph (2) shall not apply to
          the secondary transmission by a satellite carrier of the
          primary transmission of a network station to a person who is
          not a subscriber lawfully receiving such secondary
          transmission as of the date of the enactment of the Satellite
          Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 and, at the
          time such person seeks to subscribe to receive such secondary
          transmission, resides in a local market where the satellite
          carrier makes available to that person the secondary
          transmission of the primary transmission of a local network
          station affiliated with the same network pursuant to the
          statutory license under section 122.
            (ii) When local signal available after subscription. - In
          the case of a subscriber who lawfully subscribes to and
          receives the secondary transmission by a satellite carrier of
          the primary transmission of a network station under the
          statutory license under paragraph (2) (in this clause
          referred to as the "distant signal") on or after the date of
          the enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and
          Localism Act of 2010, the statutory license under paragraph
          (2) shall apply to secondary transmissions by that satellite
          carrier to that subscriber of the distant signal of a station
          affiliated with the same television network, and the
          subscriber's household shall continue to be considered to be
          an unserved household with respect to such network, until
          such time as the subscriber elects to terminate such
          secondary transmissions, but only if such subscriber
          subscribes to the secondary transmission of the primary
          transmission of a local network station affiliated with the
          same network within 60 days after the satellite carrier makes
          available to the subscriber such secondary transmission of
          the primary transmission of such local network station.

          (D) Other provisions not affected. - This paragraph shall not
        affect the applicability of the statutory license to secondary
        transmissions to unserved households included under paragraph
        (11).
          (E) Waiver. - A subscriber who is denied the secondary
        transmission of a network station under subparagraph (B) or (C)
        may request a waiver from such denial by submitting a request,
        through the subscriber's satellite carrier, to the network
        station in the local market affiliated with the same network
        where the subscriber is located. The network station shall
        accept or reject the subscriber's request for a waiver within
        30 days after receipt of the request. If the network station
        fails to accept or reject the subscriber's request for a waiver
        within that 30-day period, that network station shall be deemed
        to agree to the waiver request. Unless specifically stated by
        the network station, a waiver that was granted before the date
        of the enactment of the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and
        Reauthorization Act of 2004 under section 339(c)(2) of the
        Communications Act of 1934 shall not constitute a waiver for

        satellite carrier makes available a secondary transmission of
        the primary transmission of a local station to a subscriber or
        person if the satellite carrier offers that secondary
        transmission to other subscribers who reside in the same 9-
        digit zip code as that subscriber or person.

        (4) Noncompliance with reporting and payment requirements. -
      Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2), the
      willful or repeated secondary transmission to the public by a
      satellite carrier of a primary transmission made by a non-network
      station or a network station and embodying a performance or
      display of a work is actionable as an act of infringement under
      section 501, and is fully subject to the remedies provided by
      sections 502 through 506, where the satellite carrier has not
      deposited the statement of account and royalty fee required by
      subsection (b), or has failed to make the submissions to networks
      required by paragraph (2)(C).
        (5) Willful alterations. - Notwithstanding the provisions of
      paragraphs (1) and (2), the secondary transmission to the public
      by a satellite carrier of a performance or display of a work
      embodied in a primary transmission made by a non-network station
      or a network station is actionable as an act of infringement
      under section 501, and is fully subject to the remedies provided
      by sections 502 through 506 and section 510, if the content of
      the particular program in which the performance or display is
      embodied, or any commercial advertising or station announcement
      transmitted by the primary transmitter during, or immediately
      before or after, the transmission of such program, is in any way
      willfully altered by the satellite carrier through changes,
      deletions, or additions, or is combined with programming from any
      other broadcast signal.

      for network stations. - 
          (A) Individual violations. - The willful or repeated
        secondary transmission by a satellite carrier of a primary
        transmission made by a network station and embodying a
        performance or display of a work to a subscriber who is not
        eligible to receive the transmission under this section is
        actionable as an act of infringement under section 501 and is
        fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through
        506, except that - 
            (i) no damages shall be awarded for such act of
          infringement if the satellite carrier took corrective action
          by promptly withdrawing service from the ineligible
          subscriber, and
            (ii) any statutory damages shall not exceed $250 for such
          subscriber for each month during which the violation
          occurred.

        in a willful or repeated pattern or practice of delivering a
        primary transmission made by a network station and embodying a
        performance or display of a work to subscribers who are not
        eligible to receive the transmission under this section, then
        in addition to the remedies set forth in subparagraph (A) - 
            (i) if the pattern or practice has been carried out on a
          substantially nationwide basis, the court shall order a
          permanent injunction barring the secondary transmission by
          the satellite carrier, for private home viewing, of the
          primary transmissions of any primary network station
          affiliated with the same network, and the court may order
          statutory damages of not to exceed $2,500,000 for each 3-
          month period during which the pattern or practice was
          carried out; and
            (ii) if the pattern or practice has been carried out on a
          local or regional basis, the court shall order a permanent
          injunction barring the secondary transmission, for private
          home viewing in that locality or region, by the satellite
          carrier of the primary transmissions of any primary network
          station affiliated with the same network, and the court may
          order statutory damages of not to exceed $2,500,000 for each
          6-month period during which the pattern or practice was
          carried out.

          (C) Previous subscribers excluded. - Subparagraphs (A) and
        (B) do not apply to secondary transmissions by a satellite
        carrier to persons who subscribed to receive such secondary
        transmissions from the satellite carrier or a distributor
        before November 16, 1988.
          (D) Burden of proof. - In any action brought under this
        paragraph, the satellite carrier shall have the burden of
        proving that its secondary transmission of a primary
        transmission by a network station is to a subscriber who is
        eligible to receive the secondary transmission under this
        section.
          (E) Exception. - The secondary transmission by a satellite
        carrier of a performance or display of a work embodied in a
        primary transmission made by a network station to subscribers
        who do not reside in unserved households shall not be an act of
        infringement if - 
            (i) the station on May 1, 1991, was retransmitted by a
          satellite carrier and was not on that date owned or operated
          by or affiliated with a television network that offered
          interconnected program service on a regular basis for 15 or
          more hours per week to at least 25 affiliated television
          licensees in 10 or more States;
            (ii) as of July 1, 1998, such station was retransmitted by
          a satellite carrier under the statutory license of this
          section; and
            (iii) the station is not owned or operated by or affiliated
          with a television network that, as of January 1, 1995,
          offered interconnected program service on a regular basis for
          15 or more hours per week to at least 25 affiliated
          television licensees in 10 or more States.

      The court shall direct one half of any statutory damages ordered
      under clause (i) (!1) to be deposited with the Register of
      Copyrights for distribution to copyright owners pursuant to
      subsection (b). The Copyright Royalty Judges shall issue
      regulations establishing procedures for distributing such funds,
      on a proportional basis, to copyright owners whose works were
      included in the secondary transmissions that were the subject of
      the statutory damages.

        (7) Discrimination by a satellite carrier. - Notwithstanding
      the provisions of paragraph (1), the willful or repeated
      secondary transmission to the public by a satellite carrier of a
      performance or display of a work embodied in a primary
      transmission made by a non-network station or a network station
      is actionable as an act of infringement under section 501, and is
      fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through
      506, if the satellite carrier unlawfully discriminates against a
      distributor.

        within 60 days after receipt of the measurement results and a
        statement of such costs, reimburse the satellite carrier for
        any signal intensity measurement that is conducted by that
        carrier in response to a challenge by the network station and
        that establishes the household is an unserved household; and
          (B) a satellite carrier shall, within 60 days after receipt
        of the measurement results and a statement of such costs,
        reimburse the network station challenging such eligibility for
        any signal intensity measurement that is conducted by that
        station and that establishes the household is not an unserved

        with the Copyright Royalty Judges, in accordance with
        requirements that the Copyright Royalty Judges shall prescribe

        pursuant to chapter 8 of this title, conduct a proceeding to
        determine the distribution of royalty fees.

        such satellite carriers, distributors and copyright owners may
        at any time negotiate and agree to the royalty fee, and may
        designate common agents to negotiate, agree to, or pay such
        fees. If the parties fail to identify common agents, the

          Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate.
            (iv) Evidence of infringement. - The special master shall
          include in the report a statement of whether the examination

        compliance with the requirements for a qualified carrier. The
        qualified carrier shall attach to its affidavit copies of all

          (E) Pleading requirement. - In any motion brought under
        subparagraph (D), the party making such motion shall specify
        one or more designated market areas (as such term is defined in

        is being alleged, and, for each such designated market area,
        shall plead with particularity the circumstances of the alleged
        failure.
          (F) Burden of proof. - In any proceeding to make a
        determination under subparagraph (D), and with respect to a
        designated market area for which failure to provide service is
        alleged, the entity recognized as a qualified carrier shall
        have the burden of proving that the entity provided local-into-
        local service with a good quality satellite signal to at least

        States Census Bureau) at the time and place alleged.

        (5) Failure to provide service. - 
          (A) Penalties. - If the court recognizing an entity as a
        qualified carrier finds that such entity has willfully failed
        to provide local-into-local service to all DMAs, such finding
        shall result in the loss of recognition of the entity as a
        qualified carrier and the termination of the waiver provided
        under paragraph (1), and the court may, in its discretion - 
            (i) treat such failure as an act of infringement under
          section 501, and subject such infringement to the remedies
          provided for in sections 502 through 506 and subsection
          (a)(6)(B) of this section; and
            (ii) impose a fine of not less than $250,000 and not more
          than $5,000,000.

          (B) Exception for nonwillful violation. - If the court
        determines that the failure to provide local-into-local service
        to all DMAs is nonwillful, the court may in its discretion
        impose financial penalties for noncompliance that reflect - 
            (i) the degree of control the entity had over the
          circumstances that resulted in the failure;
            (ii) the quality of the entity's efforts to remedy the
          failure and restore service; and
            (iii) the severity and duration of any service
          interruption.

        (6) Penalties for violations of license. - A court that finds,
      under subsection (a)(6)(A), that an entity recognized as a
      qualified carrier has willfully made a secondary transmission of
      a primary transmission made by a network station and embodying a
      performance or display of a work to a subscriber who is not
      eligible to receive the transmission under this section shall
      reinstate the injunction waived under paragraph (1), and the
      court may order statutory damages of not more than $2,500,000.

      purposes of this subsection:
          (A) In general. - An entity provides "local-into-local
        service to all DMAs" if the entity provides local service in
        all designated market areas (as such term is defined in section
        122(j)(2)(C)) pursuant to the license under section 122.
          (B) Household coverage. - For purposes of subparagraph (A),
        an entity that makes available local-into-local service with a
        good quality satellite signal to at least 90 percent of the
        households in a designated market area based on the most recent
        census data released by the United States Census Bureau shall
        be considered to be providing local service to such designated
        market area.
          (C) Good quality satellite signal defined. - The term "good
        quality satellite signal" has the meaning given such term under

        this paragraph shall apply to the secondary transmission of the
        primary transmission of such system to any subscriber in any
        county or county equivalent within such State, if such
        subscriber is located in a designated market area that is not
        otherwise eligible to receive the secondary transmission of the

    TITLE 17 - COPYRIGHTS
    CHAPTER 2 - COPYRIGHT OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER

-HEAD-
    Sec. 201. Ownership of copyright

-STATUTE-
      (a) Initial Ownership. - Copyright in a work protected under this
    title vests initially in the author or authors of the work. The
    authors of a joint work are coowners of copyright in the work.
      (b) Works Made for Hire. - In the case of a work made for hire,
    the employer or other person for whom the work was prepared is
    considered the author for purposes of this title, and, unless the
    parties have expressly agreed otherwise in a written instrument
    signed by them, owns all of the rights comprised in the copyright.
      (c) Contributions to Collective Works. - Copyright in each
    separate contribution to a collective work is distinct from
    copyright in the collective work as a whole, and vests initially in
    the author of the contribution. In the absence of an express
    transfer of the copyright or of any rights under it, the owner of
    copyright in the collective work is presumed to have acquired only
    the privilege of reproducing and distributing the contribution as
    part of that particular collective work, any revision of that
    collective work, and any later collective work in the same series.
      (d) Transfer of Ownership. - 
        (1) The ownership of a copyright may be transferred in whole or
      in part by any means of conveyance or by operation of law, and
      may be bequeathed by will or pass as personal property by the
      applicable laws of intestate succession.
        (2) Any of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright,
      including any subdivision of any of the rights specified by
      section 106, may be transferred as provided by clause (1) and
      owned separately. The owner of any particular exclusive right is
      entitled, to the extent of that right, to all of the protection
      and remedies accorded to the copyright owner by this title.

      (e) Involuntary Transfer. - When an individual author's ownership
    of a copyright, or of any of the exclusive rights under a
    copyright, has not previously been transferred voluntarily by that
    individual author, no action by any governmental body or other
    official or organization purporting to seize, expropriate,
    transfer, or exercise rights of ownership with respect to the
    copyright, or any of the exclusive rights under a copyright, shall
    be given effect under this title, except as provided under title
    11.

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      Initial Ownership. Two basic and well-established principles of
    copyright law are restated in section 201(a): that the source of
    copyright ownership is the author of the work, and that, in the
    case of a "joint work," the coauthors of the work are likewise
    coowners of the copyright. Under the definition of section 101, a
    work is "joint" if the authors collaborated with each other, or if
    each of the authors prepared his or her contribution with the
    knowledge and intention that it would be merged with the
    contributions of other authors as "inseparable or interdependent
    parts of a unitary whole." The touchstone here is the intention, at
    the time the writing is done, that the parts be absorbed or
    combined into an integrated unit, although the parts themselves may
    be either "inseparable" (as the case of a novel or painting) or
    "interdependent" (as in the case of a motion picture, opera, or the
    words and music of a song). The definition of "joint work" is to be
    contrasted with the definition of "collective work," also in
    section 101, in which the elements of merger and unity are lacking;
    there the key elements are assemblage or gathering of "separate and
    independent works * * * into a collective whole."
      The definition of "joint works" has prompted some concern lest it
    be construed as converting the authors of previously written works,
    such as plays, novels, and music, into coauthors of a motion
    picture in which their work is incorporated. It is true that a
    motion picture would normally be a joint rather than a collective
    work with respect to those authors who actually work on the film,
    although their usual status as employees for hire would keep the
    question of coownership from coming up. On the other hand, although
    a novelist, playwright, or songwriter may write a work with the
    hope or expectation that it will be used in a motion picture, this
    is clearly a case of separate or independent authorship rather than
    one where the basic intention behind the writing of the work was
    for motion picture use. In this case, the motion picture is a
    derivative work within the definition of that term, and section 103
    makes plain that copyright in a derivative work is independent of,
    and does not enlarge the scope of rights in, any preexisting
    material incorporated in it. There is thus no need to spell this
    conclusion out in the definition of "joint work."
      There is also no need for a specific statutory provision
    concerning the rights and duties of the coowners of a work; court-
    made law on this point is left undisturbed. Under the bill, as
    under the present law, coowners of a copyright would be treated
    generally as tenants in common, with each coowner having an
    independent right to use or license the use of a work, subject to a
    duty of accounting to the other coowners for any profits.
      Works Made for Hire. Section 201(b) of the bill adopts one of the
    basic principles of the present law: that in the case of works made
    for hire the employer is considered the author of the work, and is
    regarded as the initial owner of copyright unless there has been an
    agreement otherwise. The subsection also requires that any
    agreement under which the employee is to own rights be in writing
    and signed by the parties.
      The work-made-for-hire provisions of this bill represent a
    carefully balanced compromise, and as such they do not incorporate
    the amendments proposed by screenwriters and composers for motion
    pictures. Their proposal was for the recognition of something
    similar to the "shop right" doctrine of patent law: with some
    exceptions, the employer would acquire the right to use the
    employee's work to the extent needed for purposes of his regular
    business, but the employee would retain all other rights as long as
    he or she refrained from the authorizing of competing uses.
    However, while this change might theoretically improve the
    bargaining position of screenwriters and others as a group, the
    practical benefits that individual authors would receive are highly
    conjectural. The presumption that initial ownership rights vest in
    the employer for hire is well established in American copyright
    law, and to exchange that for the uncertainties of the shop right
    doctrine would not only be of dubious value to employers and
    employees alike, but might also reopen a number of other issues.
      The status of works prepared on special order or commission was a
    major issue in the development of the definition of "works made for
    hire" in section 101, which has undergone extensive revision during
    the legislative process. The basic problem is how to draw a
    statutory line between those works written on special order or
    commission that should be considered as "works made for hire," and
    those that should not. The definition now provided by the bill
    represents a compromise which, in effect, spells out those specific
    categories of commissioned works that can be considered "works made
    for hire" under certain circumstances.
      Of these, one of the most important categories is that of
    "instructional texts." This term is given its own definition in the
    bill: "a literary, pictorial, or graphic work prepared for
    publication with the purpose of use in systematic instructional
    activities." The concept is intended to include what might be
    loosely called "textbook material," whether or not in book form or
    prepared in the form of text matter. The basic characteristic of
    "instructional texts" is the purpose of their preparation for "use
    in systematic instructional activities," and they are to be
    distinguished from works prepared for use by a general readership.
      Contributions to Collective Works. Subsection (c) of section 201
    deals with the troublesome problem of ownership of copyright in
    contributions to collective works, and the relationship between
    copyright ownership in a contribution and in the collective work in
    which it appears. The first sentence establishes the basic
    principle that copyright in the individual contribution and
    copyright in the collective work as a whole are separate and
    distinct, and that the author of the contribution is, as in every
    other case, the first owner of copyright in it. Under the
    definitions in section 101, a "collective work" is a species of
    "compilation" and, by its nature, must involve the selection,
    assembly, and arrangement of "a number of contributions." Examples
    of "collective works" would ordinarily include periodical issues,
    anthologies, symposia, and collections of the discrete writings of
    the same authors, but not cases, such as a composition consisting
    of words and music, a work published with illustrations or front
    matter, or three one-act plays, where relatively few separate
    elements have been brought together. Unlike the contents of other
    types of "compilations," each of the contributions incorporated in
    a "collective work" must itself constitute a "separate and
    independent" work, therefore ruling out compilations of information
    or other uncopyrightable material and works published with
    editorial revisions or annotations. Moreover, as noted above, there
    is a basic distinction between a "joint work," where the separate
    elements merge into a unified whole, and a "collective work," where
    they remain unintegrated and disparate.
      The bill does nothing to change the rights of the owner of
    copyright in a collective work under the present law. These
    exclusive rights extend to the elements of compilation and editing
    that went into the collective work as a whole, as well as the
    contributions that were written for hire by employees of the owner
    of the collective work, and those copyrighted contributions that
    have been transferred in writing to the owner by their authors.
    However, one of the most significant aims of the bill is to clarify
    and improve the present confused and frequently unfair legal
    situation with respect to rights in contributions.
      The second sentence of section 201(c), in conjunction with the
    provisions of section 404 dealing with copyright notice, will
    preserve the author's copyright in a contribution even if the
    contribution does not bear a separate notice in the author's name,
    and without requiring any unqualified transfer of rights to the
    owner of the collective work. This is coupled with a presumption
    that, unless there has been an express transfer of more, the owner
    of the collective work acquires, "only the privilege of reproducing
    and distributing the contribution as part of that particular
    collective work, any revision of that collective work, and any
    later collective work in the same series."
      The basic presumption of section 201(c) is fully consistent with
    present law and practice, and represents a fair balancing of
    equities. At the same time, the last clause of the subsection,
    under which the privilege of republishing the contribution under
    certain limited circumstances would be presumed, is an essential
    counterpart of the basic presumption. Under the language of this
    clause a publishing company could reprint a contribution from one
    issue in a later issue of its magazine, and could reprint an
    article from a 1980 edition of an encyclopedia in a 1990 revision
    of it; the publisher could not revise the contribution itself or
    include it in a new anthology or an entirely different magazine or
    other collective work.
      Transfer of Ownership. The principle of unlimited alienability of
    copyright is stated in clause (1) of section 201(d). Under that
    provision the ownership of a copyright, or of any part of it, may
    be transferred by any means of conveyance or by operation of law,
    and is to be treated as personal property upon the death of the
    owner. The term "transfer of copyright ownership" is defined in
    section 101 to cover any "conveyance, alienation, or
    hypothecation," including assignments, mortgages, and exclusive
    licenses, but not including nonexclusive licenses. Representatives
    of motion picture producers have argued that foreclosures of
    copyright mortgages should not be left to varying State laws, and
    that the statute should establish a Federal foreclosure system.
    However, the benefits of such a system would be of very limited
    application, and would not justify the complicated statutory and
    procedural requirements that would have to be established.
      Clause (2) of subsection (d) contains the first explicit
    statutory recognition of the principle of divisibility of copyright
    in our law. This provision, which has long been sought by authors
    and their representatives, and which has attracted wide support
    from other groups, means that any of the exclusive rights that go
    to make up a copyright, including those enumerated in section 106
    and any subdivision of them, can be transferred and owned
    separately. The definition of "transfer of copyright ownership" in
    section 101 makes clear that the principle of divisibility applies
    whether or not the transfer is "limited in time or place of
    effect," and another definition in the same section provides that
    the term "copyright owner," with respect to any one exclusive
    right, refers to the owner of that particular right. The last
    sentence of section 201(d)(2) adds that the owner, with respect to
    the particular exclusive right he or she owns, is entitled "to all
    of the protection and remedies accorded to the copyright owner by
    this title." It is thus clear, for example, that a local
    broadcasting station holding an exclusive license to transmit a
    particular work within a particular geographic area and for a
    particular period of time, could sue, in its own name as copyright
    owner, someone who infringed that particular exclusive right.
      Subsection (e) provides that when an individual author's
    ownership of a copyright, or of any of the exclusive rights under a
    copyright, have not previously been voluntarily transferred, no
    action by any governmental body or other official or organization
    purporting to seize, expropriate, transfer, or exercise rights of
    ownership with respect to the copyright, or any of the exclusive
    rights under a copyright, shall be given effect under this title.
      The purpose of this subsection is to reaffirm the basic principle
    that the United States copyright of an individual author shall be
    secured to that author, and cannot be taken away by any involuntary
    transfer. It is the intent of the subsection that the author be
    entitled, despite any purported expropriation or involuntary
    transfer, to continue exercising all rights under the United States
    statute, and that the governmental body or organization may not
    enforce or exercise any rights under this title in that situation.
      It may sometimes be difficult to ascertain whether a transfer of
    copyright is voluntary or is coerced by covert pressure. But
    subsection (e) would protect foreign authors against laws and
    decrees purporting to divest them of their rights under the United
    States copyright statute, and would protect authors within the
    foreign country who choose to resist such covert pressures.
      Traditional legal actions that may involve transfer of ownership,
    such as bankruptcy proceedings and mortgage foreclosures, are not
    within the scope of this subsection; the authors in such cases have
    voluntarily consented to these legal processes by their overt
    actions - for example, by filing in bankruptcy or by hypothecating
    a copyright.

-STATUTE-
      Ownership of a copyright, or of any of the exclusive rights under
    a copyright, is distinct from ownership of any material object in
    which the work is embodied. Transfer of ownership of any material
    object, including the copy or phonorecord in which the work is
    first fixed, does not of itself convey any rights in the
    copyrighted work embodied in the object; nor, in the absence of an
    agreement, does transfer of ownership of a copyright or of any
    exclusive rights under a copyright convey property rights in any
    material object.

      The principle restated in section 202 is a fundamental and
    important one: that copyright ownership and ownership of a material
    object in which the copyrighted work is embodied are entirely
    separate things. Thus, transfer of a material object does not of
    itself carry any rights under the copyright, and this includes
    transfer of the copy or phonorecord - the original manuscript, the
    photographic negative, the unique painting or statue, the master
    tape recording, etc. - in which the work was first fixed.
    Conversely, transfer of a copyright does not necessarily require
    the conveyance of any material object.
      As a result of the interaction of this section and the provisions
    of section 204(a) and 301, the bill would change a common law
    doctrine exemplified by the decision in Pushman v. New York Graphic
    Society, Inc., 287 N.Y. 302, 39 N.E.2d 249 (1942). Under that
    doctrine, authors or artists are generally presumed to transfer
    common law literary property rights when they sell their manuscript
    or work of art, unless those rights are specifically reserved. This
    presumption would be reversed under the bill, since a specific
    written conveyance of rights would be required in order for a sale
    of any material object to carry with it a transfer of copyright.

    Sec. 203. Termination of transfers and licenses granted by the
      author

-STATUTE-
      (a) Conditions for Termination. - In the case of any work other
    than a work made for hire, the exclusive or nonexclusive grant of a
    transfer or license of copyright or of any right under a copyright,
    executed by the author on or after January 1, 1978, otherwise than
    by will, is subject to termination under the following conditions:
        (1) In the case of a grant executed by one author, termination
      of the grant may be effected by that author or, if the author is
      dead, by the person or persons who, under clause (2) of this
      subsection, own and are entitled to exercise a total of more than
      one-half of that author's termination interest. In the case of a
      grant executed by two or more authors of a joint work,
      termination of the grant may be effected by a majority of the
      authors who executed it; if any of such authors is dead, the
      termination interest of any such author may be exercised as a
      unit by the person or persons who, under clause (2) of this
      subsection, own and are entitled to exercise a total of more than
      one-half of that author's interest.
        (2) Where an author is dead, his or her termination interest is
      owned, and may be exercised, as follows:
          (A) The widow or widower owns the author's entire termination
        interest unless there are any surviving children or
        grandchildren of the author, in which case the widow or widower
        owns one-half of the author's interest.
          (B) The author's surviving children, and the surviving
        children of any dead child of the author, own the author's
        entire termination interest unless there is a widow or widower,
        in which case the ownership of one-half of the author's
        interest is divided among them.
          (C) The rights of the author's children and grandchildren are
        in all cases divided among them and exercised on a per stirpes
        basis according to the number of such author's children
        represented; the share of the children of a dead child in a
        termination interest can be exercised only by the action of a
        majority of them.
          (D) In the event that the author's widow or widower,
        children, and grandchildren are not living, the author's
        executor, administrator, personal representative, or trustee
        shall own the author's entire termination interest.

        (3) Termination of the grant may be effected at any time during
      a period of five years beginning at the end of thirty-five years
      from the date of execution of the grant; or, if the grant covers
      the right of publication of the work, the period begins at the
      end of thirty-five years from the date of publication of the work
      under the grant or at the end of forty years from the date of
      execution of the grant, whichever term ends earlier.
        (4) The termination shall be effected by serving an advance
      notice in writing, signed by the number and proportion of owners
      of termination interests required under clauses (1) and (2) of
      this subsection, or by their duly authorized agents, upon the
      grantee or the grantee's successor in title.
          (A) The notice shall state the effective date of the
        termination, which shall fall within the five-year period
        specified by clause (3) of this subsection, and the notice
        shall be served not less than two or more than ten years before
        that date. A copy of the notice shall be recorded in the
        Copyright Office before the effective date of termination, as a
        condition to its taking effect.
          (B) The notice shall comply, in form, content, and manner of
        service, with requirements that the Register of Copyrights
        shall prescribe by regulation.

        (5) Termination of the grant may be effected notwithstanding
      any agreement to the contrary, including an agreement to make a
      will or to make any future grant.

      (b) Effect of Termination. - Upon the effective date of
    termination, all rights under this title that were covered by the
    terminated grants revert to the author, authors, and other persons
    owning termination interests under clauses (1) and (2) of
    subsection (a), including those owners who did not join in signing
    the notice of termination under clause (4) of subsection (a), but
    with the following limitations:
        (1) A derivative work prepared under authority of the grant
      before its termination may continue to be utilized under the
      terms of the grant after its termination, but this privilege does
      not extend to the preparation after the termination of other
      derivative works based upon the copyrighted work covered by the
      terminated grant.
        (2) The future rights that will revert upon termination of the
      grant become vested on the date the notice of termination has
      been served as provided by clause (4) of subsection (a). The
      rights vest in the author, authors, and other persons named in,
      and in the proportionate shares provided by, clauses (1) and (2)
      of subsection (a).
        (3) Subject to the provisions of clause (4) of this subsection,
      a further grant, or agreement to make a further grant, of any
      right covered by a terminated grant is valid only if it is signed
      by the same number and proportion of the owners, in whom the
      right has vested under clause (2) of this subsection, as are
      required to terminate the grant under clauses (1) and (2) of
      subsection (a). Such further grant or agreement is effective with
      respect to all of the persons in whom the right it covers has
      vested under clause (2) of this subsection, including those who
      did not join in signing it. If any person dies after rights under
      a terminated grant have vested in him or her, that person's legal
      representatives, legatees, or heirs at law represent him or her
      for purposes of this clause.
        (4) A further grant, or agreement to make a further grant, of
      any right covered by a terminated grant is valid only if it is
      made after the effective date of the termination. As an
      exception, however, an agreement for such a further grant may be
      made between the persons provided by clause (3) of this
      subsection and the original grantee or such grantee's successor
      in title, after the notice of termination has been served as
      provided by clause (4) of subsection (a).
        (5) Termination of a grant under this section affects only
      those rights covered by the grants that arise under this title,
      and in no way affects rights arising under any other Federal,
      State, or foreign laws.
        (6) Unless and until termination is effected under this
      section, the grant, if it does not provide otherwise, continues
      in effect for the term of copyright provided by this title.

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      The Problem in General. The provisions of section 203 are based
    on the premise that the reversionary provisions of the present
    section on copyright renewal (17 U.S.C. sec. 24 [section 24 of
    former title 17]) should be eliminated, and that the proposed law
    should substitute for them a provision safeguarding authors against
    unremunerative transfers. A provision of this sort is needed
    because of the unequal bargaining position of authors, resulting in
    part from the impossibility of determining a work's value until it
    has been exploited. Section 203 reflects a practical compromise
    that will further the objectives of the copyright law while
    recognizing the problems and legitimate needs of all interests
    involved.
      Scope of the Provision. Instead of being automatic, as is
    theoretically the case under the present renewal provision, the
    termination of a transfer or license under section 203 would
    require the serving of an advance notice within specified time
    limits and under specified conditions. However, although
    affirmative action is needed to effect a termination, the right to
    take this action cannot be waived in advance or contracted away.
    Under section 203(a) the right of termination would apply only to
    transfers and licenses executed after the effective date of the new
    statute [Jan. 1, 1978], and would have no retroactive effect.
      The right of termination would be confined to inter vivos
    transfers or licenses executed by the author, and would not apply
    to transfers by the author's successors in interest or to the
    author's own bequests. The scope of the right would extend not only
    to any "transfer of copyright ownership," as defined in section
    101, but also to nonexclusive licenses. The right of termination
    would not apply to "works made for hire," which is one of the
    principal reasons the definition of that term assumed importance in
    the development of the bill.
      Who Can Terminate a Grant. Two issues emerged from the disputes
    over section 203 as to the persons empowered to terminate a grant:
    (1) the specific classes of beneficiaries in the case of joint
    works; and (2) whether anything less than unanimous consent of all
    those entitled to terminate should be required to make a
    termination effective. The bill to some extent reflects a
    compromise on these points, including a recognition of the dangers
    of one or more beneficiaries being induced to "hold out" and of
    unknown children or grandchildren being discovered later. The
    provision can be summarized as follows:
        1. In the case of a work of joint authorship, where the grant
      was signed by two or more of the authors, majority action by
      those who signed the grant, or by their interests, would be
      required to terminate it.
        2. There are three different situations in which the shares of
      joint authors, or of a dead author's widow or widower, children,
      and grandchildren, must be divided under the statute: (1) The
      right to effect a termination; (2) the ownership of the
      terminated rights; and (3) the right to make further grants of
      reverted rights. The respective shares of the authors, and of a
      dead author's widow or widower, children, and grandchildren,
      would be divided in exactly the same way in each of these
      situations. The terms "widow," "widower," and "children" are
      defined in section 101 in an effort to avoid problems and
      uncertainties that have arisen under the present renewal section.
        3. The principle of per stirpes representation would also be
      applied in exactly the same way in all three situations. Take for
      example, a case where a dead author left a widow, two living
      children, and three grandchildren by a third child who is dead.
      The widow will own half of the reverted interests, the two
      children will each own 16 2/3  percent, and the three
      grandchildren will each own a share of roughly 5 1/2  percent.
      But who can exercise the right of termination? Obviously, since
      she owns 50 percent, the widow is an essential party, but suppose
      neither of the two surviving children is willing to join her in
      the termination; is it enough that she gets one of the children
      of the dead child to join, or can the dead child's interest be
      exercised only by the action of a majority of his children?
      Consistent with the per stirpes principle, the interest of a dead
      child can be exercised only as a unit by majority action of his
      surviving children. Thus, even though the widow and one
      grandchild would own 55 1/2  percent of the reverted copyright,
      they would have to be joined by another child or grandchild in
      order to effect a termination or a further transfer of reverted
      rights. This principle also applies where, for example, two joint
      authors executed a grant and one of them is dead; in order to
      effect a termination, the living author must be joined by a per
      stirpes majority of the dead author's beneficiaries. The notice
      of termination may be signed by the specified owners of
      termination interests or by "their duly authorized agents," which
      would include the legally appointed guardians or committees of
      persons incompetent to sign because of age or mental disability.

      When a Grant Can be Terminated. Section 203 draws a distinction
    between the date when a termination becomes effective and the
    earlier date when the advance notice of termination is served. With
    respect to the ultimate effective date, section 203(a)(3) provides,
    as a general rule, that a grant may be terminated during the 5
    years following the expiration of a period of 35 years from the
    execution of the grant. As an exception to this basic 35-year rule,
    the bill also provides that "if the grant covers the right of
    publication of the work, the period begins at the end of 35 years
    from the date of publication of the work under the grant or at the
    end of 40 years from the date of execution of the grant, whichever
    term ends earlier." This alternative method of computation is
    intended to cover cases where years elapse between the signing of a
    publication contract and the eventual publication of the work.
      The effective date of termination, which must be stated in the
    advance notice, is required to fall within the 5 years following
    the end of the applicable 35- or 40-year period, but the advance
    notice itself must be served earlier. Under section 203(a)(4)(A),
    the notice must be served "not less than two or more than ten
    years" before the effective date stated in it.
      As an example of how these time-limit requirements would operate
    in practice, we suggest two typical contract situations:
      Case 1: Contract for theatrical production signed on September 2,
    1987. Termination of grant can be made to take effect between
    September 2, 2022 (35 years from execution) and September 1, 2027
    (end of 5 year termination period). Assuming that the author
    decides to terminate on September 1, 2022 (the earliest possible
    date) the advance notice must be filed between September 1, 2012,
    and September 1, 2020.
      Case 2: Contract for book publication executed on April 10, 1980;
    book finally published on August 23, 1987. Since contract covers
    the right of publication, the 5-year termination period would begin
    on April 10, 2020 (40 years from execution) rather than April 10,
    2015 (35 years from execution) or August 23, 2022 (35 years from
    publication). Assuming that the author decides to make the
    termination effective on January 1, 2024, the advance notice would
    have to be served between January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2022.
      Effect of Termination. Section 203(b) makes clear that, unless
    effectively terminated within the applicable 5-year period, all
    rights covered by an existing grant will continue unchanged, and
    that rights under other Federal, State, or foreign laws are
    unaffected. However, assuming that a copyright transfer or license
    is terminated under section 203, who are bound by the termination
    and how are they affected?
      Under the bill, termination means that ownership of the rights
    covered by the terminated grant reverts to everyone who owns
    termination interests on the date the notice of termination was
    served, whether they joined in signing the notice or not. In other
    words, if a person could have signed the notice, that person is
    bound by the action of the majority who did; the termination of the
    grant will be effective as to that person, and a proportionate
    share of the reverted rights automatically vests in that person.
    Ownership is divided proportionately on the same per stirpes basis
    as that provided for the right to effect termination under section
    203(a) and, since the reverted rights vest on the date notice is
    served, the heirs of a dead beneficiary would inherit his or her
    share.
      Under clause (3) of subsection (b), majority action is required
    to make a further grant of reverted rights. A problem here, of
    course, is that years may have passed between the time the reverted
    rights vested and the time the new owners want to make a further
    transfer; people may have died and children may have been born in
    the interim. To deal with this problem, the bill looks back to the
    date of vesting; out of the group in whom rights vested on that
    date, it requires the further transfer or license to be signed by
    "the same number and proportion of the owners" (though not
    necessarily the same individuals) as were then required to
    terminate the grant under subsection (a). If some of those in whom
    the rights originally vested have died, their "legal
    representatives, legatees, or heirs at law" may represent them for
    this purpose and, as in the case of the termination itself, any one
    of the minority who does not join in the further grant is
    nevertheless bound by it.
      An important limitation on the rights of a copyright owner under
    a terminated grant is specified in section 203(b)(1). This clause
    provides that, notwithstanding a termination, a derivative work
    prepared earlier may "continue to be utilized" under the conditions
    of the terminated grant; the clause adds, however, that this
    privilege is not broad enough to permit the preparation of other
    derivative works. In other words, a film made from a play could
    continue to be licensed for performance after the motion picture
    contract had been terminated but any remake rights covered by the
    contract would be cut off. For this purpose, a motion picture would
    be considered as a "derivative work" with respect to every
    "preexisting work" incorporated in it, whether the preexisting work
    was created independently or was prepared expressly for the motion
    picture.
      Section 203 would not prevent the parties to a transfer or
    license from voluntarily agreeing at any time to terminate an
    existing grant and negotiating a new one, thereby causing another
    35-year period to start running. However, the bill seeks to avoid
    the situation that has arisen under the present renewal provision,
    in which third parties have bought up contingent future interests
    as a form of speculation. Section 203(b)(4) would make a further
    grant of rights that revert under a terminated grant valid "only if
    it is made after the effective date of the termination." An
    exception, in the nature of a right of "first refusal," would
    permit the original grantee or a successor of such grantee to
    negotiate a new agreement with the persons effecting the
    termination at any time after the notice of termination has been
    served.
      Nothing contained in this section or elsewhere in this
    legislation is intended to extend the duration of any license,
    transfer or assignment made for a period of less than thirty-five
    years. If, for example, an agreement provides an earlier
    termination date or lesser duration, or if it allows the author the
    right of cancelling or terminating the agreement under certain
    circumstances, the duration is governed by the agreement. Likewise,
    nothing in this section or legislation is intended to change the
    existing state of the law of contracts concerning the circumstances
    in which an author may cancel or terminate a license, transfer, or
    assignment.
      Section 203(b)(6) provides that, unless and until termination is
    effected under this section, the grant, "if it does not provide
    otherwise," continues for the term of copyright. This section means
    that, if the agreement does not contain provisions specifying its
    term or duration, and the author has not terminated the agreement
    under this section, the agreement continues for the term of the
    copyright, subject to any right of termination under circumstances
    which may be specified therein. If, however, an agreement does
    contain provisions governing its duration - for example, a term of
    fifty years - and the author has not exercised his or her right of
    termination under the statute, the agreement will continue
    according to its terms - in this example, for only fifty years. The
    quoted language is not to be construed as requiring agreements to
    reserve the right of termination.

      Section 204 is a somewhat broadened and liberalized counterpart
    of sections 28 and 29 of the present statute [sections 28 and 29 of
    former title 17]. Under subsection (a), a transfer of copyright
    ownership (other than one brought about by operation of law) is
    valid only if there exists an instrument of conveyance, or
    alternatively a "note or memorandum of the transfer," which is in
    writing and signed by the copyright owner "or such owner's duly
    authorized agent." Subsection (b) makes clear that a notarial or
    consular acknowledgment is not essential to the validity of any
    transfer, whether executed in the United States or abroad. However,
    the subsection would liberalize the conditions under which
    certificates of acknowledgment of documents executed abroad are to
    be accorded prima facie weight, and would give the same weight to
    domestic acknowledgments under appropriate circumstances.

    TITLE 17 - COPYRIGHTS
    CHAPTER 2 - COPYRIGHT OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER

-HEAD-
    Sec. 205. Recordation of transfers and other documents

-STATUTE-
      (a) Conditions for Recordation. - Any transfer of copyright
    ownership or other document pertaining to a copyright may be
    recorded in the Copyright Office if the document filed for
    recordation bears the actual signature of the person who executed
    it, or if it is accompanied by a sworn or official certification
    that it is a true copy of the original, signed document. A sworn or
    official certification may be submitted to the Copyright Office
    electronically, pursuant to regulations established by the Register
    of Copyrights.
      (b) Certificate of Recordation. - The Register of Copyrights
    shall, upon receipt of a document as provided by subsection (a) and
    of the fee provided by section 708, record the document and return
    it with a certificate of recordation.
      (c) Recordation as Constructive Notice. - Recordation of a
    document in the Copyright Office gives all persons constructive
    notice of the facts stated in the recorded document, but only if - 
        (1) the document, or material attached to it, specifically
      identifies the work to which it pertains so that, after the
      document is indexed by the Register of Copyrights, it would be
      revealed by a reasonable search under the title or registration
      number of the work; and
        (2) registration has been made for the work.

      (d) Priority Between Conflicting Transfers. - As between two
    conflicting transfers, the one executed first prevails if it is
    recorded, in the manner required to give constructive notice under
    subsection (c), within one month after its execution in the United
    States or within two months after its execution outside the United
    States, or at any time before recordation in such manner of the
    later transfer. Otherwise the later transfer prevails if recorded
    first in such manner, and if taken in good faith, for valuable
    consideration or on the basis of a binding promise to pay
    royalties, and without notice of the earlier transfer.
      (e) Priority Between Conflicting Transfer of Ownership and
    Nonexclusive License. - A nonexclusive license, whether recorded or
    not, prevails over a conflicting transfer of copyright ownership if
    the license is evidenced by a written instrument signed by the
    owner of the rights licensed or such owner's duly authorized agent,
    and if - 
        (1) the license was taken before execution of the transfer; or
        (2) the license was taken in good faith before recordation of
      the transfer and without notice of it.

      The recording and priority provisions of section 205 are intended
    to clear up a number of uncertainties arising from sections 30 and
    31 of the present law [sections 30 and 31 of former title 17] and
    to make them more effective and practical in operation. Any
    "document pertaining to a copyright" may be recorded under
    subsection (a) if it "bears that actual signature of the person who
    executed it," or if it is appropriately certified as a true copy.
    However, subsection (c) makes clear that the recorded document will
    give constructive notice of its contents only if two conditions are
    met: (1) the document or attached material specifically identifies
    the work to which it pertains so that a reasonable search under the
    title or registration number would reveal it, and (2) registration
    has been made for the work. Moreover, even though the Register of
    Copyrights may be compelled to accept for recordation documents
    that on their face appear self-serving or colorable, the Register
    should take care that their nature is not concealed from the public
    in the Copyright Office's indexing and search reports.
      The provisions of subsection (d), requiring recordation of
    transfers as a prerequisite to the institution of an infringement
    suit, represent a desirable change in the law. The one- and three-
    month grace periods provided in subsection (e) are a reasonable
    compromise between those who want a longer hiatus and those who
    argue that any grace period makes it impossible for a bona fide
    transferee to rely on the record at any particular time.
      Under subsection (f) of section 205, a nonexclusive license in
    writing and signed, whether recorded or not, would be valid against
    a later transfer, and would also prevail as against a prior
    unrecorded transfer if taken in good faith and without notice.
    Objections were raised by motion picture producers, particularly to
    the provision allowing unrecorded nonexclusive licenses to prevail
    over subsequent transfers, on the ground that a nonexclusive
    license can have drastic effects on the value of a copyright. On
    the other hand, the impracticalities and burdens that would
    accompany any requirement of recordation of nonexclusive licenses
    outweigh the limited advantages of a statutory recordation system
    for them.

    subsec. (d), which read as follows: "No person claiming by virtue
    of a transfer to be the owner of copyright or of any exclusive
    right under a copyright is entitled to institute an infringement
    action under this title until the instrument of transfer under
    which such person claims has been recorded in the Copyright Office,
    but suit may be instituted after such recordation on a cause of
    action that arose before recordation."

    authorship that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression and
    come within the subject matter of copyright as specified by
    sections 102 and 103, whether created before or after that date and
    whether published or unpublished, are governed exclusively by this
    title. Thereafter, no person is entitled to any such right or
    equivalent right in any such work under the common law or statutes
    of any State.
      (b) Nothing in this title annuls or limits any rights or remedies
    under the common law or statutes of any State with respect to - 
        (1) subject matter that does not come within the subject matter
      of copyright as specified by sections 102 and 103, including
      works of authorship not fixed in any tangible medium of
      expression; or
        (2) any cause of action arising from undertakings commenced
      before January 1, 1978;

    rights conferred by section 106A apply are governed exclusively by
    section 106A and section 113(d) and the provisions of this title
    relating to such sections. Thereafter, no person is entitled to any
    such right or equivalent right in any work of visual art under the

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      Single Federal System. Section 301, one of the bedrock provisions
    of the bill, would accomplish a fundamental and significant change
    in the present law. Instead of a dual system of "common law
    copyright" for unpublished works and statutory copyright for
    published works, which has been the system in effect in the United
    States since the first copyright statute in 1790, the bill adopts a
    single system of Federal statutory copyright from creation. Under
    section 301 a work would obtain statutory protection as soon as it
    is "created" or, as that term is defined in section 101 when it is
    "fixed in a copy or phonorecord for the first time." Common law
    copyright protection for works coming within the scope of the
    statute would be abrogated, and the concept of publication would
    lose its all-embracing importance as a dividing line between common
    law and statutory protection and between both of these forms of
    legal protection and the public domain.
      By substituting a single Federal system for the present
    anachronistic, uncertain, impractical, and highly complicated dual
    system, the bill would greatly improve the operation of the
    copyright law and would be much more effective in carrying out the
    basic constitutional aims of uniformity and the promotion of
    writing and scholarship. The main arguments in favor of a single
    Federal system can be summarized as follows:
        1. One of the fundamental purposes behind the copyright clause
      of the Constitution, as shown in Madison's comments in The
      Federalist, was to promote national uniformity and to avoid the
      practical difficulties of determining and enforcing an author's
      rights under the differing laws and in the separate courts of the
      various States. Today when the methods for dissemination of an
      author's work are incomparably broader and faster than they were
      in 1789, national uniformity in copyright protection is even more
      essential than it was then to carry out the constitutional
      intent.
        2. "Publication," perhaps the most important single concept
      under the present law, also represents its most serious defect.
      Although at one time when works were disseminated almost
      exclusively through printed copies, "publication" could serve as
      a practical dividing line between common law and statutory
      protection, this is no longer true. With the development of the
      20th-century communications revolution, the concept of
      publication has become increasingly artificial and obscure. To
      cope with the legal consequences of an established concept that
      has lost much of its meaning and justification, the courts have
      given "publication" a number of diverse interpretations, some of
      them radically different. Not unexpectedly, the results in
      individual cases have become unpredictable and often unfair. A
      single Federal system would help to clear up this chaotic
      situation.
        3. Enactment of section 301 would also implement the "limited
      times" provision of the Constitution [Const. Art. I, Sec. 8, cl.
      8], which has become distorted under the traditional concept of
      "publication." Common law protection in "unpublished" works is
      now perpetual, no matter how widely they may be disseminated by
      means other than "publication"; the bill would place a time limit
      on the duration of exclusive rights in them. The provision would
      also aid scholarship and the dissemination of historical
      materials by making unpublished, undisseminated manuscripts
      available for publication after a reasonable period.
        4. Adoption of a uniform national copyright system would
      greatly improve international dealings in copyrighted material.
      No other country has anything like our present dual system. In an
      era when copyrighted works can be disseminated instantaneously to
      every country on the globe, the need for effective international
      copyright relations, and the concomitant need for national
      uniformity, assume ever greater importance.
      Under section 301, the statute would apply to all works created
    after its effective date [Jan 1, 1978], whether or not they are
    ever published or disseminated. With respect to works created
    before the effective date of the statute [Jan. 1, 1978] and still
    under common law protection, section 303 of the statute would
    provide protection from that date on, and would guarantee a minimum
    period of statutory copyright.
      Preemption of State Law. The intention of section 301 is to
    preempt and abolish any rights under the common law or statutes of
    a State that are equivalent to copyright and that extend to works
    coming within the scope of the Federal copyright law. The
    declaration of this principle in section 301 is intended to be
    stated in the clearest and most unequivocal language possible, so
    as to foreclose any conceivable misinterpretation of its
    unqualified intention that Congress shall act preemptively, and to
    avoid the development of any vague borderline areas between State
    and Federal protection.
      Under section 301(a) all "legal or equitable rights that are
    equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope
    of copyright as specified by section 106" are governed exclusively
    by the Federal copyright statute if the works involved are "works
    of authorship that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression and
    come within the subject matter of copyright as specified by
    sections 102 and 103." All corresponding State laws, whether common
    law or statutory, are preempted and abrogated. Regardless of when
    the work was created and whether it is published or unpublished,
    disseminated or undisseminated, in the public domain or copyrighted
    under the Federal statute, the States cannot offer it protection
    equivalent to copyright. Section 1338 of title 28, United States
    Code, also makes clear that any action involving rights under the
    Federal copyright law would come within the exclusive jurisdiction
    of the Federal courts. The preemptive effect of section 301 is
    limited to State laws; as stated expressly in subsection (d) of
    section 301, there is no intention to deal with the question of
    whether Congress can or should offer the equivalent of copyright
    protection under some constitutional provision other than the
    patent-copyright clause of article 1, section 8 [Const. Art. I,
    Sec. 8, cl. 8].
      As long as a work fits within one of the general subject matter
    categories of sections 102 and 103, the bill prevents the States
    from protecting it even if it fails to achieve Federal statutory
    copyright because it is too minimal or lacking in originality to
    qualify, or because it has fallen into the public domain. On the
    other hand section 301(b) explicitly preserves common law copyright
    protection for one important class of works: works that have not
    been "fixed in any tangible medium of expression." Examples would
    include choreography that has never been filmed or notated, an
    extemporaneous speech, "original works of authorship" communicated
    solely through conversations or live broadcasts, and a dramatic
    sketch or musical composition improvised or developed from memory
    and without being recorded or written down. As mentioned above in
    connection with section 102, unfixed works are not included in the
    specified "subject matter of copyright." They are therefore not
    affected by the preemption of section 301, and would continue to be
    subject to protection under State statute or common law until fixed
    in tangible form.
      The preemption of rights under State law is complete with respect
    to any work coming within the scope of the bill, even though the
    scope of exclusive rights given the work under the bill is narrower
    than the scope of common law rights in the work might have been.
      Representatives of printers, while not opposed to the principle
    of section 301, expressed concern about its potential impact on
    protection of preliminary advertising copy and layouts prepared by
    printers. They argued that this material is frequently "pirated" by
    competitors, and that it would be a substantial burden if, in order
    to obtain full protection, the printer would have to make
    registrations and bear the expense and bother of suing in Federal
    rather than State courts. On the other hand, these practical
    problems are essentially procedural rather than substantive, and
    the proposal for a special exemption to preserve common law rights
    equivalent to copyright in unpublished advertising material cannot
    be justified. Moreover, subsection (b), discussed below, will
    preserve other legal grounds on which the printers can protect
    themselves against "pirates" under State laws.
      In a general way subsection (b) of section 301 represents the
    obverse of subsection (a). It sets out, in broad terms and without
    necessarily being exhaustive, some of the principal areas of
    protection that preemption would not prevent the States from
    protecting. Its purpose is to make clear, consistent with the 1964
    Supreme Court decisions in Sears, Roebuck & Co., v. Stiffel Co.,
    376 U.S. 225 [84 S.Ct. 784, 11 L.Ed.2d 661, rehearing denied 84
    S.Ct. 1131, 376 U.S. 973, 12 L.Ed.2d 87], and Compco Corp. v. Day-
    Brite Lighting, Inc., 376 U.S. 234 [84 S.Ct. 779, 11 L.Ed.2d 669,
    rehearing denied 84 S.Ct. 1162, 377 U.S. 913, 12 L.Ed.2d 183], that
    preemption does not extend to causes of action, or subject matter
    outside the scope of the revised Federal copyright statute.
      The numbered clauses of subsection (b) list three general areas
    left unaffected by the preemption: (1) subject matter that does not
    come within the subject matter of copyright; (2) causes of action
    arising under State law before the effective date of the statute
    [Jan. 1, 1978]; and (3) violations of rights that are not
    equivalent to any of the exclusive rights under copyright.
      The examples in clause (3), while not exhaustive, are intended to
    illustrate rights and remedies that are different in nature from
    the rights comprised in a copyright and that may continue to be
    protected under State common law or statute. The evolving common
    law rights of "privacy," "publicity," and trade secrets, and the
    general laws of defamation and fraud, would remain unaffected as
    long as the causes of action contain elements, such as an invasion
    of personal rights or a breach of trust or confidentiality, that
    are different in kind from copyright infringement. Nothing in the
    bill derogates from the rights of parties to contract with each
    other and to sue for breaches of contract; however, to the extent
    that the unfair competition concept known as "interference with
    contract relations" is merely the equivalent of copyright
    protection, it would be preempted.
      The last example listed in clause (3) - "deceptive trade
    practices such as passing off and false representation" -
    represents an effort to distinguish between those causes of action
    known as "unfair competition" that the copyright statute is not
    intended to preempt and those that it is. Section 301 is not
    intended to preempt common law protection in cases involving
    activities such as false labeling, fraudulent representation, and
    passing off even where the subject matter involved comes within the
    scope of the copyright statute.
      "Misappropriation" is not necessarily synonymous with copyright
    infringement, and thus a cause of action labeled as
    "misappropriation" is not preempted if it is fact based neither on
    a right within the general scope of copyright as specified by
    section 106 nor on a right equivalent thereto. For example, state
    law should have the flexibility to afford a remedy (under
    traditional principles of equity) against a consistent pattern of
    unauthorized appropriation by a competitor of the facts (i.e., not
    the literary expression) constituting "hot" news, whether in the
    traditional mold of International News Service v. Associated Press,
    248 U.S. 215 (1918) [39 S.Ct. 68, 63 L.Ed. 211], or in the newer
    form of data updates from scientific, business, or financial data
    bases. Likewise, a person having no trust or other relationship
    with the proprietor of a computerized data base should not be
    immunized from sanctions against electronically or
    cryptographically breaching the proprietor's security arrangements
    and accessing the proprietor's data. The unauthorized data access
    which should be remediable might also be achieved by the
    intentional interception of data transmissions by wire, microwave
    or laser transmissions, or by the common unintentional means of
    "crossed" telephone lines occasioned by errors in switching.
      The proprietor of data displayed on the cathode ray tube of a
    computer terminal should be afforded protection against
    unauthorized printouts by third parties (with or without improper
    access), even if the data are not copyrightable. For example, the
    data may not be copyrighted because they are not fixed in a
    tangible medium of expression (i.e., the data are not displayed for
    a period or not more than transitory duration).
      Nothing contained in section 301 precludes the owner of a
    material embodiment of a copy or a phonorecord from enforcing a
    claim of conversion against one who takes possession of the copy or
    phonorecord without consent.
      A unique and difficult problem is presented with respect to the
    status of sound recordings fixed before February 12, 1972, the
    effective date of the amendment bringing recordings fixed after
    that date under Federal copyright protection. In its testimony
    during the 1975 hearings, the Department of Justice pointed out
    that, under section 301 as then written:
        This language could be read as abrogating the anti-piracy laws
      now existing in 29 states relating to pre-February 15, 1972,
      sound recordings on the grounds that these statutes proscribe
      activities violating rights equivalent to * * * the exclusive
      rights within the general scope of copyright. * * * Certainly
      such a result cannot have been intended for it would likely
      effect the immediate resurgence of piracy of pre-February 15,
      1972, sound recordings.
    The Department recommended that section 301(b) be amended to
    exclude sound recordings fixed prior to February 15, 1972 from the
    effect of the preemption.
      The Senate adopted this suggestion when it passed S. 22. The
    result of the Senate amendment would be to leave pre-1972 sound
    recordings as entitled to perpetual protection under State law,
    while post-1972 recordings would eventually fall into the public
    domain as provided in the bill.
      The Committee recognizes that, under recent court decisions, pre-
    1972 recordings are protected by State statute or common law, and
    that should not all be thrown into the public domain instantly upon
    the coming into effect of the new law. However, it cannot agree
    that they should in effect be accorded perpetual protection, as
    under the Senate amendment, and it has therefore revised clause (4)
    to establish a future date for the pre-emption to take effect. The
    date chosen is February 15, 2047 which is 75 years from the
    effective date of the statute extending Federal protection to
    recordings.
      Subsection (c) makes clear that nothing contained in Title 17
    annuls or limits any rights or remedies under any other Federal
    statute.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 302. Duration of copyright: Works created on or after January
      1, 1978

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - Copyright in a work created on or after January
    1, 1978, subsists from its creation and, except as provided by the
    following subsections, endures for a term consisting of the life of
    the author and 70 years after the author's death.
      (b) Joint Works. - In the case of a joint work prepared by two or
    more authors who did not work for hire, the copyright endures for a
    term consisting of the life of the last surviving author and 70
    years after such last surviving author's death.
      (c) Anonymous Works, Pseudonymous Works, and Works Made for Hire.
    - In the case of an anonymous work, a pseudonymous work, or a work
    made for hire, the copyright endures for a term of 95 years from
    the year of its first publication, or a term of 120 years from the
    year of its creation, whichever expires first. If, before the end
    of such term, the identity of one or more of the authors of an
    anonymous or pseudonymous work is revealed in the records of a
    registration made for that work under subsections (a) or (d) of
    section 408, or in the records provided by this subsection, the
    copyright in the work endures for the term specified by subsection
    (a) or (b), based on the life of the author or authors whose
    identity has been revealed. Any person having an interest in the
    copyright in an anonymous or pseudonymous work may at any time
    record, in records to be maintained by the Copyright Office for
    that purpose, a statement identifying one or more authors of the
    work; the statement shall also identify the person filing it, the
    nature of that person's interest, the source of the information
    recorded, and the particular work affected, and shall comply in
    form and content with requirements that the Register of Copyrights
    shall prescribe by regulation.
      (d) Records Relating to Death of Authors. - Any person having an
    interest in a copyright may at any time record in the Copyright
    Office a statement of the date of death of the author of the
    copyrighted work, or a statement that the author is still living on
    a particular date. The statement shall identify the person filing
    it, the nature of that person's interest, and the source of the
    information recorded, and shall comply in form and content with
    requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by
    regulation. The Register shall maintain current records of
    information relating to the death of authors of copyrighted works,
    based on such recorded statements and, to the extent the Register
    considers practicable, on data contained in any of the records of
    the Copyright Office or in other reference sources.
      (e) Presumption as to Author's Death. - After a period of 95
    years from the year of first publication of a work, or a period of
    120 years from the year of its creation, whichever expires first,
    any person who obtains from the Copyright Office a certified report
    that the records provided by subsection (d) disclose nothing to
    indicate that the author of the work is living, or died less than
    70 years before, is entitled to the benefits of a presumption that
    the author has been dead for at least 70 years. Reliance in good
    faith upon this presumption shall be a complete defense to any
    action for infringement under this title.

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      In General. The debate over how long a copyright should last is
    as old as the oldest copyright statute and will doubtless continue
    as long as there is a copyright law. With certain exceptions, there
    appears to be strong support for the principle, as embodied in the
    bill, of a copyright term consisting of the life of the author and
    50 years after his death. In particular, the authors and their
    representatives stressed that the adoption of a life-plus-50 term
    was by far their most important legislative goal in copyright law
    revision. The Register of Copyrights now regards a life-plus-50
    term as the foundation of the entire bill.
      Under the present law statutory copyright protection begins on
    the date of publication (or on the date of registration in
    unpublished form) and continues for 28 years from that date; it may
    be renewed for a second 28 years, making a total potential term of
    56 years in all cases. [Under Public Laws 87-668, 89-142, 90-141,
    90-416, 91-147, 91-555, 92-170, 92-566, and 93-573, copyrights that
    were subsisting in their renewal term on September 19, 1962, and
    that were scheduled to expire before Dec. 31, 1976, have been
    extended to that later date, in anticipation that general revision
    legislation extending their terms still further will be enacted by
    then.] The principal elements of this system - a definite number of
    years, computed from either publication or registration, with a
    renewal feature - have been a part of the U.S. copyright law since
    the first statute in 1790. The arguments for changing this system
    to one based on the life of the author can be summarized as
    follows:
        1. The present 56-year term is not long enough to insure an
      author and his dependents the fair economic benefits from his
      works. Life expectancy has increased substantially, and more and
      more authors are seeing their works fall into the public domain
      during their lifetimes, forcing later works to compete with their
      own early works in which copyright has expired.
        2. The tremendous growth in communications media has
      substantially lengthened the commercial life of a great many
      works. A short term is particularly discriminatory against
      serious works of music, literature, and art, whose value may not
      be recognized until after many years.
        3. Although limitations on the term of copyright are obviously
      necessary, too short a term harms the author without giving any
      substantial benefit to the public. The public frequently pays the
      same for works in the public domain as it does for copyrighted
      works, and the only result is a commercial windfall to certain
      users at the author's expense. In some cases the lack of
      copyright protection actually restrains dissemination of the
      work, since publishers and other users cannot risk investing in
      the work unless assured of exclusive rights.
        4. A system based on the life of the author would go a long way
      toward clearing up the confusion and uncertainty involved in the
      vague concept of "publication," and would provide a much simpler,
      clearer method for computing the term. The death of the author is
      a definite, determinable event, and it would be the only date
      that a potential user would have to worry about. All of a
      particular author's works, including successive revisions of
      them, would fall into the public domain at the same time, thus
      avoiding the present problems of determining a multitude of
      publication dates and of distinguishing "old" and "new" matter in
      later editions. The bill answers the problems of determining when
      relatively obscure authors died, by establishing a registry of
      death dates and a system of presumptions.
        5. One of the worst features of the present copyright law is
      the provision for renewal of copyright. A substantial burden and
      expense, this unclear and highly technical requirement results in
      incalculable amounts of unproductive work. In a number of cases
      it is the cause of inadvertent and unjust loss of copyright.
      Under a life-plus-50 system the renewal device would be
      inappropriate and unnecessary.
        6. Under the preemption provisions of section 301 and the
      single Federal system they would establish, authors will be
      giving up perpetual, unlimited exclusive common law rights in
      their unpublished works, including works that have been widely
      disseminated by means other than publication. A statutory term of
      life-plus-50 years is no more than a fair recompense for the loss
      of these perpetual rights.
        7. A very large majority of the world's countries have adopted
      a copyright term of the life of the author and 50 years after the
      author's death. Since American authors are frequently protected
      longer in foreign countries than in the United States, the
      disparity in the duration of copyright has provoked considerable
      resentment and some proposals for retaliatory legislation.
      Copyrighted works move across national borders faster and more
      easily than virtually any other economic commodity, and with the
      techniques now in common use this movement has in many cases
      become instantaneous and effortless. The need to conform the
      duration of U.S. copyright to that prevalent throughout the rest
      of the world is increasingly pressing in order to provide
      certainty and simplicity in international business dealings. Even
      more important, a change in the basis of our copyright term would
      place the United States in the forefront of the international
      copyright community. Without this change, the possibility of
      future United States adherence to the Berne Copyright Union would
      evaporate, but with it would come a great and immediate
      improvement in our copyright relations. All of these benefits
      would accrue directly to American and foreign authors alike.

      The need for a longer total term of copyright has been
    conclusively demonstrated. It is true that a major reason for the
    striking statistical increase in life expectancy since 1909 is the
    reduction in infant mortality, but this does not mean that the
    increase can be discounted. Although not nearly as great as the
    total increase in life expectancy, there has been a marked increase
    in longevity, and with medical discoveries and health programs for
    the elderly this trend shows every indication of continuing. If
    life expectancy in 1909, which was in the neighborhood of 56 years,
    offered a rough guide to the length of copyright protection, then
    life expectancy in the 1970's which is well over 70 years, should
    offer a similar guide; the Register's 1961 Report included
    statistics indicating that something between 70 and 76 years was
    then the average equivalent of life-plus-50 years. A copyright
    should extend beyond the author's lifetime, and judged by this
    standard the present term of 56 years is too short.
      The arguments as to the benefits of uniformity with foreign laws,
    and the advantages of international comity that would result from
    adoption of a life-plus-50 term, are also highly significant. The
    system has worked well in other countries, and on the whole it
    would appear to make computation of terms considerably simpler and
    easier. The registry of death dates and the system of presumptions
    established in section 302 would solve most of the problems in
    determining when an individual author died.
      No country in the world has provisions on the duration of
    copyright like ours. Virtually every other copyright law in the
    world bases the term of protection for works by natural persons on
    the life of the author, and a substantial majority of these accord
    protection for 50 years after the author's death. This term is
    required for adherence to the Berne Convention. It is worth noting
    that the 1965 revision of the copyright law of the Federal Republic
    of Germany adopted a term of life plus 70 years.
      A point that has concerned some educational groups arose from the
    possibility that, since a large majority (now about 85 percent) of
    all copyrighted works are not renewed, a life-plus-50 year term
    would tie up a substantial body of material that is probably of no
    commercial interest but that would be more readily available for
    scholarly use if free of copyright restrictions. A statistical
    study of renewal registrations made by the Copyright Office in 1966
    supports the generalization that most material which is considered
    to be of continuing or potential commercial value is renewed. Of
    the remainder, a certain proportion is of practically no value to
    anyone, but there are a large number of unrenewed works that have
    scholarly value to historians, archivists, and specialists in a
    variety of fields. This consideration lay behind the proposals for
    retaining the renewal device or for limiting the term for
    unpublished or unregistered works.
      It is true that today's ephemera represent tomorrow's social
    history, and that works of scholarly value, which are now falling
    into the public domain after 28 years, would be protected much
    longer under the bill. Balanced against this are the burdens and
    expenses of renewals, the near impossibility of distinguishing
    between types of works in fixing a statutory term, and the
    extremely strong case in favor of a life-plus-50 system. Moreover,
    it is important to realize that the bill would not restrain
    scholars from using any work as source material or from making
    "fair use" of it; the restrictions would extend only to the
    unauthorized reproduction or distribution of copies of the work,
    its public performance, or some other use that would actually
    infringe the copyright owner's exclusive rights. The advantages of
    a basic term of copyright enduring for the life of the author and
    for 50 years after the author's death outweigh any possible
    disadvantages.
      Basic Copyright Term. Under subsection (a) of section 302, a work
    "created" on or after the effective date of the revised statute
    [Jan. 1, 1978] would be protected by statutory copyright "from its
    creation" and, with exceptions to be noted below, "endures for a
    term consisting of the life of the author and 50 years after the
    author's death."
      Under this provision, as a general rule, the life-plus-50 term
    would apply equally to unpublished works, to works published during
    the author's lifetime, and to works published posthumously.
      The definition of "created" in section 101, which will be
    discussed in more detail in connection with section 302(c) below,
    makes clear that "creation" for this purpose means the first time
    the work is fixed in a copy or phonorecord; up to that point the
    work is not "created," and is subject to common law protection,
    even though it may exist in someone's mind and may have been
    communicated to others in unfixed form.
      Joint Works. Since by definition a "joint work" has two or more
    authors, a statute basing the term of copyright on the life of the
    author must provide a special method of computing the term of
    "joint works." Under the system in effect in many foreign
    countries, the term of copyright is measured from the death of the
    last survivor of a group of joint authors, no matter how many there
    are. The bill adopts this system as the simplest and fairest of the
    alternatives for dealing with the problem.
      Anonymous Works, Pseudonymous Works, and Works Made for Hire.
    Computing the term from the author's death also requires special
    provisions to deal with cases where the authorship is not revealed
    or where the "author" is not an individual. Section 302(c)
    therefore provides a special term for anonymous works, pseudonymous
    works, and works made for hire: 75 years from publication or 100
    years from creation, whichever is shorter. The definitions in
    section 101 make the status of anonymous and pseudonymous works
    depend on what is revealed on the copies or phonorecords of a work;
    a work is "anonymous" if "no natural person is identified as
    author," and is "pseudonymous" if "the author is identified under a
    fictitious name."
      Section 302(c) provides that the 75- and 100-year terms for an
    anonymous or pseudonymous work can be converted to the ordinary
    life-plus-50 term if "the identity of one or more authors * * * is
    revealed" in special records maintained for this purpose in the
    Copyright Office. The term in such cases would be "based on the
    life of the author or authors whose identity has been revealed."
    Instead of forcing a user to search through countless Copyright
    Office records to determine if an author's identity has been
    revealed, the bill sets up a special registry for the purpose, with
    requirements concerning the filing of identifying statements that
    parallel those of the following subsection (d) with respect to
    statements of the date of an author's death.
      The alternative terms established in section 302(c) - 75 years
    from publication or 100 years from creation, whichever expires
    first - are necessary to set a time limit on protection of
    unpublished material. For example, copyright in a work created in
    1978 and published in 1988 would expire in 2063 (75 years from
    publication). A question arises as to when the copyright should
    expire if the work is never published. Both the Constitution and
    the underlying purposes of the bill require the establishment of an
    alternative term for unpublished work and the only practicable
    basis for this alternative is "creation." Under the bill a work
    created in 1980 but not published until after 2005 (or never
    published) would fall into the public domain in 2080 (100 years
    after creation).
      The definition in section 101 provides that "creation" takes
    place when a work "is fixed in a copy or phonorecord for the first
    time." Although the concept of "creation" is inherently lacking in
    precision, its adoption in the bill would, for example, enable a
    scholar to use an unpublished manuscript written anonymously,
    pseudonymously, or for hire, if he determines on the basis of
    internal or external evidence that the manuscript is at least 100
    years old. In the case of works written over a period of time or in
    successive revised versions, the definition provides that the
    portion of the work "that has been fixed at any particular time
    constitutes the work as of that time," and that, "where the work
    has been prepared in different versions, each version constitutes a
    separate work." Thus, a scholar or other user, in attempting to
    determine whether a particular work is in the public domain, needs
    to look no further than the particular version he wishes to use.
      Although "publication" would no longer play the central role
    assigned to it under the present law, the concept would still have
    substantial significance under provisions throughout the bill,
    including those on Federal preemption and duration. Under the
    definition in section 101, a work is "published" if one or more
    copies or phonorecords embodying it are distributed to the public -
    that is, generally to persons under no explicit or implicit
    restrictions with respect to disclosure of its contents - without
    regard to the manner in which the copies or phonorecords changed
    hands. The definition clears up the question of whether the sale of
    phonorecords constitutes publication, and it also makes plain that
    any form or dissemination in which a material object does not
    change hands - performances or displays on television, for example -
     is not a publication no matter how many people are exposed to the
    work. On the other hand, the definition also makes clear that, when
    copies or phonorecords are offered to a group of wholesalers,
    broadcasters, motion picture theaters, etc., publication takes
    place if the purpose is "further distribution, public performance,
    or public display."
      Although the periods of 75 or 100 years for anonymous and
    pseudonymous works and works made for hire seem to be longer than
    the equivalent term provided by foreign laws and the Berne
    Conventions, this difference is more apparent than real. In
    general, the terms in these special cases approximate, on the
    average, the term of the life of the author plus 50 years
    established for other works. The 100-year maximum term for
    unpublished works, although much more limited than the perpetual
    term now available under common law in the United States and under
    statute in some foreign countries, is sufficient to guard against
    unjustified invasions of privacy and to fulfill our obligations
    under the Universal Copyright Convention.
      Records and Presumption as to Author's Death. Subsections (d) and
    (e) of section 302 together furnish an answer to the practical
    problems of how to discover the death dates of obscure or unknown
    authors. Subsection (d) provides a procedure for recording
    statements that an author died, or that he was still living, on a
    particular date, and also requires the Register of Copyrights to
    maintain obituary records on a current basis. Under subsection (e)
    anyone who, after a specified period, obtains certification from
    the Copyright Office that its records show nothing to indicate that
    the author is living or died less than 50 years before, is entitled
    to rely upon a presumption that the author has been dead for more
    than 50 years. The period specified in subsection (e) - 75 years
    from publication or 100 years from creation - is purposely uniform
    with the special term provided in subsection (c).

-STATUTE-
      (a) Copyright in a work created before January 1, 1978, but not
    theretofore in the public domain or copyrighted, subsists from
    January 1, 1978, and endures for the term provided by section 302.

      Theoretically, at least, the legal impact of section 303 would be
    far reaching. Under it, every "original work of authorship" fixed
    in tangible form that is in existence would be given statutory
    copyright protection as long as the work is not in the public
    domain in this country. The vast majority of these works consist of
    private material that no one is interested in protecting or
    infringing, but section 303 would still have practical effects for
    a prodigious body of material already in existence.
      Looked at another way, however, section 303 would have a
    genuinely restrictive effect. Its basic purpose is to substitute
    statutory for common law copyright for everything now protected at
    common law, and to substitute reasonable time limits for the
    perpetual protection now available. In general, the substituted
    time limits are those applicable to works created after the
    effective date of the law [Jan. 1, 1978]; for example, an
    unpublished work written in 1945 whose author dies in 1980 would be
    protected under the statute from the effective date [Jan. 1, 1978]
    through 2030 (50 years after the author's death).
      A special problem under this provision is what to do with works
    whose ordinary statutory terms will have expired or will be nearing
    expiration on the effective date [Jan. 1, 1978]. The committee
    believes that a provision taking away subsisting common law rights
    and substituting statutory rights for a reasonable period is fully
    in harmony with the constitutional requirements of due process, but
    it is necessary to fix a "reasonable period" for this purpose.
    Section 303 provides that under no circumstances would copyright
    protection expire before December 31, 2002, and also attempts to
    encourage publication by providing 25 years more protection
    (through 2027) if the work were published before the end of 2002.

    CHAPTER 3 - DURATION OF COPYRIGHT

-HEAD-
    Sec. 304. Duration of copyright: Subsisting copyrights

-STATUTE-
      (a) Copyrights in Their First Term on January 1, 1978. - (1)(A)
    Any copyright, the first term of which is subsisting on January 1,
    1978, shall endure for 28 years from the date it was originally
    secured.
      (B) In the case of - 
        (i) any posthumous work or of any periodical, cyclopedic, or
      other composite work upon which the copyright was originally
      secured by the proprietor thereof, or
        (ii) any work copyrighted by a corporate body (otherwise than
      as assignee or licensee of the individual author) or by an
      employer for whom such work is made for hire,

    the proprietor of such copyright shall be entitled to a renewal and
    extension of the copyright in such work for the further term of 67
    years.
      (C) In the case of any other copyrighted work, including a
    contribution by an individual author to a periodical or to a
    cyclopedic or other composite work - 
        (i) the author of such work, if the author is still living,
        (ii) the widow, widower, or children of the author, if the
      author is not living,
        (iii) the author's executors, if such author, widow, widower,
      or children are not living, or
        (iv) the author's next of kin, in the absence of a will of the
      author,

    shall be entitled to a renewal and extension of the copyright in
    such work for a further term of 67 years.
      (2)(A) At the expiration of the original term of copyright in a
    work specified in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the
    copyright shall endure for a renewed and extended further term of
    67 years, which - 
        (i) if an application to register a claim to such further term
      has been made to the Copyright Office within 1 year before the
      expiration of the original term of copyright, and the claim is
      registered, shall vest, upon the beginning of such further term,
      in the proprietor of the copyright who is entitled to claim the
      renewal of copyright at the time the application is made; or
        (ii) if no such application is made or the claim pursuant to
      such application is not registered, shall vest, upon the
      beginning of such further term, in the person or entity that was
      the proprietor of the copyright as of the last day of the
      original term of copyright.

      (B) At the expiration of the original term of copyright in a work
    specified in paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection, the copyright
    shall endure for a renewed and extended further term of 67 years,
    which - 
        (i) if an application to register a claim to such further term
      has been made to the Copyright Office within 1 year before the
      expiration of the original term of copyright, and the claim is
      registered, shall vest, upon the beginning of such further term,
      in any person who is entitled under paragraph (1)(C) to the
      renewal and extension of the copyright at the time the
      application is made; or
        (ii) if no such application is made or the claim pursuant to
      such application is not registered, shall vest, upon the
      beginning of such further term, in any person entitled under
      paragraph (1)(C), as of the last day of the original term of
      copyright, to the renewal and extension of the copyright.

      (3)(A) An application to register a claim to the renewed and
    extended term of copyright in a work may be made to the Copyright
    Office - 
        (i) within 1 year before the expiration of the original term of
      copyright by any person entitled under paragraph (1)(B) or (C) to
      such further term of 67 years; and
        (ii) at any time during the renewed and extended term by any
      person in whom such further term vested, under paragraph (2)(A)
      or (B), or by any successor or assign of such person, if the
      application is made in the name of such person.

      (B) Such an application is not a condition of the renewal and
    extension of the copyright in a work for a further term of 67
    years.
      (4)(A) If an application to register a claim to the renewed and
    extended term of copyright in a work is not made within 1 year
    before the expiration of the original term of copyright in a work,
    or if the claim pursuant to such application is not registered,
    then a derivative work prepared under authority of a grant of a
    transfer or license of the copyright that is made before the
    expiration of the original term of copyright may continue to be
    used under the terms of the grant during the renewed and extended
    term of copyright without infringing the copyright, except that
    such use does not extend to the preparation during such renewed and
    extended term of other derivative works based upon the copyrighted
    work covered by such grant.
      (B) If an application to register a claim to the renewed and
    extended term of copyright in a work is made within 1 year before
    its expiration, and the claim is registered, the certificate of
    such registration shall constitute prima facie evidence as to the
    validity of the copyright during its renewed and extended term and
    of the facts stated in the certificate. The evidentiary weight to
    be accorded the certificates of a registration of a renewed and
    extended term of copyright made after the end of that 1-year period
    shall be within the discretion of the court.
      (b) Copyrights in Their Renewal Term at the Time of the Effective
    Date of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act. - Any
    copyright still in its renewal term at the time that the Sonny Bono
    Copyright Term Extension Act becomes effective shall have a
    copyright term of 95 years from the date copyright was originally
    secured.
      (c) Termination of Transfers and Licenses Covering Extended
    Renewal Term. - In the case of any copyright subsisting in either
    its first or renewal term on January 1, 1978, other than a
    copyright in a work made for hire, the exclusive or nonexclusive
    grant of a transfer or license of the renewal copyright or any
    right under it, executed before January 1, 1978, by any of the
    persons designated by subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section,
    otherwise than by will, is subject to termination under the
    following conditions:
        (1) In the case of a grant executed by a person or persons
      other than the author, termination of the grant may be effected
      by the surviving person or persons who executed it. In the case
      of a grant executed by one or more of the authors of the work,
      termination of the grant may be effected, to the extent of a
      particular author's share in the ownership of the renewal
      copyright, by the author who executed it or, if such author is
      dead, by the person or persons who, under clause (2) of this
      subsection, own and are entitled to exercise a total of more than
      one-half of that author's termination interest.
        (2) Where an author is dead, his or her termination interest is
      owned, and may be exercised, as follows:
          (A) The widow or widower owns the author's entire termination
        interest unless there are any surviving children or
        grandchildren of the author, in which case the widow or widower
        owns one-half of the author's interest.
          (B) The author's surviving children, and the surviving
        children of any dead child of the author, own the author's
        entire termination interest unless there is a widow or widower,
        in which case the ownership of one-half of the author's
        interest is divided among them.
          (C) The rights of the author's children and grandchildren are
        in all cases divided among them and exercised on a per stirpes
        basis according to the number of such author's children
        represented; the share of the children of a dead child in a
        termination interest can be exercised only by the action of a
        majority of them.
          (D) In the event that the author's widow or widower,
        children, and grandchildren are not living, the author's
        executor, administrator, personal representative, or trustee
        shall own the author's entire termination interest.

        (3) Termination of the grant may be effected at any time during
      a period of five years beginning at the end of fifty-six years
      from the date copyright was originally secured, or beginning on
      January 1, 1978, whichever is later.
        (4) The termination shall be effected by serving an advance
      notice in writing upon the grantee or the grantee's successor in
      title. In the case of a grant executed by a person or persons
      other than the author, the notice shall be signed by all of those
      entitled to terminate the grant under clause (1) of this
      subsection, or by their duly authorized agents. In the case of a
      grant executed by one or more of the authors of the work, the
      notice as to any one author's share shall be signed by that
      author or his or her duly authorized agent or, if that author is
      dead, by the number and proportion of the owners of his or her
      termination interest required under clauses (1) and (2) of this
      subsection, or by their duly authorized agents.
          (A) The notice shall state the effective date of the
        termination, which shall fall within the five-year period
        specified by clause (3) of this subsection, or, in the case of
        a termination under subsection (d), within the five-year period
        specified by subsection (d)(2), and the notice shall be served
        not less than two or more than ten years before that date. A
        copy of the notice shall be recorded in the Copyright Office
        before the effective date of termination, as a condition to its
        taking effect.
          (B) The notice shall comply, in form, content, and manner of
        service, with requirements that the Register of Copyrights
        shall prescribe by regulation.

        (5) Termination of the grant may be effected notwithstanding
      any agreement to the contrary, including an agreement to make a
      will or to make any future grant.
        (6) In the case of a grant executed by a person or persons
      other than the author, all rights under this title that were
      covered by the terminated grant revert, upon the effective date
      of termination, to all of those entitled to terminate the grant
      under clause (1) of this subsection. In the case of a grant
      executed by one or more of the authors of the work, all of a
      particular author's rights under this title that were covered by
      the terminated grant revert, upon the effective date of
      termination, to that author or, if that author is dead, to the
      persons owning his or her termination interest under clause (2)
      of this subsection, including those owners who did not join in
      signing the notice of termination under clause (4) of this
      subsection. In all cases the reversion of rights is subject to
      the following limitations:
          (A) A derivative work prepared under authority of the grant
        before its termination may continue to be utilized under the
        terms of the grant after its termination, but this privilege
        does not extend to the preparation after the termination of
        other derivative works based upon the copyrighted work covered
        by the terminated grant.
          (B) The future rights that will revert upon termination of
        the grant become vested on the date the notice of termination
        has been served as provided by clause (4) of this subsection.
          (C) Where the author's rights revert to two or more persons
        under clause (2) of this subsection, they shall vest in those
        persons in the proportionate shares provided by that clause. In
        such a case, and subject to the provisions of subclause (D) of
        this clause, a further grant, or agreement to make a further
        grant, of a particular author's share with respect to any right
        covered by a terminated grant is valid only if it is signed by
        the same number and proportion of the owners, in whom the right
        has vested under this clause, as are required to terminate the
        grant under clause (2) of this subsection. Such further grant
        or agreement is effective with respect to all of the persons in
        whom the right it covers has vested under this subclause,
        including those who did not join in signing it. If any person
        dies after rights under a terminated grant have vested in him
        or her, that person's legal representatives, legatees, or heirs
        at law represent him or her for purposes of this subclause.
          (D) A further grant, or agreement to make a further grant, of
        any right covered by a terminated grant is valid only if it is
        made after the effective date of the termination. As an
        exception, however, an agreement for such a further grant may
        be made between the author or any of the persons provided by
        the first sentence of clause (6) of this subsection, or between
        the persons provided by subclause (C) of this clause, and the
        original grantee or such grantee's successor in title, after
        the notice of termination has been served as provided by clause
        (4) of this subsection.
          (E) Termination of a grant under this subsection affects only
        those rights covered by the grant that arise under this title,
        and in no way affects rights arising under any other Federal,
        State, or foreign laws.
          (F) Unless and until termination is effected under this
        subsection, the grant, if it does not provide otherwise,
        continues in effect for the remainder of the extended renewal
        term.

      (d) Termination Rights Provided in Subsection (c) Which Have
    Expired on or Before the Effective Date of the Sonny Bono Copyright
    Term Extension Act. - In the case of any copyright other than a
    work made for hire, subsisting in its renewal term on the effective
    date of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act for which the
    termination right provided in subsection (c) has expired by such
    date, where the author or owner of the termination right has not
    previously exercised such termination right, the exclusive or
    nonexclusive grant of a transfer or license of the renewal

      The arguments in favor of lengthening the duration of copyright
    apply to subsisting as well as future copyrights. The bill's basic
    approach is to increase the present 56-year term to 75 years in the
    case of copyrights subsisting in both their first and their renewal
    terms.
      Copyrights in Their First Term. Subsection (a) of section 304
    reenacts and preserves the renewal provision, now in Section 24 of
    the statute [section 24 of former title 17], for all of the works
    presently in their first 28-year term. A great many of the present
    expectancies in these cases are the subject of existing contracts,
    and it would be unfair and immensely confusing to cut off or alter
    these interests. Renewal registration will be required during the
    28th year of the copyright but the length of the renewal term will
    be increased from 28 to 47 years.
      Although the bill preserves the language of the present renewal
    provision without any change in substance, the Committee intends
    that the reference to a "posthumous work" in this section has the
    meaning given to it in Bartok v. Boosey & Hawkes, Inc., 523 F.2d
    941 (2d Cir. 1975) - one as to which no copyright assignment or
    other contract for exploitation of the work has occurred during an
    author's lifetime, rather than one which is simply first published
    after the author's death.
      Copyrights in Their Renewal Term. Renewed copyrights that are
    subsisting in their second term at any time during the period
    between December 31, 1976, and December 31, 1977, inclusive, would
    be extended under section 304(b) to run for a total of 75 years.
    This provision would add another 19 years to the duration of any
    renewed copyright whose second term started during the 28 years
    immediately preceding the effective date of the act (January 1,
    1978). In addition, it would extend by varying lesser amounts the
    duration of renewal copyrights already extended under Public Laws
    87-668, 89-142, 90-141, 90-416, 91-147, 91-555, 92-170, 92-566, and
    93-573, all of which would otherwise expire on December 31, 1976.
    The subsection would also extend the duration of renewal copyrights
    whose second 28-year term is scheduled to expire during 1977. In
    none of these cases, however, would the total terms of copyright
    for the work be longer than 75 years.
      Subsection (b) also covers the special situation of a subsisting
    first-term copyright that becomes eligible for renewal registration
    during the year before the act comes into effect. If a renewal
    registration is not made before the effective date [Jan. 1, 1978],
    the case is governed by the provisions of section 304(a) [subsec.
    (a) of this section]. If a renewal registration is made during the
    year before the new law takes effect, however, the copyright would
    be treated as if it were already subsisting in its second term and
    would be extended to the full period of 75 years without the need
    for further renewal.
      Termination of Grants Covering Extended Term. An issue underlying
    the 19-year extension of renewal terms under both subsections (a)
    and (b) of section 304 [subsecs. (a) and (b) of this section] is
    whether, in a case where their rights have already been
    transferred, the author or the dependents of the author should be
    given a chance to benefit from the extended term. The arguments for
    granting rights of termination are even more persuasive under
    section 304 than they are under section 203; the extended term
    represents a completely new property right, and there are strong
    reasons for giving the author, who is the fundamental beneficiary
    of copyright under the Constitution, an opportunity to share in it.
      Subsection (c) of section 304 is a close but not exact
    counterpart of section 203. In the case of either a first-term or
    renewal copyright already subsisting when the new statute becomes
    effective [Jan. 1, 1978], any grant of rights covering the renewal
    copyright in the work, executed before the effective date [Jan. 1,
    1978], may be terminated under conditions and limitations similar
    to those provided in section 203. Except for transfers and licenses
    covering renewal copyrights already extended under Public Laws 87-
    668, 89-142, 90-141, 90-416, 91-147, 91-555, 92-170, 92-566, and
    93-573, which would become subject to termination immediately upon
    the coming into effect of the revised law, the 5-year period during
    which termination could be made effective would start 56 years
    after copyright was originally secured.
      The bill distinguishes between the persons who can terminate a
    grant under section 203 and those entitled to terminate a grant
    covering an extended term under section 304. Instead of being
    limited to transfers and licenses executed by the author, the right
    of termination under section 304(c) also extends to grants executed
    by those beneficiaries of the author who can claim renewal under
    the present law: his or her widow or widower, children, executors,
    or next of kin.
      There is good reason for this difference. Under section 203, an
    author's widow or widower and children are given rights of
    termination if the author is dead, but these rights apply only to
    grants by the author, and any effort by a widow, widower, or child
    to transfer contingent future interests under a termination would
    be ineffective. In contrast, under the present renewal provisions,
    any statutory beneficiary of the author can make a valid transfer
    or license of future renewal rights, which is completely binding if
    the author is dead and the person who executed the grant turns out
    to be the proper renewal claimant. Because of this, a great many
    contingent transfers of future renewal rights have been obtained
    from widows, widowers, children, and next of kin, and a substantial
    number of these will be binding. After the present 28-year renewal
    period has ended, a statutory beneficiary who has signed a
    disadvantageous grant of this sort should have the opportunity to
    reclaim the extended term.
      As explained above in connection with section 203, the bill
    adopts the principle that, where a transfer or license by the
    author is involved, termination may be effected by a per stirpes
    majority of those entitled to terminate, and this principle also
    applies to the ownership of rights under a termination and to the
    making of further grants of reverted rights. In general, this
    principle has also been adopted with respect to the termination of
    rights under an extended renewal copyright in section 304, but with
    several differences made necessary by the differences between the
    legal status of transfers and licenses made after the effective
    date of the new law [Jan. 1, 1978] (governed by section 203) and
    that of grants of renewal rights made earlier and governed by
    section 304(c). The following are the most important distinctions
    between the termination rights under the two sections:
        1. Joint Authorship. - Under section 304, a grant of renewal
      rights executed by joint authors during the first term of
      copyright would be effective only as to those who were living at
      the time of renewal; where any of them are dead, their statutory
      beneficiaries are entitled to claim the renewal independently as
      a new estate. It would therefore be inappropriate to impose a
      requirement of majority action with respect to transfers executed
      by two or more joint authors.
        2. Grants Not Executed by Author. - Section 304(c) adopts the
      majority principle underlying the amendments of section 203
      [section 203 of this title] with respect to the termination
      rights of a dead author's widow or widower and children. There is
      much less reason, as a matter of policy, to apply this principle
      in the case of transfers and licenses of renewal rights executed
      under the present law by the author's widow, widower, children,
      executors, or next of kin, and the practical arguments against
      doing so are conclusive. It is not clear how the shares of a
      class of renewal beneficiaries are to be divided under the
      existing law, and greater difficulties would be presented if any
      attempt were made to apply the majority principle to further
      beneficiaries in cases where one or more of the renewal
      beneficiaries are dead. Therefore, where the grant was executed
      by a person or persons other than the author, termination can be
      effected only by the unanimous action of the survivors of those
      who executed it.
        3. Further Grants. - The reason against adopting a principle of
      majority action with respect to the right to terminate grants by
      joint authors and grants not executed by the author apply equally
      with respect to the right to make further grants under section
      304(c). The requirement for majority action in clause (6)(C) is
      therefore confined to cases where the rights under a grant by the
      author have reverted to his or her widow or widower, or children,
      or both. Where the extended term reverts to joint authors or to a
      class of renewal beneficiaries who have joined in executing a
      grant, their rights would be governed by the general rules of
      tenancy in common; each coowner would have an independent right
      to sell his share, or to use or license the work subject to an
      accounting.
      Nothing contained in this section or elsewhere in this
    legislation is intended to extend the duration of any license,
    transfer, or assignment made for a period of less than fifty-six
    years. If, for example, an agreement provides an earlier
    termination date or lesser duration, or if it allows the author the
    right of cancelling or terminating the agreement under certain
    circumstances, the duration is governed by the agreement. Likewise,
    nothing in this section or legislation is intended to change the
    existing state of the law of contracts concerning the circumstances
    in which an author may terminate a license, transfer or assignment.
      Section 304(c)(6)(E) provides that, unless and until termination
    is effected under this section, the grant, "if it does not provide
    otherwise," continues for the term of copyright. This section means
    that, if the agreement does not contain provisions specifying its
    term or duration, and the author has not terminated the agreement
    under this section, the agreement continues for the term of the
    copyright, subject to any right of termination under circumstances
    which may be specified therein. If, however, an agreement does
    contain provisions governing its duration - for example, a term of
    sixty years - and the author has not exercised his or her right of
    termination under the statute, the agreement will continue
    according to its terms - in this example, for only sixty years. The
    quoted language is not to be construed as requiring agreements to
    reserve the right of termination.

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      Under section 305, which has its counterpart in the laws of most
    foreign countries, the term of copyright protection for a work
    extends through December 31 of the year in which the term would
    otherwise have expired. This will make the duration of copyright
    much easier to compute, since it will be enough to determine the
    year, rather than the exact date, of the event from which the term
    is based.
      Section 305 applies only to "terms of copyright provided by
    sections 302 through 304," which are the sections dealing with
    duration of copyright. It therefore has no effect on the other time
    periods specified in the bill; and, since they do not involve
    "terms of copyright," the periods provided in section 304(c) with
    respect to termination of grants are not affected by section 305.
      The terminal date section would change the duration of subsisting
    copyrights under section 304 by extending the total terms of
    protection under subsections (a) and (b) to the end of the 75th
    year from the date copyright was secured. A copyright subsisting in
    its first term on the effective date of the act [Jan. 1, 1978]
    would run through December 31 of the 28th year and would then
    expire unless renewed. Since all copyright terms under the bill
    expire on December 31, and since section 304(a) requires that
    renewal be made "within one year prior to the expiration of the
    original term of copyright," the period for renewal registration in
    all cases will run from December 31 through December 31.
      A special situation arises with respect to subsisting copyrights
    whose first 28-year term expires during the first year after the
    act comes into effect. As already explained in connection with
    section 304(b), if a renewal registration for a copyright of this
    sort is made before the effective date [Jan. 1, 1978], the total
    term is extended to 75 years without the need for a further renewal
    registration. But, if renewal has not yet been made when the act
    becomes effective [Jan. 1, 1978], the period for renewal
    registration may in some cases be extended. If, as the bill
    provides, the act becomes effective on January 1, 1978, a copyright
    that was originally secured on September 1, 1950, could have been
    renewed by virtue of the present statute between September 1, 1977,
    and December 31, 1977; if not, it can still be renewed under
    section 304(a) of the new act between January 1, 1978, and December
    31, 1978.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 401. Notice of copyright: Visually perceptible copies

-STATUTE-
      (a) General Provisions. - Whenever a work protected under this
    title is published in the United States or elsewhere by authority
    of the copyright owner, a notice of copyright as provided by this
    section may be placed on publicly distributed copies from which the
    work can be visually perceived, either directly or with the aid of
    a machine or device.
      (b) Form of Notice. - If a notice appears on the copies, it shall
    consist of the following three elements:
        (1) the symbol  X  (the letter C in a circle), or the word
      "Copyright", or the abbreviation "Copr."; and
        (2) the year of first publication of the work; in the case of
      compilations, or derivative works incorporating previously
      published material, the year date of first publication of the
      compilation or derivative work is sufficient. The year date may
      be omitted where a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, with
      accompanying text matter, if any, is reproduced in or on greeting
      cards, postcards, stationery, jewelry, dolls, toys, or any useful
      articles; and
        (3) the name of the owner of copyright in the work, or an
      abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a generally
      known alternative designation of the owner.

      (c) Position of Notice. - The notice shall be affixed to the
    copies in such manner and location as to give reasonable notice of
    the claim of copyright. The Register of Copyrights shall prescribe
    by regulation, as examples, specific methods of affixation and
    positions of the notice on various types of works that will satisfy
    this requirement, but these specifications shall not be considered
    exhaustive.
      (d) Evidentiary Weight of Notice. - If a notice of copyright in
    the form and position specified by this section appears on the
    published copy or copies to which a defendant in a copyright
    infringement suit had access, then no weight shall be given to such
    a defendant's interposition of a defense based on innocent
    infringement in mitigation of actual or statutory damages, except
    as provided in the last sentence of section 504(c)(2).

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      A requirement that the public be given formal notice of every
    work in which copyright is claimed was a part of the first U.S.
    copyright statute enacted in 1790, and since 1802 our copyright
    laws have always provided that the published copies of copyrighted
    works must bear a specified notice as a condition of protection.
    Under the present law the copyright notice serves four principal
    functions:
        (1) It has the effect of placing in the public domain a
      substantial body of published material that no one is interested
      in copyrighting;
        (2) It informs the public as to whether a particular work is
      copyrighted;
        (3) It identifies the copyright owner; and
        (4) It shows the date of publication.
      Ranged against these values of a notice requirement are its
    burdens and unfairness to copyright owners. One of the strongest
    arguments for revision of the present statute has been the need to
    avoid the arbitrary and unjust forfeitures now resulting from
    unintentional or relatively unimportant omissions or errors in the
    copyright notice. It has been contended that the disadvantages of
    the notice requirement outweigh its values and that it should
    therefore be eliminated or substantially liberalized.
      The fundamental principle underlying the notice provisions of the
    bill is that the copyright notice has real values which should be
    preserved, and that this should be done by inducing use of notice
    without causing outright forfeiture for errors or omissions.
    Subject to certain safeguards for innocent infringers, protection
    would not be lost by the complete omission of copyright notice from
    large numbers of copies or from a whole edition, if registration
    for the work is made before or within 5 years after publication.
    Errors in the name or date in the notice could be corrected without
    forfeiture of copyright.
      Sections 401 and 402 set out the basic notice requirements of the
    bill, the former dealing with "copies from which the work can be
    visually perceived," and the latter covering "phonorecords" of a
    "sound recording." The notice requirements established by these
    parallel provisions apply only when copies or phonorecords of the
    work are "publicly distributed." No copyright notice would be
    required in connection with the public display of a copy by any
    means, including projectors, television, or cathode ray tubes
    connected with information storage and retrieval systems, or in
    connection with the public performance of a work by means of copies
    or phonorecords, whether in the presence of an audience or through
    television, radio, computer transmission, or any other process.
      It should be noted that, under the definition of "publication" in
    section 101, there would no longer be any basis for holding, as a
    few court decisions have done in the past, that the public display
    of a work of art under some conditions (e.g., without restriction
    against its reproduction) would constitute publication of the work.
    And, as indicated above, the public display of a work of art would
    not require that a copyright notice be placed on the copy
    displayed.
      Subsections (a) of both section 401 and section 402 require that
    a notice be used whenever the work "is published in the United
    States or elsewhere by authority of the copyright owner." The
    phrase "or elsewhere," which does not appear in the present law,
    makes the notice requirements applicable to copies or phonorecords
    distributed to the public anywhere in the world, regardless of
    where and when the work was first published. The values of notice
    are fully applicable to foreign editions of works copyrighted in
    the United States, especially with the increased flow of
    intellectual materials across national boundaries, and the gains in
    the use of notice on editions published abroad under the Universal
    Copyright Convention should not be wiped out. The consequences of
    omissions or mistakes with respect to the notice are far less
    serious under the bill than under the present law, and section
    405(a) makes doubly clear that a copyright owner may guard himself
    against errors or omissions by others if he makes use of the
    prescribed notice an express condition of his publishing licenses.
      Subsection (b) of section 401, which sets out the form of notice
    to appear on visually-perceptible copies, retains the basic
    elements of the notice under the present law: the word "Copyright",
    the abbreviation "Copr.", or the symbol " X "; the year of first
    publication; and the name of the copyright owner. The year of
    publication, which is still significant in computing the term and
    determining the status of a work, is required for all categories of
    copyrightable works. Clause (2) of subsection (b) makes clear that,
    in the case of a derivative work or compilation, it is not
    necessary to list the dates of publication of all preexisting
    material incorporated in the work; however, as noted below in
    connection with section 409, the application for registration
    covering a compilation or derivative work must identify "any
    preexisting work or works that it is based on or incorporates."
    Clause (3) establishes that a recognizable abbreviation or a
    generally known alternative designation may be used instead of the
    full name of the copyright owner.
      By providing simply that the notice "shall be affixed to the
    copies in such manner and location as to give reasonable notice of
    the claim of copyright," subsection (c) follows the flexible
    approach of the Universal Copyright Convention. The further
    provision empowering the Register of Copyrights to set forth in
    regulations a list of examples of "specific methods of affixation
    and positions of the notice on various types of works that will
    satisfy this requirement" will offer substantial guidance and avoid
    a good deal of uncertainty. A notice placed or affixed in
    accordance with the regulations would clearly meet the requirements
    but, since the Register's specifications are not to "be considered
    exhaustive," a notice placed or affixed in some other way might
    also comply with the law if it were found to "give reasonable
    notice" of the copyright claim.

      or an abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a
      generally known alternative designation of the owner; if the
      producer of the sound recording is named on the phonorecord
      labels or containers, and if no other name appears in conjunction
      with the notice, the producer's name shall be considered a part
      of the notice.

      (c) Position of Notice. - The notice shall be placed on the
    surface of the phonorecord, or on the phonorecord label or
    container, in such manner and location as to give reasonable notice
    of the claim of copyright.
      (d) Evidentiary Weight of Notice. - If a notice of copyright in
    the form and position specified by this section appears on the
    published phonorecord or phonorecords to which a defendant in a
    copyright infringement suit had access, then no weight shall be
    given to such a defendant's interposition of a defense based on
    innocent infringement in mitigation of actual or statutory damages,
    except as provided in the last sentence of section 504(c)(2).

      A special notice requirement, applicable only to the subject
    matter of sound recordings, is established by section 402. Since
    the bill protects sound recordings as separate works, independent
    of protection for any literary or musical works embodied in them,
    there would be a likelihood of confusion if the same notice
    requirements applied to sound recordings and to the works they
    incorporate. Like the present law, therefore, section 402 thus sets
    forth requirements for a notice to appear on the "phonorecords" of
    "sound recordings" that are different from the notice requirements
    established by section 401 for the "copies" of all other types of
    copyrightable works. Since "phonorecords" are not "copies," there
    is no need to place a section 401 notice on "phonorecords" to
    protect the literary or musical works embodied in the records.
      In general, the form of the notice specified by section 402(b)
    consists of the symbol "P"; the year of first publication of the
    sound recording; and the name of the copyright owner or an
    admissible variant. Where the record producer's name appears on the
    record label, album, sleeve, jacket, or other container, it will be
    considered a part of the notice if no other name appears in
    conjunction with it. Under subsection (c), the notice for a
    copyrighted sound recording may be affixed to the surface, label,
    or container of the phonorecord "in such manner and location as to
    give reasonable notice of the claim of copyright."
      There are at least three reasons for prescribing use of the
    symbol "P" rather than " X " in the notice to appear on
    phonorecords of sound recordings. Aside from the need to avoid
    confusion between claims to copyright in the sound recording and in
    the musical or literary work embodied in it, there is also a
    necessity for distinguishing between copyright claims in the sound
    recording and in the printed text or art work appearing on the
    record label, album cover, liner notes, et cetera. The symbol " X "
    has also been adopted as the international symbol for the
    protection of sound recordings by the "Phonograms Convention" (the
    Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against
    Unauthorized Duplication of Their Phonograms, done at Geneva
    October 29, 1971), to which the United States is a party.

      Section 403 is aimed at a publishing practice that, while
    technically justified under the present law, has been the object of
    considerable criticism. In cases where a Government work is
    published or republished commercially, it has frequently been the
    practice to add some "new matter" in the form of an introduction,
    editing, illustrations, etc., and to include a general copyright
    notice in the name of the commercial publisher. This in no way
    suggests to the public that the bulk of the work is uncopyrightable
    and therefore free for use.
      To make the notice meaningful rather than misleading, section 403
    requires that, when the copies or phonorecords consist
    "preponderantly of one or more works of the United States
    Government," the copyright notice (if any) identify those parts of
    the work in which copyright is claimed. A failure to meet this
    requirement would be treated as an omission of the notice, subject
    to the provisions of section 405.

    Sec. 404. Notice of copyright: Contributions to collective works

-STATUTE-
      (a) A separate contribution to a collective work may bear its own
    notice of copyright, as provided by sections 401 through 403.
    However, a single notice applicable to the collective work as a
    whole is sufficient to invoke the provisions of section 401(d) or
    402(d), as applicable with respect to the separate contributions it
    contains (not including advertisements inserted on behalf of
    persons other than the owner of copyright in the collective work),
    regardless of the ownership of copyright in the contributions and
    whether or not they have been previously published.
      (b) With respect to copies and phonorecords publicly distributed
    by authority of the copyright owner before the effective date of
    the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988, where the person
    named in a single notice applicable to a collective work as a whole
    is not the owner of copyright in a separate contribution that does
    not bear its own notice, the case is governed by the provisions of
    section 406(a).

      In conjunction with the provisions of section 201(c), section 404
    deals with a troublesome problem under the present law: the notice
    requirements applicable to contributions published in periodicals
    and other collective works. The basic approach of the section is
    threefold:
        (1) To permit but not require a separate contribution to bear
      its own notice;
        (2) To make a single notice, covering the collective work as a
      whole, sufficient to satisfy the notice requirement for the
      separate contributions it contains, even if they have been
      previously published or their ownership is different; and
        (3) To protect the interests of an innocent infringer of
      copyright in a contribution that does not bear its own notice,
      who has dealt in good faith with the person named in the notice
      covering the collective work as a whole.
      As a general rule, under this section, the rights in an
    individual contribution to a collective work would not be affected
    by the lack of a separate copyright notice, as long as the
    collective work as a whole bears a notice. One exception to this
    rule would apply to "advertisements inserted on behalf of persons
    other than the owner of copyright in the collective work."
    Collective works, notably newspapers and magazines, are major
    advertising media, and it is common for the same advertisement to
    be published in a number of different periodicals. The general
    copyright notice in a particular issue would not ordinarily protect
    the advertisements inserted in it, and relatively little
    advertising matter today is published with a separate copyright
    notice. The exception in section 404(a), under which separate
    notices would be required for most advertisements published in
    collective works, would impose no undue burdens on copyright owners
    and is justified by the special circumstances.
      Under section 404(b) a separate contribution that does not bear
    its own notice, and that is published in a collective work with a
    general notice containing the name of someone other than the
    copyright owner of the contribution, is treated as if it has been
    published with the wrong name in the notice. The case is governed
    by section 406(a), which means that an innocent infringer who in
    good faith took a license from the person named in the general
    notice would be shielded from liability to some extent.

    Sec. 405. Notice of copyright: Omission of notice on certain copies
      and phonorecords

-STATUTE-
      (a) Effect of Omission on Copyright. - With respect to copies and
    phonorecords publicly distributed by authority of the copyright
    owner before the effective date of the Berne Convention
    Implementation Act of 1988, the omission of the copyright notice
    described in sections 401 through 403 from copies or phonorecords
    publicly distributed by authority of the copyright owner does not
    invalidate the copyright in a work if - 
        (1) the notice has been omitted from no more than a relatively
      small number of copies or phonorecords distributed to the public;
      or
        (2) registration for the work has been made before or is made
      within five years after the publication without notice, and a
      reasonable effort is made to add notice to all copies or
      phonorecords that are distributed to the public in the United
      States after the omission has been discovered; or
        (3) the notice has been omitted in violation of an express
      requirement in writing that, as a condition of the copyright
      owner's authorization of the public distribution of copies or
      phonorecords, they bear the prescribed notice.

      (b) Effect of Omission on Innocent Infringers. - Any person who
    innocently infringes a copyright, in reliance upon an authorized
    copy or phonorecord from which the copyright notice has been
    omitted and which was publicly distributed by authority of the
    copyright owner before the effective date of the Berne Convention
    Implementation Act of 1988, incurs no liability for actual or
    statutory damages under section 504 for any infringing acts
    committed before receiving actual notice that registration for the
    work has been made under section 408, if such person proves that he
    or she was misled by the omission of notice. In a suit for
    infringement in such a case the court may allow or disallow
    recovery of any of the infringer's profits attributable to the
    infringement, and may enjoin the continuation of the infringing
    undertaking or may require, as a condition for permitting the
    continuation of the infringing undertaking, that the infringer pay
    the copyright owner a reasonable license fee in an amount and on
    terms fixed by the court.
      (c) Removal of Notice. - Protection under this title is not
    affected by the removal, destruction, or obliteration of the
    notice, without the authorization of the copyright owner, from any
    publicly distributed copies or phonorecords.

      Effect of Omission on Copyright Protection. The provisions of
    section 405(a) make clear that the notice requirements of sections
    401, 402, and 403 are not absolute and that, unlike the law now in
    effect, the outright omission of a copyright notice does not
    automatically forfeit protection and throw the work into the public
    domain. This not only represents a major change in the theoretical
    framework of American copyright law, but it also seems certain to
    have immediate practical consequences in a great many individual
    cases. Under the proposed law a work published without any
    copyright notice will still be subject to statutory protection for
    at least 5 years, whether the omission was partial or total,
    unintentional or deliberate.
      Under the general scheme of the bill, statutory copyright
    protection is secured automatically when a work is created, and is
    not lost when the work is published, even if the copyright notice
    is omitted entirely. Subsection (a) of section 405 provides that
    omission of notice, whether intentional or unintentional, does not
    invalidate the copyright if either of two conditions is met:
        (1) if "no more than a relatively small number" of copies or
      phonorecords have been publicly distributed without notice; or
        (2) if registration for the work has already been made, or is
      made within 5 years after the publication without notice, and a
      reasonable effort is made to add notice to copies or phonorecords
      publicly distributed in the United States after the omission is
      discovered.
      Thus, if notice is omitted from more than a "relatively small
    number" of copies or phonorecords, copyright is not lost
    immediately, but the work will go into the public domain if no
    effort is made to correct the error or if the work is not
    registered within 5 years.
      Section 405(a) takes a middle-ground approach in an effort to
    encourage use of a copyright notice without causing unfair and
    unjustifiable forfeitures on technical grounds. Clause (1) provides
    that, as long as the omission is from "no more than a relatively
    small number of copies or phonorecords," there is no effect upon
    the copyright owner's rights except in the case of an innocent
    infringement covered by section 405(b); there is no need for
    registration or for efforts to correct the error if this clause is
    applicable. The phrase "relatively small number" is intended to be
    less restrictive than the phrase "a particular copy or copies" now
    in section 21 of the present law [section 21 of former title 21].
      Under clause (2) of subsection (a), the first condition for
    curing an omission from a larger number of copies is that
    registration be made before the end of 5 years from the defective
    publication. This registration may have been made before the
    omission took place or before the work had been published in any
    form and, since the reasons for the omission have no bearing on the
    validity of copyright, there would be no need for the application
    to refer to them. Some time limit for registration is essential and
    the 5-year period is reasonable and consistent with the period
    provided in section 410(c).
      The second condition established by clause (2) is that the
    copyright owner make a "reasonable effort," after discovering his
    error, to add the notice to copies or phonorecords distributed
    thereafter. This condition is specifically limited to copies or
    phonorecords publicly distributed in the United States, since it
    would be burdensome and impractical to require an American
    copyright owner to police the activities of foreign licensees in
    this situation.
      The basic notice requirements set forth in sections 401(a) and
    402(a) are limited to cases where a work is published "by authority
    of the copyright owner" and, in prescribing the effect of omission
    of notice, section 405(a) refers only to omission "from copies or
    phonorecords publicly distributed by authority of the copyright
    owner." The intention behind this language is that, where the
    copyright owner authorized publication of the work, the notice
    requirements would not be met if copies or phonorecords are
    publicly distributed without a notice, even if he expected a notice
    to be used. However, if the copyright owner authorized publication
    only on the express condition that all copies or phonorecords bear
    a prescribed notice, the provisions of section 401 or 402 and of
    section 405 would not apply since the publication itself would not
    be authorized. This principle is stated directly in section
    405(a)(3).
      Effect of Omission on Innocent Infringers. In addition to the
    possibility that copyright protection will be forfeited under
    section 405(a)(2) if the notice is omitted, a second major
    inducement to use of the notice is found in subsection (b) of
    section 405. That provision, which limits the rights of a copyright
    owner against innocent infringers under certain circumstances,
    would be applicable whether the notice has been omitted from a
    large number or from a "relatively small number" of copies. The
    general postulates underlying the provision are that a person
    acting in good faith and with no reason to think otherwise should
    ordinarily be able to assume that a work is in the public domain if
    there is no notice on an authorized copy or phonorecord and that,
    if he relies on this assumption, he should be shielded from
    unreasonable liability.
      Under section 405(b) an innocent infringer who acts "in reliance
    upon an authorized copy or phonorecord from which the copyright
    notice has been omitted", and who proves that he was misled by the
    omission, is shielded from liability for actual or statutory
    damages with respect to "any infringing acts committed before
    receiving actual notice" of registration. Thus, where the
    infringement is completed before actual notice has been served - as
    would be the usual case with respect to relatively minor
    infringements by teachers, librarians, journalists, and the like -
    liability, if any, would be limited to the profits the infringer
    realized from the act of infringement. On the other hand, where the
    infringing enterprise is one running over a period of time, the
    copyright owner would be able to seek an injunction against
    continuation of the infringement, and to obtain full monetary
    recovery for all infringing acts committed after he had served
    notice of registration. Persons who undertake major enterprises of
    this sort should check the Copyright Office registration records
    before starting, even where copies have been published without
    notice.
      The purpose of the second sentence of subsection (b) is to give
    the courts broad discretion to balance the equities within the
    framework of section 405 [this section]. Where an infringer made
    profits from infringing acts committed innocently before receiving
    notice from the copyright owner, the court may allow or withhold
    their recovery in light of the circumstances. The court may enjoin
    an infringement or may permit its continuation on condition that
    the copyright owner be paid a reasonable license fee.
      Removal of Notice by Others. Subsection (c) of section 405
    involves the situation arising when, following an authorized
    publication with notice, someone further down the chain of commerce
    removes, destroys, or obliterates the notice. The courts dealing
    with this problem under the present law, especially in connection
    with copyright notices on the selvage of textile fabrics, have
    generally upheld the validity of a notice that was securely
    attached to the copies when they left the control of the copyright
    owner, even though removal of the notice at some later stage was
    likely. This conclusion is incorporated in subsection (c).

-HEAD-
    Sec. 406. Notice of copyright: Error in name or date on certain
      copies and phonorecords

-STATUTE-
      (a) Error in Name. - With respect to copies and phonorecords
    publicly distributed by authority of the copyright owner before the
    effective date of the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988,
    where the person named in the copyright notice on copies or
    phonorecords publicly distributed by authority of the copyright
    owner is not the owner of copyright, the validity and ownership of
    the copyright are not affected. In such a case, however, any person
    who innocently begins an undertaking that infringes the copyright
    has a complete defense to any action for such infringement if such
    person proves that he or she was misled by the notice and began the
    undertaking in good faith under a purported transfer or license
    from the person named therein, unless before the undertaking was
    begun - 
        (1) registration for the work had been made in the name of the
      owner of copyright; or
        (2) a document executed by the person named in the notice and
      showing the ownership of the copyright had been recorded.

    The person named in the notice is liable to account to the
    copyright owner for all receipts from transfers or licenses
    purportedly made under the copyright by the person named in the
    notice.
      (b) Error in Date. - When the year date in the notice on copies
    or phonorecords distributed before the effective date of the Berne
    Convention Implementation Act of 1988 by authority of the copyright
    owner is earlier than the year in which publication first occurred,
    any period computed from the year of first publication under
    section 302 is to be computed from the year in the notice. Where
    the year date is more than one year later than the year in which
    publication first occurred, the work is considered to have been
    published without any notice and is governed by the provisions of
    section 405.
      (c) Omission of Name or Date. - Where copies or phonorecords
    publicly distributed before the effective date of the Berne
    Convention Implementation Act of 1988 by authority of the copyright
    owner contain no name or no date that could reasonably be
    considered a part of the notice, the work is considered to have
    been published without any notice and is governed by the provisions
    of section 405 as in effect on the day before the effective date of
    the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988.

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      In addition to cases where notice has been omitted entirely, it
    is common under the present law for a copyright notice to be
    fatally defective because the name or date has been omitted or
    wrongly stated. Section 406 is intended to avoid technical
    forfeitures in these cases, while at the same time inducing use of
    the correct name and date and protecting users who rely on
    erroneous information.
      Error in Name. Section 406(a) begins with a statement that the
    use of the wrong name in the notice will not affect the validity or
    ownership of the copyright, and then deals with situations where
    someone acting innocently and in good faith infringes a copyright
    by relying on a purported transfer or license from the person
    erroneously named in the notice. In such a case the innocent
    infringer is given a complete defense unless a search of the
    Copyright Office records would have shown that the owner was
    someone other than the person named in the notice. Use of the wrong
    name in the notice is no defense if, at the time infringement was
    begun, registration had been made in the name of the true owner, or
    if "a document executed by the person named in the notice and
    showing the ownership of the copyright had been recorded."
      The situation dealt with in section 406(a) presupposes a
    contractual relation between the copyright owner and the person
    named in the notice. The copies or phonorecords bearing the
    defective notice have been "distributed by authority of the
    copyright owner" and, unless the publication can be considered
    unauthorized because of breach of an express condition in the
    contract or other reasons, the owner must be presumed to have
    acquiesced in the use of the wrong name. If the person named in the
    notice grants a license for use of the work in good faith or under
    a misapprehension, that person should not be liable as a copyright
    infringer, but the last sentence of section 406(a) would make the
    person named in the notice liable to account to the copyright owner
    for "all receipts, from transfers or licenses purportedly made
    under the copyright" by that person.
      Error in Date. The familiar problems of antedated and postdated
    notices are dealt with in subsection (b) of section 406. In the
    case of an antedated notice, where the year in the notice is
    earlier than the year of first publication, the bill adopts the
    established judicial principle that any statutory term measured
    from the year of publication will be computed from the year given
    in the notice. This provision would apply not only to the copyright
    terms of anonymous works, pseudonymous works, and works made for
    hire under section 302(c), but also to the presumptive periods set
    forth in section 302(e).
      As for postdated notices, subsection (b) provides that, where the
    year in the notice is more than one year later than the year of
    first publication the case is treated as if the notice had been
    omitted and is governed by section 405. Notices postdated by one
    year are quite common on works published near the end of a year,
    and it would be unnecessarily strict to equate cases of that sort
    with works published without notice of any sort.
      Omission of Name or Date. Section 406(c) provides that, if the
    copies or phonorecords "contain no name or no date that could
    reasonably be considered a part of the notice," the result is the
    same as if the notice had been omitted entirely, and section 405
    controls. Unlike the present law, the bill contains no provision
    requiring the elements of the copyright notice to "accompany" each
    other, and under section 406(c) a name or date that could
    reasonably be read with the other elements may satisfy the
    requirements even if somewhat separated from them. Direct
    contiguity or juxtaposition of the elements is no longer necessary;
    but if the elements are too widely separated for their relation to
    be apparent, or if uncertainty is created by the presence of other
    names or dates, the case would have to be treated as if the name or
    date, and hence the notice itself had been omitted altogether.

    TITLE 17 - COPYRIGHTS
    CHAPTER 4 - COPYRIGHT NOTICE, DEPOSIT, AND REGISTRATION

-HEAD-
    Sec. 407. Deposit of copies or phonorecords for Library of Congress

-STATUTE-
      (a) Except as provided by subsection (c), and subject to the
    provisions of subsection (e), the owner of copyright or of the
    exclusive right of publication in a work published in the United
    States shall deposit, within three months after the date of such
    publication - 
        (1) two complete copies of the best edition; or
        (2) if the work is a sound recording, two complete phonorecords
      of the best edition, together with any printed or other visually
      perceptible material published with such phonorecords.

    Neither the deposit requirements of this subsection nor the
    acquisition provisions of subsection (e) are conditions of
    copyright protection.
      (b) The required copies or phonorecords shall be deposited in the
    Copyright Office for the use or disposition of the Library of
    Congress. The Register of Copyrights shall, when requested by the
    depositor and upon payment of the fee prescribed by section 708,
    issue a receipt for the deposit.
      (c) The Register of Copyrights may by regulation exempt any
    categories of material from the deposit requirements of this
    section, or require deposit of only one copy or phonorecord with
    respect to any categories. Such regulations shall provide either
    for complete exemption from the deposit requirements of this
    section, or for alternative forms of deposit aimed at providing a
    satisfactory archival record of a work without imposing practical
    or financial hardships on the depositor, where the individual
    author is the owner of copyright in a pictorial, graphic, or
    sculptural work and (i) less than five copies of the work have been
    published, or (ii) the work has been published in a limited edition
    consisting of numbered copies, the monetary value of which would
    make the mandatory deposit of two copies of the best edition of the
    work burdensome, unfair, or unreasonable.
      (d) At any time after publication of a work as provided by
    subsection (a), the Register of Copyrights may make written demand
    for the required deposit on any of the persons obligated to make
    the deposit under subsection (a). Unless deposit is made within
    three months after the demand is received, the person or persons on
    whom the demand was made are liable - 
        (1) to a fine of not more than $250 for each work; and
        (2) to pay into a specially designated fund in the Library of
      Congress the total retail price of the copies or phonorecords
      demanded, or, if no retail price has been fixed, the reasonable
      cost to the Library of Congress of acquiring them; and
        (3) to pay a fine of $2,500, in addition to any fine or
      liability imposed under clauses (1) and (2), if such person
      willfully or repeatedly fails or refuses to comply with such a
      demand.

      (e) With respect to transmission programs that have been fixed
    and transmitted to the public in the United States but have not
    been published, the Register of Copyrights shall, after consulting
    with the Librarian of Congress and other interested organizations
    and officials, establish regulations governing the acquisition,
    through deposit or otherwise, of copies or phonorecords of such
    programs for the collections of the Library of Congress.
        (1) The Librarian of Congress shall be permitted, under the
      standards and conditions set forth in such regulations, to make a
      fixation of a transmission program directly from a transmission
      to the public, and to reproduce one copy or phonorecord from such
      fixation for archival purposes.
        (2) Such regulations shall also provide standards and
      procedures by which the Register of Copyrights may make written
      demand, upon the owner of the right of transmission in the United
      States, for the deposit of a copy or phonorecord of a specific
      transmission program. Such deposit may, at the option of the
      owner of the right of transmission in the United States, be
      accomplished by gift, by loan for purposes of reproduction, or by
      sale at a price not to exceed the cost of reproducing and
      supplying the copy or phonorecord. The regulations established
      under this clause shall provide reasonable periods of not less
      than three months for compliance with a demand, and shall allow
      for extensions of such periods and adjustments in the scope of
      the demand or the methods for fulfilling it, as reasonably
      warranted by the circumstances. Willful failure or refusal to
      comply with the conditions prescribed by such regulations shall
      subject the owner of the right of transmission in the United
      States to liability for an amount, not to exceed the cost of
      reproducing and supplying the copy or phonorecord in question, to
      be paid into a specially designated fund in the Library of
      Congress.
        (3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require
      the making or retention, for purposes of deposit, of any copy or
      phonorecord of an unpublished transmission program, the
      transmission of which occurs before the receipt of a specific
      written demand as provided by clause (2).
        (4) No activity undertaken in compliance with regulations
      prescribed under clauses (1) or (2) of this subsection shall
      result in liability if intended solely to assist in the
      acquisition of copies or phonorecords under this subsection.

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      The provisions of sections 407 through 411 of the bill mark
    another departure from the present law. Under the 1909 statute,
    deposit of copies for the collections of the Library of Congress
    and deposit of copies for purposes of copyright registration have
    been treated as the same thing. The bill's basic approach is to
    regard deposit and registration as separate though closely related:
    deposit of copies or phonorecords for the Library of Congress is
    mandatory, but exceptions can be made for material the Library
    neither needs nor wants; copyright registration is not generally
    mandatory, but is a condition of certain remedies for copyright
    infringement. Deposit for the Library of Congress can be, and in
    the bulk of cases undoubtedly will be, combined with copyright
    registration.
      The basic requirement of the deposit provision, section 407, is
    that within 3 months after a work has been published with notice of
    copyright in the United States, the "owner of copyright or of the
    exclusive right of publication" must deposit two copies or
    phonorecords of the work in the Copyright Office. The Register of
    Copyrights is authorized to exempt any category of material from
    the deposit requirements. Where the category is not exempted and
    deposit is not made, the Register may demand it; failure to comply
    would be penalized by a fine.
      Under the present law deposits for the Library of Congress must
    be combined with copyright registration, and failure to comply with
    a formal demand for deposit and registration results in complete
    loss of copyright. Under section 407 of the bill, the deposit
    requirements can be satisfied without ever making registration, and
    subsection (a) makes clear that deposit "is not a condition of
    copyright protection." A realistic fine, coupled with the increased
    inducements for voluntary registration and deposit under other
    sections of the bill, seems likely to produce a more effective
    deposit system than the present one. The bill's approach will also
    avoid the danger that, under a divisible copyright, one copyright
    owner's rights could be destroyed by another owner's failure to
    deposit.
      Although the basic deposit requirements are limited to works
    "published with notice of copyright in the United States," they
    would become applicable as soon as a work first published abroad is
    published in this country through the distribution of copies or
    phonorecords that are either imported or are part of an American
    edition. With respect to all types or works other than sound
    recordings, the basic obligation is to deposit "two complete copies
    of the best edition"; the term "best edition," as defined in
    section 101, makes clear that the Library of Congress is entitled
    to receive copies of phonorecords from the edition it believes best
    suits its needs regardless of the quantity or quality of other U.S.
    editions that may also have been published before the time of
    deposit. Once the deposit requirements for a particular work have
    been satisfied under section 407, however, the Library cannot claim
    deposit of future editions unless they represent newly
    copyrightable works under section 103.
      The deposit requirement for sound recordings includes "two
    complete phonorecords of the best edition" and any other visually-
    perceptible material published with the phonorecords. The
    reference here is to the text or pictorial matter appearing on
    record sleeves and album covers or embodied in separate leaflets or
    booklets included in a sleeve, album, or other container. The
    required deposit in the case of a sound recording would extend to
    the entire "package" and not just to the disk, tape, or other
    phonorecord included as part of it.
      Deposits under section 407, although made in the Copyright
    Office, are "for the use or disposition of the Library of
    Congress." Thus, the fundamental criteria governing regulations
    issued under section 407(c), which allows exemptions from the
    deposit requirements for certain categories of works, would be the
    needs and wants of the Library. The purpose of this provision is to
    make the deposit requirements as flexible as possible, so that
    there will be no obligation to make deposits where it serves no
    purpose, so that only one copy or phonorecord may be deposited
    where two are not needed, and so that reasonable adjustments can be
    made to meet practical needs in special cases. The regulations, in
    establishing special categories for these purposes, would
    necessarily balance the value of the copies or phonorecords to the
    collections of the Library of Congress against the burdens and
    costs to the copyright owner of providing them.
      The Committee adopted an amendment to subsection (c) of section
    407, aimed at meeting the concerns expressed by representatives of
    various artists' groups concerning the deposit of expensive art
    works and graphics published in limited editions. Under the present
    law, optional deposit of photographs is permitted for various
    classes of works, but not for fine prints, and this has resulted in
    many artists choosing to forfeit copyright protection rather than
    bear the expense of depositing "two copies of the best edition." To
    avoid this unfair result, the last sentence of subsection (c) would
    require the Register to issue regulations under which such works
    would either be exempted entirely from the mandatory deposit or
    would be subject to an appropriate alternative form of deposit.
      If, within three months after the Register of Copyrights has made
    a formal demand for deposit in accordance with section 407(d), the
    person on whom the demand was made has not complied, that person
    becomes liable to a fine up to $250 for each work, plus the "total
    retail price of the copies or phonorecords demanded." If no retail
    price has been fixed, clause (2) of subsection (d) establishes the
    additional amount as "the reasonable cost to the Library of
    Congress of acquiring them." Thus, where the copies or phonorecords
    are not available for sale through normal trade channels - as would
    be true of many motion picture films, video tapes, and computer
    tapes, for example - the item of cost to be included in the fine
    would be equal to the basic expense of duplicating the copies or
    phonorecords plus a reasonable amount representing what it would
    have cost the Library to obtain them under its normal acquisitions
    procedures, if they had been available.
      There have been cases under the present law in which the
    mandatory deposit provisions have been deliberately and repeatedly
    ignored, presumably on the assumption that the Library is unlikely
    to enforce them. In addition to the penalties provided in the
    current bill, the last clause of subsection (d) would add a fine of
    $2,500 for willful or repeated failure or refusal to deposit upon
    demand.
      The Committee also amended section 407 [this section] by adding a
    new subsection (e), with conforming amendments of sections 407(a)
    and 408(b). These amendments are intended to provide a basis for
    the Library of Congress to acquire, as a part of the copyright
    deposit system, copies or recordings of non-syndicated radio and
    television programs, without imposing any hardships on
    broadcasters. Under subsection (e) the Library is authorized to
    tape programs off the air in all cases and may "demand" that the
    broadcaster supply the Library with a copy or phonorecord of a
    particular program. However, this "demand" authority is extremely
    limited: (1) The broadcaster is not required to retain any
    recording of a program after it has been transmitted unless a
    demand has already been received; (2) the demand would cover only a
    particular program; "blanket" demands would not be permitted; (3)
    the broadcaster would have the option of supplying the demand by
    gift, by loan for purposes of reproduction, or by sale at cost; and
    (4) the penalty for willful failure or refusal to comply with a
    demand is limited to the cost of reproducing and supplying the copy
    or phonorecord in question.

    CHAPTER 4 - COPYRIGHT NOTICE, DEPOSIT, AND REGISTRATION

-HEAD-
    Sec. 408. Copyright registration in general

-STATUTE-
      (a) Registration Permissive. - At any time during the subsistence
    of the first term of copyright in any published or unpublished work
    in which the copyright was secured before January 1, 1978, and
    during the subsistence of any copyright secured on or after that
    date, the owner of copyright or of any exclusive right in the work
    may obtain registration of the copyright claim by delivering to the
    Copyright Office the deposit specified by this section, together
    with the application and fee specified by sections 409 and 708.
    Such registration is not a condition of copyright protection.
      (b) Deposit for Copyright Registration. - Except as provided by
    subsection (c), the material deposited for registration shall
    include - 
        (1) in the case of an unpublished work, one complete copy or
      phonorecord;
        (2) in the case of a published work, two complete copies or
      phonorecords of the best edition;
        (3) in the case of a work first published outside the United
      States, one complete copy or phonorecord as so published;
        (4) in the case of a contribution to a collective work, one
      complete copy or phonorecord of the best edition of the
      collective work.

    Copies or phonorecords deposited for the Library of Congress under
    section 407 may be used to satisfy the deposit provisions of this
    section, if they are accompanied by the prescribed application and
    fee, and by any additional identifying material that the Register
    may, by regulation, require. The Register shall also prescribe
    regulations establishing requirements under which copies or
    phonorecords acquired for the Library of Congress under subsection
    (e) of section 407, otherwise than by deposit, may be used to
    satisfy the deposit provisions of this section.
      (c) Administrative Classification and Optional Deposit. - 
        (1) The Register of Copyrights is authorized to specify by
      regulation the administrative classes into which works are to be
      placed for purposes of deposit and registration, and the nature
      of the copies or phonorecords to be deposited in the various
      classes specified. The regulations may require or permit, for
      particular classes, the deposit of identifying material instead
      of copies or phonorecords, the deposit of only one copy or
      phonorecord where two would normally be required, or a single
      registration for a group of related works. This administrative
      classification of works has no significance with respect to the
      subject matter of copyright or the exclusive rights provided by
      this title.
        (2) Without prejudice to the general authority provided under
      clause (1), the Register of Copyrights shall establish
      regulations specifically permitting a single registration for a
      group of works by the same individual author, all first published
      as contributions to periodicals, including newspapers, within a
      twelve-month period, on the basis of a single deposit,
      application, and registration fee, under the following
      conditions:
          (A) if the deposit consists of one copy of the entire issue
        of the periodical, or of the entire section in the case of a
        newspaper, in which each contribution was first published; and
          (B) if the application identifies each work separately,
        including the periodical containing it and its date of first
        publication.

        (3) As an alternative to separate renewal registrations under
      subsection (a) of section 304, a single renewal registration may
      be made for a group of works by the same individual author, all
      first published as contributions to periodicals, including
      newspapers, upon the filing of a single application and fee,
      under all of the following conditions:
          (A) the renewal claimant or claimants, and the basis of claim
        or claims under section 304(a), is the same for each of the
        works; and
          (B) the works were all copyrighted upon their first
        publication, either through separate copyright notice and
        registration or by virtue of a general copyright notice in the
        periodical issue as a whole; and
          (C) the renewal application and fee are received not more
        than twenty-eight or less than twenty-seven years after the
        thirty-first day of December of the calendar year in which all
        of the works were first published; and
          (D) the renewal application identifies each work separately,
        including the periodical containing it and its date of first
        publication.

      (d) Corrections and Amplifications. - The Register may also
    establish, by regulation, formal procedures for the filing of an
    application for supplementary registration, to correct an error in
    a copyright registration or to amplify the information given in a
    registration. Such application shall be accompanied by the fee
    provided by section 708, and shall clearly identify the
    registration to be corrected or amplified. The information
    contained in a supplementary registration augments but does not
    supersede that contained in the earlier registration.
      (e) Published Edition of Previously Registered Work. -
    Registration for the first published edition of a work previously
    registered in unpublished form may be made even though the work as
    published is substantially the same as the unpublished version.
      (f) Preregistration of Works Being Prepared for Commercial
    Distribution. - 
        (1) Rulemaking. - Not later than 180 days after the date of
      enactment of this subsection, the Register of Copyrights shall
      issue regulations to establish procedures for preregistration of
      a work that is being prepared for commercial distribution and has
      not been published.
        (2) Class of works. - The regulations established under
      paragraph (1) shall permit preregistration for any work that is
      in a class of works that the Register determines has had a
      history of infringement prior to authorized commercial
      distribution.
        (3) Application for registration. - Not later than 3 months
      after the first publication of a work preregistered under this
      subsection, the applicant shall submit to the Copyright Office - 
          (A) an application for registration of the work;
          (B) a deposit; and
          (C) the applicable fee.

        (4) Effect of untimely application. - An action under this
      chapter for infringement of a work preregistered under this
      subsection, in a case in which the infringement commenced no
      later than 2 months after the first publication of the work,
      shall be dismissed if the items described in paragraph (3) are
      not submitted to the Copyright Office in proper form within the
      earlier of - 
          (A) 3 months after the first publication of the work; or
          (B) 1 month after the copyright owner has learned of the
        infringement.

                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      Permissive Registration. Under section 408(a), registration of a
    claim to copyright in any work whether published or unpublished,
    can be made voluntarily by "the owner of copyright or of any
    exclusive right in the work" at any time during the copyright term.
    The claim may be registered in the Copyright Office by depositing
    the copies, phonorecords, or other material specified by subsection
    (b) and (c), together with an application and fee. Except where,
    under section 405(a), registration is made to preserve a copyright
    that would otherwise be invalidated because of omission of the
    notice, registration is not a condition of copyright protection.
      Deposit for Purpose of Copyright Registration. In general, and
    subject to various exceptions, the material to be deposited for
    copyright registration consists of one complete copy or phonorecord
    of an unpublished work, and two complete copies or phonorecords of
    the best edition in the case of a published work. Section 408(b)
    provides special deposit requirements in the case of a work first
    published abroad ("one complete copy or phonorecord as so
    published") and in the case of a contribution to a collective work
    ("one complete copy or phonorecord of the best edition of the
    collective work"). As a general rule the deposit of more than a
    tear sheet or similar fraction of a collective work is needed to
    identify the contribution properly and to show the form in which it
    was published. Where appropriate as in the case of collective works
    such as multivolume encyclopedias, multipart newspaper editions,
    and works that are rare or out of print, the regulations issued by
    the Register under section 408(c) can be expected to make
    exceptions or special provisions.
      With respect to works published in the United States, a single
    deposit could be used to satisfy the deposit requirements of
    section 407 and the registration requirements of section 408, if
    the application and fee for registration are submitted at the same
    time and are accompanied by "any additional identifying material"
    required by regulations. To serve this dual purpose the deposit and
    registration would have to be made simultaneously; if a deposit
    under section 407 had already been made, an additional deposit
    would be required under section 408. In addition, since deposit for
    the Library of Congress and registration of a claim to copyright
    serve essentially different functions, section 408(b) authorizes
    the Register of Copyrights to issue regulations under which deposit
    of additional material, needed for identification of the work in
    which copyright is claimed, could be required in certain cases.
      Administrative Classification. It is important that the statutory
    provisions setting forth the subject matter of copyright be kept
    entirely separate from any classification of copyrightable works
    for practical administrative purposes. Section 408(c)(1) thus
    leaves it to the Register of Copyrights to specify "the
    administrative classes into which works are to be placed for
    purposes of deposit and registration," and makes clear that this
    administrative classification "has no significance with respect to
    the subject matter of copyright or the exclusive rights provided by
    this title."
      Optional Deposit. Consistent with the principle of administrative
    flexibility underlying all of the deposit and registration
    provisions, subsection (c) of section 408 also gives the Register
    latitude in adjusting the type of material deposited to the needs
    of the registration system. The Register is authorized to issue
    regulations specifying "the nature of the copies of phonorecords to
    be deposited in the various classes" and, for particular classes,
    to require or permit deposit of identifying material rather than
    copies or phonorecords, deposit of one copy or phonorecord rather
    than two, or, in the case of a group of related works, a single
    rather than a number of separate registrations. Under this
    provision the Register could, where appropriate, permit deposit of
    phonorecords rather than notated copies of musical compositions,
    allow or require deposit of print-outs of computer programs under
    certain circumstances, or permit deposit of one volume of an
    encyclopedia for purposes of registration of a single contribution.
      Where the copies or phonorecords are bulky, unwieldy, easily
    broken, or otherwise impractical to file and retain as records
    identifying the work registered, the Register would be able to
    require or permit the substitute deposit of material that would
    better serve the purpose of identification. Cases of this sort
    might include, for example, billboard posters, toys and dolls,
    ceramics and glassware, costume jewelry, and a wide range of three-
    dimensional objects embodying copyrighted material. The Register's
    authority would also extend to rare or extremely valuable copies
    which would be burdensome or impossible to deposit. Deposit of one
    copy or phonorecord rather than two would probably be justifiable
    in the case of most motion pictures, and in any case where the
    Library of Congress has no need for the deposit and its only
    purpose is identification.
      The provision empowering the Register to allow a number of
    related works to be registered together as a group represents a
    needed and important liberalization of the law now in effect. At
    present the requirement for separate registrations where related
    works or parts of a work are published separately has created
    administrative problems and has resulted in unnecessary burdens and
    expenses on authors and other copyright owners. In a number of
    cases the technical necessity for separate applications and fees
    has caused copyright owners to forego copyright altogether.
    Examples of cases where these undesirable and unnecessary results
    could be avoided by allowing a single registration include the
    various editions or issues of a daily newspaper, a work published
    in serial installments, a group of related jewelry designs, a group
    of photographs by one photographer, a series of greeting cards
    related to each other in some way, or a group of poems by a single
    author.
      Single Registration. Section 408(c)(2) directs the Register of
    Copyrights to establish regulations permitting under certain
    conditions a single registration for a group of works by the same
    individual author, all first published as contributions to
    periodicals, including newspapers, within a twelve-month period, on
    the basis of a single deposit, application, and registration fee.
    It is required that each of the works as first published have a
    separate copyright notice, and that the name of the owner of
    copyright in the work, (or an abbreviation by which the name can be
    recognized, or a generally known alternative designation of the
    owner) is the same in each notice. It is further required that the
    deposit consist of one copy of the entire issue of the periodical,
    or of the entire section in the case of a newspaper, in which each
    contribution is first published. Finally, the application shall
    identify each work separately, including the periodical containing
    it and its date of first publication.
      Section 408(c)(3) provides under certain conditions an
    alternative to the separate renewal registrations of subsection
    (a). If the specified conditions are met, a single renewal
    registration may be made for a group of works by the same
    individual author, all first published as contributions to
    periodicals, including newspapers, upon the filing of a single
    application and fee. It is required that the renewal claimant or
    claimants, and the basis of claim or claims under section 304(a),
    is the same for each of the works; that the works were all
    copyrighted upon their first publication, either through separate
    copyright notice and registration or by virtue of a general
    copyright notice in the periodical issue as a whole; that the
    renewal application and fee are received not more than twenty-eight
    or less than twenty-seven years after December 31 of the calendar
    year in which all of the works were first published; and that the
    renewal application identifies each work separately, including the
    periodical containing it and its date of first publication.
      Corrections and Amplifications. Another unsatisfactory aspect of
    the present law is the lack of any provision for correcting or
    amplifying the information given in a completed registration.
    Subsection (d) of section 408 would remedy this by authorizing the
    Register to establish "formal procedures for the filing of an
    application for supplementary registration," in order to correct an
    error or amplify the information in a copyright registration. The
    "error" to be corrected under subsection (d) is an error by the
    applicant that the Copyright Office could not have been expected to
    note during its examination of the claim; where the error in a
    registration is the result of the Copyright Office's own mistake or
    oversight, the Office can make the correction on its own initiative
    and without recourse to the "supplementary registration" procedure.
      Under subsection (d), a supplementary registration is subject to
    payment of a separate fee and would be maintained as an independent
    record, separate and apart from the record of the earlier
    registration it is intended to supplement. However, it would be
    required to identify clearly "the registration to be corrected or
    amplified" so that the two registrations could be tied together by
    appropriate means in the Copyright Office records. The original
    registration would not be expunged or cancelled; as stated in the
    subsection: "The information contained in a supplementary
    registration augments but does not supersede that contained in the
    earlier registration."
      Published Edition of Previously Registered Work. The present
    statute requires that, where a work is registered in unpublished
    form, it must be registered again when it is published, whether or
    not the published edition contains any new copyrightable material.
    Under the bill there would be no need to make a second registration
    for the published edition unless it contains sufficient added
    material to be considered a "derivative work" or "compilation"
    under section 103.
      On the other hand, there will be a number of cases where the
    copyright owner, although not required to do so, would like to have
    registration made for the published edition of the work, especially
    since the owner will still be obliged to deposit copies or
    phonorecords of it in the Copyright Office under section 407. From
    the point of view of the public there are advantages in allowing
    the owner to do so, since registration for the published edition
    will put on record the facts about the work in the form in which it
    is actually distributed to the public. Accordingly, section 408(e),
    which is intended to accomplish this result, makes an exception to
    the general rule against allowing more than one registration for
    the same work.

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      The various clauses of section 409, which specify the information
    to be included in an application for copyright registration, are
    intended to give the Register of Copyrights authority to elicit all
    of the information needed to examine the application and to make a
    meaningful record of registration. The list of enumerated items was
    not exhaustive; under the last clause of the section the
    application may also include "any other information regarded by the
    Register of Copyrights as bearing upon the preparation or
    identification of the work or the existence, ownership, or duration
    of the copyright."
      Among the enumerated items there are several that are not now
    included in the Copyright Office's application forms, but will
    become significant under the life-plus-50 term and other provisions
    of the bill. Clause (5), reflecting the increased importance of the
    interrelationship between registration of copyright claims and
    recordation of transfers of ownership, requires a statement of how
    a claimant who is not the author acquired ownership of the
    copyright. Clause (9) requires that, "in the case of a compilation
    or derivative work" the application include "an identification of
    any preexisting work or works that it is based on or incorporates,
    and a brief, general statement of the additional material covered
    by the copyright claim being registered." It is intended that,
    under this requirement, the application covering a collection such
    as a song-book or hymnal would clearly reveal any works in the
    collection that are in the public domain, and the copyright status
    of all other previously-published compositions. This information
    will be readily available in the Copyright Office.
      The catch-all clause at the end of the section will enable the
    Register to obtain more specialized information, such as that
    bearing on whether the work contains material that is a "work of
    the United States Government." In the case of works subject to the
    manufacturing requirement, the application must also include
    information about the manufacture of the copies.

                                AMENDMENTS                            
      2010 - Par. (9) to (11). Pub. L. 111-295 inserted "and" after
    semicolon at end of par. (9), redesignated par. (11) as (10), and
    struck out former par. (10) which read as follows: "in the case of
    a published work containing material of which copies are required
    by section 601 to be manufactured in the United States, the names
    of the persons or organizations who performed the processes
    specified by subsection (c) of section 601 with respect to that
    material, and the places where those processes were performed;
    and".
      1992 - Pub. L. 102-307 inserted at end "If an application is
    submitted for the renewed and extended term provided for in section
    304(a)(3)(A) and an original term registration has not been made,
    the Register may request information with respect to the existence,
    ownership, or duration of the copyright for the original term."

-STATUTE-
      (a) When, after examination, the Register of Copyrights
    determines that, in accordance with the provisions of this title,
    the material deposited constitutes copyrightable subject matter and
    that the other legal and formal requirements of this title have
    been met, the Register shall register the claim and issue to the
    applicant a certificate of registration under the seal of the
    Copyright Office. The certificate shall contain the information
    given in the application, together with the number and effective
    date of the registration.
      (b) In any case in which the Register of Copyrights determines
    that, in accordance with the provisions of this title, the material
    deposited does not constitute copyrightable subject matter or that
    the claim is invalid for any other reason, the Register shall
    refuse registration and shall notify the applicant in writing of
    the reasons for such refusal.
      (c) In any judicial proceedings the certificate of a registration
    made before or within five years after first publication of the
    work shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the
    copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate. The
    evidentiary weight to be accorded the certificate of a registration
    made thereafter shall be within the discretion of the court.
      (d) The effective date of a copyright registration is the day on
    which an application, deposit, and fee, which are later determined
    by the Register of Copyrights or by a court of competent
    jurisdiction to be acceptable for registration, have all been
    received in the Copyright Office.

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      The first two subsections of section 410 set forth the two basic
    duties of the Register of Copyrights with respect to copyright
    registration: (1) to register the claim and issue a certificate if
    the Register determines that "the material deposited constitutes
    copyrightable subject matter and that the other legal and formal
    requirements of this title have been met," and (2) to refuse
    registration and notify the applicant if the Register determines
    that "the material deposited does not constitute copyrightable
    subject matter or that the claim is invalid for any other reason."
      Subsection (c) deals with the probative effect of a certificate
    of registration issued by the Register under subsection (a). Under
    its provisions, a certificate is required to be given prima facie
    weight in any judicial proceedings if the registration it covers
    was made "before or within five years after first publication of
    the work"; thereafter the court is given discretion to decide what
    evidentiary weight the certificate should be accorded. This five-
    year period is based on a recognition that the longer the lapse of
    time between publication and registration the less likely to be
    reliable are the facts stated in the certificate.
      Under section 410(c), a certificate is to "constitute prima facie
    evidence of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated
    in the certificate." The principle that a certificate represents
    prima facie evidence of copyright validity has been established in
    a long line of court decisions, and it is a sound one. It is true
    that, unlike a patent claim, a claim to copyright is not examined
    for basic validity before a certificate is issued. On the other
    hand, endowing a copyright claimant who has obtained a certificate
    with a rebuttable presumption of the validity of the copyright does
    not deprive the defendant in an infringement suit of any rights, it
    merely orders the burdens of proof. The plaintiff should not
    ordinarily be forced in the first instance to prove all of the
    multitude of facts that underline the validity of the copyright
    unless the defendant, by effectively challenging them, shifts the
    burden of doing so to the plaintiff.
      Section 410(d), which is in accord with the present practice of
    the Copyright Office, makes the effective date of registration the
    day when an application, deposit, and fee "which are later
    determined by the Register of Copyrights or by a court of competent
    jurisdiction to be acceptable for registration" have all been
    received. Where the three necessary elements are received at
    different times the date of receipt of the last of them is
    controlling, regardless of when the Copyright Office acts on the
    claim. The provision not only takes account of the inevitable
    timelag between receipt of the application and other material and
    the issuance of the certificate, but it also recognizes the
    possibility that a court might later find the Register wrong in
    refusing registration.

    REGISTRATION OF CLAIMS TO COPYRIGHTS AND RECORDATION OF ASSIGNMENTS
     OF COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS UNDER PREDECESSOR PROVISIONS
      Section 109 of Pub. L. 94-553 provided that: "The registration of
    claims to copyright for which the required deposit, application,
    and fee were received in the Copyright Office before January 1,
    1978, and the recordation of assignments of copyright or other
    instruments received in the Copyright Office before January 1,
    1978, shall be made in accordance with title 17 as it existed on
    December 31, 1977."

-HEAD-
    Sec. 411. Registration and civil infringement actions

-STATUTE-
      (a) Except for an action brought for a violation of the rights of
    the author under section 106A(a), and subject to the provisions of
    subsection (b),(!1) no civil action for infringement of the
    copyright in any United States work shall be instituted until
    preregistration or registration of the copyright claim has been
    made in accordance with this title. In any case, however, where the
    deposit, application, and fee required for registration have been
    delivered to the Copyright Office in proper form and registration
    has been refused, the applicant is entitled to institute a civil
    action for infringement if notice thereof, with a copy of the
    complaint, is served on the Register of Copyrights. The Register
    may, at his or her option, become a party to the action with
    respect to the issue of registrability of the copyright claim by
    entering an appearance within sixty days after such service, but
    the Register's failure to become a party shall not deprive the
    court of jurisdiction to determine that issue.

      (b)(1) A certificate of registration satisfies the requirements
    of this section and section 412, regardless of whether the
    certificate contains any inaccurate information, unless - 
        (A) the inaccurate information was included on the application
      for copyright registration with knowledge that it was inaccurate;
      and
        (B) the inaccuracy of the information, if known, would have
      caused the Register of Copyrights to refuse registration.

      (2) In any case in which inaccurate information described under
    paragraph (1) is alleged, the court shall request the Register of
    Copyrights to advise the court whether the inaccurate information,
    if known, would have caused the Register of Copyrights to refuse
    registration.
      (3) Nothing in this subsection shall affect any rights,
    obligations, or requirements of a person related to information
    contained in a registration certificate, except for the institution
    of and remedies in infringement actions under this section and
    section 412.
      (c) In the case of a work consisting of sounds, images, or both,
    the first fixation of which is made simultaneously with its
    transmission, the copyright owner may, either before or after such
    fixation takes place, institute an action for infringement under
    section 501, fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502
    through 505 and section 510, if, in accordance with requirements
    that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation, the
    copyright owner - 
        (1) serves notice upon the infringer, not less than 48 hours
      before such fixation, identifying the work and the specific time
      and source of its first transmission, and declaring an intention
      to secure copyright in the work; and
        (2) makes registration for the work, if required by subsection
      (a), within three months after its first transmission.

      The first sentence of section 411(a) restates the present
    statutory requirement that registration must be made before a suit
    for copyright infringement is instituted. Under the bill, as under
    the law now in effect, a copyright owner who has not registered his
    claim can have a valid cause of action against someone who has
    infringed his copyright, but he cannot enforce his rights in the
    courts until he has made registration.
      The second and third sentences of section 411(a) would alter the
    present law as interpreted in Vacheron & Constantin-Le Coultre
    Watches, Inc. v. Benrus Watch Co., 260 F.2d 637 (2d Cir. 1958).
    That case requires an applicant, who has sought registration and
    has been refused, to bring an action against the Register of
    Copyrights to compel the issuance of a certificate, before suit can
    be brought against an infringer. Under section 411, a rejected
    claimant who has properly applied for registration may maintain an
    infringement suit if notice of it is served on the Register of
    Copyrights. The Register is authorized, though not required, to
    enter the suit within 60 days; the Register would be a party on the
    issue of registrability only, and a failure by the Register to join
    the action would "not deprive the court of jurisdiction to
    determine that issue."
      Section 411(b) is intended to deal with the special situation
    presented by works that are being transmitted "live" at the same
    time they are being fixed in tangible form for the first time.
    Under certain circumstances, where the infringer has been given
    advance notice, an injunction could be obtained to prevent the
    unauthorized use of the material included in the "live"
    transmission.

      infringement

-STATUTE-
      In any action under this title, other than an action brought for
    a violation of the rights of the author under section 106A(a), an
    action for infringement of the copyright of a work that has been
    preregistered under section 408(f) before the commencement of the
    infringement and that has an effective date of registration not
    later than the earlier of 3 months after the first publication of
    the work or 1 month after the copyright owner has learned of the
    infringement, or an action instituted under section 411(c), no
    award of statutory damages or of attorney's fees, as provided by
    sections 504 and 505, shall be made for - 
        (1) any infringement of copyright in an unpublished work
      commenced before the effective date of its registration; or
        (2) any infringement of copyright commenced after first
      publication of the work and before the effective date of its
      registration, unless such registration is made within three
      months after the first publication of the work.

      The need for section 412 arises from two basic changes the bill
    will make in the present law.
        (1) Copyright registration for published works, which is useful
      and important to users and the public at large, would no longer
      be compulsory, and should therefore be induced in some practical
      way.
        (2) The great body of unpublished works now protected at common
      law would automatically be brought under copyright and given
      statutory protection. The remedies for infringement presently
      available at common law should continue to apply to these works
      under the statute, but they should not be given special statutory
      remedies unless the owner has, by registration, made a public
      record of his copyright claim.
      Under the general scheme of the bill, a copyright owner whose
    work has been infringed before registration would be entitled to
    the remedies ordinarily available in infringement cases: an
    injunction on terms the court considers fair, and his actual
    damages plus any applicable profits not used as a measure of
    damages. However, section 412 would deny any award of the special
    or "extraordinary" remedies of statutory damages or attorney's fees
    where infringement of copyright in an unpublished work began before
    registration or where, in the case of a published work,
    infringement commenced after publication and before registration
    (unless registration has been made within a grace period of three
    months after publication). These provisions would be applicable to
    works of foreign and domestic origin alike.
      In providing that statutory damages and attorney's fees are not
    recoverable for infringement of unpublished, unregistered works,
    clause (1) of section 412 in no way narrows the remedies available
    under the present law. With respect to published works, clause (2)
    would generally deny an award of those two special remedies where
    infringement takes place before registration. As an exception,
    however, the clause provides a grace period of three months after
    publication during which registration can be made without loss of
    remedies; full remedies could be recovered for any infringement
    begun during the three months after publication if registration is
    made before that period has ended. This exception is needed to take
    care of newsworthy or suddenly popular works which may be infringed
    almost as soon as they are published, before the copyright owner
    has had a reasonable opportunity to register his claim.

                                AMENDMENTS

    the copyright of a work that has been preregistered under section
    408(f) before the commencement of the infringement and that has an
    effective date of registration not later than the earlier of 3
    months after the first publication of the work or 1 month after the
    copyright owner has learned of the infringement," after "section
    106A(a)" in introductory provisions.
      1990 - Pub. L. 101-650 inserted "an action brought for a
    violation of the rights of the author under section 106A(a) or"
    after "other than" in introductory provisions.

    CHAPTER 5 - COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AND REMEDIES

-HEAD-
    Sec. 501. Infringement of copyright

-STATUTE-
      (a) Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the
    copyright owner as provided by sections 106 through 122 or of the
    author as provided in section 106A(a), or who imports copies or
    phonorecords into the United States in violation of section 602, is
    an infringer of the copyright or right of the author, as the case
    may be. For purposes of this chapter (other than section 506), any
    reference to copyright shall be deemed to include the rights
    conferred by section 106A(a). As used in this subsection, the term
    "anyone" includes any State, any instrumentality of a State, and
    any officer or employee of a State or instrumentality of a State
    acting in his or her official capacity. Any State, and any such
    instrumentality, officer, or employee, shall be subject to the
    provisions of this title in the same manner and to the same extent
    as any nongovernmental entity.
      (b) The legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under a
    copyright is entitled, subject to the requirements of section 411,
    to institute an action for any infringement of that particular
    right committed while he or she is the owner of it. The court may
    require such owner to serve written notice of the action with a
    copy of the complaint upon any person shown, by the records of the
    Copyright Office or otherwise, to have or claim an interest in the
    copyright, and shall require that such notice be served upon any
    person whose interest is likely to be affected by a decision in the
    case. The court may require the joinder, and shall permit the
    intervention, of any person having or claiming an interest in the
    copyright.
      (c) For any secondary transmission by a cable system that
    embodies a performance or a display of a work which is actionable
    as an act of infringement under subsection (c) of section 111, a
    television broadcast station holding a copyright or other license
    to transmit or perform the same version of that work shall, for
    purposes of subsection (b) of this section, be treated as a legal
    or beneficial owner if such secondary transmission occurs within
    the local service area of that television station.
      (d) For any secondary transmission by a cable system that is
    actionable as an act of infringement pursuant to section 111(c)(3),
    the following shall also have standing to sue: (i) the primary
    transmitter whose transmission has been altered by the cable
    system; and (ii) any broadcast station within whose local service
    area the secondary transmission occurs.
      (e) With respect to any secondary transmission that is made by a
    satellite carrier of a performance or display of a work embodied in
    a primary transmission and is actionable as an act of infringement
    under section 119(a)(5),(!1) a network station holding a copyright
    or other license to transmit or perform the same version of that
    work shall, for purposes of subsection (b) of this section, be
    treated as a legal or beneficial owner if such secondary
    transmission occurs within the local service area of that station.

      (f)(1) With respect to any secondary transmission that is made by
    a satellite carrier of a performance or display of a work embodied
    in a primary transmission and is actionable as an act of
    infringement under section 122, a television broadcast station
    holding a copyright or other license to transmit or perform the
    same version of that work shall, for purposes of subsection (b) of
    this section, be treated as a legal or beneficial owner if such
    secondary transmission occurs within the local market of that
    station.
      (2) A television broadcast station may file a civil action
    against any satellite carrier that has refused to carry television
    broadcast signals, as required under section 122(a)(2), to enforce
    that television broadcast station's rights under section 338(a) of
    the Communications Act of 1934.

-MISC1-
                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      The bill, unlike the present law, contains a general statement of
    what constitutes infringement of copyright. Section 501(a)
    identifies a copyright infringer as someone who "violates any of
    the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as provided by sections
    106 through 118" of the bill, or who imports copies or phonorecords
    in violation of section 602. Under the latter section an
    unauthorized importation of copies or phonorecords acquired abroad
    is an infringement of the exclusive right of distribution under
    certain circumstances.
      The principle of the divisibility of copyright ownership,
    established by section 201(d), carries with it the need in
    infringement actions to safeguard the rights of all copyright
    owners and to avoid a multiplicity of suits. Subsection (b) of
    section 501 enables the owner of a particular right to bring an
    infringement action in that owner's name alone, while at the same
    time insuring to the extent possible that the other owners whose
    rights may be affected are notified and given a chance to join the
    action.
      The first sentence of subsection (b) empowers the "legal or
    beneficial owner of an exclusive right" to bring suit for "any
    infringement of that particular right committed while he or she is
    the owner of it." A "beneficial owner" for this purpose would
    include, for example, an author who had parted with legal title to
    the copyright in exchange for percentage royalties based on sales
    or license fees.
      The second and third sentences of section 501(b), which
    supplement the provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
    [Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure], give the courts
    discretion to require the plaintiff to serve notice of the
    plaintiff's suit on "any person shown, by the records of the
    Copyright Office or otherwise, to have or claim an interest in the
    copyright"; where a person's interest "is likely to be affected by
    a decision in the case" a court order requiring service of notice
    is mandatory. As under the Federal rules, the court has discretion
    to require joinder of "any person having or claiming an interest in
    the copyright"; but, if any such person wishes to become a party,
    the court must permit that person's intervention.
      In addition to cases involving divisibility of ownership in the
    same version of a work, section 501(b) is intended to allow a court
    to permit or compel joinder of the owners of rights in works upon
    which a derivative work is based.
      Section 501 contains two provisions conferring standing to sue
    under the statue upon broadcast stations in specific situations
    involving secondary transmissions by cable systems. Under
    subsection (c), a local television broadcaster licensed to transmit
    a work can sue a cable system importing the same version of the
    work into the broadcaster's local service area in violation of
    section 111(c). Subsection (d) deals with cases arising under
    section 111(c)(3), the provision dealing with substitution or
    alteration by a cable system of commercials or other programming;
    in such cases standing to sue is also conferred on: (1) the primary
    transmitter whose transmission has been altered by the cable
    system, and (2) any broadcast stations within whose local service
    area the secondary transmission occurs. These provisions are linked
    to section 509, a new provision on remedies for alteration of
    programming by cable systems, discussed below.
      Vicarious Liability for Infringing Performances. The committee
    has considered and rejected an amendment to this section intended
    to exempt the proprietors of an establishment, such as a ballroom
    or night club, from liability for copyright infringement committed
    by an independent contractor, such as an orchestra leader. A well-
    established principle of copyright law is that a person who
    violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner is an
    infringer, including persons who can be considered related or
    vicarious infringers. To be held a related or vicarious infringer
    in the case of performing rights, a defendant must either actively
    operate or supervise the operation of the place wherein the
    performances occur, or control the content of the infringing
    program, and expect commercial gain from the operation and either
    direct or indirect benefit from the infringing performance. The
    committee has decided that no justification exists for changing
    existing law, and causing a significant erosion of the public
    performance right.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Any court having jurisdiction of a civil action arising under
    this title may, subject to the provisions of section 1498 of title
    28, grant temporary and final injunctions on such terms as it may
    deem reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright.
      (b) Any such injunction may be served anywhere in the United
    States on the person enjoined; it shall be operative throughout the
    United States and shall be enforceable, by proceedings in contempt
    or otherwise, by any United States court having jurisdiction of
    that person. The clerk of the court granting the injunction shall,
    when requested by any other court in which enforcement of the
    injunction is sought, transmit promptly to the other court a
    certified copy of all the papers in the case on file in such
    clerk's office.

      Section 502(a) [subsec. (a) of this section] reasserts the
    discretionary power of courts to grant injunctions and restraining
    orders, whether "preliminary," "temporary," "interlocutory,"
    "permanent," or "final," to prevent or stop infringements of
    copyright. This power is made subject to the provisions of section
    1498 of title 28 dealing with infringement actions against the
    United States. The latter reference in section 502(a) makes it
    clear that the bill would not permit the granting of an injunction
    against an infringement for which the Federal Government is liable
    under section 1498.
      Under subsection (b), which is the counterpart of provisions in
    sections 112 and 113 of the present statute [sections 112 and 113
    of former title 17], a copyright owner who has obtained an
    injunction in one State will be able to enforce it against a
    defendant located anywhere else in the United States.

    Sec. 503. Remedies for infringement: Impounding and disposition of
      infringing articles

-STATUTE-
      (a)(1) At any time while an action under this title is pending,
    the court may order the impounding, on such terms as it may deem
    reasonable - 
        (A) of all copies or phonorecords claimed to have been made or
      used in violation of the exclusive right of the copyright owner;
        (B) of all plates, molds, matrices, masters, tapes, film
      negatives, or other articles by means of which such copies or
      phonorecords may be reproduced; and
        (C) of records documenting the manufacture, sale, or receipt of
      things involved in any such violation, provided that any records
      seized under this subparagraph shall be taken into the custody of
      the court.

      (2) For impoundments of records ordered under paragraph (1)(C),
    the court shall enter an appropriate protective order with respect
    to discovery and use of any records or information that has been
    impounded. The protective order shall provide for appropriate
    procedures to ensure that confidential, private, proprietary, or
    privileged information contained in such records is not improperly
    disclosed or used.
      (3) The relevant provisions of paragraphs (2) through (11) of
    section 34(d) of the Trademark Act (15 U.S.C. 1116(d)(2) through
    (11)) shall extend to any impoundment of records ordered under
    paragraph (1)(C) that is based upon an ex parte application,
    notwithstanding the provisions of rule 65 of the Federal Rules of
    Civil Procedure. Any references in paragraphs (2) through (11) of
    section 34(d) of the Trademark Act to section 32 of such Act shall
    be read as references to section 501 of this title, and references
    to use of a counterfeit mark in connection with the sale, offering
    for sale, or distribution of goods or services shall be read as
    references to infringement of a copyright.
      (b) As part of a final judgment or decree, the court may order
    the destruction or other reasonable disposition of all copies or
    phonorecords found to have been made or used in violation of the
    copyright owner's exclusive rights, and of all plates, molds,
    matrices, masters, tapes, film negatives, or other articles by
    means of which such copies or phonorecords may be reproduced.

      The two subsections of section 503 deal respectively with the
    courts' power to impound allegedly infringing articles during the
    time an action is pending, and to order the destruction or other
    disposition of articles found to be infringing. In both cases the
    articles affected include "all copies or phonorecords" which are
    claimed or found "to have been made or used in violation of the
    copyright owner's exclusive rights," and also "all plates, molds,
    matrices, masters, tapes, film negatives, or other articles by
    means of which such copies of phonorecords may be reproduced." The
    alternative phrase "made or used" in both subsections enables a
    court to deal as it sees fit with articles which, though reproduced
    and acquired lawfully, have been used for infringing purposes such
    as rentals, performances, and displays.
      Articles may be impounded under subsection (a) "at any time while
    an action under this title is pending," thus permitting seizures of
    articles alleged to be infringing as soon as suit has been filed
    and without waiting for an injunction. The same subsection empowers
    the court to order impounding "on such terms as it may deem
    reasonable." The present Supreme Court rules with respect to
    seizure and impounding were issued even though there is no specific
    provision authorizing them in the copyright statute, and there
    appears no need for including a special provision on the point in
    the bill.
      Under section 101(d) of the present statute [section 101(d) of
    former title 17], articles found to be infringing may be ordered to
    be delivered up for destruction. Section 503(b) of the bill would
    make this provision more flexible by giving the court discretion to
    order "destruction or other reasonable disposition" of the articles
    found to be infringing. Thus, as part of its final judgment or
    decree, the court could order the infringing articles sold,
    delivered to the plaintiff, or disposed of in some other way that
    would avoid needless waste and best serve the ends of justice.

    TITLE 17 - COPYRIGHTS
    CHAPTER 5 - COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AND REMEDIES

-HEAD-
    Sec. 504. Remedies for infringement: Damages and profits

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - Except as otherwise provided by this title, an
    infringer of copyright is liable for either - 
        (1) the copyright owner's actual damages and any additional
      profits of the infringer, as provided by subsection (b); or
        (2) statutory damages, as provided by subsection (c).

      (b) Actual Damages and Profits. - The copyright owner is entitled
    to recover the actual damages suffered by him or her as a result of
    the infringement, and any profits of the infringer that are
    attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account in
    computing the actual damages. In establishing the infringer's
    profits, the copyright owner is required to present proof only of
    the infringer's gross revenue, and the infringer is required to
    prove his or her deductible expenses and the elements of profit
    attributable to factors other than the copyrighted work.
      (c) Statutory Damages. - 
        (1) Except as provided by clause (2) of this subsection, the
      copyright owner may elect, at any time before final judgment is
      rendered, to recover, instead of actual damages and profits, an
      award of statutory damages for all infringements involved in the
      action, with respect to any one work, for which any one infringer
      is liable individually, or for which any two or more infringers
      are liable jointly and severally, in a sum of not less than $750
      or more than $30,000 as the court considers just. For the
      purposes of this subsection, all the parts of a compilation or
      derivative work constitute one work.
        (2) In a case where the copyright owner sustains the burden of
      proving, and the court finds, that infringement was committed
      willfully, the court in its discretion may increase the award of
      statutory damages to a sum of not more than $150,000. In a case
      where the infringer sustains the burden of proving, and the court
      finds, that such infringer was not aware and had no reason to
      believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of
      copyright, the court in its discretion may reduce the award of
      statutory damages to a sum of not less than $200. The court shall
      remit statutory damages in any case where an infringer believed
      and had reasonable grounds for believing that his or her use of
      the copyrighted work was a fair use under section 107, if the
      infringer was: (i) an employee or agent of a nonprofit
      educational institution, library, or archives acting within the
      scope of his or her employment who, or such institution, library,
      or archives itself, which infringed by reproducing the work in
      copies or phonorecords; or (ii) a public broadcasting entity
      which or a person who, as a regular part of the nonprofit
      activities of a public broadcasting entity (as defined in section
      118(f)) infringed by performing a published nondramatic literary
      work or by reproducing a transmission program embodying a
      performance of such a work.
        (3)(A) In a case of infringement, it shall be a rebuttable
      presumption that the infringement was committed willfully for
      purposes of determining relief if the violator, or a person
      acting in concert with the violator, knowingly provided or
      knowingly caused to be provided materially false contact
      information to a domain name registrar, domain name registry, or
      other domain name registration authority in registering,
      maintaining, or renewing a domain name used in connection with
      the infringement.
        (B) Nothing in this paragraph limits what may be considered
      willful infringement under this subsection.
        (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term "domain name" has
      the meaning given that term in section 45 of the Act entitled "An
      Act to provide for the registration and protection of trademarks
      used in commerce, to carry out the provisions of certain
      international conventions, and for other purposes" approved July
      5, 1946 (commonly referred to as the "Trademark Act of 1946"; 15
      U.S.C. 1127).

      (d) Additional Damages in Certain Cases. - In any case in which
    the court finds that a defendant proprietor of an establishment who
    claims as a defense that its activities were exempt under section
    110(5) did not have reasonable grounds to believe that its use of a
    copyrighted work was exempt under such section, the plaintiff shall
    be entitled to, in addition to any award of damages under this
    section, an additional award of two times the amount of the license
    fee that the proprietor of the establishment concerned should have
    paid the plaintiff for such use during the preceding period of up
    to 3 years.

-MISC1-
                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      In General. A cornerstone of the remedies sections and of the
    bill as a whole is section 504, the provision dealing with recovery
    of actual damages, profits, and statutory damages. The two basic
    aims of this section are reciprocal and correlative: (1) to give
    the courts specific unambiguous directions concerning monetary
    awards, thus avoiding the confusion and uncertainty that have
    marked the present law on the subject, and, at the same time, (2)
    to provide the courts with reasonable latitude to adjust recovery
    to the circumstances of the case, thus avoiding some of the
    artificial or overly technical awards resulting from the language
    of the existing statute.
      Subsection (a) lays the groundwork for the more detailed
    provisions of the section by establishing the liability of a
    copyright infringer for either "the copyright owner's actual
    damages and any additional profits of the infringer," or statutory
    damages. Recovery of actual damages and profits under section
    504(b) or of statutory damages under section 504(c) is alternative
    and for the copyright owner to elect; as under the present law, the
    plaintiff in an infringement suit is not obliged to submit proof of
    damages and profits and may choose to rely on the provision for
    minimum statutory damages. However, there is nothing in section 504
    to prevent a court from taking account of evidence concerning
    actual damages and profits in making an award of statutory damages
    within the range set out in subsection (c).
      Actual Damages and Profits. In allowing the plaintiff to recover
    "the actual damages suffered by him or her as a result of the
    infringement," plus any of the infringer's profits "that are
    attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account in
    computing the actual damages," section 504(b) recognizes the
    different purposes served by awards of damages and profits. Damages
    are awarded to compensate the copyright owner for losses from the
    infringement, and profits are awarded to prevent the infringer from
    unfairly benefiting from a wrongful act. Where the defendant's
    profits are nothing more than a measure of the damages suffered by
    the copyright owner, it would be inappropriate to award damages and
    profits cumulatively, since in effect they amount to the same
    thing. However, in cases where the copyright owner has suffered
    damages not reflected in the infringer's profits, or where there
    have been profits attributable to the copyrighted work but not used
    as a measure of damages, subsection (b) authorizes the award of
    both.
      The language of the subsection makes clear that only those
    profits "attributable to the infringement" are recoverable; where
    some of the defendant's profits result from the infringement and
    other profits are caused by different factors, it will be necessary
    for the court to make an apportionment. However, the burden of
    proof is on the defendant in these cases; in establishing profits
    the plaintiff need prove only "the infringer's gross revenue," and
    the defendant must prove not only "his or her deductible expenses"
    but also "the element of profit attributable to factors other than
    the copyrighted work."
      Statutory Damages. Subsection (c) of section 504 makes clear that
    the plaintiff's election to recover statutory damages may take
    place at any time during the trial before the court has rendered
    its final judgment. The remainder of clause (1) of the subsection
    represents a statement of the general rates applicable to awards of
    statutory damages. Its principal provisions may be summarized as
    follows:
        1. As a general rule, where the plaintiff elects to recover
      statutory damages, the court is obliged to award between $250 and
      $10,000. It can exercise discretion in awarding an amount within
      that range but, unless one of the exceptions provided by clause
      (2) is applicable, it cannot make an award of less than $250 or
      of more than $10,000 if the copyright owner has chosen recovery
      under section 504(c).
        2. Although, as explained below, an award of minimum statutory
      damages may be multiplied if separate works and separately liable
      infringers are involved in the suit, a single award in the $250
      to $10,000 range is to be made "for all infringements involved in
      the action." A single infringer of a single work is liable for a
      single amount between $250 and $10,000, no matter how many acts
      of infringement are involved in the action and regardless of
      whether the acts were separate, isolated, or occurred in a
      related series.
        3. Where the suit involves infringement of more than one
      separate and independent work, minimum statutory damages for each
      work must be awarded. For example, if one defendant has infringed
      three copyrighted works, the copyright owner is entitled to
      statutory damages of at least $750 and may be awarded up to
      $30,000. Subsection (c)(1) makes clear, however, that, although
      they are regarded as independent works for other purposes, "all
      the parts of a compilation or derivative work constitute one
      work" for this purpose. Moreover, although the minimum and
      maximum amounts are to be multiplied where multiple "works" are
      involved in the suit, the same is not true with respect to
      multiple copyrights, multiple owners, multiple exclusive rights,
      or multiple registrations. This point is especially important
      since, under a scheme of divisible copyright, it is possible to
      have the rights of a number of owners of separate "copyrights" in
      a single "work" infringed by one act of a defendant.
        4. Where the infringements of one work were committed by a
      single infringer acting individually, a single award of statutory
      damages would be made. Similarly, where the work was infringed by
      two or more joint tortfeasors, the bill would make them jointly
      and severally liable for an amount in the $250 to $10,000 range.
      However, where separate infringements for which two or more
      defendants are not jointly liable are joined in the same action,
      separate awards of statutory damages would be appropriate.
      Clause (2) of section 504(c) provides for exceptional cases in
    which the maximum award of statutory damages could be raised from
    $10,000 to $50,000, and in which the minimum recovery could be
    reduced from $250 to $100. The basic principle underlying this
    provision is that the courts should be given discretion to increase
    statutory damages in cases of willful infringement and to lower the
    minimum where the infringer is innocent. The language of the clause
    makes clear that in these situations the burden of proving
    willfulness rests on the copyright owner and that of proving
    innocence rests on the infringer, and that the court must make a
    finding of either willfulness or innocence in order to award the
    exceptional amounts.
      The "innocent infringer" provision of section 504(c)(2) has been
    the subject of extensive discussion. The exception, which would
    allow reduction of minimum statutory damages to $100 where the
    infringer "was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or
    her acts constituted an infringement of copyright," is sufficient
    to protect against unwarranted liability in cases of occasional or
    isolated innocent infringement, and it offers adequate insulation
    to users, such as broadcasters and newspaper publishers, who are
    particularly vulnerable to this type of infringement suit. On the
    other hand, by establishing a realistic floor for liability, the
    provision preserves its intended deterrent effect; and it would not
    allow an infringer to escape simply because the plaintiff failed to
    disprove the defendant's claim of innocence.
      In addition to the general "innocent infringer" provision clause
    (2) deals with the special situation of teachers, librarians,
    archivists, and public broadcasters, and the nonprofit institutions
    of which they are a part. Section 504(c)(2) provides that, where
    such a person or institution infringed copyrighted material in the
    honest belief that what they were doing constituted fair use, the
    court is precluded from awarding any statutory damages. It is
    intended that, in cases involving this provision, the burden of
    proof with respect to the defendant's good faith should rest on the
    plaintiff.

        (1) In general. - Any person who willfully infringes a
      copyright shall be punished as provided under section 2319 of
      title 18, if the infringement was committed - 
          (A) for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial
        gain;
          (B) by the reproduction or distribution, including by

        knew or should have known that the work was intended for
        commercial distribution.

        (2) Evidence. - For purposes of this subsection, evidence of
      reproduction or distribution of a copyrighted work, by itself,
      shall not be sufficient to establish willful infringement of a
      copyright.
        (3) Definition. - In this subsection, the term "work being
      prepared for commercial distribution" means - 
          (A) a computer program, a musical work, a motion picture or
        other audiovisual work, or a sound recording, if, at the time
        of unauthorized distribution - 
            (i) the copyright owner has a reasonable expectation of

          commercially distributed; or

          (B) a motion picture, if, at the time of unauthorized
        distribution, the motion picture - 
            (i) has been made available for viewing in a motion picture
          exhibition facility; and
            (ii) has not been made available in copies for sale to the
          general public in the United States in a format intended to
          permit viewing outside a motion picture exhibition facility.

      (b) Forfeiture, Destruction, and Restitution. - Forfeiture,
    destruction, and restitution relating to this section shall be
    subject to section 2323 of title 18, to the extent provided in that
    section, in addition to any other similar remedies provided by law.
      (c) Fraudulent Copyright Notice. - Any person who, with

    words of the same purport that such person knows to be false, or

      Four types of criminal offenses actionable under the bill are
    listed in section 506: willful infringement for profit, fraudulent
    use of a copyright notice, fraudulent removal of notice, and false
    representation in connection with a copyright application. The
    maximum fine on conviction has been increased to $10,000 and, in
    conformity with the general pattern of the Criminal Code (18
    U.S.C.), no minimum fines have been provided. In addition to or
    instead of a fine, conviction for criminal infringement under
    section 506(a) can carry with it a sentence of imprisonment of up
    to one year. Section 506(b) deals with seizure, forfeiture, and
    destruction of material involved in cases of criminal infringement.
      Section 506(a) contains a special provision applying to any
    person who infringes willfully and for purposes of commercial
    advantage the copyright in a sound recording or a motion picture.
    For the first such offense a person shall be fined not more than
    $25,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both. For any
    subsequent offense a person shall be fined not more than $50,000 or
    imprisoned not more than two years, or both.

                                AMENDMENTS                            
      2008 - Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 110-403 amended subsec. (b)
    generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows: "When any
    person is convicted of any violation of subsection (a), the court
    in its judgment of conviction shall, in addition to the penalty
    therein prescribed, order the forfeiture and destruction or other
    disposition of all infringing copies or phonorecords and all
    implements, devices, or equipment used in the manufacture of such
    infringing copies or phonorecords."
      2005 - Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 109-9 reenacted heading without
    change and amended text generally. Prior to amendment, text read as
    follows: "Any person who infringes a copyright willfully either - 
        "(1) for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial
      gain, or
        "(2) by the reproduction or distribution, including by
      electronic means, during any 180-day period, of 1 or more copies
      or phonorecords of 1 or more copyrighted works, which have a
      total retail value of more than $1,000,
    shall be punished as provided under section 2319 of title 18,
    United States Code. For purposes of this subsection, evidence of
    reproduction or distribution of a copyrighted work, by itself,
    shall not be sufficient to establish willful infringement."
      1997 - Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 105-147 amended subsec. (a)
    generally. Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) read as follows:

    copyright willfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or
    private financial gain shall be punished as provided in section
    2319 of title 18."

      1982 - Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 97-180 substituted "shall be punished
    as provided in section 2319 of title 18" for "shall be fined not
    more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or
    both: Provided, however, That any person who infringes willfully
    and for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain
    the copyright in a sound recording afforded by subsections (1),
    (2), or (3) of section 106 or the copyright in a motion picture
    afforded by subsections (1), (3), or (4) of section 106 shall be
    fined not more than $25,000 or imprisoned for not more than one
    year, or both, for the first such offense and shall be fined not
    more than $50,000 or imprisoned for not more than two years, or
    both, for any subsequent offense".

      Section 509(b) specifies a new discretionary remedy for
    alteration of programming by cable systems in violation of section
    111(c)(3): the court in such cases may decree that, "for a period
    not to exceed thirty days, the cable system shall be deprived of
    the benefit of a compulsory license for one or more distant signals
    carried by such cable system." The term "distant signals" in this
    provision is intended to have a meaning consistent with the
    definition of "distant signal equivalent" in section 111.
      Under section 509(a), four types of plaintiffs are entitled to
    bring an action in cases of alteration of programming by cable
    systems in violation of section 111(c)(3). For regular copyright
    owners and local broadcaster-licensees, the full battery of
    remedies for infringement would be available. The two new classes
    of potential plaintiffs under section 501(d) - the distant-signal
    transmitter and other local stations - would be limited to the
    following remedies: (i) discretionary injunctions; (ii)
    discretionary costs and attorney's fees; (iii) any actual damages
    the plaintiff can prove were attributable to the act of altering
    program content; and (iv) the new discretionary remedy of
    suspension of compulsory licensing.

    the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States or

    Sec. 512. Limitations on liability relating to material online

-STATUTE-
      (a) Transitory Digital Network Communications. - A service
    provider shall not be liable for monetary relief, or, except as
    provided in subsection (j), for injunctive or other equitable
    relief, for infringement of copyright by reason of the provider's
    transmitting, routing, or providing connections for, material
    through a system or network controlled or operated by or for the
    service provider, or by reason of the intermediate and transient
    storage of that material in the course of such transmitting,
    routing, or providing connections, if - 
        (1) the transmission of the material was initiated by or at the
      direction of a person other than the service provider;
        (2) the transmission, routing, provision of connections, or
      storage is carried out through an automatic technical process
      without selection of the material by the service provider;
        (3) the service provider does not select the recipients of the
      material except as an automatic response to the request of
      another person;
        (4) no copy of the material made by the service provider in the
      course of such intermediate or transient storage is maintained on
      the system or network in a manner ordinarily accessible to anyone
      other than anticipated recipients, and no such copy is maintained
      on the system or network in a manner ordinarily accessible to
      such anticipated recipients for a longer period than is
      reasonably necessary for the transmission, routing, or provision
      of connections; and
        (5) the material is transmitted through the system or network
      without modification of its content.

      (b) System Caching. - 
        (1) Limitation on liability. - A service provider shall not be
      liable for monetary relief, or, except as provided in subsection
      (j), for injunctive or other equitable relief, for infringement
      of copyright by reason of the intermediate and temporary storage
      of material on a system or network controlled or operated by or
      for the service provider in a case in which - 
          (A) the material is made available online by a person other
        than the service provider;
          (B) the material is transmitted from the person described in
        subparagraph (A) through the system or network to a person
        other than the person described in subparagraph (A) at the
        direction of that other person; and
          (C) the storage is carried out through an automatic technical
        process for the purpose of making the material available to
        users of the system or network who, after the material is
        transmitted as described in subparagraph (B), request access to
        the material from the person described in subparagraph (A),

      if the conditions set forth in paragraph (2) are met.
        (2) Conditions. - The conditions referred to in paragraph (1)
      are that - 
          (A) the material described in paragraph (1) is transmitted to
        the subsequent users described in paragraph (1)(C) without
        modification to its content from the manner in which the
        material was transmitted from the person described in paragraph
        (1)(A);
          (B) the service provider described in paragraph (1) complies
        with rules concerning the refreshing, reloading, or other
        updating of the material when specified by the person making
        the material available online in accordance with a generally
        accepted industry standard data communications protocol for the
        system or network through which that person makes the material
        available, except that this subparagraph applies only if those
        rules are not used by the person described in paragraph (1)(A)
        to prevent or unreasonably impair the intermediate storage to
        which this subsection applies;
          (C) the service provider does not interfere with the ability
        of technology associated with the material to return to the
        person described in paragraph (1)(A) the information that would
        have been available to that person if the material had been
        obtained by the subsequent users described in paragraph (1)(C)
        directly from that person, except that this subparagraph
        applies only if that technology - 
            (i) does not significantly interfere with the performance
          of the provider's system or network or with the intermediate
          storage of the material;
            (ii) is consistent with generally accepted industry
          standard communications protocols; and
            (iii) does not extract information from the provider's
          system or network other than the information that would have
          been available to the person described in paragraph (1)(A) if
          the subsequent users had gained access to the material
          directly from that person;

          (D) if the person described in paragraph (1)(A) has in effect
        a condition that a person must meet prior to having access to
        the material, such as a condition based on payment of a fee or
        provision of a password or other information, the service
        provider permits access to the stored material in significant
        part only to users of its system or network that have met those
        conditions and only in accordance with those conditions; and
          (E) if the person described in paragraph (1)(A) makes that
        material available online without the authorization of the
        copyright owner of the material, the service provider responds
        expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material
        that is claimed to be infringing upon notification of claimed
        infringement as described in subsection (c)(3), except that
        this subparagraph applies only if - 
            (i) the material has previously been removed from the
          originating site or access to it has been disabled, or a
          court has ordered that the material be removed from the
          originating site or that access to the material on the
          originating site be disabled; and
            (ii) the party giving the notification includes in the
          notification a statement confirming that the material has
          been removed from the originating site or access to it has
          been disabled or that a court has ordered that the material
          be removed from the originating site or that access to the
          material on the originating site be disabled.

      (c) Information Residing on Systems or Networks At Direction of
    Users. - 
        (1) In general. - A service provider shall not be liable for
      monetary relief, or, except as provided in subsection (j), for
      injunctive or other equitable relief, for infringement of
      copyright by reason of the storage at the direction of a user of
      material that resides on a system or network controlled or
      operated by or for the service provider, if the service provider -
       
          (A)(i) does not have actual knowledge that the material or an
        activity using the material on the system or network is
        infringing;
          (ii) in the absence of such actual knowledge, is not aware of
        facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is
        apparent; or
          (iii) upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts
        expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material;
          (B) does not receive a financial benefit directly
        attributable to the infringing activity, in a case in which the
        service provider has the right and ability to control such
        activity; and
          (C) upon notification of claimed infringement as described in
        paragraph (3), responds expeditiously to remove, or disable
        access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing or to
        be the subject of infringing activity.

        (2) Designated agent. - The limitations on liability
      established in this subsection apply to a service provider only
      if the service provider has designated an agent to receive
      notifications of claimed infringement described in paragraph (3),
      by making available through its service, including on its website
      in a location accessible to the public, and by providing to the
      Copyright Office, substantially the following information:
          (A) the name, address, phone number, and electronic mail
        address of the agent.
          (B) other contact information which the Register of
        Copyrights may deem appropriate.

      The Register of Copyrights shall maintain a current directory of
      agents available to the public for inspection, including through
      the Internet, and may require payment of a fee by service
      providers to cover the costs of maintaining the directory.
        (3) Elements of notification. - 
          (A) To be effective under this subsection, a notification of
        claimed infringement must be a written communication provided
        to the designated agent of a service provider that includes
        substantially the following:
            (i) A physical or electronic signature of a person
          authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive
          right that is allegedly infringed.
            (ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have
          been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single
          online site are covered by a single notification, a
          representative list of such works at that site.
            (iii) Identification of the material that is claimed to be
          infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and
          that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled,
          and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service
          provider to locate the material.
            (iv) Information reasonably sufficient to permit the
          service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an
          address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic
          mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.
            (v) A statement that the complaining party has a good faith
          belief that use of the material in the manner complained of
          is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the
          law.
            (vi) A statement that the information in the notification
          is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the
          complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner
          of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

          (B)(i) Subject to clause (ii), a notification from a
        copyright owner or from a person authorized to act on behalf of
        the copyright owner that fails to comply substantially with the
        provisions of subparagraph (A) shall not be considered under
        paragraph (1)(A) in determining whether a service provider has
        actual knowledge or is aware of facts or circumstances from
        which infringing activity is apparent.
          (ii) In a case in which the notification that is provided to
        the service provider's designated agent fails to comply
        substantially with all the provisions of subparagraph (A) but
        substantially complies with clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv) of
        subparagraph (A), clause (i) of this subparagraph applies only
        if the service provider promptly attempts to contact the person
        making the notification or takes other reasonable steps to
        assist in the receipt of notification that substantially
        complies with all the provisions of subparagraph (A).

      (d) Information Location Tools. - A service provider shall not be
    liable for monetary relief, or, except as provided in subsection
    (j), for injunctive or other equitable relief, for infringement of
    copyright by reason of the provider referring or linking users to
    an online location containing infringing material or infringing
    activity, by using information location tools, including a
    directory, index, reference, pointer, or hypertext link, if the
    service provider - 
        (1)(A) does not have actual knowledge that the material or
      activity is infringing;
        (B) in the absence of such actual knowledge, is not aware of
      facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is
      apparent; or
        (C) upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts
      expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material;
        (2) does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable
      to the infringing activity, in a case in which the service
      provider has the right and ability to control such activity; and
        (3) upon notification of claimed infringement as described in
      subsection (c)(3), responds expeditiously to remove, or disable
      access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be
      the subject of infringing activity, except that, for purposes of
      this paragraph, the information described in subsection
      (c)(3)(A)(iii) shall be identification of the reference or link,
      to material or activity claimed to be infringing, that is to be
      removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information
      reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate
      that reference or link.

      (e) Limitation on Liability of Nonprofit Educational
    Institutions. - (1) When a public or other nonprofit institution of
    higher education is a service provider, and when a faculty member
    or graduate student who is an employee of such institution is
    performing a teaching or research function, for the purposes of
    subsections (a) and (b) such faculty member or graduate student
    shall be considered to be a person other than the institution, and
    for the purposes of subsections (c) and (d) such faculty member's
    or graduate student's knowledge or awareness of his or her
    infringing activities shall not be attributed to the institution,
    if - 
        (A) such faculty member's or graduate student's infringing
      activities do not involve the provision of online access to
      instructional materials that are or were required or recommended,
      within the preceding 3-year period, for a course taught at the
      institution by such faculty member or graduate student;
        (B) the institution has not, within the preceding 3-year
      period, received more than two notifications described in
      subsection (c)(3) of claimed infringement by such faculty member
      or graduate student, and such notifications of claimed
      infringement were not actionable under subsection (f); and
        (C) the institution provides to all users of its system or
      network informational materials that accurately describe, and
      promote compliance with, the laws of the United States relating
      to copyright.

      (2) For the purposes of this subsection, the limitations on
    injunctive relief contained in subsections (j)(2) and (j)(3), but
    not those in (j)(1), shall apply.
      (f) Misrepresentations. - Any person who knowingly materially
    misrepresents under this section - 
        (1) that material or activity is infringing, or
        (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by
      mistake or misidentification,

    shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys'
    fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or
    copyright owner's authorized licensee, or by a service provider,
    who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of the
    service provider relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or
    disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be
    infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to
    disable access to it.
      (g) Replacement of Removed or Disabled Material and Limitation on
    Other Liability. - 
        (1) No liability for taking down generally. - Subject to
      paragraph (2), a service provider shall not be liable to any
      person for any claim based on the service provider's good faith
      disabling of access to, or removal of, material or activity
      claimed to be infringing or based on facts or circumstances from
      which infringing activity is apparent, regardless of whether the
      material or activity is ultimately determined to be infringing.
        (2) Exception. - Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to
      material residing at the direction of a subscriber of the service
      provider on a system or network controlled or operated by or for
      the service provider that is removed, or to which access is
      disabled by the service provider, pursuant to a notice provided
      under subsection (c)(1)(C), unless the service provider - 
          (A) takes reasonable steps promptly to notify the subscriber
        that it has removed or disabled access to the material;
          (B) upon receipt of a counter notification described in
        paragraph (3), promptly provides the person who provided the
        notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) with a copy of the
        counter notification, and informs that person that it will
        replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it in
        10 business days; and
          (C) replaces the removed material and ceases disabling access
        to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days
        following receipt of the counter notice, unless its designated
        agent first receives notice from the person who submitted the
        notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) that such person has
        filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the
        subscriber from engaging in infringing activity relating to the
        material on the service provider's system or network.

        (3) Contents of counter notification. - To be effective under
      this subsection, a counter notification must be a written
      communication provided to the service provider's designated agent
      that includes substantially the following:
          (A) A physical or electronic signature of the subscriber.
          (B) Identification of the material that has been removed or
        to which access has been disabled and the location at which the
        material appeared before it was removed or access to it was
        disabled.
          (C) A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber
        has a good faith belief that the material was removed or
        disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the
        material to be removed or disabled.
          (D) The subscriber's name, address, and telephone number, and
        a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of
        Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the
        address is located, or if the subscriber's address is outside
        of the United States, for any judicial district in which the
        service provider may be found, and that the subscriber will
        accept service of process from the person who provided
        notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such
        person.

        (4) Limitation on other liability. - A service provider's
      compliance with paragraph (2) shall not subject the service
      provider to liability for copyright infringement with respect to
      the material identified in the notice provided under subsection
      (c)(1)(C).

      (h) Subpoena To Identify Infringer. - 
        (1) Request. - A copyright owner or a person authorized to act

      district court to issue a subpoena to a service provider for
      identification of an alleged infringer in accordance with this
      subsection.
        (2) Contents of request. - The request may be made by filing
      with the clerk - 
          (A) a copy of a notification described in subsection
        (c)(3)(A);
          (B) a proposed subpoena; and
          (C) a sworn declaration to the effect that the purpose for
        which the subpoena is sought is to obtain the identity of an
        alleged infringer and that such information will only be used
        for the purpose of protecting rights under this title.

        (3) Contents of subpoena. - The subpoena shall authorize and
      order the service provider receiving the notification and the
      subpoena to expeditiously disclose to the copyright owner or
      person authorized by the copyright owner information sufficient
      to identify the alleged infringer of the material described in
      the notification to the extent such information is available to
      the service provider.
        (4) Basis for granting subpoena. - If the notification filed
      satisfies the provisions of subsection (c)(3)(A), the proposed
      subpoena is in proper form, and the accompanying declaration is

        (5) Actions of service provider receiving subpoena. - Upon
      receipt of the issued subpoena, either accompanying or subsequent
      to the receipt of a notification described in subsection
      (c)(3)(A), the service provider shall expeditiously disclose to
      the copyright owner or person authorized by the copyright owner
      the information required by the subpoena, notwithstanding any
      other provision of law and regardless of whether the service
      provider responds to the notification.
        (6) Rules applicable to subpoena. - Unless otherwise provided
      by this section or by applicable rules of the court, the
      procedure for issuance and delivery of the subpoena, and the
      remedies for noncompliance with the subpoena, shall be governed
      to the greatest extent practicable by those provisions of the
      Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing the issuance, service,
      and enforcement of a subpoena duces tecum.

      (i) Conditions for Eligibility. - 
        (1) Accommodation of technology. - The limitations on liability
      established by this section shall apply to a service provider
      only if the service provider - 
          (A) has adopted and reasonably implemented, and informs
        subscribers and account holders of the service provider's
        system or network of, a policy that provides for the
        termination in appropriate circumstances of subscribers and
        account holders of the service provider's system or network who
        are repeat infringers; and
          (B) accommodates and does not interfere with standard
        technical measures.

        (2) Definition. - As used in this subsection, the term
      "standard technical measures" means technical measures that are
      used by copyright owners to identify or protect copyrighted works
      and -

        copyright owners and service providers in an open, fair,
        voluntary, multi-industry standards process;
          (B) are available to any person on reasonable and
        nondiscriminatory terms; and
          (C) do not impose substantial costs on service providers or
        substantial burdens on their systems or networks.

      (j) Injunctions. - The following rules shall apply in the case of
    any application for an injunction under section 502 against a
    service provider that is not subject to monetary remedies under
    this section:
        (1) Scope of relief. - (A) With respect to conduct other than
      that which qualifies for the limitation on remedies set forth in
      subsection (a), the court may grant injunctive relief with
      respect to a service provider only in one or more of the
      following forms:
          (i) An order restraining the service provider from providing
        access to infringing material or activity residing at a
        particular online site on the provider's system or network.
          (ii) An order restraining the service provider from providing
        access to a subscriber or account holder of the service
        provider's system or network who is engaging in infringing
        activity and is identified in the order, by terminating the
        accounts of the subscriber or account holder that are specified
        in the order.
          (iii) Such other injunctive relief as the court may consider
        necessary to prevent or restrain infringement of copyrighted
        material specified in the order of the court at a particular
        online location, if such relief is the least burdensome to the
        service provider among the forms of relief comparably effective
        for that purpose.

        (B) If the service provider qualifies for the limitation on
      remedies described in subsection (a), the court may only grant
      injunctive relief in one or both of the following forms:
          (i) An order restraining the service provider from providing
        access to a subscriber or account holder of the service
        provider's system or network who is using the provider's
        service to engage in infringing activity and is identified in
        the order, by terminating the accounts of the subscriber or
        account holder that are specified in the order.
          (ii) An order restraining the service provider from providing
        access, by taking reasonable steps specified in the order to
        block access, to a specific, identified, online location
        outside the United States.

        (2) Considerations. - The court, in considering the relevant
      criteria for injunctive relief under applicable law, shall
      consider - 
          (A) whether such an injunction, either alone or in
        combination with other such injunctions issued against the same
        service provider under this subsection, would significantly
        burden either the provider or the operation of the provider's
        system or network;
          (B) the magnitude of the harm likely to be suffered by the
        copyright owner in the digital network environment if steps are
        not taken to prevent or restrain the infringement;
          (C) whether implementation of such an injunction would be
        technically feasible and effective, and would not interfere
        with access to noninfringing material at other online
        locations; and
          (D) whether other less burdensome and comparably effective
        means of preventing or restraining access to the infringing
        material are available.

        (3) Notice and ex parte orders. - Injunctive relief under this
      subsection shall be available only after notice to the service
      provider and an opportunity for the service provider to appear
      are provided, except for orders ensuring the preservation of
      evidence or other orders having no material adverse effect on the
      operation of the service provider's communications network.

      (k) Definitions. - 
        (1) Service provider. - (A) As used in subsection (a), the term
      "service provider" means an entity offering the transmission,
      routing, or providing of connections for digital online
      communications, between or among points specified by a user, of
      material of the user's choosing, without modification to the
      content of the material as sent or received.
        (B) As used in this section, other than subsection (a), the
      term "service provider" means a provider of online services or
      network access, or the operator of facilities therefor, and
      includes an entity described in subparagraph (A).
        (2) Monetary relief. - As used in this section, the term
      "monetary relief" means damages, costs, attorneys' fees, and any
      other form of monetary payment.

      (l) Other Defenses Not Affected. - The failure of a service
    provider's conduct to qualify for limitation of liability under
    this section shall not bear adversely upon the consideration of a
    defense by the service provider that the service provider's conduct
    is not infringing under this title or any other defense.
      (m) Protection of Privacy. - Nothing in this section shall be
    construed to condition the applicability of subsections (a) through
    (d) on - 
        (1) a service provider monitoring its service or affirmatively
      seeking facts indicating infringing activity, except to the
      extent consistent with a standard technical measure complying
      with the provisions of subsection (i); or
        (2) a service provider gaining access to, removing, or
      disabling access to material in cases in which such conduct is
      prohibited by law.

      (n) Construction. - Subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) describe
    separate and distinct functions for purposes of applying this
    section. Whether a service provider qualifies for the limitation on
    liability in any one of those subsections shall be based solely on
    the criteria in that subsection, and shall not affect a
    determination of whether that service provider qualifies for the
    limitations on liability under any other such subsection.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 513. Determination of reasonable license fees for individual
      proprietors

-STATUTE-
      In the case of any performing rights society subject to a consent
    decree which provides for the determination of reasonable license
    rates or fees to be charged by the performing rights society,
    notwithstanding the provisions of that consent decree, an
    individual proprietor who owns or operates fewer than 7 non-
    publicly traded establishments in which nondramatic musical works
    are performed publicly and who claims that any license agreement
    offered by that performing rights society is unreasonable in its
    license rate or fee as to that individual proprietor, shall be
    entitled to determination of a reasonable license rate or fee as
    follows:
        (1) The individual proprietor may commence such proceeding for
      determination of a reasonable license rate or fee by filing an
      application in the applicable district court under paragraph (2)
      that a rate disagreement exists and by serving a copy of the
      application on the performing rights society. Such proceeding
      shall commence in the applicable district court within 90 days
      after the service of such copy, except that such 90-day
      requirement shall be subject to the administrative requirements
      of the court.
        (2) The proceeding under paragraph (1) shall be held, at the
      individual proprietor's election, in the judicial district of the
      district court with jurisdiction over the applicable consent
      decree or in that place of holding court of a district court that
      is the seat of the Federal circuit (other than the Court of
      Appeals for the Federal Circuit) in which the proprietor's
      establishment is located.
        (3) Such proceeding shall be held before the judge of the court
      with jurisdiction over the consent decree governing the
      performing rights society. At the discretion of the court, the
      proceeding shall be held before a special master or magistrate
      judge appointed by such judge. Should that consent decree provide
      for the appointment of an advisor or advisors to the court for
      any purpose, any such advisor shall be the special master so
      named by the court.
        (4) In any such proceeding, the industry rate shall be presumed
      to have been reasonable at the time it was agreed to or
      determined by the court. Such presumption shall in no way affect
      a determination of whether the rate is being correctly applied to
      the individual proprietor.
        (5) Pending the completion of such proceeding, the individual
      proprietor shall have the right to perform publicly the
      copyrighted musical compositions in the repertoire of the
      performing rights society by paying an interim license rate or
      fee into an interest bearing escrow account with the clerk of the
      court, subject to retroactive adjustment when a final rate or fee
      has been determined, in an amount equal to the industry rate, or,
      in the absence of an industry rate, the amount of the most recent
      license rate or fee agreed to by the parties.
        (6) Any decision rendered in such proceeding by a special
      master or magistrate judge named under paragraph (3) shall be
      reviewed by the judge of the court with jurisdiction over the
      consent decree governing the performing rights society. Such
      proceeding, including such review, shall be concluded within 6
      months after its commencement.
        (7) Any such final determination shall be binding only as to
      the individual proprietor commencing the proceeding, and shall
      not be applicable to any other proprietor or any other performing
      rights society, and the performing rights society shall be
      relieved of any obligation of nondiscrimination among similarly
      situated music users that may be imposed by the consent decree
      governing its operations.
        (8) An individual proprietor may not bring more than one
      proceeding provided for in this section for the determination of
      a reasonable license rate or fee under any license agreement with
      respect to any one performing rights society.
        (9) For purposes of this section, the term "industry rate"
      means the license fee a performing rights society has agreed to
      with, or which has been determined by the court for, a
      significant segment of the music user industry to which the
      individual proprietor belongs.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 602. Infringing importation or exportation of copies or
      phonorecords

-STATUTE-
      (a) Infringing Importation or Exportation. - 
        (1) Importation. - Importation into the United States, without
      the authority of the owner of copyright under this title, of
      copies or phonorecords of a work that have been acquired outside
      the United States is an infringement of the exclusive right to
      distribute copies or phonorecords under section 106, actionable
      under section 501.
        (2) Importation or exportation of infringing items. -
      Importation into the United States or exportation from the United
      States, without the authority of the owner of copyright under
      this title, of copies or phonorecords, the making of which either
      constituted an infringement of copyright, or which would have
      constituted an infringement of copyright if this title had been
      applicable, is an infringement of the exclusive right to
      distribute copies or phonorecords under section 106, actionable
      under sections 501 and 506.
        (3) Exceptions. - This subsection does not apply to - 
          (A) importation or exportation of copies or phonorecords
        under the authority or for the use of the Government of the
        United States or of any State or political subdivision of a
        State, but not including copies or phonorecords for use in
        schools, or copies of any audiovisual work imported for
        purposes other than archival use;
          (B) importation or exportation, for the private use of the
        importer or exporter and not for distribution, by any person
        with respect to no more than one copy or phonorecord of any one
        work at any one time, or by any person arriving from outside
        the United States or departing from the United States with
        respect to copies or phonorecords forming part of such person's
        personal baggage; or
          (C) importation by or for an organization operated for
        scholarly, educational, or religious purposes and not for
        private gain, with respect to no more than one copy of an
        audiovisual work solely for its archival purposes, and no more
        than five copies or phonorecords of any other work for its
        library lending or archival purposes, unless the importation of
        such copies or phonorecords is part of an activity consisting
        of systematic reproduction or distribution, engaged in by such
        organization in violation of the provisions of section
        108(g)(2).

      (b) Import Prohibition. - In a case where the making of the
    copies or phonorecords would have constituted an infringement of
    copyright if this title had been applicable, their importation is
    prohibited. In a case where the copies or phonorecords were
    lawfully made, United States Customs and Border Protection has no
    authority to prevent their importation. In either case, the
    Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to prescribe, by
    regulation, a procedure under which any person claiming an interest
    in the copyright in a particular work may, upon payment of a
    specified fee, be entitled to notification by United States Customs
    and Border Protection of the importation of articles that appear to
    be copies or phonorecords of the work.

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      Scope of the Section. Section 602, which has nothing to do with
    the manufacturing requirements of section 601, deals with two
    separate situations: importation of "piratical" articles (that is,
    copies or phonorecords made without any authorization of the
    copyright owner), and unauthorized importation of copies or
    phonorecords that were lawfully made. The general approach of
    section 602 is to make unauthorized importation an act of
    infringement in both cases, but to permit the United States Customs
    Service to prohibit importation only of "piratical" articles.
      Section 602(a) first states the general rule that unauthorized
    importation is an infringement merely if the copies or phonorecords
    "have been acquired outside the United States", but then enumerates
    three specific exceptions: (1) importation under the authority or
    for the use of a governmental body, but not including material for
    use in schools or copies of an audiovisual work imported for any
    purpose other than archival use; (2) importation for the private
    use of the importer of no more than one copy or phonorecord of a
    work at a time, or of articles in the personal baggage of travelers
    from abroad; or (3) importation by nonprofit organizations
    "operated for scholarly, educational, or religious purposes" of "no
    more than one copy of an audiovisual work solely for archival
    purposes, and no more than five copies or phonorecords of any other
    work for its library lending or archival purposes." The bill
    specifies that the third exception does not apply if the
    importation "is part of an activity consisting of systematic
    reproduction or distribution, engaged in by such organization in
    violation of the provisions of section 108(g)(2)."
      If none of the three exemptions applies, any unauthorized
    importer of copies or phonorecords acquired abroad could be sued
    for damages and enjoined from making any use of them, even before
    any public distribution in this country has taken place.
      Importation of "Piratical" Copies. Section 602(b) retains the
    present statute's prohibition against importation of "piratical"
    copies or phonorecords - those whose making "would have constituted
    an infringement of copyright if this title has been applicable."
    Thus, the Customs Service could exclude copies or phonorecords that
    were unlawful in the country where they were made; it could also
    exclude copies or phonorecords which, although made lawfully under
    the domestic law of that country, would have been unlawful if the
    U.S. copyright law could have been applied. A typical example would
    be a work by an American author which is in the public domain in a
    foreign country because that country does not have copyright
    relations with the United States; the making and publication of an
    authorized edition would be lawful in that country, but the Customs
    Service could prevent the importation of any copies of that
    edition.
      Importation for Infringing Distribution. The second situation
    covered by section 602 is that where the copies or phonorecords
    were lawfully made but their distribution in the United States
    would infringe the U.S. copyright owner's exclusive rights. As
    already said, the mere act of importation in this situation would
    constitute an act of infringement and could be enjoined. However,
    in cases of this sort it would be impracticable for the United
    States Customs Service to attempt to enforce the importation
    prohibition, and section 602(b) provides that, unless a violation

    no authority to prevent importation, "where the copies or

    the establishment of a procedure under which copyright owners could
    arrange for the Customs Service to notify them wherever articles
    appearing to infringe their works are imported.

      excluded articles

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Secretary of the Treasury and the United States Postal
    Service shall separately or jointly make regulations for the
    enforcement of the provisions of this title prohibiting
    importation.
      (b) These regulations may require, as a condition for the
    exclusion of articles under section 602 - 
        (1) that the person seeking exclusion obtain a court order
      enjoining importation of the articles; or
        (2) that the person seeking exclusion furnish proof, of a
      specified nature and in accordance with prescribed procedures,
      that the copyright in which such person claims an interest is
      valid and that the importation would violate the prohibition in
      section 602; the person seeking exclusion may also be required to
      post a surety bond for any injury that may result if the
      detention or exclusion of the articles proves to be unjustified.

      (c) Articles imported in violation of the importation
    prohibitions of this title are subject to seizure and forfeiture in
    the same manner as property imported in violation of the customs
    revenue laws. Forfeited articles shall be destroyed as directed by
    the Secretary of the Treasury or the court, as the case may be.

      The importation prohibitions of both sections 601 and 602 would
    be enforced under section 603, which is similar to section 109 of
    the statute now in effect [section 109 of former title 17].
    Subsection (a) would authorize the Secretary of the Treasury and
    the United States Postal Service to make regulations for this
    purpose, and subsection (c) provides for the disposition of
    excluded articles.
      Subsection (b) of section 603 deals only with the prohibition
    against importation of "piratical" copies or phonorecords, and is
    aimed at solving problems that have arisen under the present
    statute. Since the United States Customs Service is often in no
    position to make determinations as to whether particular articles
    are "piratical," section 603(b) would permit the Customs
    regulations to require the person seeking exclusion either to
    obtain a court order enjoining importation, or to furnish proof of
    his claim and to post bond.

                                AMENDMENTS                            
      1996 - Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 104-153 substituted a period at end
    for "; however, the articles may be returned to the country of
    export whenever it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary of
    the Treasury that the importer had no reasonable grounds for
    believing that his or her acts constituted a violation of law."

                         HOUSE REPORT NO. 94-1476                     
      Chapter 7 entitled "Copyright Office," sets forth the
    administrative and housekeeping provisions of the bill.
      Administrative Procedure Act. Under an amendment to section 701
    adopted by the Committee, the Copyright Office is made fully
    subject to the Administrative Procedure Act [5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.
    and 701 et seq.] with one exception: under section 706(b),
    reproduction and distribution of copyright deposit copies would be
    made under the Freedom of Information Act [5 U.S.C. 552] only to
    the extent permitted by the Copyright Office regulations.
      Retention and Disposition of Deposited Articles. A recurring
    problem in the administration of the copyright law has been the
    need to reconcile the storage limitations of the Copyright Office
    with the continued value of deposits in identifying copyrighted
    works. Aside from its indisputable utility to future historians and
    scholars, a substantially complete collection of both published and
    unpublished deposits, other than those selected by the Library of
    Congress, would avoid the many difficulties encountered when copies
    needed for identification in connection with litigation or other
    purposes have been destroyed. The basic policy behind section 704
    is that copyright deposits should be retained as long as possible,
    but that the Register of Copyrights and the Librarian of Congress
    should be empowered to dispose of them under appropriate safeguards
    when they decide that it has become necessary to do so.
      Under subsection (a) of section 704, any copy, phonorecord, or
    identifying material deposited for registration, whether registered
    or not, becomes "the property of the United States Government."
    This means that the copyright owner or person who made the deposit
    cannot demand its return as a matter of right, even in rejection
    cases, although the provisions of section 407 and 408 are flexible
    enough to allow for special arrangements in exceptional cases. On
    the other hand, Government ownership of deposited articles under
    section 704(a) carries with it no privileges under the copyright
    itself; use of a deposited article in violation of the copyright
    owner's exclusive rights would be infringement.
      With respect to published works, section 704(b) makes all
    deposits available to the Library of Congress "for its collections,
    or for exchanges or transfer to any other library"; where the work
    is unpublished, the Library is authorized to select any deposit for
    its own collections or for transfer to the National Archives of the
    United States or to a Federal records center.
      Motion picture producers have expressed some concern lest the
    right to transfer copies of works, such as motion pictures, that
    have been published under rental, lease, or loan arrangements,
    might lead to abuse. However, the Library of Congress has not
    knowingly transferred works of this sort to other libraries in the
    past, and there is no reason to expect it to do so in the future.
      The Committee added a new subsection (c) to section 704, under
    which the Register is authorized to make microfilm or other record
    copies of copyright deposits before transferring or otherwise
    disposing of them.
      For deposits not selected by the Library, subsection (d) provides
    that they, or "identifying portions or reproductions of them," are
    to be retained under Copyright Office control "for the longest
    period considered practicable and desirable" by the Register and
    the Librarian. When and if they ultimately decide that retention of
    certain deposited articles is no longer "practicable and
    desirable," the Register and Librarian have joint discretion to
    order their "destruction or other disposition." Because of the
    unique value and irreplaceable nature of unpublished deposits, the
    subsection prohibits their intentional destruction during their
    copyright term, unless a facsimile reproduction has been made.
      Subsection (e) of section 704 establishes a new procedure under
    which a copyright owner can request retention of deposited material
    for the full term of copyright. The Register of Copyrights is
    authorized to issue regulations prescribing the fees for this
    service and the "conditions under which such requests are to be
    made and granted."
      Catalog of Copyright Entries. Section 707(a) of the bill retains
    the present statute's basis requirement that the Register compile
    and publish catalogs of all copyright registrations at periodic
    intervals, but provides for "discretion to determine, on the basis
    of practicability and usefulness the form and frequency of
    publication of each particular part". This provision will in no way
    diminish the utility or value of the present catalogs, and the
    flexibility of approach, coupled with use of the new mechanical and
    electronic devices now becoming available, will avoid waste and
    result in a better product.
      Copyright Office Fees. The schedule of fees set out in section
    708 reflects a general increase in the fees of the Copyright Office
    from those established by the Congress in 1965. The basic fees are
    $10 for registration, $6 for renewal registration, $10 for
    recordation of documents and $10 per hour for searching. The
    section also contains new fee provisions needed because of new
    requirements or services established under the bill, and subsection
    (a)(11) authorizes the Register to fix additional fees, on the
    "basis of the cost of providing the service," "for any other
    special services requiring a substantial amount of time or
    expense." Subsection (b) makes clear that, except for the
    possibility of waivers in "occasional or isolated cases involving
    relatively small amounts," the Register is to charge fees for
    services rendered to other Government agencies.
      Postal Interruptions. Section 709 authorizes the Register of
    Copyrights to issue regulation to permit the acceptance by the
    Copyright Office of documents which are delivered after the close
    of the prescribed period if the delay was caused by a general
    disruption or suspension of postal or other transportation or
    communications services.
      Reproductions for the Blind and Handicapped. Section 710 directs
    the Register of Copyrights to establish by regulation forms and
    procedures by which the copyright owners of certain categories of
    works may voluntarily grant to the Library of Congress a license to
    reproduce and distribute copies or phonorecords of the work solely
    for the use of the blind and physically handicapped.

      Copyright Office

-STATUTE-
      (a) Upon their deposit in the Copyright Office under sections 407
    and 408, all copies, phonorecords, and identifying material,
    including those deposited in connection with claims that have been
    refused registration, are the property of the United States
    Government.
      (b) In the case of published works, all copies, phonorecords, and
    identifying material deposited are available to the Library of
    Congress for its collections, or for exchange or transfer to any
    other library. In the case of unpublished works, the Library is
    entitled, under regulations that the Register of Copyrights shall
    prescribe, to select any deposits for its collections or for
    transfer to the National Archives of the United States or to a
    Federal records center, as defined in section 2901 of title 44.
      (c) The Register of Copyrights is authorized, for specific or
    general categories of works, to make a facsimile reproduction of
    all or any part of the material deposited under section 408, and to
    make such reproduction a part of the Copyright Office records of
    the registration, before transferring such material to the Library
    of Congress as provided by subsection (b), or before destroying or
    otherwise disposing of such material as provided by subsection (d).
      (d) Deposits not selected by the Library under subsection (b), or
    identifying portions or reproductions of them, shall be retained
    under the control of the Copyright Office, including retention in
    Government storage facilities, for the longest period considered
    practicable and desirable by the Register of Copyrights and the
    Librarian of Congress. After that period it is within the joint
    discretion of the Register and the Librarian to order their
    destruction or other disposition; but, in the case of unpublished
    works, no deposit shall be knowingly or intentionally destroyed or
    otherwise disposed of during its term of copyright unless a
    facsimile reproduction of the entire deposit has been made a part
    of the Copyright Office records as provided by subsection (c).
      (e) The depositor of copies, phonorecords, or identifying
    material under section 408, or the copyright owner of record, may
    request retention, under the control of the Copyright Office, of
    one or more of such articles for the full term of copyright in the
    work. The Register of Copyrights shall prescribe, by regulation,
    the conditions under which such requests are to be made and
    granted, and shall fix the fee to be charged under section 708(a)
    if the request is granted.

    Sec. 708. Copyright Office fees

-STATUTE-
      (a) Fees. - Fees shall be paid to the Register of Copyrights - 
        (1) on filing each application under section 408 for
      registration of a copyright claim or for a supplementary
      registration, including the issuance of a certificate of
      registration if registration is made;
        (2) on filing each application for registration of a claim for
      renewal of a subsisting copyright under section 304(a), including
      the issuance of a certificate of registration if registration is
      made;
        (3) for the issuance of a receipt for a deposit under section
      407;
        (4) for the recordation, as provided by section 205, of a
      transfer of copyright ownership or other document;
        (5) for the filing, under section 115(b), of a notice of
      intention to obtain a compulsory license;
        (6) for the recordation, under section 302(c), of a statement
      revealing the identity of an author of an anonymous or
      pseudonymous work, or for the recordation, under section 302(d),
      of a statement relating to the death of an author;
        (7) for the issuance, under section 706, of an additional
      certificate of registration;
        (8) for the issuance of any other certification;
        (9) for the making and reporting of a search as provided by
      section 705, and for any related services;
        (10) on filing a statement of account based on secondary
      transmissions of primary transmissions pursuant to section 119 or
      122; and
        (11) on filing a statement of account based on secondary
      transmissions of primary transmissions pursuant to section 111.

    The Register is authorized to fix fees for other services,
    including the cost of preparing copies of Copyright Office records,
    whether or not such copies are certified, based on the cost of
    providing the service. Fees established under paragraphs (10) and
    (11) shall be reasonable and may not exceed one-half of the cost
    necessary to cover reasonable expenses incurred by the Copyright
    Office for the collection and administration of the statements of
    account and any royalty fees deposited with such statements.
      (b) Adjustment of Fees. - The Register of Copyrights may, by
    regulation, adjust the fees for the services specified in
    paragraphs (1) through (9) of subsection (a) in the following
    manner:
        (1) The Register shall conduct a study of the costs incurred by
      the Copyright Office for the registration of claims, the
      recordation of documents, and the provision of services. The
      study shall also consider the timing of any adjustment in fees
      and the authority to use such fees consistent with the budget.
        (2) The Register may, on the basis of the study under paragraph
      (1), and subject to paragraph (5), adjust fees to not more than
      that necessary to cover the reasonable costs incurred by the
      Copyright Office for the services described in paragraph (1),
      plus a reasonable inflation adjustment to account for any
      estimated increase in costs.
        (3) Any fee established under paragraph (2) shall be rounded
      off to the nearest dollar, or for a fee less than $12, rounded
      off to the nearest 50 cents.
        (4) Fees established under this subsection shall be fair and
      equitable and give due consideration to the objectives of the
      copyright system.
        (5) If the Register determines under paragraph (2) that fees
      should be adjusted, the Register shall prepare a proposed fee
      schedule and submit the schedule with the accompanying economic
      analysis to the Congress. The fees proposed by the Register may
      be instituted after the end of 120 days after the schedule is
      submitted to the Congress unless, within that 120-day period, a
      law is enacted stating in substance that the Congress does not
      approve the schedule.

      (c) The fees prescribed by or under this section are applicable
    to the United States Government and any of its agencies, employees,
    or officers, but the Register of Copyrights has discretion to waive
    the requirement of this subsection in occasional or isolated cases
    involving relatively small amounts.
      (d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), all fees received
    under this section shall be deposited by the Register of Copyrights
    in the Treasury of the United States and shall be credited to the
    appropriations for necessary expenses of the Copyright Office. Such
    fees that are collected shall remain available until expended. The
    Register may, in accordance with regulations that he or she shall
    prescribe, refund any sum paid by mistake or in excess of the fee
    required by this section.
      (2) In the case of fees deposited against future services, the
    Register of Copyrights shall request the Secretary of the Treasury
    to invest in interest-bearing securities in the United States
    Treasury any portion of the fees that, as determined by the
    Register, is not required to meet current deposit account demands.
    Funds from such portion of fees shall be invested in securities
    that permit funds to be available to the Copyright Office at all
    times if they are determined to be necessary to meet current
    deposit account demands. Such investments shall be in public debt
    securities with maturities suitable to the needs of the Copyright
    Office, as determined by the Register of Copyrights, and bearing
    interest at rates determined by the Secretary of the Treasury,
    taking into consideration current market yields on outstanding
    marketable obligations of the United States of comparable
    maturities.
      (3) The income on such investments shall be deposited in the
    Treasury of the United States and shall be credited to the
    appropriations for necessary expenses of the Copyright Office.

    TITLE 17 - COPYRIGHTS
    CHAPTER 8 - PROCEEDINGS BY COPYRIGHT ROYALTY JUDGES

-HEAD-
    Sec. 801. Copyright Royalty Judges; appointment and functions

-STATUTE-
      (a) Appointment. - The Librarian of Congress shall appoint 3 full-
    time Copyright Royalty Judges, and shall appoint 1 of the 3 as the
    Chief Copyright Royalty Judge. The Librarian shall make
    appointments to such positions after consultation with the Register
    of Copyrights.
      (b) Functions. - Subject to the provisions of this chapter, the
    functions of the Copyright Royalty Judges shall be as follows:
        (1) To make determinations and adjustments of reasonable terms
      and rates of royalty payments as provided in sections 112(e),
      114, 115, 116, 118, 119, and 1004. The rates applicable under
      sections 114(f)(1)(B), 115, and 116 shall be calculated to
      achieve the following objectives:
          (A) To maximize the availability of creative works to the
        public.
          (B) To afford the copyright owner a fair return for his or
        her creative work and the copyright user a fair income under
        existing economic conditions.
          (C) To reflect the relative roles of the copyright owner and
        the copyright user in the product made available to the public
        with respect to relative creative contribution, technological
        contribution, capital investment, cost, risk, and contribution
        to the opening of new markets for creative expression and media
        for their communication.
          (D) To minimize any disruptive impact on the structure of the
        industries involved and on generally prevailing industry
        practices.

        (2) To make determinations concerning the adjustment of the
      copyright royalty rates under section 111 solely in accordance
      with the following provisions:
          (A) The rates established by section 111(d)(1)(B) may be
        adjusted to reflect - 
            (i) national monetary inflation or deflation; or
            (ii) changes in the average rates charged cable subscribers
          for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions to
          maintain the real constant dollar level of the royalty fee
          per subscriber which existed as of the date of October 19,
          1976,

        except that - 
            (I) if the average rates charged cable system subscribers
          for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions
          are changed so that the average rates exceed national
          monetary inflation, no change in the rates established by
          section 111(d)(1)(B) shall be permitted; and
            (II) no increase in the royalty fee shall be permitted
          based on any reduction in the average number of distant
          signal equivalents per subscriber.

        The Copyright Royalty Judges may consider all factors relating
        to the maintenance of such level of payments, including, as an
        extenuating factor, whether the industry has been restrained by
        subscriber rate regulating authorities from increasing the
        rates for the basic service of providing secondary
        transmissions.
          (B) In the event that the rules and regulations of the
        Federal Communications Commission are amended at any time after
        April 15, 1976, to permit the carriage by cable systems of
        additional television broadcast signals beyond the local
        service area of the primary transmitters of such signals, the
        royalty rates established by section 111(d)(1)(B) may be
        adjusted to ensure that the rates for the additional distant
        signal equivalents resulting from such carriage are reasonable
        in the light of the changes effected by the amendment to such
        rules and regulations. In determining the reasonableness of
        rates proposed following an amendment of Federal Communications
        Commission rules and regulations, the Copyright Royalty Judges
        shall consider, among other factors, the economic impact on
        copyright owners and users; except that no adjustment in
        royalty rates shall be made under this subparagraph with
        respect to any distant signal equivalent or fraction thereof
        represented by - 
            (i) carriage of any signal permitted under the rules and
          regulations of the Federal Communications Commission in
          effect on April 15, 1976, or the carriage of a signal of the
          same type (that is, independent, network, or noncommercial
          educational) substituted for such permitted signal; or
            (ii) a television broadcast signal first carried after
          April 15, 1976, pursuant to an individual waiver of the rules
          and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, as
          such rules and regulations were in effect on April 15, 1976.

          (C) In the event of any change in the rules and regulations
        of the Federal Communications Commission with respect to
        syndicated and sports program exclusivity after April 15, 1976,
        the rates established by section 111(d)(1)(B) may be adjusted
        to assure that such rates are reasonable in light of the
        changes to such rules and regulations, but any such adjustment
        shall apply only to the affected television broadcast signals
        carried on those systems affected by the change.
          (D) The gross receipts limitations established by section
        111(d)(1)(C) and (D) (!1) shall be adjusted to reflect national
        monetary inflation or deflation or changes in the average rates
        charged cable system subscribers for the basic service of
        providing secondary transmissions to maintain the real constant
        dollar value of the exemption provided by such section, and the
        royalty rate specified therein shall not be subject to
        adjustment.


        (3)(A) To authorize the distribution, under sections 111, 119,
      and 1007, of those royalty fees collected under sections 111,
      119, and 1005, as the case may be, to the extent that the
      Copyright Royalty Judges have found that the distribution of such
      fees is not subject to controversy.
        (B) In cases where the Copyright Royalty Judges determine that
      controversy exists, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall determine
      the distribution of such fees, including partial distributions,
      in accordance with section 111, 119, or 1007, as the case may be.
        (C) Notwithstanding section 804(b)(8), the Copyright Royalty
      Judges, at any time after the filing of claims under section 111,
      119, or 1007, may, upon motion of one or more of the claimants
      and after publication in the Federal Register of a request for
      responses to the motion from interested claimants, make a partial
      distribution of such fees, if, based upon all responses received
      during the 30-day period beginning on the date of such
      publication, the Copyright Royalty Judges conclude that no
      claimant entitled to receive such fees has stated a reasonable
      objection to the partial distribution, and all such claimants - 
          (i) agree to the partial distribution;
          (ii) sign an agreement obligating them to return any excess
        amounts to the extent necessary to comply with the final
        determination on the distribution of the fees made under
        subparagraph (B);
          (iii) file the agreement with the Copyright Royalty Judges;
        and
          (iv) agree that such funds are available for distribution.

        (D) The Copyright Royalty Judges and any other officer or
      employee acting in good faith in distributing funds under
      subparagraph (C) shall not be held liable for the payment of any
      excess fees under subparagraph (C). The Copyright Royalty Judges
      shall, at the time the final determination is made, calculate any
      such excess amounts.
        (4) To accept or reject royalty claims filed under sections
      111, 119, and 1007, on the basis of timeliness or the failure to
      establish the basis for a claim.
        (5) To accept or reject rate adjustment petitions as provided
      in section 804 and petitions to participate as provided in
      section 803(b) (1) and (2).
        (6) To determine the status of a digital audio recording device
      or a digital audio interface device under sections 1002 and 1003,
      as provided in section 1010.
        (7)(A) To adopt as a basis for statutory terms and rates or as
      a basis for the distribution of statutory royalty payments, an
      agreement concerning such matters reached among some or all of
      the participants in a proceeding at any time during the
      proceeding, except that - 
          (i) the Copyright Royalty Judges shall provide to those that
        would be bound by the terms, rates, or other determination set
        by any agreement in a proceeding to determine royalty rates an
        opportunity to comment on the agreement and shall provide to
        participants in the proceeding under section 803(b)(2) that
        would be bound by the terms, rates, or other determination set
        by the agreement an opportunity to comment on the agreement and
        object to its adoption as a basis for statutory terms and
        rates; and
          (ii) the Copyright Royalty Judges may decline to adopt the
        agreement as a basis for statutory terms and rates for
        participants that are not parties to the agreement, if any
        participant described in clause (i) objects to the agreement
        and the Copyright Royalty Judges conclude, based on the record
        before them if one exists, that the agreement does not provide
        a reasonable basis for setting statutory terms or rates.

        (B) License agreements voluntarily negotiated pursuant to
      section 112(e)(5), 114(f)(3), 115(c)(3)(E)(i), 116(c), or
      118(b)(2) that do not result in statutory terms and rates shall
      not be subject to clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A).
        (C) Interested parties may negotiate and agree to, and the
      Copyright Royalty Judges may adopt, an agreement that specifies
      as terms notice and recordkeeping requirements that apply in lieu
      of those that would otherwise apply under regulations.
        (8) To perform other duties, as assigned by the Register of
      Copyrights within the Library of Congress, except as provided in
      section 802(g), at times when Copyright Royalty Judges are not
      engaged in performing the other duties set forth in this section.

      (c) Rulings. - The Copyright Royalty Judges may make any
    necessary procedural or evidentiary rulings in any proceeding under
    this chapter and may, before commencing a proceeding under this

      subsection shall include locality pay.

      (f) Independence of Copyright Royalty Judge. - 
        (1) In making determinations. - 
          (A) In general. - (i) Subject to subparagraph (B) and clause
        (ii) of this subparagraph, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall
        have full independence in making determinations concerning
        adjustments and determinations of copyright royalty rates and
        terms, the distribution of copyright royalties, the acceptance
        or rejection of royalty claims, rate adjustment petitions, and
        petitions to participate, and in issuing other rulings under
        this title, except that the Copyright Royalty Judges may
        consult with the Register of Copyrights on any matter other
        than a question of fact.
          (ii) One or more Copyright Royalty Judges may, or by motion
        to the Copyright Royalty Judges, any participant in a
        proceeding may, request from the Register of Copyrights an
        interpretation of any material questions of substantive law
        that relate to the construction of provisions of this title and
        arise in the course of the proceeding. Any request for a
        written interpretation shall be in writing and on the record,
        and reasonable provision shall be made to permit participants
        in the proceeding to comment on the material questions of
        substantive law in a manner that minimizes duplication and
        delay. Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Register of
        Copyrights shall deliver to the Copyright Royalty Judges a
        written response within 14 days after the receipt of all briefs
        and comments from the participants. The Copyright Royalty
        Judges shall apply the legal interpretation embodied in the
        response of the Register of Copyrights if it is timely
        delivered, and the response shall be included in the record
        that accompanies the final determination. The authority under
        this clause shall not be construed to authorize the Register of
        Copyrights to provide an interpretation of questions of
        procedure before the Copyright Royalty Judges, the ultimate
        adjustments and determinations of copyright royalty rates and
        terms, the ultimate distribution of copyright royalties, or the
        acceptance or rejection of royalty claims, rate adjustment
        petitions, or petitions to participate in a proceeding.
          (B) Novel questions. - (i) In any case in which a novel
        material question of substantive law concerning an
        interpretation of those provisions of this title that are the
        subject of the proceeding is presented, the Copyright Royalty
        Judges shall request a decision of the Register of Copyrights,
        in writing, to resolve such novel question. Reasonable
        provision shall be made for comment on such request by the
        participants in the proceeding, in such a way as to minimize
        duplication and delay. The Register of Copyrights shall
        transmit his or her decision to the Copyright Royalty Judges
        within 30 days after the Register of Copyrights receives all of
        the briefs or comments of the participants. Such decision shall
        be in writing and included by the Copyright Royalty Judges in
        the record that accompanies their final determination. If such
        a decision is timely delivered to the Copyright Royalty Judges,
        the Copyright Royalty Judges shall apply the legal
        determinations embodied in the decision of the Register of
        Copyrights in resolving material questions of substantive law.
          (ii) In clause (i), a "novel question of law" is a question
        of law that has not been determined in prior decisions,
        determinations, and rulings described in section 803(a).
          (C) Consultation. - Notwithstanding the provisions of
        subparagraph (A), the Copyright Royalty Judges shall consult
        with the Register of Copyrights with respect to any
        determination or ruling that would require that any act be
        performed by the Copyright Office, and any such determination
        or ruling shall not be binding upon the Register of Copyrights.
          (D) Review of legal conclusions by the register of
        copyrights. - The Register of Copyrights may review for legal
        error the resolution by the Copyright Royalty Judges of a
        material question of substantive law under this title that
        underlies or is contained in a final determination of the
        Copyright Royalty Judges. If the Register of Copyrights
        concludes, after taking into consideration the views of the
        participants in the proceeding, that any resolution reached by
        the Copyright Royalty Judges was in material error, the
        Register of Copyrights shall issue a written decision
        correcting such legal error, which shall be made part of the
        record of the proceeding. The Register of Copyrights shall
        issue such written decision not later than 60 days after the
        date on which the final determination by the Copyright Royalty
        Judges is issued. Additionally, the Register of Copyrights
        shall cause to be published in the Federal Register such
        written decision, together with a specific identification of
        the legal conclusion of the Copyright Royalty Judges that is
        determined to be erroneous. As to conclusions of substantive
        law involving an interpretation of the statutory provisions of
        this title, the decision of the Register of Copyrights shall be
        binding as precedent upon the Copyright Royalty Judges in
        subsequent proceedings under this chapter. When a decision has
        been rendered pursuant to this subparagraph, the Register of
        Copyrights may, on the basis of and in accordance with such
        decision, intervene as of right in any appeal of a final
        determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges pursuant to
        section 803(d) in the United States Court of Appeals for the
        District of Columbia Circuit. If, prior to intervening in such
        an appeal, the Register of Copyrights gives notification to,
        and undertakes to consult with, the Attorney General with
        respect to such intervention, and the Attorney General fails,
        within a reasonable period after receiving such notification,
        to intervene in such appeal, the Register of Copyrights may
        intervene in such appeal in his or her own name by any attorney
        designated by the Register of Copyrights for such purpose.
        Intervention by the Register of Copyrights in his or her own
        name shall not preclude the Attorney General from intervening
        on behalf of the United States in such an appeal as may be
        otherwise provided or required by law.
          (E) Effect on judicial review. - Nothing in this section
        shall be interpreted to alter the standard applied by a court
        in reviewing legal determinations involving an interpretation
        or construction of the provisions of this title or to affect
        the extent to which any construction or interpretation of the
        provisions of this title shall be accorded deference by a
        reviewing court.

        (2) Performance appraisals. - 
          (A) In general. - Notwithstanding any other provision of law
        or any regulation of the Library of Congress, and subject to
        subparagraph (B), the Copyright Royalty Judges shall not
        receive performance appraisals.
          (B) Relating to sanction or removal. - To the extent that the
        Librarian of Congress adopts regulations under subsection (h)
        relating to the sanction or removal of a Copyright Royalty
        Judge and such regulations require documentation to establish
        the cause of such sanction or removal, the Copyright Royalty
        Judge may receive an appraisal related specifically to the
        cause of the sanction or removal.

      (g) Inconsistent Duties Barred. - No Copyright Royalty Judge may
    undertake duties that conflict with his or her duties and
    responsibilities as a Copyright Royalty Judge.
      (h) Standards of Conduct. - The Librarian of Congress shall adopt
    regulations regarding the standards of conduct, including financial
    conflict of interest and restrictions against ex parte
    communications, which shall govern the Copyright Royalty Judges and
    the proceedings under this chapter.
      (i) Removal or Sanction. - The Librarian of Congress may sanction
    or remove a Copyright Royalty Judge for violation of the standards
    of conduct adopted under subsection (h), misconduct, neglect of

    for a hearing, but the Librarian of Congress may suspend the
    Copyright Royalty Judge during the pendency of such hearing. The
    Librarian shall appoint an interim Copyright Royalty Judge during
    the period of any such suspension.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 803. Proceedings of Copyright Royalty Judges

-STATUTE-
      (a) Proceedings. - 
        (1) In general. - The Copyright Royalty Judges shall act in
      accordance with this title, and to the extent not inconsistent
      with this title, in accordance with subchapter II of chapter 5 of
      title 5, in carrying out the purposes set forth in section 801.
      The Copyright Royalty Judges shall act in accordance with
      regulations issued by the Copyright Royalty Judges and the
      Librarian of Congress, and on the basis of a written record,
      prior determinations and interpretations of the Copyright Royalty
      Tribunal, Librarian of Congress, the Register of Copyrights,
      copyright arbitration royalty panels (to the extent those
      determinations are not inconsistent with a decision of the
      Librarian of Congress or the Register of Copyrights), and the
      Copyright Royalty Judges (to the extent those determinations are
      not inconsistent with a decision of the Register of Copyrights
      that was timely delivered to the Copyright Royalty Judges
      pursuant to section 802(f)(1)(A) or (B), or with a decision of
      the Register of Copyrights pursuant to section 802(f)(1)(D)),
      under this chapter, and decisions of the court of appeals under
      this chapter before, on, or after the effective date of the
      Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004.
        (2) Judges acting as panel and individually. - The Copyright
      Royalty Judges shall preside over hearings in proceedings under
      this chapter en banc. The Chief Copyright Royalty Judge may
      designate a Copyright Royalty Judge to preside individually over
      such collateral and administrative proceedings, and over such
      proceedings under paragraphs (1) through (5) of subsection (b),
      as the Chief Judge considers appropriate.
        (3) Determinations. - Final determinations of the Copyright
      Royalty Judges in proceedings under this chapter shall be made by
      majority vote. A Copyright Royalty Judge dissenting from the
      majority on any determination under this chapter may issue his or
      her dissenting opinion, which shall be included with the
      determination.

      (b) Procedures. - 
        (1) Initiation. - 
          (A) Call for petitions to participate. - (i) The Copyright
        Royalty Judges shall cause to be published in the Federal
        Register notice of commencement of proceedings under this
        chapter, calling for the filing of petitions to participate in
        a proceeding under this chapter for the purpose of making the
        relevant determination under section 111, 112, 114, 115, 116,
        118, 119, 1004, or 1007, as the case may be - 
            (I) promptly upon a determination made under section
          804(a);
            (II) by no later than January 5 of a year specified in
          paragraph (2) of section 804(b) for the commencement of
          proceedings;
            (III) by no later than January 5 of a year specified in
          subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (3) of section 804(b)
          for the commencement of proceedings, or as otherwise provided
          in subparagraph (A) or (C) of such paragraph for the
          commencement of proceedings;
            (IV) as provided under section 804(b)(8); or
            (V) by no later than January 5 of a year specified in any
          other provision of section 804(b) for the filing of petitions
          for the commencement of proceedings, if a petition has not
          been filed by that date, except that the publication of
          notice requirement shall not apply in the case of proceedings
          under section 111 that are scheduled to commence in 2005.

          (ii) Petitions to participate shall be filed by no later than
        30 days after publication of notice of commencement of a
        proceeding under clause (i), except that the Copyright Royalty
        Judges may, for substantial good cause shown and if there is no
        prejudice to the participants that have already filed
        petitions, accept late petitions to participate at any time up
        to the date that is 90 days before the date on which
        participants in the proceeding are to file their written direct
        statements. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, petitioners
        whose petitions are filed more than 30 days after publication
        of notice of commencement of a proceeding are not eligible to
        object to a settlement reached during the voluntary negotiation
        period under paragraph (3), and any objection filed by such a
        petitioner shall not be taken into account by the Copyright
        Royalty Judges.
          (B) Petitions to participate. - Each petition to participate
        in a proceeding shall describe the petitioner's interest in the
        subject matter of the proceeding. Parties with similar
        interests may file a single petition to participate.

        (2) Participation in general. - Subject to paragraph (4), a
      person may participate in a proceeding under this chapter,
      including through the submission of briefs or other information,
      only if - 
          (A) that person has filed a petition to participate in
        accordance with paragraph (1) (either individually or as a
        group under paragraph (1)(B));
          (B) the Copyright Royalty Judges have not determined that the
        petition to participate is facially invalid;
          (C) the Copyright Royalty Judges have not determined, sua
        sponte or on the motion of another participant in the
        proceeding, that the person lacks a significant interest in the
        proceeding; and
          (D) the petition to participate is accompanied by either - 
            (i) in a proceeding to determine royalty rates, a filing
          fee of $150; or
            (ii) in a proceeding to determine distribution of royalty
          fees - 
              (I) a filing fee of $150; or
              (II) a statement that the petitioner (individually or as
            a group) will not seek a distribution of more than $1000,
            in which case the amount distributed to the petitioner
            shall not exceed $1000.

        (3) Voluntary negotiation period. - 
          (A) Commencement of proceedings. - 
            (i) Rate adjustment proceeding. - Promptly after the date
          for filing of petitions to participate in a proceeding, the
          Copyright Royalty Judges shall make available to all
          participants in the proceeding a list of such participants
          and shall initiate a voluntary negotiation period among the
          participants.
            (ii) Distribution proceeding. - Promptly after the date for
          filing of petitions to participate in a proceeding to
          determine the distribution of royalties, the Copyright
          Royalty Judges shall make available to all participants in
          the proceeding a list of such participants. The initiation of
          a voluntary negotiation period among the participants shall
          be set at a time determined by the Copyright Royalty Judges.

          (B) Length of proceedings. - The voluntary negotiation period
        initiated under subparagraph (A) shall be 3 months.
          (C) Determination of subsequent proceedings. - At the close
        of the voluntary negotiation proceedings, the Copyright Royalty
        Judges shall, if further proceedings under this chapter are
        necessary, determine whether and to what extent paragraphs (4)
        and (5) will apply to the parties.

        (4) Small claims procedure in distribution proceedings. - 
          (A) In general. - If, in a proceeding under this chapter to
        determine the distribution of royalties, the contested amount
        of a claim is $10,000 or less, the Copyright Royalty Judges
        shall decide the controversy on the basis of the filing of the
        written direct statement by the participant, the response by
        any opposing participant, and 1 additional response by each
        such party.
          (B) Bad faith inflation of claim. - If the Copyright Royalty
        Judges determine that a participant asserts in bad faith an
        amount in controversy in excess of $10,000 for the purpose of
        avoiding a determination under the procedure set forth in
        subparagraph (A), the Copyright Royalty Judges shall impose a
        fine on that participant in an amount not to exceed the
        difference between the actual amount distributed and the amount
        asserted by the participant.

        (5) Paper proceedings. - The Copyright Royalty Judges in
      proceedings under this chapter may decide, sua sponte or upon
      motion of a participant, to determine issues on the basis of the
      filing of the written direct statement by the participant, the
      response by any opposing participant, and one additional response
      by each such participant. Prior to making such decision to
      proceed on such a paper record only, the Copyright Royalty Judges
      shall offer to all parties to the proceeding the opportunity to
      comment on the decision. The procedure under this paragraph - 
          (A) shall be applied in cases in which there is no genuine
        issue of material fact, there is no need for evidentiary
        hearings, and all participants in the proceeding agree in
        writing to the procedure; and
          (B) may be applied under such other circumstances as the
        Copyright Royalty Judges consider appropriate.

        (6) Regulations. - 
          (A) In general. - The Copyright Royalty Judges may issue
        regulations to carry out their functions under this title. All
        regulations issued by the Copyright Royalty Judges are subject
        to the approval of the Librarian of Congress and are subject to
        judicial review pursuant to chapter 7 of title 5, except as set
        forth in subsection (d). Not later than 120 days after
        Copyright Royalty Judges or interim Copyright Royalty Judges,
        as the case may be, are first appointed after the enactment of
        the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004, such
        judges shall issue regulations to govern proceedings under this
        chapter.
          (B) Interim regulations. - Until regulations are adopted
        under subparagraph (A), the Copyright Royalty Judges shall
        apply the regulations in effect under this chapter on the day
        before the effective date of the Copyright Royalty and
        Distribution Reform Act of 2004, to the extent such regulations
        are not inconsistent with this chapter, except that functions
        carried out under such regulations by the Librarian of
        Congress, the Register of Copyrights, or copyright arbitration
        royalty panels that, as of such date of enactment, are to be
        carried out by the Copyright Royalty Judges under this chapter,
        shall be carried out by the Copyright Royalty Judges under such
        regulations.
          (C) Requirements. - Regulations issued under subparagraph (A)
        shall include the following:
            (i) The written direct statements and written rebuttal
          statements of all participants in a proceeding under
          paragraph (2) shall be filed by a date specified by the
          Copyright Royalty Judges, which, in the case of written
          direct statements, may be not earlier than 4 months, and not
          later than 5 months, after the end of the voluntary
          negotiation period under paragraph (3). Notwithstanding the
          preceding sentence, the Copyright Royalty Judges may allow a
          participant in a proceeding to file an amended written direct
          statement based on new information received during the
          discovery process, within 15 days after the end of the
          discovery period specified in clause (iv).
            (ii)(I) Following the submission to the Copyright Royalty
          Judges of written direct statements and written rebuttal
          statements by the participants in a proceeding under
          paragraph (2), the Copyright Royalty Judges, after taking
          into consideration the views of the participants in the
          proceeding, shall determine a schedule for conducting and
          completing discovery.
            (II) In this chapter, the term "written direct statements"
          means witness statements, testimony, and exhibits to be
          presented in the proceedings, and such other information that
          is necessary to establish terms and rates, or the
          distribution of royalty payments, as the case may be, as set
          forth in regulations issued by the Copyright Royalty Judges.
            (iii) Hearsay may be admitted in proceedings under this
          chapter to the extent deemed appropriate by the Copyright
          Royalty Judges.
            (iv) Discovery in connection with written direct statements
          shall be permitted for a period of 60 days, except for
          discovery ordered by the Copyright Royalty Judges in
          connection with the resolution of motions, orders, and
          disputes pending at the end of such period. The Copyright
          Royalty Judges may order a discovery schedule in connection
          with written rebuttal statements.
            (v) Any participant under paragraph (2) in a proceeding
          under this chapter to determine royalty rates may request of
          an opposing participant nonprivileged documents directly
          related to the written direct statement or written rebuttal
          statement of that participant. Any objection to such a
          request shall be resolved by a motion or request to compel
          production made to the Copyright Royalty Judges in accordance
          with regulations adopted by the Copyright Royalty Judges.
          Each motion or request to compel discovery shall be
          determined by the Copyright Royalty Judges, or by a Copyright
          Royalty Judge when permitted under subsection (a)(2). Upon
          such motion, the Copyright Royalty Judges may order discovery
          pursuant to regulations established under this paragraph.
            (vi)(I) Any participant under paragraph (2) in a proceeding
          under this chapter to determine royalty rates may, by means
          of written motion or on the record, request of an opposing
          participant or witness other relevant information and
          materials if, absent the discovery sought, the Copyright
          Royalty Judges' resolution of the proceeding would be
          substantially impaired. In determining whether discovery will
          be granted under this clause, the Copyright Royalty Judges
          may consider - 
              (aa) whether the burden or expense of producing the
            requested information or materials outweighs the likely
            benefit, taking into account the needs and resources of the
            participants, the importance of the issues at stake, and
            the probative value of the requested information or
            materials in resolving such issues;
              (bb) whether the requested information or materials would
            be unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or are
            obtainable from another source that is more convenient,
            less burdensome, or less expensive; and
              (cc) whether the participant seeking discovery has had
            ample opportunity by discovery in the proceeding or by
            other means to obtain the information sought.

            (II) This clause shall not apply to any proceeding
          scheduled to commence after December 31, 2010.
            (vii) In a proceeding under this chapter to determine
          royalty rates, the participants entitled to receive royalties
          shall collectively be permitted to take no more than 10
          depositions and secure responses to no more than 25
          interrogatories, and the participants obligated to pay
          royalties shall collectively be permitted to take no more
          than 10 depositions and secure responses to no more than 25
          interrogatories. The Copyright Royalty Judges shall resolve
          any disputes among similarly aligned participants to allocate
          the number of depositions or interrogatories permitted under
          this clause.
            (viii) The rules and practices in effect on the day before
          the effective date of the Copyright Royalty and Distribution
          Reform Act of 2004, relating to discovery in proceedings
          under this chapter to determine the distribution of royalty
          fees, shall continue to apply to such proceedings on and
          after such effective date.
            (ix) In proceedings to determine royalty rates, the
          Copyright Royalty Judges may issue a subpoena commanding a
          participant or witness to appear and give testimony, or to
          produce and permit inspection of documents or tangible
          things, if the Copyright Royalty Judges' resolution of the
          proceeding would be substantially impaired by the absence of
          such testimony or production of documents or tangible things.
          Such subpoena shall specify with reasonable particularity the
          materials to be produced or the scope and nature of the
          required testimony. Nothing in this clause shall preclude the
          Copyright Royalty Judges from requesting the production by a
          nonparticipant of information or materials relevant to the
          resolution by the Copyright Royalty Judges of a material
          issue of fact.
            (x) The Copyright Royalty Judges shall order a settlement
          conference among the participants in the proceeding to
          facilitate the presentation of offers of settlement among the
          participants. The settlement conference shall be held during
          a 21-day period following the 60-day discovery period
          specified in clause (iv) and shall take place outside the
          presence of the Copyright Royalty Judges.
            (xi) No evidence, including exhibits, may be submitted in
          the written direct statement or written rebuttal statement of
          a participant without a sponsoring witness, except where the
          Copyright Royalty Judges have taken official notice, or in
          the case of incorporation by reference of past records, or
          for good cause shown.

      (c) Determination of Copyright Royalty Judges. - 
        (1) Timing. - The Copyright Royalty Judges shall issue their
      determination in a proceeding not later than 11 months after the
      conclusion of the 21-day settlement conference period under
      subsection (b)(6)(C)(x), but, in the case of a proceeding to
      determine successors to rates or terms that expire on a specified
      date, in no event later than 15 days before the expiration of the
      then current statutory rates and terms.
        (2) Rehearings. - 
          (A) In general. - The Copyright Royalty Judges may, in
        exceptional cases, upon motion of a participant in a proceeding
        under subsection (b)(2), order a rehearing, after the
        determination in the proceeding is issued under paragraph (1),
        on such matters as the Copyright Royalty Judges determine to be
        appropriate.
          (B) Timing for filing motion. - Any motion for a rehearing
        under subparagraph (A) may only be filed within 15 days after
        the date on which the Copyright Royalty Judges deliver to the
        participants in the proceeding their initial determination.
          (C) Participation by opposing party not required. - In any
        case in which a rehearing is ordered, any opposing party shall
        not be required to participate in the rehearing, except that
        nonparticipation may give rise to the limitations with respect
        to judicial review provided for in subsection (d)(1).
          (D) No negative inference. - No negative inference shall be
        drawn from lack of participation in a rehearing.
          (E) Continuity of rates and terms. - (i) If the decision of
        the Copyright Royalty Judges on any motion for a rehearing is
        not rendered before the expiration of the statutory rates and
        terms that were previously in effect, in the case of a
        proceeding to determine successors to rates and terms that
        expire on a specified date, then - 
            (I) the initial determination of the Copyright Royalty
          Judges that is the subject of the rehearing motion shall be
          effective as of the day following the date on which the rates
          and terms that were previously in effect expire; and
            (II) in the case of a proceeding under section 114(f)(1)(C)
          or 114(f)(2)(C), royalty rates and terms shall, for purposes
          of section 114(f)(4)(B), be deemed to have been set at those
          rates and terms contained in the initial determination of the
          Copyright Royalty Judges that is the subject of the rehearing
          motion, as of the date of that determination.

          (ii) The pendency of a motion for a rehearing under this
        paragraph shall not relieve persons obligated to make royalty
        payments who would be affected by the determination on that
        motion from providing the statements of account and any reports
        of use, to the extent required, and paying the royalties
        required under the relevant determination or regulations.
          (iii) Notwithstanding clause (ii), whenever royalties
        described in clause (ii) are paid to a person other than the
        Copyright Office, the entity designated by the Copyright
        Royalty Judges to which such royalties are paid by the
        copyright user (and any successor thereto) shall, within 60
        days after the motion for rehearing is resolved or, if the
        motion is granted, within 60 days after the rehearing is
        concluded, return any excess amounts previously paid to the
        extent necessary to comply with the final determination of
        royalty rates by the Copyright Royalty Judges. Any underpayment
        of royalties resulting from a rehearing shall be paid within
        the same period.

        (3) Contents of determination. - A determination of the
      Copyright Royalty Judges shall be supported by the written record
      and shall set forth the findings of fact relied on by the
      Copyright Royalty Judges. Among other terms adopted in a
      determination, the Copyright Royalty Judges may specify notice
      and recordkeeping requirements of users of the copyrights at
      issue that apply in lieu of those that would otherwise apply
      under regulations.
        (4) Continuing jurisdiction. - The Copyright Royalty Judges may
      issue an amendment to a written determination to correct any
      technical or clerical errors in the determination or to modify
      the terms, but not the rates, of royalty payments in response to
      unforeseen circumstances that would frustrate the proper
      implementation of such determination. Such amendment shall be set
      forth in a written addendum to the determination that shall be
      distributed to the participants of the proceeding and shall be
      published in the Federal Register.
        (5) Protective order. - The Copyright Royalty Judges may issue
      such orders as may be appropriate to protect confidential
      information, including orders excluding confidential information
      from the record of the determination that is published or made
      available to the public, except that any terms or rates of
      royalty payments or distributions may not be excluded.
        (6) Publication of determination. - By no later than the end of
      the 60-day period provided in section 802(f)(1)(D), the Librarian
      of Congress shall cause the determination, and any corrections
      thereto, to be published in the Federal Register. The Librarian
      of Congress shall also publicize the determination and
      corrections in such other manner as the Librarian considers
      appropriate, including, but not limited to, publication on the
      Internet. The Librarian of Congress shall also make the
      determination, corrections, and the accompanying record available
      for public inspection and copying.
        (7) Late payment. - A determination of the Copyright Royalty
      Judges may include terms with respect to late payment, but in no
      way shall such terms prevent the copyright holder from asserting
      other rights or remedies provided under this title.

      (d) Judicial Review. - 
        (1) Appeal. - Any determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges
      under subsection (c) may, within 30 days after the publication of
      the determination in the Federal Register, be appealed, to the
      United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
      Circuit, by any aggrieved participant in the proceeding under
      subsection (b)(2) who fully participated in the proceeding and
      who would be bound by the determination. Any participant that did
      not participate in a rehearing may not raise any issue that was
      the subject of that rehearing at any stage of judicial review of
      the hearing determination. If no appeal is brought within that 30-
      day period, the determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges
      shall be final, and the royalty fee or determination with respect
      to the distribution of fees, as the case may be, shall take
      effect as set forth in paragraph (2).
        (2) Effect of rates. - 
          (A) Expiration on specified date. - When this title provides
        that the royalty rates and terms that were previously in effect
        are to expire on a specified date, any adjustment or
        determination by the Copyright Royalty Judges of successor
        rates and terms for an ensuing statutory license period shall
        be effective as of the day following the date of expiration of
        the rates and terms that were previously in effect, even if the
        determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges is rendered on a
        later date. A licensee shall be obligated to continue making
        payments under the rates and terms previously in effect until
        such time as rates and terms for the successor period are
        established. Whenever royalties pursuant to this section are
        paid to a person other than the Copyright Office, the entity
        designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges to which such
        royalties are paid by the copyright user (and any successor
        thereto) shall, within 60 days after the final determination of
        the Copyright Royalty Judges establishing rates and terms for a
        successor period or the exhaustion of all rehearings or appeals
        of such determination, if any, return any excess amounts
        previously paid to the extent necessary to comply with the
        final determination of royalty rates. Any underpayment of
        royalties by a copyright user shall be paid to the entity
        designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges within the same
        period.
          (B) Other cases. - In cases where rates and terms have not,
        prior to the inception of an activity, been established for
        that particular activity under the relevant license, such rates
        and terms shall be retroactive to the inception of activity
        under the relevant license covered by such rates and terms. In
        other cases where rates and terms do not expire on a specified
        date, successor rates and terms shall take effect on the first
        day of the second month that begins after the publication of
        the determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges in the
        Federal Register, except as otherwise provided in this title,
        or by the Copyright Royalty Judges, or as agreed by the
        participants in a proceeding that would be bound by the rates
        and terms. Except as otherwise provided in this title, the
        rates and terms, to the extent applicable, shall remain in
        effect until such successor rates and terms become effective.
          (C) Obligation to make payments. - 
            (i) The pendency of an appeal under this subsection shall
          not relieve persons obligated to make royalty payments under
          section 111, 112, 114, 115, 116, 118, 119, or 1003, who would
          be affected by the determination on appeal, from - 
              (I) providing the applicable statements of account and
            reports of use; and
              (II) paying the royalties required under the relevant
            determination or regulations.

            (ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), whenever royalties
          described in clause (i) are paid to a person other than the
          Copyright Office, the entity designated by the Copyright
          Royalty Judges to which such royalties are paid by the
          copyright user (and any successor thereto) shall, within 60
          days after the final resolution of the appeal, return any
          excess amounts previously paid (and interest thereon, if
          ordered pursuant to paragraph (3)) to the extent necessary to
          comply with the final determination of royalty rates on
          appeal. Any underpayment of royalties resulting from an
          appeal (and interest thereon, if ordered pursuant to
          paragraph (3)) shall be paid within the same period.

        (3) Jurisdiction of court. - Section 706 of title 5 shall apply
      with respect to review by the court of appeals under this
      subsection. If the court modifies or vacates a determination of
      the Copyright Royalty Judges, the court may enter its own
      determination with respect to the amount or distribution of
      royalty fees and costs, and order the repayment of any excess
      fees, the payment of any underpaid fees, and the payment of
      interest pertaining respectively thereto, in accordance with its
      final judgment. The court may also vacate the determination of
      the Copyright Royalty Judges and remand the case to the Copyright
      Royalty Judges for further proceedings in accordance with
      subsection (a).

      (e) Administrative Matters. - 
        (1) Deduction of costs of library of congress and copyright
      office from filing fees. - 
          (A) Deduction from filing fees. - The Librarian of Congress
        may, to the extent not otherwise provided under this title,
        deduct from the filing fees collected under subsection (b) for
        a particular proceeding under this chapter the reasonable costs
        incurred by the Librarian of Congress, the Copyright Office,
        and the Copyright Royalty Judges in conducting that proceeding,
        other than the salaries of the Copyright Royalty Judges and the
        3 staff members appointed under section 802(b).
          (B) Authorization of appropriations. - There are authorized
        to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to pay the
        costs incurred under this chapter not covered by the filing
        fees collected under subsection (b). All funds made available
        pursuant to this subparagraph shall remain available until
        expended.

        (2) Positions required for administration of compulsory
      licensing. - Section 307 of the Legislative Branch Appropriations
      Act, 1994, shall not apply to employee positions in the Library
      of Congress that are required to be filled in order to carry out
      section 111, 112, 114, 115, 116, 118, or 119 or chapter 10.

      after negotiated licenses authorized by section 116 are
      terminated or expire and are not replaced by subsequent
      agreements.
        (B) If a negotiated license authorized by section 116 is
      terminated or expires and is not replaced by another such license
      agreement which provides permission to use a quantity of musical
      works not substantially smaller than the quantity of such works
      performed on coin-operated phonorecord players during the 1-year
      period ending March 1, 1989, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall,
      upon petition filed under paragraph (1) within 1 year after such
      termination or expiration, commence a proceeding to promptly
      establish an interim royalty rate or rates for the public
      performance by means of a coin-operated phonorecord player of
      nondramatic musical works embodied in phonorecords which had been
      subject to the terminated or expired negotiated license
      agreement. Such rate or rates shall be the same as the last such
      rate or rates and shall remain in force until the conclusion of
      proceedings by the Copyright Royalty Judges, in accordance with
      section 803, to adjust the royalty rates applicable to such
      works, or until superseded by a new negotiated license agreement,
      as provided in section 116(b).
        (6) Section 118 proceedings. - A petition described in
      subsection (a) to initiate proceedings under section 801(b)(1)
      concerning the determination of reasonable terms and rates of
      royalty payments as provided in section 118 may be filed in the
      year 2006 and in each subsequent fifth calendar year.

    CHAPTER 9 - PROTECTION OF SEMICONDUCTOR CHIP PRODUCTS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 901. Definitions

-STATUTE-
      (a) As used in this chapter - 
        (1) a "semiconductor chip product" is the final or intermediate
      form of any product - 
          (A) having two or more layers of metallic, insulating, or
        semiconductor material, deposited or otherwise placed on, or
        etched away or otherwise removed from, a piece of semiconductor
        material in accordance with a predetermined pattern; and
          (B) intended to perform electronic circuitry functions;

        (2) a "mask work" is a series of related images, however fixed
      or encoded - 
          (A) having or representing the predetermined, three-
        dimensional pattern of metallic, insulating, or semiconductor
        material present or removed from the layers of a semiconductor
        chip product; and
          (B) in which series the relation of the images to one another
        is that each image has the pattern of the surface of one form
        of the semiconductor chip product;

        (3) a mask work is "fixed" in a semiconductor chip product when
      its embodiment in the product is sufficiently permanent or stable
      to permit the mask work to be perceived or reproduced from the
      product for a period of more than transitory duration;
        (4) to "distribute" means to sell, or to lease, bail, or
      otherwise transfer, or to offer to sell, lease, bail, or
      otherwise transfer;
        (5) to "commercially exploit" a mask work is to distribute to
      the public for commercial purposes a semiconductor chip product
      embodying the mask work; except that such term includes an offer
      to sell or transfer a semiconductor chip product only when the
      offer is in writing and occurs after the mask work is fixed in
      the semiconductor chip product;
        (6) the "owner" of a mask work is the person who created the
      mask work, the legal representative of that person if that person
      is deceased or under a legal incapacity, or a party to whom all
      the rights under this chapter of such person or representative
      are transferred in accordance with section 903(b); except that,
      in the case of a work made within the scope of a person's
      employment, the owner is the employer for whom the person created
      the mask work or a party to whom all the rights under this
      chapter of the employer are transferred in accordance with
      section 903(b);
        (7) an "innocent purchaser" is a person who purchases a
      semiconductor chip product in good faith and without having
      notice of protection with respect to the semiconductor chip
      product;
        (8) having "notice of protection" means having actual knowledge
      that, or reasonable grounds to believe that, a mask work is
      protected under this chapter; and
        (9) an "infringing semiconductor chip product" is a
      semiconductor chip product which is made, imported, or
      distributed in violation of the exclusive rights of the owner of
      a mask work under this chapter.

      (b) For purposes of this chapter, the distribution or importation
    of a product incorporating a semiconductor chip product as a part
    thereof is a distribution or importation of that semiconductor chip
    product.

    the owner of the mask work, is eligible for protection under this
    chapter if - 
        (A) on the date on which the mask work is registered under
      section 908, or is first commercially exploited anywhere in the
      world, whichever occurs first, the owner of the mask work is (i)
      a national or domiciliary of the United States, (ii) a national,
      domiciliary, or sovereign authority of a foreign nation that is a
      party to a treaty affording protection to mask works to which the
      United States is also a party, or (iii) a stateless person,
      wherever that person may be domiciled;
        (B) the mask work is first commercially exploited in the United
      States; or
        (C) the mask work comes within the scope of a Presidential
      proclamation issued under paragraph (2).

      (2) Whenever the President finds that a foreign nation extends,
    to mask works of owners who are nationals or domiciliaries of the
    United States protection (A) on substantially the same basis as
    that on which the foreign nation extends protection to mask works
    of its own nationals and domiciliaries and mask works first
    commercially exploited in that nation, or (B) on substantially the
    same basis as provided in this chapter, the President may by
    proclamation extend protection under this chapter to mask works (i)
    of owners who are, on the date on which the mask works are
    registered under section 908, or the date on which the mask works
    are first commercially exploited anywhere in the world, whichever
    occurs first, nationals, domiciliaries, or sovereign authorities of
    that nation, or (ii) which are first commercially exploited in that
    nation. The President may revise, suspend, or revoke any such
    proclamation or impose any conditions or limitations on protection
    extended under any such proclamation.
      (b) Protection under this chapter shall not be available for a
    mask work that - 
        (1) is not original; or
        (2) consists of designs that are staple, commonplace, or
      familiar in the semiconductor industry, or variations of such
      designs, combined in a way that, considered as a whole, is not
      original.

      (c) In no case does protection under this chapter for a mask work
    extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of
    operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form
    in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in
    such work.

-STATUTE-
      (a) The exclusive rights in a mask work subject to protection
    under this chapter belong to the owner of the mask work.
      (b) The owner of the exclusive rights in a mask work may transfer
    all of those rights, or license all or less than all of those
    rights, by any written instrument signed by such owner or a duly
    authorized agent of the owner. Such rights may be transferred or
    licensed by operation of law, may be bequeathed by will, and may
    pass as personal property by the applicable laws of intestate
    succession.
      (c)(1) Any document pertaining to a mask work may be recorded in
    the Copyright Office if the document filed for recordation bears
    the actual signature of the person who executed it, or if it is
    accompanied by a sworn or official certification that it is a true
    copy of the original, signed document. The Register of Copyrights
    shall, upon receipt of the document and the fee specified pursuant
    to section 908(d), record the document and return it with a
    certificate of recordation. The recordation of any transfer or
    license under this paragraph gives all persons constructive notice
    of the facts stated in the recorded document concerning the
    transfer or license.
      (2) In any case in which conflicting transfers of the exclusive
    rights in a mask work are made, the transfer first executed shall
    be void as against a subsequent transfer which is made for a
    valuable consideration and without notice of the first transfer,
    unless the first transfer is recorded in accordance with paragraph
    (1) within three months after the date on which it is executed, but
    in no case later than the day before the date of such subsequent
    transfer.
      (d) Mask works prepared by an officer or employee of the United
    States Government as part of that person's official duties are not
    protected under this chapter, but the United States Government is
    not precluded from receiving and holding exclusive rights in mask
    works transferred to the Government under subsection (b).

      of teaching, analyzing, or evaluating the concepts or techniques
      embodied in the mask work or the circuitry, logic flow, or
      organization of components used in the mask work; or
        (2) a person who performs the analysis or evaluation described
      in paragraph (1) to incorporate the results of such conduct in an
      original mask work which is made to be distributed.

      (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 905(2), the owner
    of a particular semiconductor chip product made by the owner of the
    mask work, or by any person authorized by the owner of the mask
    work, may import, distribute, or otherwise dispose of or use, but
    not reproduce, that particular semiconductor chip product without

-STATUTE-
      (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an
    innocent purchaser of an infringing semiconductor chip product - 
        (1) shall incur no liability under this chapter with respect to
      the importation or distribution of units of the infringing
      semiconductor chip product that occurs before the innocent
      purchaser has notice of protection with respect to the mask work
      embodied in the semiconductor chip product; and
        (2) shall be liable only for a reasonable royalty on each unit
      of the infringing semiconductor chip product that the innocent
      purchaser imports or distributes after having notice of
      protection with respect to the mask work embodied in the
      semiconductor chip product.

      (b) The amount of the royalty referred to in subsection (a)(2)
    shall be determined by the court in a civil action for infringement
    unless the parties resolve the issue by voluntary negotiation,
    mediation, or binding arbitration.
      (c) The immunity of an innocent purchaser from liability referred
    to in subsection (a)(1) and the limitation of remedies with respect
    to an innocent purchaser referred to in subsection (a)(2) shall
    extend to any person who directly or indirectly purchases an
    infringing semiconductor chip product from an innocent purchaser.
      (d) The provisions of subsections (a), (b), and (c) apply only
    with respect to those units of an infringing semiconductor chip
    product that an innocent purchaser purchased before having notice
    of protection with respect to the mask work embodied in the
    semiconductor chip product.

    Sec. 908. Registration of claims of protection

-STATUTE-
      (a) The owner of a mask work may apply to the Register of
    Copyrights for registration of a claim of protection in a mask
    work. Protection of a mask work under this chapter shall terminate
    if application for registration of a claim of protection in the
    mask work is not made as provided in this chapter within two years
    after the date on which the mask work is first commercially
    exploited anywhere in the world.
      (b) The Register of Copyrights shall be responsible for all
    administrative functions and duties under this chapter. Except for
    section 708, the provisions of chapter 7 of this title relating to
    the general responsibilities, organization, regulatory authority,
    actions, records, and publications of the Copyright Office shall
    apply to this chapter, except that the Register of Copyrights may
    make such changes as may be necessary in applying those provisions
    to this chapter.
      (c) The application for registration of a mask work shall be made
    on a form prescribed by the Register of Copyrights. Such form may
    require any information regarded by the Register as bearing upon
    the preparation or identification of the mask work, the existence
    or duration of protection of the mask work under this chapter, or
    ownership of the mask work. The application shall be accompanied by
    the fee set pursuant to subsection (d) and the identifying material
    specified pursuant to such subsection.
      (d) The Register of Copyrights shall by regulation set reasonable
    fees for the filing of applications to register claims of
    protection in mask works under this chapter, and for other services
    relating to the administration of this chapter or the rights under
    this chapter, taking into consideration the cost of providing those
    services, the benefits of a public record, and statutory fee
    schedules under this title. The Register shall also specify the
    identifying material to be deposited in connection with the claim
    for registration.
      (e) If the Register of Copyrights, after examining an application
    for registration, determines, in accordance with the provisions of
    this chapter, that the application relates to a mask work which is
    entitled to protection under this chapter, then the Register shall
    register the claim of protection and issue to the applicant a
    certificate of registration of the claim of protection under the
    seal of the Copyright Office. The effective date of registration of
    a claim of protection shall be the date on which an application,
    deposit of identifying material, and fee, which are determined by
    the Register of Copyrights or by a court of competent jurisdiction
    to be acceptable for registration of the claim, have all been
    received in the Copyright Office.
      (f) In any action for infringement under this chapter, the
    certificate of registration of a mask work shall constitute prima
    facie evidence (1) of the facts stated in the certificate, and (2)
    that the applicant issued the certificate has met the requirements
    of this chapter, and the regulations issued under this chapter,
    with respect to the registration of claims.
      (g) Any applicant for registration under this section who is
    dissatisfied with the refusal of the Register of Copyrights to
    issue a certificate of registration under this section may seek
    judicial review of that refusal by bringing an action for such
    review in an appropriate United States district court not later
    than sixty days after the refusal. The provisions of chapter 7 of
    title 5 shall apply to such judicial review. The failure of the
    Register of Copyrights to issue a certificate of registration
    within four months after an application for registration is filed
    shall be deemed to be a refusal to issue a certificate of
    registration for purposes of this subsection and section 910(b)(2),
    except that, upon a showing of good cause, the district court may
    shorten such four-month period.

    specific methods of affixation and positions of notice for purposes
    of this section, but these specifications shall not be considered
    exhaustive. The affixation of such notice is not a condition of
    protection under this chapter, but shall constitute prima facie
    evidence of notice of protection.
      (b) The notice referred to in subsection (a) shall consist of - 
        (1) the words "mask work", the symbol *M*, or the symbol M (the

-STATUTE-
      (a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any person who
    violates any of the exclusive rights of the owner of a mask work
    under this chapter, by conduct in or affecting commerce, shall be
    liable as an infringer of such rights. As used in this subsection,
    the term "any person" includes any State, any instrumentality of a
    State, and any officer or employee of a State or instrumentality of
    a State acting in his or her official capacity. Any State, and any
    such instrumentality, officer, or employee, shall be subject to the
    provisions of this chapter in the same manner and to the same
    extent as any nongovernmental entity.
      (b)(1) The owner of a mask work protected under this chapter, or
    the exclusive licensee of all rights under this chapter with
    respect to the mask work, shall, after a certificate of
    registration of a claim of protection in that mask work has been
    issued under section 908, be entitled to institute a civil action
    for any infringement with respect to the mask work which is
    committed after the commencement of protection of the mask work
    under section 904(a).
      (2) In any case in which an application for registration of a
    claim of protection in a mask work and the required deposit of
    identifying material and fee have been received in the Copyright
    Office in proper form and registration of the mask work has been
    refused, the applicant is entitled to institute a civil action for
    infringement under this chapter with respect to the mask work if
    notice of the action, together with a copy of the complaint, is
    served on the Register of Copyrights, in accordance with the
    Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Register may, at his or her
    option, become a party to the action with respect to the issue of
    whether the claim of protection is eligible for registration by
    entering an appearance within sixty days after such service, but
    the failure of the Register to become a party to the action shall
    not deprive the court of jurisdiction to determine that issue.
      (c)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury and the United States Postal
    Service shall separately or jointly issue regulations for the
    enforcement of the rights set forth in section 905 with respect to
    importation. These regulations may require, as a condition for the
    exclusion of articles from the United States, that the person
    seeking exclusion take any one or more of the following actions:
        (A) Obtain a court order enjoining, or an order of the
      International Trade Commission under section 337 of the Tariff
      Act of 1930 excluding, importation of the articles.
        (B) Furnish proof that the mask work involved is protected
      under this chapter and that the importation of the articles would
      infringe the rights in the mask work under this chapter.
        (C) Post a surety bond for any injury that may result if the
      detention or exclusion of the articles proves to be unjustified.

      (2) Articles imported in violation of the rights set forth in
    section 905 are subject to seizure and forfeiture in the same
    manner as property imported in violation of the customs laws. Any
    such forfeited articles shall be destroyed as directed by the
    Secretary of the Treasury or the court, as the case may be, except
    that the articles may be returned to the country of export whenever
    it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury
    that the importer had no reasonable grounds for believing that his
    or her acts constituted a violation of the law.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 911. Civil actions

-STATUTE-
      (a) Any court having jurisdiction of a civil action arising under
    this chapter may grant temporary restraining orders, preliminary
    injunctions, and permanent injunctions on such terms as the court
    may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement of the
    exclusive rights in a mask work under this chapter.
      (b) Upon finding an infringer liable, to a person entitled under
    section 910(b)(1) to institute a civil action, for an infringement
    of any exclusive right under this chapter, the court shall award
    such person actual damages suffered by the person as a result of
    the infringement. The court shall also award such person the
    infringer's profits that are attributable to the infringement and
    are not taken into account in computing the award of actual
    damages. In establishing the infringer's profits, such person is
    required to present proof only of the infringer's gross revenue,
    and the infringer is required to prove his or her deductible
    expenses and the elements of profit attributable to factors other
    than the mask work.
      (c) At any time before final judgment is rendered, a person
    entitled to institute a civil action for infringement may elect,
    instead of actual damages and profits as provided by subsection
    (b), an award of statutory damages for all infringements involved
    in the action, with respect to any one mask work for which any one
    infringer is liable individually, or for which any two or more
    infringers are liable jointly and severally, in an amount not more
    than $250,000 as the court considers just.
      (d) An action for infringement under this chapter shall be barred
    unless the action is commenced within three years after the claim
    accrues.
      (e)(1) At any time while an action for infringement of the
    exclusive rights in a mask work under this chapter is pending, the
    court may order the impounding, on such terms as it may deem
    reasonable, of all semiconductor chip products, and any drawings,
    tapes, masks, or other products by means of which such products may
    be reproduced, that are claimed to have been made, imported, or
    used in violation of those exclusive rights. Insofar as
    practicable, applications for orders under this paragraph shall be
    heard and determined in the same manner as an application for a
    temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.
      (2) As part of a final judgment or decree, the court may order
    the destruction or other disposition of any infringing
    semiconductor chip products, and any masks, tapes, or other
    articles by means of which such products may be reproduced.
      (f) In any civil action arising under this chapter, the court in
    its discretion may allow the recovery of full costs, including
    reasonable attorneys' fees, to the prevailing party.
      (g)(1) Any State, any instrumentality of a State, and any officer
    or employee of a State or instrumentality of a State acting in his
    or her official capacity, shall not be immune, under the Eleventh
    Amendment of the Constitution of the United States or under any
    other doctrine of sovereign immunity, from suit in Federal court by
    any person, including any governmental or nongovernmental entity,
    for a violation of any of the exclusive rights of the owner of a
    mask work under this chapter, or for any other violation under this
    chapter.
      (2) In a suit described in paragraph (1) for a violation
    described in that paragraph, remedies (including remedies both at
    law and in equity) are available for the violation to the same
    extent as such remedies are available for such a violation in a
    suit against any public or private entity other than a State,
    instrumentality of a State, or officer or employee of a State
    acting in his or her official capacity. Such remedies include
    actual damages and profits under subsection (b), statutory damages
    under subsection (c), impounding and disposition of infringing
    articles under subsection (e), and costs and attorney's fees under
    subsection (f).

    shall be effective only with respect to actions filed on or after
    January 1, 1986.
      (d) Notwithstanding subsection (c), nothing in this chapter shall
    detract from any rights of a mask work owner, whether under Federal

    with respect to any mask work first commercially exploited before

    after the date of the enactment of this chapter.
      (b) No monetary relief under section 911 may be granted with

      (c) Subject to subsection (a), the provisions of this chapter
    apply to all mask works that are first commercially exploited or
    are registered under this chapter, or both, on or after the date of
    the enactment of this chapter.
      (d)(1) Subject to subsection (a), protection is available under
    this chapter to any mask work that was first commercially exploited
    on or after July 1, 1983, and before the date of the enactment of
    this chapter, if a claim of protection in the mask work is

    Sec. 914. International transitional provisions

-STATUTE-
      (a) Notwithstanding the conditions set forth in subparagraphs (A)
    and (C) of section 902(a)(1) with respect to the availability of
    protection under this chapter to nationals, domiciliaries, and
    sovereign authorities of a foreign nation, the Secretary of
    Commerce may, upon the petition of any person, or upon the
    Secretary's own motion, issue an order extending protection under
    this chapter to such foreign nationals, domiciliaries, and
    sovereign authorities if the Secretary finds - 
        (1) that the foreign nation is making good faith efforts and
      reasonable progress toward - 
          (A) entering into a treaty described in section 902(a)(1)(A);
        or
          (B) enacting or implementing legislation that would be in
        compliance with subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 902(a)(2);
        and

        (2) that the nationals, domiciliaries, and sovereign
      authorities of the foreign nation, and persons controlled by
      them, are not engaged in the misappropriation, or unauthorized
      distribution or commercial exploitation, of mask works; and
        (3) that issuing the order would promote the purposes of this
      chapter and international comity with respect to the protection
      of mask works.

      (b) While an order under subsection (a) is in effect with respect
    to a foreign nation, no application for registration of a claim for
    protection in a mask work under this chapter may be denied solely
    because the owner of the mask work is a national, domiciliary, or
    sovereign authority of that foreign nation, or solely because the
    mask work was first commercially exploited in that foreign nation.
      (c) Any order issued by the Secretary of Commerce under
    subsection (a) shall be effective for such period as the Secretary
    designates in the order, except that no such order may be effective
    after the date on which the authority of the Secretary of Commerce
    terminates under subsection (e). The effective date of any such
    order shall also be designated in the order. In the case of an
    order issued upon the petition of a person, such effective date may
    be no earlier than the date on which the Secretary receives such
    petition.
      (d)(1) Any order issued under this section shall terminate if - 
        (A) the Secretary of Commerce finds that any of the conditions
      set forth in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (a) no
      longer exist; or
        (B) mask works of nationals, domiciliaries, and sovereign
      authorities of that foreign nation or mask works first
      commercially exploited in that foreign nation become eligible for
      protection under subparagraph (A) or (C) of section 902(a)(1).

      (2) Upon the termination or expiration of an order issued under
    this section, registrations of claims of protection in mask works
    made pursuant to that order shall remain valid for the period
    specified in section 904.
      (e) The authority of the Secretary of Commerce under this section
    shall commence on the date of the enactment of this chapter, and
    shall terminate on July 1, 1995.
      (f)(1) The Secretary of Commerce shall promptly notify the
    Register of Copyrights and the Committees on the Judiciary of the
    Senate and the House of Representatives of the issuance or
    termination of any order under this section, together with a
    statement of the reasons for such action. The Secretary shall also
    publish such notification and statement of reasons in the Federal
    Register.
      (2) Two years after the date of the enactment of this chapter,
    the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Register of
    Copyrights, shall transmit to the Committees on the Judiciary of
    the Senate and the House of Representatives a report on the actions
    taken under this section and on the current status of international
    recognition of mask work protection. The report shall include such
    recommendations for modifications of the protection accorded under
    this chapter to mask works owned by nationals, domiciliaries, or
    sovereign authorities of foreign nations as the Secretary, in
    consultation with the Register of Copyrights, considers would
    promote the purposes of this chapter and international comity with
    respect to mask work protection. Not later than July 1, 1994, the
    Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Register of
    Copyrights, shall transmit to the Committees on the Judiciary of
    the Senate and the House of Representatives a report updating the
    matters contained in the report transmitted under the preceding
    sentence.

      interim protection under chapter 9 of title 17, United States
      Code, to mask works fixed in semiconductor chip products and
      originating in foreign countries that are making good faith
      efforts and reasonable progress toward providing protection, by
      treaty or legislation, to mask works of United States nationals,
      has resulted in substantial and positive legislative developments
      in foreign countries regarding protection of mask works;
        "(2) the Secretary of Commerce has determined that most of the
      industrialized countries of the world are eligible for orders
      affording interim protection under section 914 of title 17,
      United States Code;
        "(3) no multilateral treaty recognizing the protection of mask
      works has come into force, nor has the United States become bound
      by any multilateral agreement regarding such protection; and
        "(4) bilateral and multilateral relationships regarding the
      protection of mask works should be directed toward the
      international protection of mask works in an effective,
      consistent, and harmonious manner, and the existing bilateral
      authority of the Secretary of Commerce under chapter 9 of title
      17, United States Code, should be extended to facilitate the
      continued development of protection for mask works.
      "(b) Purposes. - The purposes of this Act [amending this section
    and enacting provisions set out as a note under section 901 of this
    title] are - 
        "(1) to extend the period within which the Secretary of

      bilateral and multilateral protection of mask works; and

      mask works in a consistent and harmonious manner; and
        "(5) it is inherent in section 902 of title 17, United States
      Code, that the President has the authority to revise, suspend, or
      revoke, as well as issue, proclamations extending mask work
      protection to nationals, domiciliaries, and sovereign authorities
      of other countries, if conditions warrant.
      "(b) Purposes. - The purposes of this Act [amending this section
    and section 902 of this title] are - 
        "(1) to extend the period within which the Secretary of
      Commerce may grant interim protective orders under section 914 of

        programs or data bases.

        (5)(A) A "digital musical recording" is a material object - 
          (i) in which are fixed, in a digital recording format, only
        sounds, and material, statements, or instructions incidental to

        that a digital musical recording may contain statements or
        instructions constituting the fixed sounds and incidental
        material, and statements or instructions to be used directly or
        indirectly in order to bring about the perception,
        reproduction, or communication of the fixed sounds and
        incidental material.

        (C) For purposes of this paragraph - 
          (i) a "spoken word recording" is a sound recording in which

    SUBCHAPTER C - ROYALTY PAYMENTS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1004. Royalty payments

-STATUTE-
      (a) Digital Audio Recording Devices. - 
        (1) Amount of payment. - The royalty payment due under section
      1003 for each digital audio recording device imported into and
      distributed in the United States, or manufactured and distributed
      in the United States, shall be 2 percent of the transfer price.
      Only the first person to manufacture and distribute or import and
      distribute such device shall be required to pay the royalty with
      respect to such device.
        (2) Calculation for devices distributed with other devices. -
      With respect to a digital audio recording device first
      distributed in combination with one or more devices, either as a
      physically integrated unit or as separate components, the royalty
      payment shall be calculated as follows:
          (A) If the digital audio recording device and such other
        devices are part of a physically integrated unit, the royalty
        payment shall be based on the transfer price of the unit, but
        shall be reduced by any royalty payment made on any digital
        audio recording device included within the unit that was not
        first distributed in combination with the unit.
          (B) If the digital audio recording device is not part of a
        physically integrated unit and substantially similar devices
        have been distributed separately at any time during the
        preceding 4 calendar quarters, the royalty payment shall be
        based on the average transfer price of such devices during
        those 4 quarters.
          (C) If the digital audio recording device is not part of a
        physically integrated unit and substantially similar devices
        have not been distributed separately at any time during the
        preceding 4 calendar quarters, the royalty payment shall be
        based on a constructed price reflecting the proportional value
        of such device to the combination as a whole.

        (3) Limits on royalties. - Notwithstanding paragraph (1) or
      (2), the amount of the royalty payment for each digital audio
      recording device shall not be less than $1 nor more than the
      royalty maximum. The royalty maximum shall be $8 per device,
      except that in the case of a physically integrated unit
      containing more than 1 digital audio recording device, the
      royalty maximum for such unit shall be $12. During the 6th year
      after the effective date of this chapter, and not more than once
      each year thereafter, any interested copyright party may petition
      the Copyright Royalty Judges to increase the royalty maximum and,
      if more than 20 percent of the royalty payments are at the
      relevant royalty maximum, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall
      prospectively increase such royalty maximum with the goal of
      having no more than 10 percent of such payments at the new
      royalty maximum; however the amount of any such increase as a
      percentage of the royalty maximum shall in no event exceed the
      percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index during the period
      under review.

      (b) Digital Audio Recording Media. - The royalty payment due
    under section 1003 for each digital audio recording medium imported
    into and distributed in the United States, or manufactured and
    distributed in the United States, shall be 3 percent of the
    transfer price. Only the first person to manufacture and distribute
    or import and distribute such medium shall be required to pay the
    royalty with respect to such medium.

    Sec. 1007. Procedures for distributing royalty payments

-STATUTE-
      (a) Filing of Claims and Negotiations. - 
        (1) Filing of claims. - During the first 2 months of each
      calendar year, every interested copyright party seeking to
      receive royalty payments to which such party is entitled under
      section 1006 shall file with the Copyright Royalty Judges a claim
      for payments collected during the preceding year in such form and
      manner as the Copyright Royalty Judges shall prescribe by
      regulation.
        (2) Negotiations. - Notwithstanding any provision of the
      antitrust laws, for purposes of this section interested copyright
      parties within each group specified in section 1006(b) may agree
      among themselves to the proportionate division of royalty
      payments, may lump their claims together and file them jointly or
      as a single claim, or may designate a common agent, including any
      organization described in section 1001(7)(D), to negotiate or
      receive payment on their behalf; except that no agreement under
      this subsection may modify the allocation of royalties specified
      in section 1006(b).

      (b) Distribution of Payments in the Absence of a Dispute. - After
    the period established for the filing of claims under subsection
    (a), in each year, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall determine
    whether there exists a controversy concerning the distribution of
    royalty payments under section 1006(c). If the Copyright Royalty
    Judges determine that no such controversy exists, the Copyright
    Royalty Judges shall, within 30 days after such determination,
    authorize the distribution of the royalty payments as set forth in
    the agreements regarding the distribution of royalty payments
    entered into pursuant to subsection (a). The Librarian of Congress
    shall, before such royalty payments are distributed, deduct the
    reasonable administrative costs incurred under this section.
      (c) Resolution of Disputes. - If the Copyright Royalty Judges
    find the existence of a controversy, the Copyright Royalty Judges
    shall, pursuant to chapter 8 of this title, conduct a proceeding to
    determine the distribution of royalty payments. During the pendency
    of such a proceeding, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall withhold
    from distribution an amount sufficient to satisfy all claims with
    respect to which a controversy exists, but shall, to the extent
    feasible, authorize the distribution of any amounts that are not in
    controversy. The Librarian of Congress shall, before such royalty
    payments are distributed, deduct the reasonable administrative
    costs incurred under this section.

    distribution in the United States of a digital audio recording
    device or a digital audio interface device, any party
    manufacturing, importing, or distributing such device, and any
    interested copyright party may mutually agree to petition the
    Copyright Royalty Judges to determine whether such device is
    subject to section 1002, or the basis on which royalty payments for
    such device are to be made under section 1003.
      (b) Initiation of Proceedings. - The parties under subsection (a)
    shall file the petition with the Copyright Royalty Judges
    requesting the commencement of a proceeding. Within 2 weeks after
    receiving such a petition, the Chief Copyright Royalty Judge shall
    cause notice to be published in the Federal Register of the
    initiation of the proceeding.
      (c) Stay of Judicial Proceedings. - Any civil action brought
    under section 1009 against a party to a proceeding under this
    section shall, on application of one of the parties to the
    proceeding, be stayed until completion of the proceeding.
      (d) Proceeding. - The Copyright Royalty Judges shall conduct a
    proceeding with respect to the matter concerned, in accordance with
    such procedures as the Copyright Royalty Judges may adopt. The
    Copyright Royalty Judges shall act on the basis of a fully
    documented written record. Any party to the proceeding may submit

    costs of participation.
      (e) Judicial Review. - Any determination of the Copyright Royalty
    Judges under subsection (d) may be appealed, by a party to the
    proceeding, in accordance with section 803(d) of this title. The
    pendency of an appeal under this subsection shall not stay the
    determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges. If the court
    modifies the determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges, the
    court shall have jurisdiction to enter its own decision in
    accordance with its final judgment. The court may further vacate
    the determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges and remand the
    case for proceedings as provided in this section.

    CHAPTER 12 - COPYRIGHT PROTECTION AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1201. Circumvention of copyright protection systems

-STATUTE-
      (a) Violations Regarding Circumvention of Technological Measures.
    - (1)(A) No person shall circumvent a technological measure that
    effectively controls access to a work protected under this title.
    The prohibition contained in the preceding sentence shall take
    effect at the end of the 2-year period beginning on the date of the
    enactment of this chapter.
      (B) The prohibition contained in subparagraph (A) shall not apply
    to persons who are users of a copyrighted work which is in a
    particular class of works, if such persons are, or are likely to be
    in the succeeding 3-year period, adversely affected by virtue of
    such prohibition in their ability to make noninfringing uses of
    that particular class of works under this title, as determined
    under subparagraph (C).
      (C) During the 2-year period described in subparagraph (A), and
    during each succeeding 3-year period, the Librarian of Congress,
    upon the recommendation of the Register of Copyrights, who shall
    consult with the Assistant Secretary for Communications and
    Information of the Department of Commerce and report and comment on
    his or her views in making such recommendation, shall make the
    determination in a rulemaking proceeding for purposes of
    subparagraph (B) of whether persons who are users of a copyrighted
    work are, or are likely to be in the succeeding 3-year period,
    adversely affected by the prohibition under subparagraph (A) in
    their ability to make noninfringing uses under this title of a
    particular class of copyrighted works. In conducting such
    rulemaking, the Librarian shall examine - 
        (i) the availability for use of copyrighted works;
        (ii) the availability for use of works for nonprofit archival,
      preservation, and educational purposes;
        (iii) the impact that the prohibition on the circumvention of
      technological measures applied to copyrighted works has on
      criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or
      research;
        (iv) the effect of circumvention of technological measures on
      the market for or value of copyrighted works; and
        (v) such other factors as the Librarian considers appropriate.

      (D) The Librarian shall publish any class of copyrighted works
    for which the Librarian has determined, pursuant to the rulemaking
    conducted under subparagraph (C), that noninfringing uses by
    persons who are users of a copyrighted work are, or are likely to
    be, adversely affected, and the prohibition contained in
    subparagraph (A) shall not apply to such users with respect to such
    class of works for the ensuing 3-year period.
      (E) Neither the exception under subparagraph (B) from the
    applicability of the prohibition contained in subparagraph (A), nor
    any determination made in a rulemaking conducted under subparagraph
    (C), may be used as a defense in any action to enforce any
    provision of this title other than this paragraph.
      (2) No person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public,
    provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service,
    device, component, or part thereof, that - 
        (A) is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of
      circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls
      access to a work protected under this title;
        (B) has only limited commercially significant purpose or use
      other than to circumvent a technological measure that effectively
      controls access to a work protected under this title; or
        (C) is marketed by that person or another acting in concert
      with that person with that person's knowledge for use in
      circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls
      access to a work protected under this title.

      (3) As used in this subsection - 
        (A) to "circumvent a technological measure" means to descramble
      a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to
      avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological
      measure, without the authority of the copyright owner; and
        (B) a technological measure "effectively controls access to a
      work" if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation,
      requires the application of information, or a process or a
      treatment, with the authority of the copyright owner, to gain
      access to the work.

      (b) Additional Violations. - (1) No person shall manufacture,
    import, offer to the public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any
    technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof,
    that - 
        (A) is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of
      circumventing protection afforded by a technological measure that
      effectively protects a right of a copyright owner under this
      title in a work or a portion thereof;
        (B) has only limited commercially significant purpose or use
      other than to circumvent protection afforded by a technological
      measure that effectively protects a right of a copyright owner
      under this title in a work or a portion thereof; or
        (C) is marketed by that person or another acting in concert
      with that person with that person's knowledge for use in
      circumventing protection afforded by a technological measure that
      effectively protects a right of a copyright owner under this
      title in a work or a portion thereof.

      (2) As used in this subsection - 
        (A) to "circumvent protection afforded by a technological
      measure" means avoiding, bypassing, removing, deactivating, or
      otherwise impairing a technological measure; and
        (B) a technological measure "effectively protects a right of a
      copyright owner under this title" if the measure, in the ordinary
      course of its operation, prevents, restricts, or otherwise limits
      the exercise of a right of a copyright owner under this title.

      (c) Other Rights, Etc., Not Affected. - (1) Nothing in this
    section shall affect rights, remedies, limitations, or defenses to
    copyright infringement, including fair use, under this title.
      (2) Nothing in this section shall enlarge or diminish vicarious
    or contributory liability for copyright infringement in connection
    with any technology, product, service, device, component, or part
    thereof.
      (3) Nothing in this section shall require that the design of, or
    design and selection of parts and components for, a consumer
    electronics, telecommunications, or computing product provide for a
    response to any particular technological measure, so long as such
    part or component, or the product in which such part or component
    is integrated, does not otherwise fall within the prohibitions of
    subsection (a)(2) or (b)(1).
      (4) Nothing in this section shall enlarge or diminish any rights
    of free speech or the press for activities using consumer
    electronics, telecommunications, or computing products.
      (d) Exemption for Nonprofit Libraries, Archives, and Educational
    Institutions. - (1) A nonprofit library, archives, or educational
    institution which gains access to a commercially exploited
    copyrighted work solely in order to make a good faith determination
    of whether to acquire a copy of that work for the sole purpose of
    engaging in conduct permitted under this title shall not be in
    violation of subsection (a)(1)(A). A copy of a work to which access
    has been gained under this paragraph - 
        (A) may not be retained longer than necessary to make such good
      faith determination; and
        (B) may not be used for any other purpose.

      (2) The exemption made available under paragraph (1) shall only
    apply with respect to a work when an identical copy of that work is
    not reasonably available in another form.
      (3) A nonprofit library, archives, or educational institution
    that willfully for the purpose of commercial advantage or financial
    gain violates paragraph (1) - 
        (A) shall, for the first offense, be subject to the civil
      remedies under section 1203; and
        (B) shall, for repeated or subsequent offenses, in addition to
      the civil remedies under section 1203, forfeit the exemption
      provided under paragraph (1).

      (4) This subsection may not be used as a defense to a claim under
    subsection (a)(2) or (b), nor may this subsection permit a
    nonprofit library, archives, or educational institution to
    manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or otherwise
    traffic in any technology, product, service, component, or part
    thereof, which circumvents a technological measure.
      (5) In order for a library or archives to qualify for the
    exemption under this subsection, the collections of that library or
    archives shall be - 
        (A) open to the public; or
        (B) available not only to researchers affiliated with the
      library or archives or with the institution of which it is a
      part, but also to other persons doing research in a specialized
      field.

      (e) Law Enforcement, Intelligence, and Other Government
    Activities. - This section does not prohibit any lawfully
    authorized investigative, protective, information security, or
    intelligence activity of an officer, agent, or employee of the
    United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, or a
    person acting pursuant to a contract with the United States, a
    State, or a political subdivision of a State. For purposes of this
    subsection, the term "information security" means activities
    carried out in order to identify and address the vulnerabilities of
    a government computer, computer system, or computer network.
      (f) Reverse Engineering. - (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of
    subsection (a)(1)(A), a person who has lawfully obtained the right
    to use a copy of a computer program may circumvent a technological
    measure that effectively controls access to a particular portion of
    that program for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing
    those elements of the program that are necessary to achieve
    interoperability of an independently created computer program with
    other programs, and that have not previously been readily available
    to the person engaging in the circumvention, to the extent any such
    acts of identification and analysis do not constitute infringement
    under this title.
      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)(2) and (b),
    a person may develop and employ technological means to circumvent a
    technological measure, or to circumvent protection afforded by a
    technological measure, in order to enable the identification and
    analysis under paragraph (1), or for the purpose of enabling
    interoperability of an independently created computer program with
    other programs, if such means are necessary to achieve such
    interoperability, to the extent that doing so does not constitute
    infringement under this title.
      (3) The information acquired through the acts permitted under
    paragraph (1), and the means permitted under paragraph (2), may be
    made available to others if the person referred to in paragraph (1)
    or (2), as the case may be, provides such information or means
    solely for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an
    independently created computer program with other programs, and to
    the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under
    this title or violate applicable law other than this section.
      (4) For purposes of this subsection, the term "interoperability"
    means the ability of computer programs to exchange information, and
    of such programs mutually to use the information which has been
    exchanged.
      (g) Encryption Research. - 
        (1) Definitions. - For purposes of this subsection - 
          (A) the term "encryption research" means activities necessary
        to identify and analyze flaws and vulnerabilities of encryption
        technologies applied to copyrighted works, if these activities
        are conducted to advance the state of knowledge in the field of
        encryption technology or to assist in the development of
        encryption products; and
          (B) the term "encryption technology" means the scrambling and
        descrambling of information using mathematical formulas or
        algorithms.

        (2) Permissible acts of encryption research. - Notwithstanding
      the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), it is not a violation of
      that subsection for a person to circumvent a technological
      measure as applied to a copy, phonorecord, performance, or
      display of a published work in the course of an act of good faith
      encryption research if - 
          (A) the person lawfully obtained the encrypted copy,
        phonorecord, performance, or display of the published work;
          (B) such act is necessary to conduct such encryption
        research;
          (C) the person made a good faith effort to obtain
        authorization before the circumvention; and
          (D) such act does not constitute infringement under this
        title or a violation of applicable law other than this section,
        including section 1030 of title 18 and those provisions of
        title 18 amended by the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.

        (3) Factors in determining exemption. - In determining whether
      a person qualifies for the exemption under paragraph (2), the
      factors to be considered shall include - 
          (A) whether the information derived from the encryption
        research was disseminated, and if so, whether it was
        disseminated in a manner reasonably calculated to advance the
        state of knowledge or development of encryption technology,
        versus whether it was disseminated in a manner that facilitates
        infringement under this title or a violation of applicable law
        other than this section, including a violation of privacy or
        breach of security;
          (B) whether the person is engaged in a legitimate course of
        study, is employed, or is appropriately trained or experienced,
        in the field of encryption technology; and
          (C) whether the person provides the copyright owner of the
        work to which the technological measure is applied with notice
        of the findings and documentation of the research, and the time
        when such notice is provided.

        (4) Use of technological means for research activities. -
      Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(2), it is not a
      violation of that subsection for a person to - 
          (A) develop and employ technological means to circumvent a
        technological measure for the sole purpose of that person
        performing the acts of good faith encryption research described
        in paragraph (2); and
          (B) provide the technological means to another person with
        whom he or she is working collaboratively for the purpose of
        conducting the acts of good faith encryption research described

      (h) Exceptions Regarding Minors. - In applying subsection (a) to
    a component or part, the court may consider the necessity for its
    intended and actual incorporation in a technology, product,
    service, or device, which - 
        (1) does not itself violate the provisions of this title; and
        (2) has the sole purpose to prevent the access of minors to
      material on the Internet.

      (i) Protection of Personally Identifying Information. - 
        (1) Circumvention permitted. - Notwithstanding the provisions
      of subsection (a)(1)(A), it is not a violation of that subsection
      for a person to circumvent a technological measure that
      effectively controls access to a work protected under this title,
      if - 
          (A) the technological measure, or the work it protects,
        contains the capability of collecting or disseminating
        personally identifying information reflecting the online
        activities of a natural person who seeks to gain access to the
        work protected;
          (B) in the normal course of its operation, the technological
        measure, or the work it protects, collects or disseminates
        personally identifying information about the person who seeks
        to gain access to the work protected, without providing
        conspicuous notice of such collection or dissemination to such
        person, and without providing such person with the capability
        to prevent or restrict such collection or dissemination;
          (C) the act of circumvention has the sole effect of
        identifying and disabling the capability described in
        subparagraph (A), and has no other effect on the ability of any
        person to gain access to any work; and
          (D) the act of circumvention is carried out solely for the
        purpose of preventing the collection or dissemination of
        personally identifying information about a natural person who
        seeks to gain access to the work protected, and is not in
        violation of any other law.

        (2) Inapplicability to certain technological measures. - This
      subsection does not apply to a technological measure, or a work
      it protects, that does not collect or disseminate personally
      identifying information and that is disclosed to a user as not
      having or using such capability.

      testing, investigating, or correcting, a security flaw or
      vulnerability, with the authorization of the owner or operator of
      such computer, computer system, or computer network.
        (2) Permissible acts of security testing. - Notwithstanding the
      provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), it is not a violation of that
      subsection for a person to engage in an act of security testing,
      if such act does not constitute infringement under this title or
      a violation of applicable law other than this section, including
      section 1030 of title 18 and those provisions of title 18 amended
      by the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.
        (3) Factors in determining exemption. - In determining whether
      a person qualifies for the exemption under paragraph (2), the
      factors to be considered shall include - 
          (A) whether the information derived from the security testing
        was used solely to promote the security of the owner or
        operator of such computer, computer system or computer network,
        or shared directly with the developer of such computer,
        computer system, or computer network; and
          (B) whether the information derived from the security testing

        VHS format analog video cassette recorder, or an 8mm format
        analog cassette recorder, shall be required to conform to the
        four-line colorstripe copy control technology in the initial
        model of any such recorder manufactured after the date of the
        enactment of this chapter, and thereafter to continue
        conforming to the four-line colorstripe copy control
        technology. For purposes of this subparagraph, an analog video
        cassette recorder "conforms to" the four-line colorstripe copy
        control technology if it records a signal that, when played
        back by the playback function of that recorder in the normal
        viewing mode, exhibits, on a reference display device, a
        display containing distracting visible lines through portions
        of the viewable picture.

        (2) Certain encoding restrictions. - No person shall apply the
      automatic gain control copy control technology or colorstripe
      copy control technology to prevent or limit consumer copying
      except such copying - 
          (A) of a single transmission, or specified group of
        transmissions, of live events or of audiovisual works for which
        a member of the public has exercised choice in selecting the
        transmissions, including the content of the transmissions or
        the time of receipt of such transmissions, or both, and as to
        which such member is charged a separate fee for each such
        transmission or specified group of transmissions;
          (B) from a copy of a transmission of a live event or an
        audiovisual work if such transmission is provided by a channel
        or service where payment is made by a member of the public for
        such channel or service in the form of a subscription fee that
        entitles the member of the public to receive all of the
        programming contained in such channel or service;
          (C) from a physical medium containing one or more prerecorded
        audiovisual works; or
          (D) from a copy of a transmission described in subparagraph
        (A) or from a copy made from a physical medium described in
        subparagraph (C).

      In the event that a transmission meets both the conditions set
      forth in subparagraph (A) and those set forth in subparagraph
      (B), the transmission shall be treated as a transmission
      described in subparagraph (A).
        (3) Inapplicability. - This subsection shall not - 
          (A) require any analog video cassette camcorder to conform to

    (a), the court - 
        (1) may grant temporary and permanent injunctions on such terms

      press protected under the 1st amendment to the Constitution;
        (2) at any time while an action is pending, may order the
      impounding, on such terms as it deems reasonable, of any device
      or product that is in the custody or control of the alleged
      violator and that the court has reasonable cause to believe was
      involved in a violation;
        (3) may award damages under subsection (c);
        (4) in its discretion may allow the recovery of costs by or

      actual damages, if the complaining party elects such damages at
      any time before final judgment is entered.
        (3) Statutory damages. - (A) At any time before final judgment
      is entered, a complaining party may elect to recover an award of
      statutory damages for each violation of section 1201 in the sum

      circumvention, device, product, component, offer, or performance
      of service, as the court considers just.

      more than $25,000.
        (4) Repeated violations. - In any case in which the injured

      person has violated section 1201 or 1202 within 3 years after a
      final judgment was entered against the person for another such
      violation, the court may increase the award of damages up to
      triple the amount that would otherwise be awarded, as the court
      considers just.
        (5) Innocent violations. - 
          (A) In general. - The court in its discretion may reduce or
        remit the total award of damages in any case in which the
        violator sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds,
        that the violator was not aware and had no reason to believe
        that its acts constituted a violation.
          (B) Nonprofit library, archives, educational institutions, or
        public broadcasting entities. - 
            (i) Definition. - In this subparagraph, the term "public

    Sec. 1301. Designs protected

-STATUTE-
      (a) Designs Protected. - 
        (1) In general. - The designer or other owner of an original
      design of a useful article which makes the article attractive or
      distinctive in appearance to the purchasing or using public may
      secure the protection provided by this chapter upon complying
      with and subject to this chapter.
        (2) Vessel features. - The design of a vessel hull, deck, or
      combination of a hull and deck, including a plug or mold, is
      subject to protection under this chapter, notwithstanding section
      1302(4).
        (3) Exceptions. - Department of Defense rights in a registered
      design under this chapter, including the right to build to such
      registered design, shall be determined solely by operation of
      section 2320 of title 10 or by the instrument under which the
      design was developed for the United States Government.

      (b) Definitions. - For the purpose of this chapter, the following
    terms have the following meanings:
        (1) A design is "original" if it is the result of the
      designer's creative endeavor that provides a distinguishable
      variation over prior work pertaining to similar articles which is
      more than merely trivial and has not been copied from another
      source.
        (2) A "useful article" is a vessel hull or deck, including a
      plug or mold, which in normal use has an intrinsic utilitarian
      function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the
      article or to convey information. An article which normally is
      part of a useful article shall be deemed to be a useful article.
        (3) A "vessel" is a craft - 
          (A) that is designed and capable of independently steering a
        course on or through water through its own means of propulsion;
        and
          (B) that is designed and capable of carrying and transporting
        one or more passengers.

        (4) A "hull" is the exterior frame or body of a vessel,
      exclusive of the deck, superstructure, masts, sails, yards,
      rigging, hardware, fixtures, and other attachments.
        (5) A "plug" means a device or model used to make a mold for
      the purpose of exact duplication, regardless of whether the
      device or model has an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not
      only to portray the appearance of the product or to convey
      information.
        (6) A "mold" means a matrix or form in which a substance for
      material is used, regardless of whether the matrix or form has an
      intrinsic utilitarian function that is not only to portray the
      appearance of the product or to convey information.
        (7) A "deck" is the horizontal surface of a vessel that covers
      the hull, including exterior cabin and cockpit surfaces, and
      exclusive of masts, sails, yards, rigging, hardware, fixtures,
      and other attachments.

    which protection is sought under this chapter is made public under
    section 1310(b), the owner of the design shall, subject to the
    provisions of section 1307, mark it or have it marked legibly with
    a design notice consisting of -

      Des.", or the letter "D" with a circle, or the symbol "*D*";
        (B) the year of the date on which protection for the design
      commenced; and
        (C) the name of the owner, an abbreviation by which the name
      can be recognized, or a generally accepted alternative
      designation of the owner.

    Any distinctive identification of the owner may be used for
    purposes of subparagraph (C) if it has been recorded by the
    Administrator before the design marked with such identification is
    registered.
      (2) After registration, the registration number may be used
    instead of the elements specified in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of
    paragraph (1).
      (b) Location of Notice. - The design notice shall be so located
    and applied as to give reasonable notice of design protection while
    the useful article embodying the design is passing through its
    normal channels of commerce.
      (c) Subsequent Removal of Notice. - When the owner of a design
    has complied with the provisions of this section, protection under
    this chapter shall not be affected by the removal, destruction, or
    obliteration by others of the design notice on an article.

      (a) Actions With Notice. - Except as provided in subsection (b),
    the omission of the notice prescribed in section 1306 shall not

    undertaking leading to infringement under this chapter.
      (b) Actions Without Notice. - The omission of the notice
    prescribed in section 1306 shall prevent any recovery under section
    1323 against a person who began an undertaking leading to
    infringement under this chapter before receiving written notice of
    the design protection. No injunction shall be issued under this
    chapter with respect to such undertaking unless the owner of the
    design reimburses that person for any reasonable expenditure or
    contractual obligation in connection with such undertaking that was
    incurred before receiving written notice of the design protection,
    as the court in its discretion directs. The burden of providing
    written notice of design protection shall be on the owner of the
    design.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Acts of Infringement. - Except as provided in subsection (b),
    it shall be infringement of the exclusive rights in a design
    protected under this chapter for any person, without the consent of
    the owner of the design, within the United States and during the
    term of such protection, to - 
        (1) make, have made, or import, for sale or for use in trade,
      any infringing article as defined in subsection (e); or
        (2) sell or distribute for sale or for use in trade any such
      infringing article.

      (b) Acts of Sellers and Distributors. - A seller or distributor
    of an infringing article who did not make or import the article
    shall be deemed to have infringed on a design protected under this
    chapter only if that person - 
        (1) induced or acted in collusion with a manufacturer to make,
      or an importer to import such article, except that merely
      purchasing or giving an order to purchase such article in the
      ordinary course of business shall not of itself constitute such
      inducement or collusion; or
        (2) refused or failed, upon the request of the owner of the
      design, to make a prompt and full disclosure of that person's
      source of such article, and that person orders or reorders such
      article after receiving notice by registered or certified mail of
      the protection subsisting in the design.

      (c) Acts Without Knowledge. - It shall not be infringement under
    this section to make, have made, import, sell, or distribute, any
    article embodying a design which was created without knowledge that
    a design was protected under this chapter and was copied from such
    protected design.
      (d) Acts in Ordinary Course of Business. - A person who
    incorporates into that person's product of manufacture an
    infringing article acquired from others in the ordinary course of
    business, or who, without knowledge of the protected design
    embodied in an infringing article, makes or processes the
    infringing article for the account of another person in the
    ordinary course of business, shall not be deemed to have infringed
    the rights in that design under this chapter except under a
    condition contained in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (b).
    Accepting an order or reorder from the source of the infringing
    article shall be deemed ordering or reordering within the meaning
    of subsection (b)(2).
      (e) Infringing Article Defined. - As used in this section, an
    "infringing article" is any article the design of which has been
    copied from a design protected under this chapter, without the
    consent of the owner of the protected design. An infringing article
    is not an illustration or picture of a protected design in an
    advertisement, book, periodical, newspaper, photograph, broadcast,
    motion picture, or similar medium. A design shall not be deemed to
    have been copied from a protected design if it is original and not
    substantially similar in appearance to a protected design.
      (f) Establishing Originality. - The party to any action or
    proceeding under this chapter who alleges rights under this chapter
    in a design shall have the burden of establishing the design's
    originality whenever the opposing party introduces an earlier work
    which is identical to such design, or so similar as to make prima
    facie showing that such design was copied from such work.
      (g) Reproduction for Teaching or Analysis. - It is not an
    infringement of the exclusive rights of a design owner for a person
    to reproduce the design in a useful article or in any other form
    solely for the purpose of teaching, analyzing, or evaluating the
    appearance, concepts, or techniques embodied in the design, or the
    function of the useful article embodying the design.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Time Limit for Application for Registration. - Protection
    under this chapter shall be lost if application for registration of
    the design is not made within 2 years after the date on which the
    design is first made public.
      (b) When Design is Made Public. - A design is made public when an
    existing useful article embodying the design is anywhere publicly
    exhibited, publicly distributed, or offered for sale or sold to the
    public by the owner of the design or with the owner's consent.
      (c) Application by Owner of Design. - Application for
    registration may be made by the owner of the design.
      (d) Contents of Application. - The application for registration
    shall be made to the Administrator and shall state - 
        (1) the name and address of the designer or designers of the
      design;
        (2) the name and address of the owner if different from the
      designer;
        (3) the specific name of the useful article embodying the
      design;
        (4) the date, if any, that the design was first made public, if
      such date was earlier than the date of the application;
        (5) affirmation that the design has been fixed in a useful
      article; and
        (6) such other information as may be required by the
      Administrator.

    The application for registration may include a description setting
    forth the salient features of the design, but the absence of such a
    description shall not prevent registration under this chapter.
      (e) Sworn Statement. - The application for registration shall be
    accompanied by a statement under oath by the applicant or the
    applicant's duly authorized agent or representative, setting forth,
    to the best of the applicant's knowledge and belief - 
        (1) that the design is original and was created by the designer
      or designers named in the application;
        (2) that the design has not previously been registered on
      behalf of the applicant or the applicant's predecessor in title;
      and
        (3) that the applicant is the person entitled to protection and
      to registration under this chapter.

    If the design has been made public with the design notice
    prescribed in section 1306, the statement shall also describe the
    exact form and position of the design notice.
      (f) Effect of Errors. - (1) Error in any statement or assertion
    as to the utility of the useful article named in the application
    under this section, the design of which is sought to be registered,
    shall not affect the protection secured under this chapter.
      (2) Errors in omitting a joint designer or in naming an alleged
    joint designer shall not affect the validity of the registration,
    or the actual ownership or the protection of the design, unless it
    is shown that the error occurred with deceptive intent.
      (g) Design Made in Scope of Employment. - In a case in which the
    design was made within the regular scope of the designer's
    employment and individual authorship of the design is difficult or
    impossible to ascribe and the application so states, the name and
    address of the employer for whom the design was made may be stated
    instead of that of the individual designer.
      (h) Pictorial Representation of Design. - The application for
    registration shall be accompanied by two copies of a drawing or
    other pictorial representation of the useful article embodying the
    design, having one or more views, adequate to show the design, in a
    form and style suitable for reproduction, which shall be deemed a
    part of the application.
      (i) Design in More Than One Useful Article. - If the
    distinguishing elements of a design are in substantially the same
    form in different useful articles, the design shall be protected as
    to all such useful articles when protected as to one of them, but
    not more than one registration shall be required for the design.
      (j) Application for More Than One Design. - More than one design
    may be included in the same application under such conditions as
    may be prescribed by the Administrator. For each design included in
    an application the fee prescribed for a single design shall be
    paid.

    Sec. 1313. Examination of application and issue or refusal of
      registration

-STATUTE-
      (a) Determination of Registrability of Design; Registration. -
    Upon the filing of an application for registration in proper form
    under section 1310, and upon payment of the fee prescribed under
    section 1316, the Administrator shall determine whether or not the
    application relates to a design which on its face appears to be
    subject to protection under this chapter, and, if so, the Register
    shall register the design. Registration under this subsection shall
    be announced by publication. The date of registration shall be the
    date of publication.
      (b) Refusal To Register; Reconsideration. - If, in the judgment
    of the Administrator, the application for registration relates to a
    design which on its face is not subject to protection under this
    chapter, the Administrator shall send to the applicant a notice of
    refusal to register and the grounds for the refusal. Within 3
    months after the date on which the notice of refusal is sent, the
    applicant may, by written request, seek reconsideration of the
    application. After consideration of such a request, the
    Administrator shall either register the design or send to the
    applicant a notice of final refusal to register.
      (c) Application To Cancel Registration. - Any person who believes
    he or she is or will be damaged by a registration under this
    chapter may, upon payment of the prescribed fee, apply to the
    Administrator at any time to cancel the registration on the ground
    that the design is not subject to protection under this chapter,
    stating the reasons for the request. Upon receipt of an application
    for cancellation, the Administrator shall send to the owner of the
    design, as shown in the records of the Office of the Administrator,
    a notice of the application, and the owner shall have a period of 3
    months after the date on which such notice is mailed in which to
    present arguments to the Administrator for support of the validity
    of the registration. The Administrator shall also have the
    authority to establish, by regulation, conditions under which the
    opposing parties may appear and be heard in support of their
    arguments. If, after the periods provided for the presentation of
    arguments have expired, the Administrator determines that the
    applicant for cancellation has established that the design is not
    subject to protection under this chapter, the Administrator shall
    order the registration stricken from the record. Cancellation under
    this subsection shall be announced by publication, and notice of
    the Administrator's final determination with respect to any
    application for cancellation shall be sent to the applicant and to
    the owner of record. Costs of the cancellation procedure under this
    subsection shall be borne by the nonprevailing party or parties,
    and the Administrator shall have the authority to assess and
    collect such costs.

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - The owner of a design is entitled, after
    issuance of a certificate of registration of the design under this
    chapter, to institute an action for any infringement of the design.
      (b) Review of Refusal To Register. - (1) Subject to paragraph
    (2), the owner of a design may seek judicial review of a final
    refusal of the Administrator to register the design under this
    chapter by bringing a civil action, and may in the same action, if
    the court adjudges the design subject to protection under this
    chapter, enforce the rights in that design under this chapter.
      (2) The owner of a design may seek judicial review under this
    section if - 
        (A) the owner has previously duly filed and prosecuted to final
      refusal an application in proper form for registration of the
      design;
        (B) the owner causes a copy of the complaint in the action to
      be delivered to the Administrator within 10 days after the
      commencement of the action; and
        (C) the defendant has committed acts in respect to the design
      which would constitute infringement with respect to a design
      protected under this chapter.

      (c) Administrator as Party to Action. - The Administrator may, at
    the Administrator's option, become a party to the action with
    respect to the issue of registrability of the design claim by
    entering an appearance within 60 days after being served with the
    complaint, but the failure of the Administrator to become a party
    shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction to determine that
    issue.
      (d) Use of Arbitration To Resolve Dispute. - The parties to an
    infringement dispute under this chapter, within such time as may be
    specified by the Administrator by regulation, may determine the
    dispute, or any aspect of the dispute, by arbitration. Arbitration
    shall be governed by title 9. The parties shall give notice of any
    arbitration award to the Administrator, and such award shall, as
    between the parties to the arbitration, be dispositive of the
    issues to which it relates. The arbitration award shall be
    unenforceable until such notice is given. Nothing in this
    subsection shall preclude the Administrator from determining
    whether a design is subject to registration in a cancellation
    proceeding under section 1313(c).

    restraining orders and preliminary injunctions.

    or distributor who suffers damage by reason of injunctive relief
    wrongfully obtained under this section has a cause of action
    against the applicant for such injunctive relief and may recover
    such relief as may be appropriate, including damages for lost
    profits, cost of materials, loss of good will, and punitive damages
    in instances where the injunctive relief was sought in bad faith,
    and, unless the court finds extenuating circumstances, reasonable
    attorney's fees.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Damages. - Upon a finding for the claimant in an action for
    infringement under this chapter, the court shall award the claimant
    damages adequate to compensate for the infringement. In addition,
    the court may increase the damages to such amount, not exceeding
    $50,000 or $1 per copy, whichever is greater, as the court
    determines to be just. The damages awarded shall constitute
    compensation and not a penalty. The court may receive expert
    testimony as an aid to the determination of damages.
      (b) Infringer's Profits. - As an alternative to the remedies
    provided in subsection (a), the court may award the claimant the
    infringer's profits resulting from the sale of the copies if the
    court finds that the infringer's sales are reasonably related to
    the use of the claimant's design. In such a case, the claimant
    shall be required to prove only the amount of the infringer's sales
    and the infringer shall be required to prove its expenses against
    such sales.
      (c) Statute of Limitations. - No recovery under subsection (a) or
    (b) shall be had for any infringement committed more than 3 years
    before the date on which the complaint is filed.
      (d) Attorney's Fees. - In an action for infringement under this
    chapter, the court may award reasonable attorney's fees to the
    prevailing party.
      (e) Disposition of Infringing and Other Articles. - The court may
    order that all infringing articles, and any plates, molds,
    patterns, models, or other means specifically adapted for making
    the articles, be delivered up for destruction or other disposition
    as the court may direct.

    directed by the Secretary of the Treasury or the court, as the case
    may be, except that the articles may be returned to the country of

    believing that his or her acts constituted a violation of the law.
