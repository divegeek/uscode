    constitute a violation of a State law regulating the importation or
    transportation of any intoxicating liquor, the attorney general may
    bring a civil action in accordance with this section for injunctive
    relief (including a preliminary or permanent injunction) against
    the person, as the attorney general determines to be necessary to -
    
        (1) restrain the person from engaging, or continuing to engage,
      in the violation; and
        (2) enforce compliance with the State law.
    (c) Federal jurisdiction
      (1) In general
        The district courts of the United States shall have

      liquor in such State.
      (2) Venue
        An action under this section may be brought only in accordance

      injunctive relief (a preliminary and/or permanent injunction).
      (4) No right to jury trial
        An action under this section shall be tried before the court.
    (d) Requirements for injunctions and orders

      section has taken place or is taking place.
      (2) Additional showing for preliminary injunction

          (C) describe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to
        the complaint or other document, the act or acts sought to be
        restrained; and
          (D) be binding upon - 
            (i) the parties to the action and the officers, agents,
          employees, and attorneys of those parties; and
            (ii) persons in active concert or participation with the
          parties to the action who receive actual notice of the order
          by personal service or otherwise.
      (5) Admissibility of evidence
        In a hearing on an application for a permanent injunction, any
      evidence previously received on an application for a preliminary
      injunction in connection with the same civil action and that
      would otherwise be admissible, may be made a part of the record
      of the hearing on the permanent injunction.

      Constitution of the United States as such article of amendment is
      interpreted by the Supreme Court of the United States including

        A remedy under this section is in addition to any other
      remedies provided by law.
      (2) State court proceedings
        Nothing in this section may be construed to prohibit an
      authorized State official from proceeding in State court on the
      basis of an alleged violation of any State law.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 204. Permits

-STATUTE-
    (a) Who entitled thereto
      The following persons shall, on application therefor, be entitled
    to a basic permit:
        (1) Any person who, on May 25, 1935, held a basic permit as
      distiller, rectifier, wine producer, or importer issued by an
      agency of the Federal Government.
        (2) Any other person unless the Secretary of the Treasury finds
      (A) that such person (or in case of a corporation, any of its
      officers, directors, or principal stockholders) has, within five
      years prior to the date of application, been convicted of a
      felony under Federal or State law or has, within three years
      prior to date of application, been convicted of a misdemeanor
      under any Federal law relating to liquor, including the taxation
      thereof; or (B) that such person is, by reason of his business
      experience, financial standing, or trade connections, not likely
      to commence operations within a reasonable period or to maintain
      such operations in conformity with Federal law; or (C) that the
      operations proposed to be conducted by such person are in
      violation of the law of the State in which they are to be
      conducted.
    (b) Refusal of permit; hearing
      If upon examination of any application for a basic permit the
    Secretary of the Treasury has reason to believe that the applicant
    is not entitled to such permit, he shall notify the applicant
    thereof and, upon request by the applicant, afford him due notice
    and opportunity for hearing on the application. If the Secretary of
    the Treasury, after affording such notice and opportunity for
    hearing, finds that the applicant is not entitled to a basic permit
    hereunder, he shall by order deny the application stating the
    findings which are the basis for his order.
    (c) Form of application
      The Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe the manner and form
    of all applications for basic permits (including the facts to be
    set forth therein) and the form of all basic permits, and shall
    specify in any basic permit the authority conferred by the permit
    and the conditions thereof in accordance with the provisions of
    this subchapter. To the extent deemed necessary by the Secretary of
    the Treasury for the efficient administration of this subchapter,
    separate applications and permits shall be required by the
    Secretary of the Treasury with respect to distilled spirits, wine,
    and malt beverages, and the various classes thereof, and with
    respect to the various classes of persons entitled to permits
    hereunder. The issuance of a basic permit under this subchapter
    shall not operate to deprive the United States of its remedy for
    any violation of law.
    (d) Conditions
      A basic permit shall be conditioned upon compliance with the
    requirements of section 205 of this title (relating to unfair
    competition and unlawful practices) and of section 206 of this
    title (relating to bulk sales and bottling), with the twenty-first
    amendment and laws relating to the enforcement thereof, and with
    all other Federal laws relating to distilled spirits, wine, and
    malt beverages, including taxes with respect thereto.
    (e) Revocation, suspension, and annulment
      A basic permit shall by order of the Secretary of the Treasury,
    after due notice and opportunity for hearing to the permittee, (1)
    be revoked, or suspended for such period as the Secretary of the
    Treasury deems appropriate, if the Secretary finds that the
    permittee has wilfully violated any of the conditions thereof,
    provided that for a first violation of the conditions thereof the
    permit shall be subject to suspension only; or (2) be revoked if
    the Secretary finds that the permittee has not engaged in the
    operations authorized by the permit for a period of more than two
    years; or (3) be annulled if the Secretary finds that the permit
    was procured through fraud, or misrepresentation, or concealment of
    material fact. The order shall state the findings which are the
    basis for the order.
    (f) Service of orders
      Orders of the Secretary with respect to any denial of
    application, suspension, revocation, annulment, or other
    proceedings, shall be served (1) in person by any officer or
    employee of the Secretary designated by him or any internal revenue
    or customs officer authorized by the Secretary for the purpose, or
    (2) by mailing the order by registered mail, addressed to the
    applicant or respondent at his last known address in the records of
    the Secretary.
    (g) Duration
      A basic permit shall continue in effect until suspended, revoked,
    or annulled as provided herein, or voluntarily surrendered; except
    that (1) if leased, sold, or otherwise voluntarily transferred, the
    permit shall be automatically terminated thereupon, and (2) if
    transferred by operation of law or if actual or legal control of
    the permittee is acquired, directly or indirectly, whether by stock-
    ownership or in any other manner, by any person, then such permit
    shall be automatically terminated at the expiration of thirty days
    thereafter: Provided, That if within such thirty-day period
    application for a new basic permit is made by the transferee or
    permittee, respectively, then the outstanding basic permit shall
    continue in effect until such application is finally acted on by
    the Secretary of the Treasury.
    (h) Appeal; procedure
      An appeal may be taken by the permittee or applicant for a permit
    from any order of the Secretary of the Treasury denying an
    application for, or suspending, revoking, or annulling, a basic
    permit. Such appeal shall be taken by filing, in the court of
    appeals of the United States within any circuit wherein such person
    resides or has his principal place of business, or in the United
    States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, within sixty
    days after the entry of such order, a written petition praying that
    the order of the Secretary be modified or set aside in whole or in
    part. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the
    clerk of the court to the Secretary, or any officer designated by
    him for that purpose, and thereupon the Secretary shall file in the
    court the record upon which the order complained of was entered, as
    provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such
    petition such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to affirm,
    modify, or set aside such order, in whole or in part. No objection
    to the order of the Secretary shall be considered by the court
    unless such objection shall have been urged before the Secretary or
    unless there were reasonable grounds for failure so to do. The
    finding of the Secretary as to the facts, if supported by
    substantial evidence, shall be conclusive. If any party shall apply
    to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shall
    show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence
    is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to
    adduce such evidence in the proceeding before the Secretary, the
    court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the
    Secretary and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and
    upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The
    Secretary may modify his findings as to the facts by reason of the
    additional evidence so taken, and he shall file with the court such
    modified or new findings, which, if supported by substantial
    evidence, shall be conclusive, and his recommendation, if any, for
    the modification or setting aside of the original order. The
    judgment and decree of the court affirming, modifying, or setting
    aside, in whole or in part, any such order of the Secretary shall
    be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United
    States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254
    of title 28. The commencement of proceedings under this subsection
    shall, unless specifically ordered by the court to the contrary,
    operate as a stay of the Secretary's order.
    (i) Limitation
      No proceeding for the suspension or revocation of a basic permit
    for violation of any condition thereof relating to compliance with
    Federal law shall be instituted by the Secretary more than eighteen
    months after conviction of the violation of Federal law, or, if no
    conviction has been had, more than three years after the violation
    occurred; and no basic permit shall be suspended or revoked for a
    violation of any such condition thereof if the alleged violation of
    Federal law has been compromised by any officer of the Government
    authorized to compromise such violation.

    statements of, or statements likely to be considered as statements

    distilled spirits (other than cordials, liqueurs, and specialties)
    produced by blending or rectification, if neutral spirits have been
    used in the production thereof, informing the consumer of the
    percentage of neutral spirits so used and of the name of the
    commodity from which such neutral spirits have been distilled, or
    in case of neutral spirits or of gin produced by a process of
    continuous distillation, the name of the commodity from which
    distilled; (4) as will prohibit statements on the label that are
    disparaging of a competitor's products or are false, misleading,
    obscene, or indecent; and (5) as will prevent deception of the
    consumer by use of a trade or brand name that is the name of any
    living individual of public prominence, or existing private or
    public organization, or is a name that is in simulation or is an
    abbreviation thereof, and as will prevent the use of a graphic,
    pictorial, or emblematic representation of any such individual or
    organization, if the use of such name or representation is likely
    falsely to lead the consumer to believe that the product has been
    indorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or under the
    supervision of, or in accordance with the specifications of, such
    individual or organization: Provided, That this clause shall not
    apply to the use of the name of any person engaged in business as a
    distiller, brewer, rectifier, blender, or other producer, or as an
    importer, wholesaler, retailer, bottler, or warehouseman, of
    distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages, nor to the use by any

    at time of release from customs custody, certificates issued by
    foreign governments covering origin, age, and identity of imported
    products: Provided further, That nothing herein nor any decision,
    ruling, or regulation of any Department of the Government shall
    deny the right of any person to use any trade name or brand of
    foreign origin not presently effectively registered in the United
    States Patent and Trademark Office which has been used by such
    person or predecessors in the United States for a period of at
    least five years last past, if the use of such name or brand is
    qualified by the name of the locality in the United States in which
    the product is produced, and, in the case of the use of such name
    or brand on any label or in any advertisement, if such
    qualification is as conspicuous as such name or brand.
      It shall be unlawful for any person to alter, mutilate, destroy,
    obliterate, or remove any mark, brand, or label upon distilled
    spirits, wine, or malt beverages held for sale in interstate or
    foreign commerce or after shipment therein, except as authorized by
    Federal law or except pursuant to regulations of the Secretary of
    the Treasury authorizing relabeling for purposes of compliance with
    the requirements of this subsection or of State law.
      In order to prevent the sale or shipment or other introduction of

    commerce, if bottled, packaged, or labeled in violation of the
    requirements of this subsection, (1) no bottler of distilled
    spirits, no producer, blender, or wholesaler of wine, or proprietor
    of a bonded wine storeroom, and no brewer or wholesaler of malt
    beverages shall bottle, and (2) no person shall remove from customs
    custody, in bottles, for sale or any other commercial purpose,
    distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages, respectively, after
    such date as the Secretary of the Treasury fixes as the earliest

    subsection to any class of such persons (but not later than August
    15, 1936, in the case of distilled spirits, and December 15, 1936,
    in the case of wine and malt beverages, and only after thirty days'
    public notice), unless, upon application to the Secretary of the
    Treasury, he has obtained and has in his possession a certificate
    of label approval covering the distilled spirits, wine, or malt
    beverages, issued by the Secretary in such manner and form as he
    shall by regulations prescribe: Provided, That any such bottler of
    distilled spirits, or producer, blender, or wholesaler of wine, or
    proprietor of a bonded wine storeroom, or brewer or wholesaler of
    malt beverages shall be exempt from the requirements of this
    subsection if, upon application to the Secretary, he shows to the

    malt beverages to be bottled by the applicant are not to be sold,
    or offered for sale, or shipped or delivered for shipment, or
    otherwise introduced, in interstate or foreign commerce. Officers

    certificates have been obtained, or unless the application of the
    bottler for exemption has been granted by the Secretary; and

    disseminated by radio broadcast, or in any newspaper, periodical or
    other publication or by any sign or outdoor advertisement or any
    other printed or graphic matter, any advertisement of distilled
    spirits, wine, or malt beverages, if such advertisement is in, or
    is calculated to induce sales in, interstate or foreign commerce,
    or is disseminated by mail, unless such advertisement is in
    conformity with such regulations, to be prescribed by the Secretary
    of the Treasury, (1) as will prevent deception of the consumer with
    respect to the products advertised and as will prohibit,
    irrespective of falsity, such statements relating to age,
    manufacturing processes, analyses, guaranties, and scientific or
    irrelevant matters as the Secretary of the Treasury finds to be
    likely to mislead the consumer; (2) as will provide the consumer
    with adequate information as to the identity and quality of the
    products advertised, the alcoholic content thereof (except the
    statements of, or statements likely to be considered as statements
    of, alcoholic content of malt beverages and wines are prohibited),
    and the person responsible for the advertisement; (3) as will
    require an accurate statement, in the case of distilled spirits
    (other than cordials, liqueurs, and specialties) produced by
    blending or rectification, if neutral spirits have been used in the
    production thereof, informing the consumer of the percentage of
    neutral spirits so used and of the name of the commodity from which
    such neutral spirits have been distilled, or in case of neutral
    spirits or of gin produced by a process of continuous distillation,
    the name of the commodity from which distilled; (4) as will
    prohibit statements that are disparaging of a competitor's products
    or are false, misleading, obscene, or indecent; (5) as will prevent
    statements inconsistent with any statement on the labeling of the
    products advertised. This subsection shall not apply to outdoor
    advertising in place on June 18, 1935, but shall apply upon
    replacement, restoration, or renovation of any such advertising.
    The prohibitions of this subsection and regulations thereunder
    shall not apply to the publisher of any newspaper, periodical, or
    other publication, or radio broadcaster, unless such publisher or
    radio broadcaster is engaged in business as a distiller, brewer,
    rectifier, or other producer, or as an importer or wholesaler, of
    distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages, or as a bottler, or
    warehouseman and bottler, of distilled spirits, directly or
    indirectly or through an affiliate.
      The provisions of subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section
    shall not apply to any act done by an agency of a State or
    political subdivision thereof, or by any officer or employee of
    such agency.
      In the case of malt beverages, the provisions of subsections (a),
    (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall apply to transactions
    between a retailer or trade buyer in any State and a brewer,
    importer, or wholesaler of malt beverages outside such State only
    to the extent that the law of such State imposes similar
    requirements with respect to similar transactions between a
    retailer or trade buyer in such State and a brewer, importer, or
    wholesaler of malt beverages in such State, as the case may be. In
    the case of malt beverages, the provisions of this subsection and
    subsection (e) of this section shall apply to the labeling of malt
    beverages sold or shipped or delivered for shipment or otherwise
    introduced into or received in any State from any place outside
    thereof, or the advertising of malt beverages intended to be sold
    or shipped or delivered for shipment or otherwise introduced into

    the extent that the law of such State imposes similar requirements
    with respect to the labeling or advertising, as the case may be, of
    malt beverages not sold or shipped or delivered for shipment or
    otherwise introduced into or received in such State from any place
    outside thereof.
      The Secretary of the Treasury shall give reasonable public
    notice, and afford to interested parties opportunity for hearing,
    prior to prescribing regulations to carry out the provisions of
    this section.

      As originally enacted subsec. (e) of this section contained a
    reference to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Act
    June 25, 1936, substituted "the district court of the United States
    for the District of Columbia" for "the Supreme Court of the

    24, 1949, substituted "United States District Court for the
    District of Columbia" for "district court of the United States for
    the District of Columbia". However, the words "United States
    District Court for the District of Columbia" have been deleted
    entirely as superfluous in view of section 132(a) of Title 28,
    Judiciary and Judicial Procedure, which states that "There shall be
    in each judicial district a district court which shall be a court
    of record known as the United States District Court for the
    district", and section 88 of Title 28 which states that "the
    District of Columbia constitutes one judicial district".

    was contained in act June 26, 1936, ch. 830, title V, Sec. 506, 49
    Stat. 1965. The amendment was to have taken effect when a majority
    of the members of the Federal Alcohol Administration authorized to
    be appointed under section 202b of this title took office. However,
    the members were never appointed and section 202b of this title was

    "the date of the enactment of this title" for "the date of the
    enactment of this Act", which had been translated editorially as
    "August 29, 1935", thereby requiring no change in text.
      1942 - Subsec. (f)(2). Act Apr. 20, 1942, substituted "beverages
    and wines are prohibited" for "beverages are prohibited and except

      organized under the law of such State; or
        (3) One or more such companies has been organized under the law
      of a State to comply with a requirement thereof under which, as a
      condition of doing business in such State, such company must be
      organized under the laws of such State, and the other one or more
      of such companies not so organized, is in existence on August 29,

      As originally enacted subsec. (a) of this section contained a
    reference to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Act
    June 25, 1936, substituted "the district court of the United States
    for the District of Columbia" for "the Supreme Court of the
    District of Columbia", and act June 25, 1948, as amended by act May
    24, 1949, substituted "United States District Court for the
    District of Columbia" for "district court of the United States for
    the District of Columbia". However, the words "United States
    District Court for the District of Columbia" have been deleted
    entirely as superfluous in view of section 132(a) of Title 28,
    Judiciary and Judicial Procedure, which states that "There shall be
    in each judicial district a district court which shall be a court
    of record known as the United States District Court for the

    District of Columbia constitutes one judicial district".

    Sec. 213. Declaration of policy and purpose

-STATUTE-
      The Congress finds that the American public should be informed
    about the health hazards that may result from the consumption or
    abuse of alcoholic beverages, and has determined that it would be
    beneficial to provide a clear, nonconfusing reminder of such
    hazards, and that there is a need for national uniformity in such
    reminders in order to avoid the promulgation of incorrect or
    misleading information and to minimize burdens on interstate
    commerce. The Congress finds that requiring such reminders on all
    containers of alcoholic beverages is appropriate and necessary in
    view of the substantial role of the Federal Government in promoting
    the health and safety of the Nation's population. It is therefore
    the policy of the Congress, and the purpose of this subchapter, to
    exercise the full reach of the Federal Government's constitutional
    powers in order to establish a comprehensive Federal program, in
    connection with the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages in
    or affecting interstate commerce, to deal with the provision of
    warning or other information with respect to any relationship
    between the consumption or abuse of alcoholic beverages and health,
    so that - 
        (1) the public may be adequately reminded about any health
      hazards that may be associated with the consumption or abuse of
      alcoholic beverages through a nationally uniform, nonconfusing
      warning notice on each container of such beverages; and
        (2) commerce and the national economy may be - 
          (A) protected to the maximum extent consistent with this
        declared policy,
          (B) not impeded by diverse, nonuniform, and confusing
        requirements for warnings or other information on alcoholic
        beverage containers with respect to any relationship between
        the consumption or abuse of alcoholic beverages and health, and
          (C) protected from the adverse effects that would result from
        a noncomprehensive program covering alcoholic beverage
        containers sold in interstate commerce, but not alcoholic
        beverage containers manufactured and sold within a single
        State.
