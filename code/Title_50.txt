    place an order with any person for such ships or war material as
    the necessities of the Government, to be determined by the
    President, may require and which are of the nature, kind, and
    quantity usually produced or capable of being produced by such
    person. Compliance with all such orders shall be obligatory on any
    person to whom such order is given, and such order shall take
    precedence over all other orders and contracts theretofore placed
    with such person. If any person owning, leasing, or operating any
    factory equipped for the building or production of ships or war
    material for the Navy shall refuse or fail to give to the United
    States such preference in the execution of such an order, or shall
    refuse to build, supply, furnish, or manufacture the kind,
    quantity, or quality of ships or war material so ordered at such
    reasonable price as shall be determined by the President, the
    President may take immediate possession of any factory of such
    person, or of any part thereof without taking possession of the

    manner as he may consider necessary or expedient.
      Second. Within the limit of the amounts appropriated therefor, to
    modify or cancel any existing contract for the building,
    production, or purchase of ships or war material; and if any
    contractor shall refuse or fail to comply with the contract as so
    modified the President may take immediate possession of any factory
    of such contractor, or any part thereof without taking possession
    of the entire factory, and may use the same at such times and in
    such manner as he may consider necessary or expedient.
      Third. To require the owner or occupier of any factory in which
    ships or war material are built or produced to place at the
    disposal of the United States the whole or any part of the output
    of such factory, and, within the limit of the amounts appropriated
    therefor, to deliver such output or parts thereof in such
    quantities and at such times as may be specified in the order at
    such reasonable price as shall be determined by the President.
      Fourth. To requisition and take over for use or operation by the
    Government any factory, or any part thereof without taking
    possession of the entire factory, whether the United States has or
    has not any contract or agreement with the owner or occupier of
    such factory.

    the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, it shall make
    just compensation therefor, to be determined by the President, and

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Congress finds that the natural resources of the United
    States in certain strategic and critical materials are deficient or
    insufficiently developed to supply the military, industrial, and
    essential civilian needs of the United States for national defense.
      (b) It is the purpose of this subchapter to provide for the
    acquisition and retention of stocks of certain strategic and
    critical materials and to encourage the conservation and
    development of sources of such materials within the United States
    and thereby to decrease and to preclude, when possible, a dangerous
    and costly dependence by the United States upon foreign sources for
    supplies of such materials in times of national emergency.
      (c) The purpose of the National Defense Stockpile is to serve the
    interest of national defense only. The National Defense Stockpile
    is not to be used for economic or budgetary purposes.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Presidential powers
      The President shall -

      this title to be strategic and critical materials;
        (2) provide for the proper storage, security, and maintenance
      of materials in the stockpile;
        (3) provide for the upgrading, refining, or processing of any
      material in the stockpile (notwithstanding any intermediate
      stockpile quantity established for such material) when necessary
      to convert such material into a form more suitable for storage,
      subsequent disposition, and immediate use in a national
      emergency;
        (4) provide for the rotation of any material in the stockpile
      when necessary to prevent deterioration or technological
      obsolescence of such material by replacement of such material
      with an equivalent quantity of substantially the same material or
      better material;
        (5) subject to the notification required by subsection (d)(2)
      of this section, provide for the timely disposal of materials in
      the stockpile that (A) are excess to stockpile requirements, and
      (B) may cause a loss to the Government if allowed to deteriorate;
      and
        (6) subject to the provisions of section 98d(b) of this title,
      dispose of materials in the stockpile the disposal of which is
      specifically authorized by law.
    (b) Federal procurement practices
      Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section,
    acquisition of strategic and critical materials under this
    subchapter shall be made in accordance with established Federal
    procurement practices, and, except as provided in subsections (c)
    and (d) of this section and in section 98f(a) of this title,
    disposal of strategic and critical materials from the stockpile
    shall be made in accordance with the next sentence. To the maximum
    extent feasible - 
        (1) competitive procedures shall be used in the acquisition and
      disposal of such materials; and
        (2) efforts shall be made in the acquisition and disposal of
      such materials to avoid undue disruption of the usual markets of
      producers, processors, and consumers of such materials and to
      protect the United States against avoidable loss.
    (c) Barter; use of stockpile materials as payment for expenses of
      acquiring, refining, processing, or rotating materials
      (1) The President shall encourage the use of barter in the
    acquisition under subsection (a)(1) of this section of strategic
    and critical materials for, and the disposal under subsection
    (a)(5) or (a)(6) of this section of materials from, the stockpile
    when acquisition or disposal by barter is authorized by law and is
    practical and in the best interest of the United States.
      (2) Materials in the stockpile (the disposition of which is
    authorized by paragraph (3) to finance the upgrading, refining, or
    processing of a material in the stockpile, or is otherwise
    authorized by law) shall be available for transfer at fair market
    value as payment for expenses (including transportation and other
    incidental expenses) of acquisition of materials, or of upgrading,
    refining, processing, or rotating materials, under this subchapter.
      (3) Notwithstanding section 98b(c) of this title or any other
    provision of law, whenever the President provides under subsection
    (a)(3) of this section for the upgrading, refining, or processing
    of a material in the stockpile to convert that material into a form
    more suitable for storage, subsequent disposition, and immediate
    use in a national emergency, the President may barter a portion of
    the same material (or any other material in the stockpile that is
    authorized for disposal) to finance that upgrading, refining, or
    processing.
      (4) To the extent otherwise authorized by law, property owned by
    the United States may be bartered for materials needed for the
    stockpile.
    (d) Waiver; notification of proposed disposal of materials
      (1) The President may waive the applicability of any provision of
    the first sentence of subsection (b) of this section to any
    acquisition of material for, or disposal of material from, the
    stockpile. Whenever the President waives any such provision with
    respect to any such acquisition or disposal, or whenever the
    President determines that the application of paragraph (1) or (2)
    of such subsection to a particular acquisition or disposal is not
    feasible, the President shall notify the Committee on Armed
    Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the
    House of Representatives in writing of the proposed acquisition or
    disposal at least 45 days before any obligation of the United
    States is incurred in connection with such acquisition or disposal
    and shall include in such notification the reasons for not
    complying with any provision of such subsection.
      (2) Materials in the stockpile may be disposed of under
    subsection (a)(5) of this section only if such congressional
    committees are notified in writing of the proposed disposal at
    least 45 days before any obligation of the United States is
    incurred in connection with such disposal.
    (e) Leasehold interests in property
      The President may acquire leasehold interests in property, for
    periods not in excess of twenty years, for storage, security, and
    maintenance of materials in the stockpile.

    (a) In general
      Not later than January 15 of every other year, the Secretary of
    Defense shall submit to Congress a report on stockpile
    requirements. Each such report shall include - 
        (1) the Secretary's recommendations with respect to stockpile
      requirements; and

      Each report under this section shall set forth the national
    emergency planning assumptions used by the Secretary in making the
    Secretary's recommendations under subsection (a)(1) of this section
    with respect to stockpile requirements. The Secretary shall base
    the national emergency planning assumptions on a military conflict
    scenario consistent with the scenario used by the Secretary in
    budgeting and defense planning purposes. The assumptions to be set
    forth include assumptions relating to each of the following:
        (1) The length and intensity of the assumed military conflict.
        (2) The military force structure to be mobilized.
        (3) The losses anticipated from enemy action.
        (4) The military, industrial, and essential civilian
      requirements to support the national emergency.
        (5) The availability of supplies of strategic and critical
      materials from foreign sources during the mobilization period,
      the military conflict, and the subsequent period of
      replenishment, taking into consideration possible shipping
      losses.
        (6) The domestic production of strategic and critical materials
      during the mobilization period, the military conflict, and the
      subsequent period of replenishment, taking into consideration
      possible shipping losses.
        (7) Civilian austerity measures required during the
      mobilization period and military conflict.
    (c) Period within which to replace or replenish materials
      The stockpile requirements shall be based on those strategic and
    critical materials necessary for the United States to replenish or
    replace, within three years of the end of the military conflict
    scenario required under subsection (b) of this section, all
    munitions, combat support items, and weapons systems that would be
    required after such a military conflict.
    (d) Effect of alternative mobilization periods
      The Secretary shall also include in each report under this
    section an examination of the effect that alternative mobilization
    periods under the military conflict scenario required under
    subsection (b) of this section, as well as a range of other
    military conflict scenarios addressing potentially more serious
    threats to national security, would have on the Secretary's
    recommendations under subsection (a)(1) of this section with
    respect to stockpile requirements.
    (e) Plans of President
      The President shall submit with each report under this section a
    statement of the plans of the President for meeting the
    recommendations of the Secretary set forth in the report.

    Sec. 167d. Sale of helium

-STATUTE-
    (a) Purchase by Government agencies
      The Department of Defense, the Atomic Energy Commission, and
    other agencies of the Federal Government, to the extent that
    supplies are readily available, shall purchase all major
    requirements of helium from persons who have entered into
    enforceable contracts to purchase an equivalent amount of crude
    helium from the Secretary.
    (b) Sales by Secretary
      The Secretary is authorized to sell crude helium for Federal,
    medical, scientific, and commercial uses in such quantities and
    under such terms and conditions as he determines. Except as may be
    required by reason of subsection (a) of this section, sales of
    crude helium under this section shall be in amounts as the
    Secretary determines, in consultation with the helium industry,
    necessary to carry out this subsection with minimum market
    disruption.
    (c) Prices and determinations; repayable amounts
      Sales of crude helium by the Secretary shall be at prices
    established by him which shall be adequate to cover all costs
    incurred in carrying out the provisions of this chapter and to
    repay to the United States by deposit in the Treasury, all funds
    required to be repaid to the United States as of October 1, 1995
    under this section (referred to in this subsection as "repayable
    amounts"). The price at which crude helium is sold by the Secretary
    shall not be less than the amount determined by the Secretary by - 
        (1) dividing the outstanding amount of such repayable amounts
      by the volume (in million cubic feet) of crude helium owned by
      the United States and stored in the Bureau of Mines Cliffside
      Field at the time of the sale concerned, and
        (2) adjusting the amount determined under paragraph (1) by the
      Consumer Price Index for years beginning after December 31, 1995.
    (d) Extraction of helium from deposits on Federal lands
      All moneys received by the Secretary from the sale or disposition
    of helium on Federal lands shall be paid to the Treasury and
    credited against the amounts required to be repaid to the Treasury
    under subsection (c) of this section.
    (e) Helium production fund
      (1) All moneys received under this chapter, including moneys from
    sale of helium or other products resulting from helium operations
    and from the sale of excess property shall be credited to the
    helium production fund, which shall be available without fiscal
    year limitation, for carrying out the provisions of this chapter,
    including any research relating to helium carried out by the
    Department of the Interior. Amounts accumulating in said fund in
    excess of amounts the Secretary deems necessary to carry out this
    chapter and contracts negotiated hereunder shall be paid to the
    Treasury and credited against the amounts required to be repaid to
    the Treasury under subsection (c) of this section.
      (2)(A) Within 7 days after the commencement of each fiscal year
    after the disposal of the facilities referred to in section 167b(c)
    of this title, all amounts in such fund in excess of $2,000,000 (or
    such lesser sum as the Secretary deems necessary to carry out this
    chapter during such fiscal year) shall be paid to the Treasury and
    credited as provided in paragraph (1).
      (B) On repayment of all amounts referred to in subsection (c) of
    this section, the fund established under this section shall be
    terminated and all moneys received under this chapter shall be
    deposited in the general fund of the Treasury.

    Keyes, Oklahoma;
      "(2) Within twenty-five years from the date of borrowing, all
    funds borrowed, as provided in section 167j of this chapter, to
    acquire and construct helium plants and facilities; and

    United States having maturities comparable to the investments
    authorized by this chapter, except that the interest rate on the

-HEAD-
    Sec. 191. Regulation of anchorage and movement of vessels during
      national emergency

-STATUTE-
      Whenever the President by proclamation or Executive order
    declares a national emergency to exist by reason of actual or
    threatened war, insurrection, or invasion, or disturbance or
    threatened disturbance of the international relations of the United
    States, or whenever the Attorney General determines that an actual
    or anticipated mass migration of aliens en route to, or arriving
    off the coast of, the United States presents urgent circumstances
    requiring an immediate Federal response, the Secretary of
    Transportation may make, subject to the approval of the President,
    rules and regulations governing the anchorage and movement of any
    vessel, foreign or domestic, in the territorial waters of the
    United States, may inspect such vessel at any time, place guards
    thereon, and, if necessary in his opinion in order to secure such
    vessels from damage or injury, or to prevent damage or injury to
    any harbor or waters of the United States, or to secure the
    observance of the rights and obligations of the United States, may
    take, by and with the consent of the President, for such purposes,
    full possession and control of such vessel and remove therefrom the
    officers and crew thereof and all other persons not specially
    authorized by him to go or remain on board thereof.
      Whenever the President finds that the security of the United
    States is endangered by reason of actual or threatened war, or
    invasion, or insurrection, or subversive activity, or of
    disturbances or threatened disturbances of the international
    relations of the United States, the President is authorized to
    institute such measures and issue such rules and regulations - 
        (a) to govern the anchorage and movement of any foreign-flag
      vessels in the territorial waters of the United States, to
      inspect such vessels at any time, to place guards thereon, and,
      if necessary in his opinion in order to secure such vessels from
      damage or injury, or to prevent damage or injury to any harbor or
      waters of the United States, or to secure the observance of
      rights and obligations of the United States, may take for such
      purposes full possession and control of such vessels and remove
      therefrom the officers and crew thereof, and all other persons
      not especially authorized by him to go or remain on board
      thereof;
        (b) to safeguard against destruction, loss, or injury from
      sabotage or other subversive acts, accidents, or other causes of
      similar nature, vessels, harbors, ports, and waterfront
      facilities in the United States and all territory and water,
      continental or insular, subject to the jurisdiction of the United
      States.

    The President may delegate the authority to issue such rules and
    regulations to the Secretary of the department in which the Coast
    Guard is operating. Any appropriation available to any of the
    Executive Departments shall be available to carry out the
    provisions of this title.(!1)

        EMERGENCY AUTHORITY RELATING TO REGULATION OF ANCHORAGE AND
                            MOVEMENT OF VESSELS
      Proc. No. 6867, Mar. 1, 1996, 61 F.R. 8843, provided:
      WHEREAS, on February 24, 1996, Cuban military aircraft
    intercepted and destroyed two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian
    aircraft in international airspace north of Cuba;
      WHEREAS the Government of Cuba has demonstrated a ready and
    reckless willingness to use excessive force, including deadly
    force, in the ostensible enforcement of its sovereignty;
      WHEREAS, on July 13, 1995, persons in U.S.-registered vessels who
    entered into Cuban territorial waters suffered injury as a result
    of the reckless use of force against them by the Cuban military;
    and
      WHEREAS the entry of U.S.-registered vessels into Cuban
    territorial waters could again result in injury to, or loss of life
    of, persons engaged in that conduct, due to the potential use of
    excessive force, including deadly force, against them by the Cuban
    military, and could threaten a disturbance in international
    relations;
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United
    States of America, by the authority vested in me by the
    Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
    including section 1 of title II of Public Law 65-24, ch. 30, June
    15, 1917, as amended (50 U.S.C. 191), sections 201 and 301 of the
    National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) [50 U.S.C. 1621,
    1631], and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, find and do
    hereby proclaim that a national emergency does exist by reason of a
    disturbance or threatened disturbance of international relations.
    In order to address this national emergency and to secure the
    observance of the rights and obligations of the United States, I
    hereby authorize and direct the Secretary of Transportation (the
    "Secretary") to make and issue such rules and regulations as the
    Secretary may find appropriate to regulate the anchorage and
    movement of vessels, and delegate to the Secretary my authority to
    approve such rules and regulations, as authorized by the Act of
    June 15, 1917 [see Tables for classification].
      Section 1. The Secretary may make rules and regulations governing
    the anchorage and movement of any vessel, foreign or domestic, in
    the territorial waters of the United States, which may be used, or
    is susceptible of being used, for voyage into Cuban territorial
    waters and that may create unsafe conditions and threaten a
    disturbance of international relations. Any rule or regulation
    issued pursuant to this proclamation may be effective immediately
    upon issuance as such rule or regulation shall involve a foreign
    affairs function of the United States.
      Sec. 2. The Secretary is authorized to inspect any vessel,
    foreign or domestic, in the territorial waters of the United
    States, at any time; to place guards on any such vessel; and, with
    my consent expressly hereby granted, take full possession and
    control of any such vessel and remove the officers and crew, and
    all other persons not specifically authorized by the Secretary to
    go or remain on board the vessel when necessary to secure the
    rights and obligations of the United States.
      Sec. 3. The Secretary may request assistance from such
    departments, agencies, officers, or instrumentalities of the United
    States as the Secretary deems necessary to carry out the purposes
    of this proclamation. Such departments, agencies, officers, or
    instrumentalities shall, consistent with other provisions of law
    and to the extent practicable, provide requested assistance.
      Sec. 4. The Secretary may seek assistance from State and local
    authorities in carrying out the purposes of this proclamation.
    Because State and local assistance may be essential for an
    effective response to this emergency, I urge all State and local
    officials to cooperate with Federal authorities and to take all
    actions within their lawful authority necessary to prevent the
    unauthorized departure of vessels intending to enter Cuban
    territorial waters.
      Sec. 5. All powers and authorities delegated by this proclamation
    to the Secretary may be delegated by the Secretary to other
    officers and agents of the United States Government unless
    otherwise prohibited by law.
      Sec. 6. This proclamation shall be immediately transmitted to the
    Congress and published in the Federal Register.
      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of
    March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and
    of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
    and twentieth.
                                                     William J. Clinton.

       CONTINUATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARED BY PROC. NO. 6867   
      Notice of President of the United States, dated Jan. 10, 2006, 71
    F.R. 2133, provided:
      On March 1, 1996, by Proclamation 6867 [set out above], a
    national emergency was declared to address the disturbance or
    threatened disturbance of international relations caused by the
    February 24, 1996, destruction by the Cuban government of two
    unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in international airspace
    north of Cuba. In July 1996 and on subsequent occasions, the Cuban
    government stated its intent to forcefully defend its sovereignty
    against any U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft that might enter
    Cuban territorial waters or airspace while involved in a flotilla
    or peaceful protest. Since these events, the Cuban government has
    not demonstrated that it will refrain from the future use of
    reckless and excessive force against U.S. vessels or aircraft that
    may engage in memorial activities or peaceful protest north of
    Cuba. On February 26, 2004, by Proclamation 7757 [set out below],
    the scope of the national emergency was expanded in order to deny
    monetary and material support to the repressive Cuban government,
    which had taken a series of steps to destabilize relations with the
    United States, including threatening to abrogate the Migration
    Accords with the United States and to close the United States
    Interests Section.
      Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National
    Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the
    national emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency authority
    relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels
    set out in Proclamation 6687 [6867], as amended and expanded by
    Proclamation 7757.
      This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and
    transmitted to the Congress.
                                                         George W. Bush.

     PROC. NO. 7757. EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY AND
    INVOCATION OF EMERGENCY AUTHORITY RELATING TO THE REGULATION OF THE
      ANCHORAGE AND MOVEMENT OF VESSELS INTO CUBAN TERRITORIAL WATERS
      Proc. No. 7757, Feb. 26, 2004, 69 F.R. 9515, provided:
      By the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of
    the United States of America, in order to expand the scope of the
    national emergency declared in Proclamation 6867 of March 1, 1996
    [set out above], based on the disturbance or threatened disturbance
    of the international relations of the United States caused by
    actions taken by the Cuban government, and in light of steps taken
    over the past year by the Cuban government to worsen the threat to
    United States international relations, and,
      WHEREAS the United States has determined that Cuba is a state-
    sponsor of terrorism and it is subject to the restrictions of
    section 6(j)(1)(A) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 [50
    U.S.C. App. 2405(j)(1)(A)], section 620A of the Foreign Assistance
    Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2371], and section 40 of the Arms Export
    Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2780];
      WHEREAS the Cuban government has demonstrated a ready and
    reckless willingness to use excessive force, including deadly
    force, against U.S. citizens, in the ostensible enforcement of its
    sovereignty, including the February 1996 shoot-down of two unarmed
    U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in international airspace,
    resulting in the deaths of three American citizens and one other
    individual;
      WHEREAS the Cuban government has demonstrated a ready and
    reckless willingness to use excessive force, including deadly
    force, against U.S. citizens and its own citizens, including on
    July 13, 1995, when persons in U.S.-registered vessels that entered
    into Cuban territorial waters suffered injury as a result of the
    reckless use of force against them by the Cuban military, and
    including the July 1994 sinking of an unarmed Cuban-registered
    vessel, resulting in the deaths of 41 Cuban citizens;
      WHEREAS the Cuban government has impounded U.S.-registered
    vessels in Cuban ports and forced the owners, as a condition of
    release, to violate U.S. law by requiring payments to be made to
    the Cuban government;
      WHEREAS the entry of any U.S.-registered vessels into Cuban
    territorial waters could result in injury to, or loss of life of,
    persons engaged in that conduct, due to the potential use of
    excessive force, including deadly force, against them by the Cuban
    military, and could threaten a disturbance of international
    relations;
      WHEREAS the unauthorized entry of vessels subject to the
    jurisdiction of the United States into Cuban territorial waters is
    in violation of U.S. law and contrary to U.S. policy;
      WHEREAS the objectives of U.S. policy regarding Cuba are the end
    of the dictatorship and a rapid, peaceful transition to a
    representative democracy respectful of human rights and
    characterized by an open market economic system;
      WHEREAS a critical initiative by the United States to advance
    these U.S. objectives is to deny resources to the repressive Cuban
    government, resources that may be used by that government to
    support terrorist activities and carry out excessive use of force
    against innocent victims, including U.S. citizens;
      WHEREAS the unauthorized entry of U.S.-registered vessels into
    Cuban territorial waters is detrimental to the foreign policy of
    the United States, which is to deny monetary and material support
    to the repressive Cuban government, and, therefore, such
    unauthorized entries threaten to disturb the international
    relations of the United States by facilitating the Cuban
    government's support of terrorism, use of excessive force, and
    continued existence;
      WHEREAS the Cuban government has over the course of its 45-year
    existence repeatedly used violence and the threat of violence to
    undermine U.S. policy interests. This same regime continues in
    power today, and has since 1959 maintained a pattern of hostile
    actions contrary to U.S. policy interests. Among other things, the
    Cuban government established a military alliance with the Soviet
    Union, and invited Soviet forces to install nuclear missiles in
    Cuba capable of attacking the United States, and encouraged Soviet
    authorities to use those weapons against the United States; it
    engaged in military adventurism in Africa; and it helped to form
    and provide material and political support to terrorist
    organizations that sought the violent overthrow of democratically
    elected governments in Central America and elsewhere in the
    hemisphere allied with the United States, thereby causing repeated
    disturbances of U.S. international relations;
      WHEREAS the Cuban government has recently and over the last year
    taken a series of steps to destabilize relations with the United
    States, including threatening to abrogate the Migration Accords
    with the United States and to close the U.S. Interests Section, and
    Cuba's most senior officials repeatedly asserting that the United
    States intended to invade Cuba, despite explicit denials from the
    U.S. Secretaries of State and Defense that such action is planned,
    thereby causing a sudden and worsening disturbance of U.S.
    international relations;
      WHEREAS U.S. concerns about these unforeseen Cuban government
    actions that threaten to disturb international relations were
    sufficiently grave that on May 8, 2003, the United States warned
    the Cuban government that political manipulations that resulted in
    a mass migration would be viewed as a "hostile act;"
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States
    of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
    the laws of the United States of America, including section 1 of
    title II of Public Law 65-24, ch. 30, June 15, 1917, as amended (50
    U.S.C. 191), sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies Act
    (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) [50 U.S.C. 1621, 1631], and section 301 of
    title 3, United States Code, in order to expand the scope of the
    national emergency declared in Proclamation 6867 of March 1, 1996
    [set out above], and to secure the observance of the rights and
    obligations of the United States, hereby authorize and direct the
    Secretary of Homeland Security (the "Secretary") to make and issue
    such rules and regulations as the Secretary may find appropriate to
    regulate the anchorage and movement of vessels, and authorize and
    approve the Secretary's issuance of such rules and regulations, as
    authorized by the Act of June 15, 1917 [see Tables for
    classification].
      Section 1. The Secretary may make rules and regulations governing
    the anchorage and movement of any vessel, foreign or domestic, in
    the territorial waters of the United States, which may be used, or
    is susceptible of being used, for voyage into Cuban territorial
    waters and that may create unsafe conditions, or result in
    unauthorized transactions, and thereby threaten a disturbance of
    international relations. Any rule or regulation issued pursuant to
    this proclamation may be effective immediately upon issuance as
    such rule or regulation shall involve a foreign affairs function of
    the United States.
      Sec. 2. The Secretary is authorized to inspect any vessel,
    foreign or domestic, in the territorial waters of the United
    States, at any time; to place guards on any such vessel; and, with
    my consent expressly hereby granted, take full possession and
    control of any such vessel and remove the officers and crew and all
    other persons not specifically authorized by the Secretary to go or
    remain on board the vessel when necessary to secure the rights and
    obligations of the United States.
      Sec. 3. The Secretary may request assistance from such
    departments, agencies, officers, or instrumentalities of the United
    States as the Secretary deems necessary to carry out the purposes
    of this proclamation. Such departments, agencies, officers, or
    instrumentalities shall, consistent with other provisions of law
    and to the extent practicable, provide requested assistance.
      Sec. 4. The Secretary may seek assistance from State and local
    authorities in carrying out the purposes of this proclamation.
    Because State and local assistance may be essential for an
    effective response to this emergency, I urge all State and local
    officials to cooperate with Federal authorities and to take all
    actions within their lawful authority necessary to prevent the
    unauthorized departure of vessels intending to enter Cuban
    territorial waters.
      Sec. 5. All powers and authorities delegated by this proclamation
    to the Secretary may be delegated by the Secretary to other
    officers and agents of the United States Government unless
    otherwise prohibited by law.
      Sec. 6. Any provisions of Proclamation 6867 [set out above] that
    are inconsistent with the provisions of this proclamation are
    superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
      Sec. 7. This proclamation shall be immediately transmitted to the
    Congress and published in the Federal Register.
      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth
    day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of
    the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
    and twenty-eighth.
                                                         George W. Bush.

    CHAPTER 12 - VESSELS IN TERRITORIAL WATERS OF UNITED STATES

-HEAD-
    Sec. 198. Requisitioned vessels

-STATUTE-
    (a) Documentation of vessels
      Any vessel not documented under the laws of the United States,
    acquired by or made available to the Secretary of Transportation
    under sections 196 to 198 of this title, or otherwise, may,
    notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the discretion of
    the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is
    operating be documented as a vessel of the United States under such
    rules and regulations or orders, and with such limitations, as the
    Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating
    may prescribe or issue as necessary or appropriate to carry out the
    purposes and provisions of sections 196 to 198 of this title, and
    in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this
    section, engage in the coastwise trade when so documented. Any
    document issued to a vessel under the provisions of this subsection
    shall be surrendered at any time that such surrender may be ordered
    by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is
    operating. No vessel, the surrender of the documents of which has
    been so ordered, shall, after the effective date of such order,
    have the status of a vessel of the United States unless documented
    anew.
    (b) Waiver of compliance
      The President may, notwithstanding any other provisions of law,
    by rules and regulations or orders, waive compliance with any
    provision of law relating to masters, officers, members of the
    crew, or crew accommodations on any vessel documented under
    authority of this section to such extent and upon such terms as he
    finds necessary because of the lack of physical facilities on such
    vessels, and because of the need to employ aliens for their
    operation. No vessel shall cease to enjoy the benefits and
    privileges of a vessel of the United States by reason of the
    employment of any person in accordance with the provisions of this
    subsection.
    (c) Coastwise trade; inspection
      Any vessel while documented under the provisions of this section,
    when chartered under sections 196 to 198 of this title by the
    Secretary of Transportation to Government agencies or departments
    or to private operators, may engage in the coastwise trade under
    permits issued by the Secretary of Transportation, who is
    authorized to issue permits for such purpose pursuant to such rules
    and regulations as he may prescribe. The Secretary of
    Transportation is authorized to prescribe such rules and
    regulations as he may deem necessary or appropriate to carry out
    the purposes and provisions of this section. Section 57109 of title
    46 shall not apply with respect to vessels chartered to Government
    agencies or departments or to private operators or otherwise used
    or disposed of under sections 196 to 198 of this title. Existing
    laws covering the inspection of steam vessels are made applicable
    to vessels documented under this section only to such extent and
    upon such conditions as may be required by regulations of the
    Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating:
    Provided, That in determining to what extent those laws should be
    made applicable, due consideration shall be given to the primary
    purpose of transporting commodities essential to the national
    defense.
    (d) Reconditioning of vessels
      The Secretary of Transportation without regard to the provisions
    of section 5 of title 41 may repair, reconstruct, or recondition
    any vessels to be utilized under sections 196 to 198 of this title.
    The Secretary of Transportation and any other Government department
    or agency by which any vessel is acquired or chartered, or to which
    any vessel is transferred or made available under sections 196 to
    198 of this title may, with the aid of any funds available and
    without regard to the provisions of said section 5 of title 41,
    repair, reconstruct, or recondition any such vessels to meet the
    needs of the services intended, or provide facilities for such
    repair, reconstruction, or reconditioning. The Secretary of
    Transportation may operate or charter for operation any vessel to
    be utilized under sections 196 to 198 of this title to private
    operators, citizens of the United States, or to any department or
    agency of the United States Government, without regard to the
    provisions of chapter 575 of title 46, and any department or agency
    of the United States Government is authorized to enter into such
    charters.
    (e) Effective period
      In case of any voyage of a vessel documented under the provisions
    of this section begun before the date of termination of an
    effective period of section 196 of this title, but is completed
    after such date, the provisions of this section shall continue in
    effect with respect to such vessel until such voyage is completed.
    (f) "Documented" defined
      When used in sections 196 to 198 of this title, the term
    "documented" means "registered", "enrolled and licensed", or
    "licensed".

      Whenever, at any port of entry, the duties on imports cannot, in
    the judgment of the President, be collected in the ordinary way, or
    by the course provided in section 218 (!1) of this title, by reason
    of the cause mentioned in said section, he may direct that the
    customhouse for the district be established in any secure place
    within the district, either on land or on board any vessel in the
    district, or at sea near the coast; and in such case the collector
    shall reside at such place, or on shipboard, as the case may be,
    and there detain all vessels and cargoes arriving within or
    approaching the district, until the duties imposed by law on such
    vessels and their cargoes are paid in cash. But if the owner or
    consignee of the cargo on board any vessel thus detained, or the
    master of the vessel, desires to enter a port of entry in any other
    district where no such obstructions to the execution of the laws
    exist, the master may be permitted so to change the destination of
    the vessel and cargo in his manifest; whereupon the collector shall
    deliver him a written permit to proceed to the port so designated.
    And the Secretary of the Treasury, with the approval of the
    President, shall make proper regulations for the enforcement on
    shipboard of such provisions of the laws regulating the assessment
    and collection of duties as in his judgment may be necessary and

-STATUTE-
      In enacting this legislation, it is the intent of Congress to
    provide a comprehensive program for the future security of the
    United States; to provide for the establishment of integrated
    policies and procedures for the departments, agencies, and
    functions of the Government relating to the national security; to
    provide a Department of Defense, including the three military
    Departments of the Army, the Navy (including naval aviation and the
    United States Marine Corps), and the Air Force under the direction,
    authority, and control of the Secretary of Defense; to provide that
    each military department shall be separately organized under its
    own Secretary and shall function under the direction, authority,
    and control of the Secretary of Defense; to provide for their
    unified direction under civilian control of the Secretary of
    Defense but not to merge these departments or services; to provide
    for the establishment of unified or specified combatant commands,
    and a clear and direct line of command to such commands; to
    eliminate unnecessary duplication in the Department of Defense, and
    particularly in the field of research and engineering by vesting
    its overall direction and control in the Secretary of Defense; to
    provide more effective, efficient, and economical administration in
    the Department of Defense; to provide for the unified strategic
    direction of the combatant forces, for their operation under
    unified command, and for their integration into an efficient team
    of land, naval, and air forces but not to establish a single Chief
    of Staff over the armed forces nor an overall armed forces general
    staff.

      military assistance, from the developed free nations in order to
      thrive and to become productive members of the world community.

      and of nuclear weapons could produce a world more dangerous than
      we have faced in the past.

      produce instabilities that could spark serious conflict.
        "(6) In order to formulate coherent national policies to meet

      the United States to achieve a bipartisan consensus such as that
      which emerged following World War II.
        "(7) Such a consensus can be fostered by the development of
      policy recommendations from a highly respected group of
      individuals who do not bear a partisan label and who possess
      critical expertise and experience.

      Timely and accurate information about the activities,
    capabilities, plans, and intentions of foreign powers,
    organizations, and persons, and their agents, is essential to the
    national security of the United States. All reasonable and lawful
    means must be used to ensure that the United States will receive
    the best intelligence available. For that purpose, by virtue of the
    authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes of the
    United States of America, including the National Security Act of
    1947, as amended (Act) [see Short Title note above], and as
    President of the United States of America, in order to provide for
    the effective conduct of United States intelligence activities and
    the protection of constitutional rights, it is hereby ordered as
    follows:


-MISC3-
    PART 1 - GOALS, DIRECTION, DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES WITH RESPECT
                    TO THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE EFFORT

      The United States intelligence effort shall provide the President
    and the National Security Council with the necessary information on
    which to base decisions concerning the conduct and development of
    foreign, defense and economic policy, and the protection of United
    States national interests from foreign security threats. All
    departments and agencies shall cooperate fully to fulfill this
    goal.
      (a) Maximum emphasis should be given to fostering analytical
    competition among appropriate elements of the Intelligence
    Community.

    this Order, and with full consideration of the rights of United
    States persons, shall be used to develop intelligence information

    approach between technical collection efforts and other means
    should be maintained and encouraged.
      (c) Special emphasis should be given to detecting and countering
    espionage and other threats and activities directed by foreign
    intelligence services against the United States Government, or
    United States corporations, establishments, or persons.
      (d) To the greatest extent possible consistent with applicable
    United States law and this Order, and with full consideration of
    the rights of United States persons, all agencies and departments
    should seek to ensure full and free exchange of information in
    order to derive maximum benefit from the United States intelligence
    effort.

    security. The NSC shall act as the highest Executive Branch entity

    of all national foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, and
    special activities, and attendant policies and programs.
      (b) Committees. The NSC shall establish such committees as may be
    necessary to carry out its functions and responsibilities under
    this Order. The NSC, or a committee established by it, shall
    consider and submit to the President a policy recommendation,
    including all dissents, on each special activity and shall review
    proposals for other sensitive intelligence operations.

             1.3 NATIONAL FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE ADVISORY GROUPS

    intelligence;

      (7) Such other matters as may be referred by the Director of
    Central Intelligence.
      (b) Membership. Advisory groups established pursuant to this
    section shall be chaired by the Director of Central Intelligence or
    his designated representative and shall consist of senior
    representatives from organizations within the Intelligence
    Community and from departments or agencies containing such
    organizations, as designated by the Director of Central
    Intelligence. Groups for consideration of substantive intelligence
    matters will include representatives of organizations involved in
    the collection, processing and analysis of intelligence. A senior
    representative of the Secretary of Commerce, the Attorney General,
    the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and
    the Office of the Secretary of Defense shall be invited to
    participate in any group which deals with other than substantive
    intelligence matters.

      The agencies within the Intelligence Community shall, in
    accordance with applicable United States law and with the other
    provisions of this Order, conduct intelligence activities necessary
    for the conduct of foreign relations and the protection of the
    national security of the United States, including:

    organizations, persons, and their agents;

    and law enforcement activities, and integration of such activities
    among departments and agencies) relating to such matters.
      (B) The countering of terrorism within the United States, or
    against citizens of the United States, our allies, and our

      Accurate and timely information about the capabilities,
    intentions and activities of foreign powers, organizations, or
    persons and their agents is essential to informed decisionmaking in
    the areas of national defense and foreign relations. Collection of
    such information is a priority objective and will be pursued in a
    vigorous, innovative and responsible manner that is consistent with
    the Constitution and applicable law and respectful of the
    principles upon which the United States was founded.

                                2.2 PURPOSE                            
      This Order is intended to enhance human and technical collection
    techniques, especially those undertaken abroad, and the acquisition
    of significant foreign intelligence, as well as the detection and
    countering of international terrorist activities and espionage
    conducted by foreign powers. Set forth below are certain general
    principles that, in addition to and consistent with applicable
    laws, are intended to achieve the proper balance between the
    acquisition of essential information and protection of individual
    interests. Nothing in this Order shall be construed to apply to or
    interfere with any authorized civil or criminal law enforcement
    responsibility of any department or agency.

                       2.3 COLLECTION OF INFORMATION                   
      Agencies within the Intelligence Community are authorized to
    collect, retain or disseminate information concerning United States
    persons only in accordance with procedures established by the head
    of the agency concerned and approved by the Attorney General,
    consistent with the authorities provided by Part 1 of this Order.
    Those procedures shall permit collection, retention and
    dissemination of the following types of information:
      (a) Information that is publicly available or collected with the
    consent of the person concerned;
      (b) Information constituting foreign intelligence or
    counterintelligence, including such information concerning
    corporations or other commercial organizations. Collection within
    the United States of foreign intelligence not otherwise obtainable
    shall be undertaken by the FBI or, when significant foreign
    intelligence is sought, by other authorized agencies of the
    Intelligence Community, provided that no foreign intelligence
    collection by such agencies may be undertaken for the purpose of
    acquiring information concerning the domestic activities of United
    States persons;
      (c) Information obtained in the course of a lawful foreign
    intelligence, counterintelligence, international narcotics or
    international terrorism investigation;

    of international terrorist organizations;
      (e) Information needed to protect foreign intelligence or
    counterintelligence sources or methods from unauthorized
    disclosure. Collection within the United States shall be undertaken
    by the FBI except that other agencies of the Intelligence Community
    may also collect such information concerning present or former
    employees, present or former intelligence agency contractors or
    their present or former employees, or applicants for any such
    employment or contracting;
      (f) Information concerning persons who are reasonably believed to
    be potential sources or contacts for the purpose of determining
    their suitability or credibility;
      (g) Information arising out of a lawful personnel, physical or
    communications security investigation;
      (h) Information acquired by overhead reconnaissance not directed
    at specific United States persons;
      (i) Incidentally obtained information that may indicate
    involvement in activities that may violate federal, state, local or
    foreign laws; and
      (j) Information necessary for administrative purposes.
      In addition, agencies within the Intelligence Community may
    disseminate information, other than information derived from
    signals intelligence, to each appropriate agency within the
    Intelligence Community for purposes of allowing the recipient
    agency to determine whether the information is relevant to its
    responsibilities and can be retained by it.

                         2.4 COLLECTION TECHNIQUES                     
      Agencies within the Intelligence Community shall use the least
    intrusive collection techniques feasible within the United States
    or directed against United States persons abroad. Agencies are not
    authorized to use such techniques as electronic surveillance,
    unconsented physical search, mail surveillance, physical
    surveillance, or monitoring devices unless they are in accordance
    with procedures established by the head of the agency concerned and
    approved by the Attorney General. Such procedures shall protect
    constitutional and other legal rights and limit use of such
    information to lawful governmental purposes. These procedures shall
    not authorize:
      (a) The CIA to engage in electronic surveillance within the
    United States except for the purpose of training, testing, or
    conducting countermeasures to hostile electronic surveillance;
      (b) Unconsented physical searches in the United States by
    agencies other than the FBI, except for:
      (1) Searches by counterintelligence elements of the military
    services directed against military personnel within the United
    States or abroad for intelligence purposes, when authorized by a
    military commander empowered to approve physical searches for law
    enforcement purposes, based upon a finding of probable cause to
    believe that such persons are acting as agents of foreign powers;
    and
      (2) Searches by CIA of personal property of non-United States
    persons lawfully in its possession.
      (c) Physical surveillance of a United States person in the United
    States by agencies other than the FBI, except for:
      (1) Physical surveillance of present or former employees, present
    or former intelligence agency contractors or their present or
    former employees, or applicants for any such employment or
    contracting; and
      (2) Physical surveillance of a military person employed by a
    nonintelligence element of a military service.
      (d) Physical surveillance of a United States person abroad to
    collect foreign intelligence, except to obtain significant
    information that cannot reasonably be acquired by other means.

                       2.5 ATTORNEY GENERAL APPROVAL                   
      The Attorney General hereby is delegated the power to approve the
    use for intelligence purposes, within the United States or against
    a United States person abroad, of any technique for which a warrant
    would be required if undertaken for law enforcement purposes,
    provided that such techniques shall not be undertaken unless the
    Attorney General has determined in each case that there is probable
    cause to believe that the technique is directed against a foreign

-EXEC-
    EFFECTIVE DATES OF PROVISIONS IN TITLE I OF THE INTELLIGENCE REFORM
                   AND TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT OF 2004
      Memorandum of President of the United States, Apr. 21, 2005, 70
    F.R. 23925, provided:
      Memorandum for the Secretary of State[,] the Secretary of the
    Treasury[,] the Secretary of Defense[,] the Attorney General[,] the
    Secretary of Energy[,] the Secretary of Homeland Security[,] the
    Director of the Office of Management and Budget[, and] the Director
    of National Intelligence
      Subsection 1097(a) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism
    Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-458, December 17, 2004) (the
    Act) [set out in a note above] provides:
      (a) IN GENERAL- Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
      Act, this title and the amendments made by this title shall take
      effect not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of
      this Act.
      Subsection 1097(a) clearly contemplates that one or more of the
    provisions in Title I of the Act may take effect earlier than the
    date that is 6 months after the date of enactment of the Act, but
    does not state explicitly the mechanism for determining when such
    earlier effect shall occur, leaving it to the President in the
    execution of the Act. Moreover, given that section 1097(a) evinces
    a legislative intent to afford the President flexibility, and such
    flexibility is constitutionally appropriate with respect to
    intelligence matters (see United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export
    Corporation, 299 U.S. 304 (1936)), the executive branch shall
    construe section 1097(a) to authorize the President to select
    different effective dates that precede the 6-month deadline for
    different provisions in Title I.
      Therefore, pursuant to the Constitution and the laws of the
    United States of America, including subsection 1097(a) of the Act,
    I hereby determine and direct:
      1. Sections 1097(a) and 1103 of the Act [set out in notes above],
    relating respectively to effective dates of provisions and to
    severability, shall take effect immediately upon the signing of
    this memorandum to any extent that they have not already taken
    effect.
      2. Provisions in Title I of the Act other than those addressed in
    numbered paragraph 1 of this memorandum shall take effect
    immediately upon the signing of this memorandum, except:
      (a) any provision in Title I of the Act for which the Act
    expressly provides the date on which the provision shall take
    effect; and
      (b) sections 1021 and 1092 of the Act [enacting section 404o of
    this title and provisions set out in a note above, respectively],
    relating to the National Counterterrorism Center.
      The taking of effect of a provision pursuant to section 1097(a)
    of the Act and this memorandum shall not affect the construction of
    such provision by the executive branch as set forth in my Statement
    of December 17, 2004, upon signing the Act into law.
      The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized
    and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
                                                         George W. Bush.

    arrange for, and shall prescribe regulations concerning, language
    and language-related training programs for military and civilian
    cryptologic personnel. In establishing programs under this section
    for language and language-related training, the Director - 
        "(1) may provide for the training and instruction to be
      furnished, including functional and geographic area
      specializations;
        "(2) may arrange for training and instruction through other
      Government agencies and, in any case in which appropriate
      training or instruction is unavailable through Government
      facilities, through nongovernmental facilities that furnish
      training and instruction useful in the fields of language and
      foreign affairs;
        "(3) may support programs that furnish necessary language and
      language-related skills, including, in any case in which
      appropriate programs are unavailable at Government facilities,
      support through contracts, grants, or cooperation with
      nongovernmental educational institutions; and
        "(4) may obtain by appointment or contract the services of
      individuals to serve as language instructors, linguists, or

    monetary or other incentives to encourage civilian cryptologic
    personnel of the Agency to acquire or retain proficiency in foreign
    languages or special related abilities needed by the Agency.
      "(2) In order to provide linguistic training and support for
    cryptologic personnel, the Director - 
        "(A) may pay all or part of the tuition and other expenses

      accordance with chapters 57 and 59 of title 5, United States
      Code, and to military personnel in accordance with chapter 7 of
      title 37, United States Code, and applicable provisions of title
      10, United States Code, when such personnel are assigned to

    Secretary of Defense, with the operation of military cryptologic
    reserve units and in order to maintain necessary capability in
    foreign language skills and related abilities needed by the
    National Security Agency, the Director may establish a cryptologic
    linguist reserve. The cryptologic linguist reserve may consist of
    former or retired civilian or military cryptologic personnel of the
    National Security Agency and of other qualified individuals, as
    determined by the Director of the Agency. Each member of the
    cryptologic linguist reserve shall agree that, during any period of
    emergency (as determined by the Director), the member shall return
    to active civilian status with the National Security Agency and
    shall perform such linguistic or linguistic-related duties as the
    Director may assign.
      "(2) In order to attract individuals to become members of the
    cryptologic linguist reserve, the Director, without regard to
    subchapter IV of chapter 55 of title 5, United States Code, may
    provide special monetary incentives to individuals eligible to
    become members of the reserve who agree to become members of the
    cryptologic linguist reserve and to acquire or retain proficiency

    cryptologic linguist reserve, the Director -

      linguist reserve who are assigned or detailed for language and
      language-related training, orientation, or instruction; and
        "(B) may pay benefits and allowances in accordance with
      chapters 57 and 59 of title 5, United States Code, to individuals
      in the cryptologic linguist reserve who are assigned to training
      at sites away from their homes or regular places of business.
      "(d)(1) The Director, before providing training under this
    section to any individual, may obtain an agreement with that
    individual that - 
        "(A) in the case of current employees, pertains to continuation
      of service of the employee, and repayment of the expenses of such
      training for failure to fulfill the agreement, consistent with
      the provisions of section 4108 of title 5, United States Code;
      and
        "(B) in the case of individuals accepted for membership in the
      cryptologic linguist reserve, pertains to return to service when
      requested, and repayment of the expenses of such training for
      failure to fulfill the agreement, consistent with the provisions
      of section 4108 of title 5, United States Code.
      "(2) The Director, under regulations prescribed under this
    section, may waive, in whole or in part, a right of recovery under
    an agreement made under this subsection if it is shown that the
    recovery would be against equity and good conscience or against the
    public interest.
      "(e)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Director may provide to
    family members of military and civilian cryptologic personnel
    assigned to representational duties outside the United States, in
    anticipation of the assignment of such personnel outside the United
    States or while outside the United States, appropriate orientation
    and language training that is directly related to the assignment
    abroad.
      "(2) Language training under paragraph (1) may not be provided to
    any individual through payment of the expenses of tuition or other
    cost of instruction at a non-Government educational institution
    unless appropriate instruction is not available at a Government
    facility.
      "(f) The Director may waive the applicability of any provision of
    chapter 41 of title 5, United States Code, to any provision of this
    section if he finds that such waiver is important to the
    performance of cryptologic functions.
      "(g) The authority of the Director to enter into contracts or to
    make grants under this section is effective for any fiscal year
    only to the extent that appropriated funds are available for such
    purpose.
      "(h) Regulations issued pursuant to this section shall be
    submitted to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the
    House of Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence
    of the Senate before such regulations take effect.

    the Secretary of Defense, may, without regard to section
    4109(a)(2)(B) of title 5, United States Code, pay travel,

    Bureau of Investigation. Such waiver shall be in writing and shall
    fully state the justification for such waiver. Within thirty days,
    the President shall notify the Select Committee on Intelligence of
    the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of
    the House of Representatives that such waiver has been issued, and
    at that time or as soon as national security considerations permit,

    investigations of persons subject to the Uniform Code of Military
    Justice, nor to impose additional reporting requirements upon the
    Department of Defense with respect to such investigations beyond
    those required by existing law and executive branch policy.

        IMPROVEMENT OF EQUALITY OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE

      Pub. L. 108-177, title III, Sec. 319, Dec. 13, 2003, 117 Stat.
    2614, as amended by Pub. L. 108-458, title I, Sec.

    that:
      "(a) Findings. - Congress makes the following findings:
        "(1) It is the recommendation of the Joint Inquiry of the
      Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent
      Select Committee on Intelligence into Intelligence Community
      Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September
      11, 2001, that the Intelligence Community should enhance
      recruitment of a more ethnically and culturally diverse workforce
      and devise a strategy to capitalize upon the unique cultural and
      linguistic capabilities of first generation Americans.
        "(2) The Intelligence Community could greatly benefit from an
      increased number of employees who are proficient in foreign
      languages and knowledgeable of world cultures, especially in
      foreign languages that are critical to the national security
      interests of the United States. Particular emphasis should be
      given to the recruitment of United States citizens whose
      linguistic capabilities are acutely required for the improvement
      of the overall intelligence collection and analysis effort of the
      United States Government.
        "(3) The Intelligence Community has a significantly lower
      percentage of women and minorities than the total workforce of
      the Federal government and the total civilian labor force.
        "(4) Women and minorities continue to be under-represented in
      senior grade levels, and in core mission areas, of the
      intelligence community.
      "(b) Pilot Project To Promote Equality of Employment
    Opportunities for Women and Minorities Throughout the Intelligence
    Community Using Innovative Methodologies. - The Director of
    National Intelligence shall carry out a pilot project under this

        (2) Since September 11, 2001, the need for language proficiency
      levels to meet required national security functions has been
      raised, and the ability to comprehend and articulate technical
      and scientific information in foreign languages has become
      critical.
    (b) Linguistic requirements
      (1) The Director of National Intelligence shall - 
        (A) identify the linguistic requirements for the Office of the
      Director of National Intelligence;
        (B) identify specific requirements for the range of linguistic
      skills necessary for the intelligence community, including
      proficiency in scientific and technical vocabularies of critical
      foreign languages; and
        (C) develop a comprehensive plan for the Office to meet such
      requirements through the education, recruitment, and training of
      linguists.

      (2) In carrying out activities under paragraph (1), the Director
    shall take into account education grant programs of the Department
    of Defense and the Department of Education that are in existence as
    of December 17, 2004.
      (3) Not later than one year after December 17, 2004, and annually
    thereafter, the Director shall submit to Congress a report on the
    requirements identified under paragraph (1), including the success
    of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in meeting
    such requirements. Each report shall notify Congress of any
    additional resources determined by the Director to be required to
    meet such requirements.
      (4) Each report under paragraph (3) shall be in unclassified
    form, but may include a classified annex.
    (c) Professional intelligence training
      The Director of National Intelligence shall require the head of
    each element and component within the Office of the Director of
    National Intelligence who has responsibility for professional
    intelligence training to periodically review and revise the
    curriculum for the professional intelligence training of the senior
    and intermediate level personnel of such element or component in
    order to - 
        (1) strengthen the focus of such curriculum on the integration
      of intelligence collection and analysis throughout the Office;
      and
        (2) prepare such personnel for duty with other departments,
      agencies, and elements of the intelligence community.

    Sec. 403-2b. Limitation on construction of facilities to be used
      primarily by intelligence community

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      (1) In general
        Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, no
      project for the construction of any facility to be used primarily
      by personnel of any component of the intelligence community which
      has an estimated Federal cost in excess of $5,000,000 may be
      undertaken in any fiscal year unless such project is specifically
      identified as a separate item in the President's annual fiscal
      year budget request and is specifically authorized by the
      Congress.
      (2) Notification
        In the case of a project for the construction of any facility
      to be used primarily by personnel of any component of the
      intelligence community which has an estimated Federal cost
      greater than $1,000,000 but less than $5,000,000, or where any
      improvement project to such a facility has an estimated Federal
      cost greater than $1,000,000, the Director of Central
      Intelligence shall submit a notification to the intelligence
      committees specifically identifying such project.
    (b) Exception
      (1) In general
        Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section but subject to
      paragraphs (2) and (3), a project for the construction of a
      facility to be used primarily by personnel of any component of
      the intelligence community may be carried out if the Secretary of
      Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence jointly
      determine - 
          (A) that the project is vital to the national security or to
        the protection of health, safety, or the quality of the
        environment, and
          (B) that the requirement for the project is so urgent that
        deferral of the project for inclusion in the next Act
        authorizing appropriations for the intelligence community would
        be inconsistent with national security or the protection of
        health, safety, or environmental quality, as the case may be.
      (2) Report
        (A) When a decision is made to carry out a construction project
      under this subsection, the Secretary of Defense and the Director
      of Central Intelligence jointly shall submit a report in writing
      to the appropriate committees of Congress on that decision. Each
      such report shall include (i) the justification for the project
      and the current estimate of the cost of the project, (ii) the
      justification for carrying out the project under this subsection,
      and (iii) a statement of the source of the funds to be used to
      carry out the project. The project may then be carried out only
      after the end of the 7-day period beginning on the date the
      notification is received by such committees.
        (B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a project referred to in
      paragraph (1) may begin on the date the notification is received
      by the appropriate committees of Congress under that paragraph if
      the Director of Central Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense
      jointly determine that - 
          (i) an emergency exists with respect to the national security
        or the protection of health, safety, or environmental quality;
        and
          (ii) any delay in the commencement of the project would harm
        any or all of those interests.
      (3) Projects primarily for CIA
        If a project referred to in paragraph (1) is primarily for the
      Central Intelligence Agency, the Director of Central Intelligence
      shall make the determination and submit the report required by
      paragraphs (1) and (2).
      (4) Limitation
        A project carried out under this subsection shall be carried
      out within the total amount of funds appropriated for
      intelligence and intelligence-related activities that have not
      been obligated.
    (c) Application
      This section shall not apply to any project which is subject to
    subsection (a)(1)(A) or (c) of section 601.

        DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE STRATEGY FOR OPEN-SOURCE INTELLIGENCE    
      Pub. L. 109-163, div. A, title IX, Sec. 931, Jan. 6, 2006, 119
    Stat. 3411, provided that:
      "(a) Findings. - Congress makes the following findings:
        "(1) Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is intelligence that is
      produced from publicly available information and is collected,
      exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate
      audience for the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence
      requirement.
        "(2) With the Information Revolution, the amount, significance,
      and accessibility of open-source information has expanded
      significantly, but the intelligence community has not expanded
      its exploitation efforts and systems to produce open-source
      intelligence.
        "(3) The production of open-source intelligence is a valuable
      intelligence discipline that must be integrated into intelligence
      tasking, collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination
      to ensure that United States policymakers are fully and
      completely informed.
        "(4) The dissemination and use of validated open-source
      intelligence inherently enables information sharing since open-
      source intelligence is produced without the use of sensitive
      sources and methods. Open-source intelligence products can be
      shared with the American public and foreign allies because of the
      unclassified nature of open-source intelligence.
        "(5) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the
      United States (popularly referred to as the '9/11 Commission'),
      in its final report released on July 22, 2004, identified
      shortfalls in the ability of the United States to use all-source
      intelligence, a large component of which is open-source
      intelligence.
        "(6) In the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of
      2004 (Public Law 108-458) [see Tables for classification],
      Congress calls for coordination of the collection, analysis,
      production, and dissemination of open-source intelligence.
        "(7) The Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the
      United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction, in its
      report to the President released on March 31, 2005, found that
      'the need for exploiting open-source material is greater now than
      ever before,' but that 'the Intelligence Community's open source
      programs have not expanded commensurate with either the increase
      in available information or with the growing importance of open
      source data to today's problems'.
      "(b) Department of Defense Strategy for Open-Source Intelligence.
    - 
        "(1) Development of strategy. - The Secretary of Defense shall

      notwithstanding the fact that such travel or transportation may

      States) on leave of absence each officer or employee of the
      Agency who was a resident of the United States (as described
      above) at time of employment, upon completion of two years'
      continuous service abroad, or as soon as possible thereafter.
        (B) While in the United States (as described in paragraph
      (3)(A) of this subsection) (!2) on leave, the service of any
      officer or employee shall be available for work or duties in the

        (C) Where an officer or employee on leave returns to the United
      States (as described in paragraph (3)(A) of this subsection),(!2)
      leave of absence granted shall be exclusive of the time actually

        (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, transport
      for or on behalf of an officer or employee of the Agency, a
      privately owned motor vehicle in any case in which it shall be
      determined that water, rail, or air transportation of the motor
      vehicle is necessary or expedient for all or any part of the
      distance between points of origin and destination, and pay the
      costs of such transportation. Not more than one motor vehicle of
      any officer or employee of the Agency may be transported under
      authority of this paragraph during any four-year period, except
      that, as a replacement for such motor vehicle, one additional
      motor vehicle of any such officer or employee may be so
      transported during such period upon approval, in advance, by the
      Director and upon a determination, in advance, by the Director
      that such replacement is necessary for reasons beyond the control
      of the officer or employee and is in the interest of the
      Government. After the expiration of a period of four years
      following the date of transportation under authority of this
      paragraph of a privately owned motor vehicle of any officer or
      employee who has remained in continuous service outside the
      several States of the United States of America, excluding Alaska
      and Hawaii, but including the District of Columbia, during such
      period, the transportation of a replacement for such motor
      vehicle for such officer or employee may be authorized by the
      Director in accordance with this paragraph.
        (5)(A) In the event of illness or injury requiring the
      hospitalization of an officer or full time employee of the Agency
      incurred while on assignment abroad, in a locality where there
      does not exist a suitable hospital or clinic, pay the travel
      expenses of such officer or employee by whatever means the
      Director deems appropriate and without regard to the Standardized
      Government Travel Regulations and section 5731 of title 5, to the
      nearest locality where a suitable hospital or clinic exists and
      on the recovery of such officer or employee pay for the travel
      expenses of the return to the post of duty of such officer or
      employee. If the officer or employee is too ill to travel
      unattended, the Director may also pay the travel expenses of an
      attendant;
        (B) Establish a first-aid station and provide for the services
      of a nurse at a post at which, in the opinion of the Director,
      sufficient personnel is employed to warrant such a station:
      Provided, That, in the opinion of the Director, it is not
      feasible to utilize an existing facility;
        (C) In the event of illness or injury requiring hospitalization
      of an officer or full time employee of the Agency incurred in the
      line of duty while such person is assigned abroad, pay for the
      cost of the treatment of such illness or injury at a suitable
      hospital or clinic;
        (D) Provide for the periodic physical examination of officers
      and employees of the Agency and for the cost of administering
      inoculation or vaccinations to such officers or employees.
        (6) Pay the costs of preparing and transporting the remains of
      an officer or employee of the Agency or a member of his family
      who may die while in travel status or abroad, to his home or
      official station, or to such other place as the Director may
      determine to be the appropriate place of interment, provided that
      in no case shall the expense payable be greater than the amount
      which would have been payable had the destination been the home
      or official station.
        (7) Pay the costs of travel of new appointees and their
      dependents, and the transportation of their household goods and
      personal effects, from places of actual residence in foreign
      countries at time of appointment to places of employment and
      return to their actual residences at the time of appointment or a
      point not more distant: Provided, That such appointees agree in
      writing to remain with the United States Government for a period
      of not less than twelve months from the time of appointment.
        Violation of such agreement for personal convenience of an
      employee or because of separation for misconduct will bar such
      return payments and, if determined by the Director or his
      designee to be in the best interests of the United States, any
      money expended by the United States on account of such travel and
      transportation shall be considered as a debt due by the
      individual concerned to the United States.
    (b) Allowances and benefits comparable to those paid members of
      Foreign Service; special requirements; persons detailed or
      assigned from other agencies; regulations
      (1) The Director may pay to officers and employees of the Agency,
    and to persons detailed or assigned to the Agency from other
    agencies of the Government or from the Armed Forces, allowances and
    benefits comparable to the allowances and benefits authorized to be
    paid to members of the Foreign Service under chapter 9 of title I
    of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 4081 et seq.) or any
    other provision of law.
      (2) The Director may pay allowances and benefits related to
    officially authorized travel, personnel and physical security
    activities, operational activities, and cover-related activities
    (whether or not such allowances and benefits are otherwise
    authorized under this section or any other provision of law) when
    payment of such allowances and benefits is necessary to meet the
    special requirements of work related to such activities. Payment of
    allowances and benefits under this paragraph shall be in accordance
    with regulations prescribed by the Director. Rates for allowances
    and benefits under this paragraph may not be set at rates in excess
    of those authorized by section 5724 and 5724a of title 5 when
    reimbursement is provided for relocation attributable, in whole or
    in part, to relocation within the United States.
      (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or any
    other provision of law relating to the officially authorized travel
    of Government employees, the Director, in order to reflect Agency
    requirements not taken into account in the formulation of
    Government-wide travel procedures, may by regulation - 
        (A) authorize the travel of officers and employees of the
      Agency, and of persons detailed or assigned to the Agency from
      other agencies of the Government or from the Armed Forces who are
      engaged in the performance of intelligence functions, and
        (B) provide for payment for such travel, in classes of cases,
      as determined by the Director, in which such travel is important
      to the performance of intelligence functions.

      (4) Members of the Armed Forces may not receive benefits under
    both this section and title 37 for the same purpose. The Director
    and Secretary of Defense shall prescribe joint regulations to carry
    out the preceding sentence.
      (5) Regulations, other than regulations under paragraph (1),
    issued pursuant to this subsection shall be submitted to the
    Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of
    Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the
    Senate before such regulations take effect.

    ensure that such officers and employees have the requisite training
    and experience to enable him to carry out his duties effectively.

    General may request such information or assistance as may be
    necessary for carrying out his duties and responsibilities from any
    Government agency. Upon request of the Inspector General for such
    information or assistance, the head of the Government agency
    involved shall, insofar as is practicable and not in contravention
    of any existing statutory restriction or regulation of the
    Government agency concerned, furnish to the Inspector General, or
    to an authorized designee, such information or assistance.

      (1) The portion of the annuity relating to such service abroad
    that is actually performed at any time during the officer's or

    the rate and using the percent of average pay specified in section
    8339(a)(3) of title 5 that is normally applicable only to so much
    of an employee's total service as exceeds ten years.
      (2) The portion of the annuity relating to service abroad as

    performed at any time after the officer's or employee's first ten
    years of total service shall be computed as provided in section
    8339(a)(3) of title 5; but, in addition, the officer or employee
    shall be deemed for annuity computation purposes to have actually
    performed an equivalent period of service abroad during his or her
    first ten years of total service, and in calculating the portion of
    the officer's or employee's annuity for his or her first ten years
    of total service, the computation rate and percent of average pay
    specified in paragraph (1) shall also be applied to the period of
    such deemed or equivalent service abroad.
      (3) The portion of the annuity relating to other service by an
    officer or employee as described in subsection (a) of this section
    shall be computed as provided in the provisions of section 8339(a)

      (4) For purposes of this subsection, the term "total service" has
    the meaning given such term under chapter 83 of title 5.

    section 8339 of title 5.

    (d) Officers and employees entitled to greater annuities under
      section 8339 of title 5

    (c) Compensation
      The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency may pay a
    designated employee salary, allowances, and other benefits in an
    amount and in a manner consistent with the nonofficial cover of
    that employee, without regard to any limitation that is otherwise

        that employee at any appropriate time determined by the
        Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (including at the
        time of separation of service by reason of retirement), if the
        Director of the Central Intelligence Agency determines that the
        employee's participation in the retirement system established
        under this subsection is no longer necessary to protect from
        unauthorized disclosure -

            contributions including - 
                (aa) interest as determined by the head of the agency
              administering the Federal retirement system into which

                (bb) in the case of an employee converting into the
              Federal Employees' Retirement System, interest as
              determined under section 8334(e) of title 5; and

              (II) ensures that such conversion does not result in any
            unfunded liability to that fund; and

            (iii) in the case of a designated employee who participated
          in an employee investment retirement system established under
          paragraph (1) and is converted to coverage under subchapter
          III of chapter 84 of title 5, the Director of the Central

        Central Intelligence Agency determines that the employee's

        this subsection is no longer necessary to protect from
        unauthorized disclosure - 
            (i) intelligence operations;

      period of at least 12 months, except that such term does not
      include - 
          (A) a reemployed annuitant under subchapter III of chapter 83
        or chapter 84 of title 5 or another retirement system for
        employees of the Government; or
          (B) an employee having a disability on the basis of which
        such employee is or would be eligible for disability retirement
        under any of the retirement systems referred to in subparagraph
        (A).
    (b) Establishment of program
      In order to avoid or minimize the need for involuntary
    separations due to downsizing, reorganization, transfer of
    function, or other similar action, the Director may establish a
    program under which employees may be offered separation pay to
    separate from service voluntarily (whether by retirement or
    resignation). An employee who receives separation pay under such
    program may not be reemployed by the Central Intelligence Agency
    for the 12-month period beginning on the effective date of the
    employee's separation. An employee who receives separation pay
    under this section on the basis of a separation occurring on or
    after March 30, 1994, and accepts employment with the Government of
    the United States within 5 years after the date of the separation
    on which payment of the separation pay is based shall be required
    to repay the entire amount of the separation pay to the Central
    Intelligence Agency. If the employment is with an Executive agency
    (as defined by section 105 of title 5), the Director of the Office
    of Personnel Management may, at the request of the head of the
    agency, waive the repayment if the individual involved possesses
    unique abilities and is the only qualified applicant available for
    the position. If the employment is with an entity in the
    legislative branch, the head of the entity or the appointing
    official may waive the repayment if the individual involved
    possesses unique abilities and is the only qualified applicant
    available for the position. If the employment is with the judicial
    branch, the Director of the Administrative Office of the United
    States Courts may waive the repayment if the individual involved
    possesses unique abilities and is the only qualified applicant
    available for the position.
    (c) Bar on certain employment
      (1) Bar
        An employee may not be separated from service under this
      section unless the employee agrees that the employee will not - 
          (A) act as agent or attorney for, or otherwise represent, any
        other person (except the United States) in any formal or
        informal appearance before, or, with the intent to influence,
        make any oral or written communication on behalf of any other
        person (except the United States) to the Central Intelligence
        Agency; or
          (B) participate in any manner in the award, modification,
        extension, or performance of any contract for property or
        services with the Central Intelligence Agency,

      employee's separation from service.

        An employee who violates an agreement under this subsection
      shall be liable to the United States in the amount of the
      separation pay paid to the employee pursuant to this section
      times the proportion of the 12-month period during which the
      employee was in violation of the agreement.
    (d) Limitations
      Under this program, separation pay may be offered only - 
        (1) with the prior approval of the Director; and
        (2) to employees within such occupational groups or geographic
      locations, or subject to such other similar limitations or
      conditions, as the Director may require.
    (e) Amount and treatment for other purposes
      Such separation pay - 
        (1) shall be paid in a lump sum;
        (2) shall be equal to the lesser of - 
          (A) an amount equal to the amount the employee would be
        entitled to receive under section 5595(c) of title 5, if the
        employee were entitled to payment under such section; or
          (B) $25,000;

        (3) shall not be a basis for payment, and shall not be included
      in the computation, of any other type of Government benefit; and
        (4) shall not be taken into account for the purpose of
      determining the amount of any severance pay to which an
      individual may be entitled under section 5595 of title 5 based on
      any other separation.
    (f) Regulations
      The Director shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary

      pay pursuant to this section until 30 days after submitting to
      the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of
      Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the
      Senate a report describing the occupational groups or geographic
      locations, or other similar limitations or conditions, required
      by the Director under subsection (d) of this section.
      (2) Annual report
        At the end of each of the fiscal years 1993 through 1997, the
      Director shall submit to the President and the Permanent Select

               SECTION 1. FUNCTIONS OF CHAIRMAN AND OF BOARD           
      The functions of the National Security Resources Board are hereby
    transferred to the Chairman of the National Security Resources
    Board, and the Board shall hereafter advise and consult with the
    Chairman with respect to such matters within his jurisdiction as he
    may request.

                           SEC. 2. VICE CHAIRMAN                       
      There is hereby established the office of Vice Chairman of the
    National Security Resources Board. Such Vice Chairman shall (1) be
    an additional member of the National Security Resources Board, (2)
    be appointed from civilian life by the President, by and with the
    advice and consent of the Senate, (3) receive compensation at the
    rate of $16,000 per annum, and (4) perform such of the duties of
    the Chairman as the Chairman shall designate.

               SEC. 3. PERFORMANCE OF FUNCTIONS OF CHAIRMAN           
      The Chairman may from time to time make such provisions as he
    shall deem appropriate authorizing the performance by any other
    officer, or by any agency or employee, of the National Security
    Resources Board of any function of the Chairman.

                         MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT                     
    To the Congress of the United States:
      I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 25 of 1950, prepared
    in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of
    1949. The plan transfers the function of the National Security
    Resources Board from the Board to the Chairman of the Board and
    makes the Board advisory to the Chairman. The plan also provides
    for a Vice Chairman, appointed by the President and confirmed by
    the Senate.
      The function assigned to the National Security Resources Board by
    the National Security Act of 1947 is "to advise the President
    concerning the coordination of military, industrial and civilian
    mobilization." Proper performance of this function requires action
    by the Board and its staff in two broad areas:
      (1) The conduct of advance mobilization planning which identifies
    the problems which will arise and the measures necessary to meet
    these problems if and when the Nation moves from a peacetime into a
    wartime situation.
      (2) The formulation of current policies and programs which will
    help the Nation achieve an adequate state of readiness against the
    eventuality of a future war.
      The role assigned the National Security Resources Board is
    clearly one of staff assistance to the President. The Congress
    recently recognized this fact in its approval of Reorganization
    Plan No. 4 of 1949 which, pursuant to the specific recommendation
    of the Hoover Commission, placed the National Security Resources
    Board in the Executive Office of the President.
      The accompanying reorganization plan is designed to make the
    National Security Resources Board a more effective instrument.
    Successful performance of the Board's mission requires a wide range
    of detailed study and analysis to cover all the major aspects of
    national mobilization. A committee of department heads or
    departmental representatives encounters some natural difficulties
    in providing supervision and leadership in such an extensive and
    detailed activity. The Chairman has the difficult task of
    exercising discretion as to which matters shall be submitted for
    Board approval. The departmental members of the Board cannot
    possibly supervise or approve the Board's extensive and detailed
    activities and yet, as Board members, must accept ultimate
    responsibility for all such activities. Likewise, the departmental
    members are encumbered by the difficulty of having to reach
    collective and speedy decisions on a great many matters for which
    they, as Board members, are responsible.
      By vesting the functions of the Board in the Chairman, the
    difficulties of Board operation will be overcome. At the same time,
    the reorganization plan provides for the continued participation of
    the several departments and agencies in the task of mobilization
    planning. This is not only a matter of established policy but also
    a requirement of the National Security Act. The departments will
    continue to have representation on the Board. The Board, in an
    advisory relationship to the Chairman, will be a useful arrangement
    for obtaining the necessary participation of departments in
    mobilization planning and for coordination of their activity. It
    will enable the departments to keep abreast of the total range of
    security resources planning. Without reliance on the departments
    for the execution of much of the actual job of mobilization
    planning, coordination with the total range of governmental
    policies and objectives would be lost.
      The Congress in passing the National Security Act Amendments of
    1949 recognized the difficulty which exists when functions of staff
    advice and assistance are placed in a board-type agency. The
    National Security Act Amendments of 1949, in clarifying the role of
    the Chairman of the Munitions Board and the Research and
    Development Board, strengthened and increased the effectiveness of
    these staff agencies of the Secretary of Defense by providing for
    the exclusive exercise of responsibilities by the Chairman. This
    plan achieves the same objective for the National Security
    Resources Board.
      The accompanying reorganization plan provides for a Vice Chairman
    appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The
    tremendous responsibilities of the National Security Resources
    Board and the heavy workload on the Chairman fully warrant this.
    Providing the Chairman with a principal associate for the exercise
    of his responsibilities is consistent with the usual practice in
    other agencies of the executive branch.
      After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each
    reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 25 of 1950 is
    necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in
    section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.
      I have found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include
    in the accompanying reorganization plan, by reason of
    reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and
    compensation of a Vice Chairman of the National Security Resources
    Board. The rate of compensation fixed for this officer is that
    which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in
    the executive branch of the Government.
      The taking effect of the reorganizations included in
    Reorganization Plan No. 25 may not in itself result in substantial
    immediate savings. However, the important objective is maximum
    effectiveness in security resources planning.
      The security of this Nation requires that these steps be taken to
    enable security resources planning to move forward more
    effectively. It is for that reason that Reorganization Plan No. 25
    is today submitted to the Congress. It is for that reason, and that
    reason alone, that I strongly urge congressional acceptance of
    Reorganization Plan No. 25.

      [For subsequent history relating to Office of Defense

                         MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT                     
    To the Congress of the United States:
      I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1953, prepared
    in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of
    1949, as amended.
      The reorganization plan is designed to achieve two primary
    objectives: The first is to improve the organization of the
    Executive Office of the President; the second is to enable one
    Executive Office agency to exercise strong leadership in our
    national mobilization effort, including both current defense
    activities and readiness for any future national emergency.
      The National Security Resources Board was established by the
    National Security Act of 1947 to advise the President concerning
    various aspects of future military, industrial, and civilian
    mobilization. The areas of responsibility assigned to the Board
    included the use of national and industrial resources for military
    and civilian needs; the sufficiency of productive facilities; the
    strategic relocation of industries; the mobilization and maximum
    utilization of manpower; and the maintenance and stabilization of
    the civilian economy.
      The vigorous and efficient discharge of these vital functions is
    not well served by the simultaneous existence in the Executive
    Office of the President of the National Security Resources Board
    (charged with planning for the future) and the present Office of
    Defense Mobilization (charged with programs of the present). The
    progress of the current mobilization effort has made plain how
    artificial is the present separation of these functions.
      Both functions should now be combined into one defense
    mobilization agency. Accordingly, the reorganization plan would
    create in the Executive Office of the President a new agency, to be
    known as the Office of Defense Mobilization. It would transfer to
    the new Office the functions of the Chairman of the National
    Security Resources Board and abolish that Board, including the
    offices of Chairman and Vice Chairman.
      The reorganization plan also transfers to the new agency the
    statutory functions of the present Office of Defense Mobilization.
    These are of a minor nature, the major functions of the present
    Office of Defense Mobilization having been delegated to it by the
    President, principally under the Defense Production Act of 1950, as
    amended. It is my intention to transfer the latter functions to the
    new agency by Executive order, and to abolish the Office of Defense
    Mobilization established by Executive Order No. 10193. There will
    thus result a new agency which combines the activities of the
    National Security Resources Board and both the statutory and
    delegated functions of the heretofore existing Office of Defense
    Mobilization.
      The proposed plan would also reorganize various activities
    relating to the stockpiling of strategic and critical materials.
    Those activities are principally provided for in the Strategic and
    Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, as amended. It has become
    increasingly apparent that the policy and program aspects of
    stockpiling are an integral part of mobilization planning. They
    should not be administered separately from plant expansion,
    conservation of materials, and materials procurement under the
    Defense Production Act of 1950, or from the duties placed in the
    National Security Resources Board by the National Security Act of
    1947. Therefore, the reorganization plan would transfer to the
    Director of the new Office of Defense Mobilization responsibility
    for major stockpiling actions, including the determination of the
    nature and quantities of materials to be stockpiled. In the main,
    these functions are transferred from the Secretaries of the Army,
    Navy, and Air Force (acting jointly through the agency of the
    Munitions Board) and the Secretary of the Interior. The duties of
    the Administrator of General Services regarding the purchase of
    strategic and critical materials and the management of stockpiles
    are not affected by the reorganization plan, except that he will
    receive his directions, under the plan, from the Director of the
    Office of Defense Mobilization instead of from the Department of
    Defense.
      This transfer of stockpiling functions will correct the present
    undesirable confusion of responsibilities. The functions of the
    heads of the military departments of the Department of Defense and
    the Secretary of the Interior under the Strategic and Critical
    Materials Stock Piling Act, as amended, are at present in
    considerable measure subject to other authority of delegates of the
    President springing from the Defense Production Act of 1950, as
    amended. The allocation and distribution of scarce materials among
    essential civilian and military activities and the continued
    maintenance of adequate stockpiles of strategic and critical
    materials are of major current importance. The reorganization plan
    will make possible more effective coordination and close control
    over the Government's whole stockpile program. It will speed
    decisions. It can result in significant economies.
      The Department of Defense will, of course, continue to be
    responsible for presenting the needs of the military services. That
    Department and the Department of the Interior are specifically
    designated in the plan as additional agencies which shall appoint
    representatives to cooperate with the Director of the Office of
    Defense Mobilization in determining which materials are strategic
    and critical and how much of them is to be purchased. Final
    authority with regard to such determination will, however, be in
    the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization.
      Section 5(a) of the reorganization plan withholds from transfer
    to the Director and abolishes the functions of the Chairman of the
    National Security Resources Board with regard to being consulted by
    and furnishing advice to the President concerning the placing of
    orders of mandatory precedence for articles or materials for the
    use of the armed forces of the United States or for the use of the
    Atomic Energy Commission, and with regard to determining that a
    plant, mine, or other facility can be readily converted to the
    production or furnishing of such articles or materials. These
    abolished functions were vested in the National Security Resources
    Board by section 18 of the Selective Service Act of 1948 (later
    renamed as the Universal Military Training and Service Act) and
    were transferred to the Chairman of that Board by Reorganization
    Plan No. 25 of 1950. The practical effect of this abolition is to
    obviate a statutory mandate that the President consult and advise
    with another officer of the executive branch of the Government.
      Section 5(b) of the reorganization plan abolishes the direction,
    authority, and control of the Secretary of Defense over functions
    transferred from the Department of Defense by the reorganization
    plan. The Secretary's functions in this regard are provided for in
    section 202(b) of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (5
    U.S.C. 171a(b)) [see 10 U.S.C. 113(b)].
      Section 5(c) of the reorganization plan abolishes any functions
    which were vested in the Army and Navy Munitions Board or which are
    vested in the Munitions Board with respect to serving as the agent
    through which the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the
    Interior jointly act in determining which materials are strategic
    and critical under the provisions of the Strategic and Critical
    Materials Stock Piling Act, as amended, and the quality and
    quantities of such materials to be stockpiled. These abolished
    functions are provided for in section 2(a) of the Strategic and
    Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, as amended.
      After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each
    reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1953 is
    necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in
    section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended. I have
    also found and hereby declare that by reason of these
    reorganizations it is necessary to include in the reorganization
    plan provisions for the appointment and compensation of a Director
    and a Deputy Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization. The
    rates of compensation fixed for these officers are, respectively,
    those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable
    officers of the executive branch of the Government.
      The reorganization plan will permit better organization and
    management of the Federal programs relating to materials and
    requirements and will thus help to achieve the maximum degree of
    mobilization readiness at the least possible cost. It is not
    practicable, however, to itemize, in advance of actual experience,
    the reductions of expenditures to be brought about by the taking
    effect of the reorganizations included in Reorganization Plan No. 3
    of 1953.
      I urge that the Congress allow the proposed reorganization plan
    to become effective.

      (1) The Director of National Intelligence shall - 
        (A) establish and maintain a list of individuals who are known

      with the departments, agencies, and organizations described by
      subsection (c) of this section.

      (2) The Director shall ensure that the information utilized to
    determine the inclusion, or deletion or omission, of an individual
    or organization on or from the list is derived from all-source
    intelligence.
      (3) The Director shall ensure that the list is maintained in
    accordance with existing law and regulations governing the
    collection, storage, and dissemination of intelligence concerning
    United States persons.
    (c) Information sharing
      Subject to section 403-1(i) of this title, relating to the
    protection of intelligence sources and methods, the Director shall
    provide for the sharing of the list, and information on the list,
    with such departments and agencies of the Federal Government, State
    and local government agencies, and entities of foreign governments
    and international organizations as the Director considers
    appropriate.
    (d) Reporting and certification
      (1) The Director shall review on an annual basis the information
    provided by various departments and agencies for purposes of the
    list under subsection (a) of this section in order to determine
    whether or not the information so provided is derived from the
    widest possible range of intelligence available to such departments
    and agencies.
      (2) The Director shall, as a result of each review under
    paragraph (1), certify whether or not the elements of the

    in which the Director has determined that sharing information on
    the list with the departments and agencies of the Federal

    concerns addressed by section 403-3(c)(7) (!1) of this title,
    relating to the protection of sources and methods, and any instance
    in which the sharing of information on the list has been
    inappropriate in light of such concerns.

    technologies that are effective in aiding the identification of
    individuals in the field.

      agencies to carry out appropriately their domestic security
      responsibilities.
        (C) Whether the System is operating in a manner that maximizes
      its contribution to the domestic security of the United States.
        (D) If a certification under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) is
      in the negative, the modifications or enhancements of the System
      necessary to ensure a future certification in the positive.

      (2) The report shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may
    include a classified annex.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Establishment
      Not later than 18 months after December 17, 2004, the President
    shall establish a National Counter Proliferation Center, taking
    into account all appropriate government tools to prevent and halt
    the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, their delivery
    systems, and related materials and technologies.
    (b) Missions and objectives
      In establishing the National Counter Proliferation Center, the
    President shall address the following missions and objectives to
    prevent and halt the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
    their delivery systems, and related materials and technologies:
        (1) Establishing a primary organization within the United
      States Government for analyzing and integrating all intelligence
      possessed or acquired by the United States pertaining to
      proliferation.
        (2) Ensuring that appropriate agencies have full access to and
      receive all-source intelligence support needed to execute their
      counter proliferation plans or activities, and perform
      independent, alternative analyses.
        (3) Establishing a central repository on known and suspected
      proliferation activities, including the goals, strategies,
      capabilities, networks, and any individuals, groups, or entities
      engaged in proliferation.
        (4) Disseminating proliferation information, including
      proliferation threats and analyses, to the President, to the
      appropriate departments and agencies, and to the appropriate
      committees of Congress.
        (5) Conducting net assessments and warnings about the
      proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, their delivery
      systems, and related materials and technologies.
        (6) Coordinating counter proliferation plans and activities of
      the various departments and agencies of the United States
      Government to prevent and halt the proliferation of weapons of
      mass destruction, their delivery systems, and related materials
      and technologies.
        (7) Conducting strategic operational counter proliferation
      planning for the United States Government to prevent and halt the

      systems, and related materials and technologies.
    (c) National security waiver
      The President may waive the requirements of this section, and any
    parts thereof, if the President determines that such requirements
    do not materially improve the ability of the United States
    Government to prevent and halt the proliferation of weapons of mass
    destruction, their delivery systems, and related materials and
    technologies. Such waiver shall be made in writing to Congress and
    shall include a description of how the missions and objectives in
    subsection (b) of this section are being met.
    (d) Report to Congress
      (1) Not later than nine months after the implementation of this

    Order in February 2004, together with the views of the President
    regarding the establishment of a National Counter Proliferation
    Center.
      (2) If the President decides not to exercise the waiver authority
    granted by subsection (c) of this section, the President shall
    submit to Congress from time to time updates and plans regarding
    the establishment of a National Counter Proliferation Center.
    (e) Sense of Congress
      It is the sense of Congress that a central feature of counter
    proliferation activities, consistent with the President's
    Proliferation Security Initiative, should include the physical
    interdiction, by air, sea, or land, of weapons of mass destruction,
    their delivery systems, and related materials and technologies, and
    enhanced law enforcement activities to identify and disrupt
    proliferation networks, activities, organizations, and persons.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Short title
      This section may be cited as the "National Security Agency
    Voluntary Separation Act".
    (b) Definitions
      For purposes of this section - 
        (1) the term "Director" means the Director of the National
      Security Agency; and
        (2) the term "employee" means an employee of the National
      Security Agency, serving under an appointment without time
      limitation, who has been currently employed by the National
      Security Agency for a continuous period of at least 12 months
      prior to the effective date of the program established under
      subsection (c) of this section, except that such term does not
      include - 
          (A) a reemployed annuitant under subchapter III of chapter 83
        or chapter 84 of title 5 or another retirement system for
        employees of the Government; or
          (B) an employee having a disability on the basis of which
        such employee is or would be eligible for disability retirement
        under any of the retirement systems referred to in subparagraph
        (A).
    (c) Establishment of program
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Director, in his
    sole discretion, may establish a program under which employees may,
    after October 1, 2000, be eligible for early retirement, offered
    separation pay to separate from service voluntarily, or both.
    (d) Early retirement
      An employee who - 
        (1) is at least 50 years of age and has completed 20 years of
      service; or
        (2) has at least 25 years of service,

    may, pursuant to regulations promulgated under this section, apply
    and be retired from the National Security Agency and receive
    benefits in accordance with chapter 83 or 84 of title 5 if the
    employee has not less than 10 years of service with the National
    Security Agency.
    (e) Amount of separation pay and treatment for other purposes
      (1) Amount
        Separation pay shall be paid in a lump sum and shall be equal
      to the lesser of - 
          (A) an amount equal to the amount the employee would be
        entitled to receive under section 5595(c) of title 5 if the
        employee were entitled to payment under such section; or
          (B) $25,000.
      (2) Treatment
        Separation pay shall not - 
          (A) be a basis for payment, and shall not be included in the
        computation, of any other type of Government benefit; and
          (B) be taken into account for the purpose of determining the
        amount of any severance pay to which an individual may be
        entitled under section 5595 of title 5 based on any other
        separation.
    (f) Reemployment restrictions
      An employee who receives separation pay under such program may
    not be reemployed by the National Security Agency for the 12-month
    period beginning on the effective date of the employee's
    separation. An employee who receives separation pay under this
    section on the basis of a separation occurring on or after March
    30, 1994, and accepts employment with the Government of the United
    States within 5 years after the date of the separation on which
    payment of the separation pay is based shall be required to repay
    the entire amount of the separation pay to the National Security
    Agency. If the employment is with an Executive agency (as defined
    by section 105 of title 5), the Director of the Office of Personnel
    Management may, at the request of the head of the agency, waive the
    repayment if the individual involved possesses unique abilities and
    is the only qualified applicant available for the position. If the
    employment is with an entity in the legislative branch, the head of
    the entity or the appointing official may waive the repayment if
    the individual involved possesses unique abilities and is the only
    qualified applicant available for the position. If the employment
    is with the judicial branch, the Director of the Administrative
    Office of the United States Courts may waive the repayment if the
    individual involved possesses unique abilities and is the only
    qualified applicant available for the position.
    (g) Bar on certain employment
      (1) Bar
        An employee may not be separated from service under this
      section unless the employee agrees that the employee will not - 
          (A) act as agent or attorney for, or otherwise represent, any
        other person (except the United States) in any formal or
        informal appearance before, or, with the intent to influence,
        make any oral or written communication on behalf of any other
        person (except the United States) to the National Security
        Agency; or
          (B) participate in any manner in the award, modification, or
        extension of any contract for property or services with the
        National Security Agency,

      during the 12-month period beginning on the effective date of the
      employee's separation from service.
      (2) Penalty
        An employee who violates an agreement under this subsection
      shall be liable to the United States in the amount of the
      separation pay paid to the employee pursuant to this section
      multiplied by the proportion of the 12-month period during which
      the employee was in violation of the agreement.
    (h) Limitations
      Under this program, early retirement and separation pay may be
    offered only - 
        (1) with the prior approval of the Director;
        (2) for the period specified by the Director; and
        (3) to employees within such occupational groups or geographic
      locations, or subject to such other similar limitations or
      conditions, as the Director may require.
    (i) Regulations
      Before an employee may be eligible for early retirement,
    separation pay, or both, under this section, the Director shall
    prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this
    section.
    (j) Notification of exercise of authority
      The Director may not make an offer of early retirement,
    separation pay, or both, pursuant to this section until 15 days
    after submitting to the congressional intelligence committees a
    report describing the occupational groups or geographic locations,
    or other similar limitations or conditions, required by the
    Director under subsection (h) of this section, and includes (!1)
    the proposed regulations issued pursuant to subsection (i) of this
    section.

    (k) Remittance of funds
      In addition to any other payment that is required to be made
    under subchapter III of chapter 83 or chapter 84 of title 5, the
    National Security Agency shall remit to the Office of Personnel
    Management for deposit in the Treasury of the United States to the
    credit of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, an
    amount equal to 15 percent of the final basic pay of each employee
    to whom a voluntary separation payment has been or is to be paid
    under this section. The remittance required by this subsection
    shall be in lieu of any remittance required by section 4(a) of the
    Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 (5 U.S.C. 8331 note).

-STATUTE-
    (a) Reports to Congressional committees of intelligence activities
      and anticipated activities
      (1) The President shall ensure that the congressional
    intelligence committees are kept fully and currently informed of
    the intelligence activities of the United States, including any
    significant anticipated intelligence activity as required by this
    subchapter.
      (2) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as requiring
    the approval of the congressional intelligence committees as a
    condition precedent to the initiation of any significant
    anticipated intelligence activity.
    (b) Reports concerning illegal intelligence activities
      The President shall ensure that any illegal intelligence activity
    is reported promptly to the congressional intelligence committees,
    as well as any corrective action that has been taken or is planned
    in connection with such illegal activity.
    (c) Procedures for reporting information
      The President and the congressional intelligence committees shall
    each establish such procedures as may be necessary to carry out the
    provisions of this subchapter.
    (d) Procedures to protect from unauthorized disclosure
      The House of Representatives and the Senate shall each establish,
    by rule or resolution of such House, procedures to protect from
    unauthorized disclosure all classified information, and all
    information relating to intelligence sources and methods, that is
    furnished to the congressional intelligence committees or to
    Members of Congress under this subchapter. Such procedures shall be
    established in consultation with the Director of National
    Intelligence. In accordance with such procedures, each of the
    congressional intelligence committees shall promptly call to the
    attention of its respective House, or to any appropriate committee
    or committees of its respective House, any matter relating to
    intelligence activities requiring the attention of such House or
    such committee or committees.
    (e) Construction of authority conferred
      Nothing in this Act shall be construed as authority to withhold
    information from the congressional intelligence committees on the
    grounds that providing the information to the congressional
    intelligence committees would constitute the unauthorized
    disclosure of classified information or information relating to
    intelligence sources and methods.
    (f) "Intelligence activities" defined
      As used in this section, the term "intelligence activities"
    includes covert actions as defined in section 413b(e) of this

    Sec. 413b. Presidential approval and reporting of covert actions

-STATUTE-
    (a) Presidential findings
      The President may not authorize the conduct of a covert action by
    departments, agencies, or entities of the United States Government
    unless the President determines such an action is necessary to
    support identifiable foreign policy objectives of the United States
    and is important to the national security of the United States,
    which determination shall be set forth in a finding that shall meet
    each of the following conditions:
        (1) Each finding shall be in writing, unless immediate action
      by the United States is required and time does not permit the
      preparation of a written finding, in which case a written record
      of the President's decision shall be contemporaneously made and
      shall be reduced to a written finding as soon as possible but in
      no event more than 48 hours after the decision is made.
        (2) Except as permitted by paragraph (1), a finding may not
      authorize or sanction a covert action, or any aspect of any such
      action, which already has occurred.
        (3) Each finding shall specify each department, agency, or
      entity of the United States Government authorized to fund or
      otherwise participate in any significant way in such action. Any
      employee, contractor, or contract agent of a department, agency,
      or entity of the United States Government other than the Central
      Intelligence Agency directed to participate in any way in a
      covert action shall be subject either to the policies and
      regulations of the Central Intelligence Agency, or to written
      policies or regulations adopted by such department, agency, or
      entity, to govern such participation.
        (4) Each finding shall specify whether it is contemplated that
      any third party which is not an element of, or a contractor or
      contract agent of, the United States Government, or is not
      otherwise subject to United States Government policies and
      regulations, will be used to fund or otherwise participate in any
      significant way in the covert action concerned, or be used to
      undertake the covert action concerned on behalf of the United
      States.
        (5) A finding may not authorize any action that would violate
      the Constitution or any statute of the United States.
    (b) Reports to congressional intelligence committees; production of
      information
      To the extent consistent with due regard for the protection from
    unauthorized disclosure of classified information relating to
    sensitive intelligence sources and methods or other exceptionally
    sensitive matters, the Director of National Intelligence and the
    heads of all departments, agencies, and entities of the United
    States Government involved in a covert action - 
        (1) shall keep the congressional intelligence committees fully
      and currently informed of all covert actions which are the
      responsibility of, are engaged in by, or are carried out for or
      on behalf of, any department, agency, or entity of the United
      States Government, including significant failures; and
        (2) shall furnish to the congressional intelligence committees
      any information or material concerning covert actions which is in
      the possession, custody, or control of any department, agency, or
      entity of the United States Government and which is requested by
      either of the congressional intelligence committees in order to
      carry out its authorized responsibilities.
    (c) Timing of reports; access to finding
      (1) The President shall ensure that any finding approved pursuant
    to subsection (a) of this section shall be reported to the
    congressional intelligence committees as soon as possible after
    such approval and before the initiation of the covert action
    authorized by the finding, except as otherwise provided in
    paragraph (2) and paragraph (3).
      (2) If the President determines that it is essential to limit
    access to the finding to meet extraordinary circumstances affecting
    vital interests of the United States, the finding may be reported
    to the chairmen and ranking minority members of the congressional
    intelligence committees, the Speaker and minority leader of the
    House of Representatives, the majority and minority leaders of the
    Senate, and such other member or members of the congressional
    leadership as may be included by the President.
      (3) Whenever a finding is not reported pursuant to paragraph (1)
    or (2) of this section,(!1) the President shall fully inform the
    congressional intelligence committees in a timely fashion and shall
    provide a statement of the reasons for not giving prior notice.

      (4) In a case under paragraph (1), (2), or (3), a copy of the
    finding, signed by the President, shall be provided to the chairman
    of each congressional intelligence committee. When access to a

-HEAD-
    Sec. 415a-1. Budget treatment of costs of acquisition of major
      systems by the intelligence community

-STATUTE-
    (a) Independent cost estimates
      (1) The Director of National Intelligence shall, in consultation
    with the head of each element of the intelligence community
    concerned, prepare an independent cost estimate of the full life-
    cycle cost of development, procurement, and operation of each
    major system to be acquired by the intelligence community.
      (2) Each independent cost estimate for a major system shall, to
    the maximum extent practicable, specify the amount required to be
    appropriated and obligated to develop, procure, and operate the
    major system in each fiscal year of the proposed period of
    development, procurement, and operation of the major system.
      (3)(A) In the case of a program of the intelligence community
    that qualifies as a major system, an independent cost estimate
    shall be prepared before the submission to Congress of the budget
    of the President for the first fiscal year in which appropriated
    funds are anticipated to be obligated for the development or
    procurement of such major system.
      (B) In the case of a program of the intelligence community for
    which an independent cost estimate was not previously required to
    be prepared under this section, including a program for which
    development or procurement commenced before December 13, 2003, if
    the aggregate future costs of development or procurement (or any
    combination of such activities) of the program will exceed
    $500,000,000 (in current fiscal year dollars), the program shall
    qualify as a major system for purposes of this section, and an
    independent cost estimate for such major system shall be prepared
    before the submission to Congress of the budget of the President
    for the first fiscal year thereafter in which appropriated funds
    are anticipated to be obligated for such major system.
      (4) The independent cost estimate for a major system shall be
    updated upon - 
        (A) the completion of any preliminary design review associated
      with the major system;
        (B) any significant modification to the anticipated design of
      the major system; or
        (C) any change in circumstances that renders the current
      independent cost estimate for the major system inaccurate.

      (5) Any update of an independent cost estimate for a major system
    under paragraph (4) shall meet all requirements for independent
    cost estimates under this section, and shall be treated as the most
    current independent cost estimate for the major system until
    further updated under that paragraph.
    (b) Preparation of independent cost estimates
      (1) The Director shall establish within the Office of the
    Director of National Intelligence for Community Management an
    office which shall be responsible for preparing independent cost
    estimates, and any updates thereof, under subsection (a) of this
    section, unless a designation is made under paragraph (2).
      (2) In the case of the acquisition of a major system for an
    element of the intelligence community within the Department of
    Defense, the Director and the Secretary of Defense shall provide
    that the independent cost estimate, and any updates thereof, under
    subsection (a) of this section be prepared by an entity jointly
    designated by the Director and the Secretary in accordance with
    section 2434(b)(1)(A) of title 10.
    (c) Utilization in budgets of President
      (1) If the budget of the President requests appropriations for
    any fiscal year for the development or procurement of a major
    system by the intelligence community, the President shall, subject
    to paragraph (2), request in such budget an amount of
    appropriations for the development or procurement, as the case may
    be, of the major system that is equivalent to the amount of
    appropriations identified in the most current independent cost
    estimate for the major system for obligation for each fiscal year
    for which appropriations are requested for the major system in such
    budget.
      (2) If the amount of appropriations requested in the budget of
    the President for the development or procurement of a major system
    is less than the amount of appropriations identified in the most
    current independent cost estimate for the major system for
    obligation for each fiscal year for which appropriations are
    requested for the major system in such budget, the President shall
    include in the budget justification materials submitted to Congress
    in support of such budget - 
        (A) an explanation for the difference between the amount of
      appropriations requested and the amount of appropriations
      identified in the most current independent cost estimate;
        (B) a description of the importance of the major system to the
      national security;
        (C) an assessment of the consequences for the funding of all
      programs of the National Foreign Intelligence Program in future
      fiscal years if the most current independent cost estimate for
      the major system is accurate and additional appropriations are
      required in future fiscal years to ensure the continued
      development or procurement of the major system, including the
      consequences of such funding shortfalls on the major system and
      all other programs of the National Foreign Intelligence Program;
      and
        (D) such other information on the funding of the major system
      as the President considers appropriate.
    (d) Inclusion of estimates in budget justification materials
      The budget justification materials submitted to Congress in
    support of the budget of the President shall include the most
    current independent cost estimate under this section for each major
    system for which appropriations are requested in such budget for
    any fiscal year.
    (e) Definitions
      In this section:
        (1) The term "budget of the President" means the budget of the
      President for a fiscal year as submitted to Congress under
      section 1105(a) of title 31.
        (2) The term "independent cost estimate" means a pragmatic and
      neutral analysis, assessment, and quantification of all costs and
      risks associated with the acquisition of a major system, which
      shall be based on programmatic and technical specifications
      provided by the office within the element of the intelligence
      community with primary responsibility for the development,
      procurement, or operation of the major system.
        (3) The term "major system" means any significant program of an
      element of the intelligence community with projected total
      development and procurement costs exceeding $500,000,000 (in
      current fiscal year dollars), which costs shall include all end-
      to-end program costs, including costs associated with the
      development and procurement of the program and any other costs
      associated with the development and procurement of systems
      required to support or utilize the program.

    2609, provided that: "The amendments made by subsection (b)
    [enacting this section] shall take effect on the date of the
    enactment of this Act [Dec. 13, 2003]."

                          CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS                      
      Pub. L. 108-177, title III, Sec. 312(a), Dec. 13, 2003, 117 Stat.
    2606, provided that: "Congress makes the following findings:
        "(1) Funds within the National Foreign Intelligence Program
      often must be shifted from program to program and from fiscal
      year to fiscal year to address funding shortfalls caused by
      significant increases in the costs of acquisition of major
      systems by the intelligence community.
        "(2) While some increases in the costs of acquisition of major
      systems by the intelligence community are unavoidable, the
      magnitude of growth in the costs of acquisition of many major
      systems indicates a systemic bias within the intelligence
      community to underestimate the costs of such acquisition,
      particularly in the preliminary stages of development and
      production.
        "(3) Decisions by Congress to fund the acquisition of major
      systems by the intelligence community rely significantly upon
      initial estimates of the affordability of acquiring such major
      systems and occur within a context in which funds can be
      allocated for a variety of alternative programs. Thus,
      substantial increases in costs of acquisition of major systems
      place significant burdens on the availability of funds for other
      programs and new proposals within the National Foreign
      Intelligence Program.
        "(4) Independent cost estimates, prepared by independent
      offices, have historically represented a more accurate projection
      of the costs of acquisition of major systems.
        "(5) Recognizing the benefits associated with independent cost
      estimates for the acquisition of major systems, the Secretary of
      Defense has built upon the statutory requirement in section 2434
      of title 10, United States Code, to develop and consider
      independent cost estimates for the acquisition of such systems by
      mandating the use of such estimates in budget requests of the
      Department of Defense.
        "(6) The mandatory use throughout the intelligence community of
      independent cost estimates for the acquisition of major systems
      will assist the President and Congress in the development and
      funding of budgets which more accurately reflect the requirements
      and priorities of the United States Government for intelligence
      and intelligence-related activities."

         LIMITATIONS ON MAJOR SYSTEM PROCUREMENT, ACQUISITION, AND
                                DEVELOPMENT

    authorized for a fiscal year before fiscal year 2005, or for which
    funds are sought in the budget of the President for fiscal year
    2005, as submitted to Congress pursuant to section 1105(a) of title
    31, United States Code, and for which no independent cost estimate
    has been provided to Congress, no contract, or option to contract,
    for the procurement or acquisition of such major system may be
    entered into, or option to contract be exercised, before the date
    of the enactment of an Act to authorize appropriations for fiscal
    year 2005 for intelligence and intelligence-related activities of
    the United States Government.
      "(B) Subparagraph (A) shall not affect any contract for
    procurement or acquisition that was entered into before the date of
    the enactment of this Act [Dec. 13, 2003].
      "(2) Commencing as of the date of the submittal to Congress of
    the budget of the President for fiscal year 2006 pursuant to
    section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, no funds may be
    obligated or expended for the development or procurement of a major
    system until the President has complied with the requirements of
    section 506A of the National Security Act of 1947 (as added by
    subsection (b)) [50 U.S.C. 415a-1] with respect to such major

    Sec. 431. Operational files of the Central Intelligence Agency

-STATUTE-
    (a) Exemption by Director of Central Intelligence Agency
      The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, with the
    coordination of the Director of National Intelligence, may exempt
    operational files of the Central Intelligence Agency from the
    provisions of section 552 of title 5 (Freedom of Information Act)
    which require publication or disclosure, or search or review in
    connection therewith.
    (b) "Operational files" defined
      In this section, the term "operational files" means - 
        (1) files of the Directorate of Operations which document the
      conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence operations
      or intelligence or security liaison arrangements or information

      security services;
        (2) files of the Directorate for Science and Technology which
      document the means by which foreign intelligence or
      counterintelligence is collected through scientific and technical
      systems; and

      investigations conducted to determine the suitability of
      potential foreign intelligence or counterintelligence sources;

    except that files which are the sole repository of disseminated
    intelligence are not operational files.
    (c) Search and review for information
      Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, exempted
    operational files shall continue to be subject to search and review
    for information concerning - 
        (1) United States citizens or aliens lawfully admitted for
      permanent residence who have requested information on themselves
      pursuant to the provisions of section 552 of title 5 (Freedom of
      Information Act) or section 552a of title 5 (Privacy Act of
      1974);
        (2) any special activity the existence of which is not exempt
      from disclosure under the provisions of section 552 of title 5
      (Freedom of Information Act); or
        (3) the specific subject matter of an investigation by the

      Board, the Department of Justice, the Office of General Counsel
      of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Office of Inspector
      General of the Central Intelligence Agency, or the Office of the
      Director of National Intelligence for any impropriety, or
      violation of law, Executive order, or Presidential directive, in
      the conduct of an intelligence activity.
    (d) Information derived or disseminated from exempted operational
      files
      (1) Files that are not exempted under subsection (a) of this
    section which contain information derived or disseminated from
    exempted operational files shall be subject to search and review.
      (2) The inclusion of information from exempted operational files
    in files that are not exempted under subsection (a) of this section
    shall not affect the exemption under subsection (a) of this section
    of the originating operational files from search, review,
    publication, or disclosure.
      (3) Records from exempted operational files which have been
    disseminated to and referenced in files that are not exempted under
    subsection (a) of this section and which have been returned to
    exempted operational files for sole retention shall be subject to
    search and review.
    (e) Supersedure of prior law
      The provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall not be
    superseded except by a provision of law which is enacted after
    October 15, 1984, and which specifically cites and repeals or
    modifies its provisions.
    (f) Allegation; improper withholding of records; judicial review
      Whenever any person who has requested agency records under
    section 552 of title 5 (Freedom of Information Act), alleges that
    the Central Intelligence Agency has improperly withheld records
    because of failure to comply with any provision of this section,
    judicial review shall be available under the terms set forth in
    section 552(a)(4)(B) of title 5, except that - 
        (1) in any case in which information specifically authorized
      under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept
      secret in the interest of national defense or foreign relations
      which is filed with, or produced for, the court by the Central
      Intelligence Agency, such information shall be examined ex parte,
      in camera by the court;
        (2) the court shall, to the fullest extent practicable,
      determine issues of fact based on sworn written submissions of
      the parties;
        (3) when a complaint alleges that requested records were
      improperly withheld because of improper placement solely in
      exempted operational files, the complainant shall support such
      allegation with a sworn written submission, based upon personal
      knowledge or otherwise admissible evidence;
        (4)(A) when a complainant alleges that requested records were
      improperly withheld because of improper exemption of operational
      files, the Central Intelligence Agency shall meet its burden
      under section 552(a)(4)(B) of title 5 by demonstrating to the
      court by sworn written submission that exempted operational files
      likely to contain responsive records currently perform the
      functions set forth in subsection (b) of this section; and
        (B) the court may not order the Central Intelligence Agency to
      review the content of any exempted operational file or files in
      order to make the demonstration required under subparagraph (A)
      of this paragraph, unless the complainant disputes the Central
      Intelligence Agency's showing with a sworn written submission
      based on personal knowledge or otherwise admissible evidence;
        (5) in proceedings under paragraphs (3) and (4) of this
      subsection, the parties shall not obtain discovery pursuant to
      rules 26 through 36 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
      except that requests for admission may be made pursuant to rules
      26 and 36;
        (6) if the court finds under this subsection that the Central
      Intelligence Agency has improperly withheld requested records
      because of failure to comply with any provision of this section,
      the court shall order the Central Intelligence Agency to search
      and review the appropriate exempted operational file or files for
      the requested records and make such records, or portions thereof,
      available in accordance with the provisions of section 552 of
      title 5 (Freedom of Information Act), and such order shall be the
      exclusive remedy for failure to comply with this section; and
        (7) if at any time following the filing of a complaint pursuant
      to this subsection the Central Intelligence Agency agrees to
      search the appropriate exempted operational file or files for the
      requested records, the court shall dismiss the claim based upon
      such complaint.
    (g) Decennial review of exempted operational files
      Not less than once every ten years, the Director of the Central
    Intelligence Agency and the Director of National Intelligence shall
    review the exemptions in force under subsection (a) of this section
    to determine whether such exemptions may be removed from any
    category of exempted files or any portion thereof.
      The review required by paragraph (1) shall include consideration
    of the historical value or other public interest in the subject
    matter of the particular category of files or portions thereof and
    the potential for declassifying a significant part of the
    information contained therein.
      A complainant who alleges that the Central Intelligence Agency
    has improperly withheld records because of failure to comply with
    this subsection may seek judicial review in the district court of
    the United States of the district in which any of the parties
    reside, or in the District of Columbia. In such a proceeding, the
    court's review shall be limited to determining the following:
        (A) Whether the Central Intelligence Agency has conducted the
      review required by paragraph (1) before October 15, 1994, or
      before the expiration of the 10-year period beginning on the date
      of the most recent review.
        (B) Whether the Central Intelligence Agency, in fact,
      considered the criteria set forth in paragraph (2) in conducting
      the required review.

      Agency

-STATUTE-
    (a) Exemption of certain operational files from search, review,
      publication, or disclosure
      (1) The Director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency,
    with the coordination of the Director of National Intelligence, may
    exempt operational files of the National Geospatial-Intelligence
    Agency from the provisions of section 552 of title 5 which require
    publication, disclosure, search, or review in connection therewith.
      (2)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), for the purposes of this
    section, the term "operational files" means files of the National
    Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (hereafter in this section referred
    to as "NGA") concerning the activities of NGA that before the
    establishment of NGA were performed by the National Photographic
    Interpretation Center of the Central Intelligence Agency (NPIC),
    that document the means by which foreign intelligence or
    counterintelligence is collected through scientific and technical
    systems.
      (B) Files which are the sole repository of disseminated
    intelligence are not operational files.
      (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), exempted operational files
    shall continue to be subject to search and review for information
    concerning - 
        (A) United States citizens or aliens lawfully admitted for
      permanent residence who have requested information on themselves
      pursuant to the provisions of section 552 or 552a of title 5;
        (B) any special activity the existence of which is not exempt
      from disclosure under the provisions of section 552 of title 5;
      or
        (C) the specific subject matter of an investigation by any of
      the following for any impropriety, or violation of law, Executive
      order, or Presidential directive, in the conduct of an
      intelligence activity:
          (i) The congressional intelligence committees.
          (ii) The Intelligence Oversight Board.
          (iii) The Department of Justice.
          (iv) The Office of General Counsel of NGA.
          (v) The Office of the Director of NGA.
          (vi) The Office of the Inspector General of the National
        Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

      (4)(A) Files that are not exempted under paragraph (1) which
    contain information derived or disseminated from exempted
    operational files shall be subject to search and review.
      (B) The inclusion of information from exempted operational files
    in files that are not exempted under paragraph (1) shall not affect
    the exemption under paragraph (1) of the originating operational
    files from search, review, publication, or disclosure.
      (C) Records from exempted operational files which have been
    disseminated to and referenced in files that are not exempted under
    paragraph (1) and which have been returned to exempted operational
    files for sole retention shall be subject to search and review.
      (5) The provisions of paragraph (1) may not be superseded except
    by a provision of law which is enacted after December 3, 1999, and
    which specifically cites and repeals or modifies its provisions.
      (6)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), whenever any
    person who has requested agency records under section 552 of title
    5 alleges that NGA has withheld records improperly because of
    failure to comply with any provision of this section, judicial
    review shall be available under the terms set forth in section
    552(a)(4)(B) of title 5.
      (B) Judicial review shall not be available in the manner provided
    for under subparagraph (A) as follows:
        (i) In any case in which information specifically authorized
      under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept
      secret in the interests of national defense or foreign relations
      is filed with, or produced for, the court by NGA, such
      information shall be examined ex parte, in camera by the court.
        (ii) The court shall, to the fullest extent practicable,
      determine the issues of fact based on sworn written submissions
      of the parties.
        (iii) When a complainant alleges that requested records are
      improperly withheld because of improper placement solely in
      exempted operational files, the complainant shall support such
      allegation with a sworn written submission based upon personal
      knowledge or otherwise admissible evidence.
        (iv)(I) When a complainant alleges that requested records were
      improperly withheld because of improper exemption of operational
      files, NGA shall meet its burden under section 552(a)(4)(B) of
      title 5 by demonstrating to the court by sworn written submission
      that exempted operational files likely to contain responsive
      records currently perform the functions set forth in paragraph
      (2).
        (II) The court may not order NGA to review the content of any
      exempted operational file or files in order to make the
      demonstration required under subclause (I), unless the
      complainant disputes NGA's showing with a sworn written
      submission based on personal knowledge or otherwise admissible
      evidence.
        (v) In proceedings under clauses (iii) and (iv), the parties
      may not obtain discovery pursuant to rules 26 through 36 of the
      Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, except that requests for
      admissions may be made pursuant to rules 26 and 36.
        (vi) If the court finds under this paragraph that NGA has
      improperly withheld requested records because of failure to
      comply with any provision of this subsection, the court shall
      order NGA to search and review the appropriate exempted
      operational file or files for the requested records and make such
      records, or portions thereof, available in accordance with the
      provisions of section 552 of title 5, and such order shall be the
      exclusive remedy for failure to comply with this subsection.
        (vii) If at any time following the filing of a complaint
      pursuant to this paragraph NGA agrees to search the appropriate
      exempted operational file or files for the requested records, the
      court shall dismiss the claim based upon such complaint.
        (viii) Any information filed with, or produced for the court
      pursuant to clauses (i) and (iv) shall be coordinated with the
      Director of National Intelligence prior to submission to the
      court.
    (b) Decennial review of exempted operational files
      (1) Not less than once every 10 years, the Director of the
    National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the Director of
    National Intelligence shall review the exemptions in force under
    subsection (a)(1) of this section to determine whether such
    exemptions may be removed from the category of exempted files or
    any portion thereof. The Director of National Intelligence must
    approve any determination to remove such exemptions.
      (2) The review required by paragraph (1) shall include
    consideration of the historical value or other public interest in
    the subject matter of the particular category of files or portions
    thereof and the potential for declassifying a significant part of
    the information contained therein.
      (3) A complainant that alleges that NGA has improperly withheld
    records because of failure to comply with this subsection may seek
    judicial review in the district court of the United States of the
    district in which any of the parties reside, or in the District of
    Columbia. In such a proceeding, the court's review shall be limited
    to determining the following:
        (A) Whether NGA has conducted the review required by paragraph
      (1) before the expiration of the 10-year period beginning on
      December 3, 1999, or before the expiration of the 10-year period
      beginning on the date of the most recent review.
        (B) Whether NGA, in fact, considered the criteria set forth in
      paragraph (2) in conducting the required review.

      knowledge or otherwise admissible evidence.
        (D)(i) When a complainant alleges that requested records were
      improperly withheld because of improper exemption of operational

        (ii) The court may not order the National Security Agency to
      review the content of any exempted operational file or files in

      with a sworn written submission based on personal knowledge or
      otherwise admissible evidence.

      Security Agency has improperly withheld requested records because
      of failure to comply with any provision of this subsection, the
      court shall order the Agency to search and review the appropriate
      exempted operational file or files for the requested records and

      with the provisions of section 552 of title 5, and such order
      shall be the exclusive remedy for failure to comply with this
      section (other than subsection (g) of this section).
        (G) If at any time following the filing of a complaint pursuant
      to this paragraph the National Security Agency agrees to search

      requested records, the court shall dismiss the claim based upon
      such complaint.
        (H) Any information filed with, or produced for the court
      pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (D) shall be coordinated with
      the Director of National Intelligence before submission to the

    has improperly withheld records because of failure to comply with
    this subsection may seek judicial review in the district court of

-STATUTE-
      (a) Not later than 180 days after October 14, 1994, the President
    shall, by Executive order or regulation, establish procedures to
    govern access to classified information which shall be binding upon
    all departments, agencies, and offices of the executive branch of
    Government. Such procedures shall, at a minimum - 
        (1) provide that, except as may be permitted by the President,
      no employee in the executive branch of Government may be given
      access to classified information by any department, agency, or
      office of the executive branch of Government unless, based upon
      an appropriate background investigation, such access is
      determined to be clearly consistent with the national security
      interests of the United States;
        (2) establish uniform minimum requirements governing the scope
      and frequency of background investigations and reinvestigations
      for all employees in the executive branch of Government who
      require access to classified information as part of their
      official responsibilities;
        (3) provide that all employees in the executive branch of
      Government who require access to classified information shall be
      required as a condition of such access to provide to the
      employing department or agency written consent which permits
      access by an authorized investigative agency to relevant
      financial records, other financial information, consumer reports,
      travel records, and computers used in the performance of
      Government duties, as determined by the President, in accordance
      with section 436 of this title, during the period of access to
      classified information and for a period of three years
      thereafter;
        (4) provide that all employees in the executive branch of
      Government who require access to particularly sensitive
      classified information, as determined by the President, shall be
      required, as a condition of maintaining access to such
      information, to submit to the employing department or agency,
      during the period of such access, relevant information concerning
      their financial condition and foreign travel, as determined by
      the President, as may be necessary to ensure appropriate
      security; and
        (5) establish uniform minimum standards to ensure that
      employees in the executive branch of Government whose access to
      classified information is being denied or terminated under this
      subchapter are appropriately advised of the reasons for such
      denial or termination and are provided an adequate opportunity to
      respond to all adverse information which forms the basis for such
      denial or termination before final action by the department or
      agency concerned.

      (b)(1) Subsection (a) of this section shall not be deemed to
    limit or affect the responsibility and power of an agency head
    pursuant to other law or Executive order to deny or terminate
    access to classified information if the national security so
    requires. Such responsibility and power may be exercised only when
    the agency head determines that the procedures prescribed by
    subsection (a) of this section cannot be invoked in a manner that
    is consistent with the national security.
      (2) Upon the exercise of such responsibility, the agency head
    shall submit a report to the congressional intelligence committees.

      "This title may be cited as the 'Public Interest Declassification
    Act of 2000'.

      "SEC. 702. FINDINGS.
      "Congress makes the following findings:
        "(1) It is in the national interest to establish an effective,
      coordinated, and cost-effective means by which records on
      specific subjects of extraordinary public interest that do not
      undermine the national security interests of the United States
      may be collected, retained, reviewed, and disseminated to
      Congress, policymakers in the executive branch, and the public.
        "(2) Ensuring, through such measures, public access to
      information that does not require continued protection to
      maintain the national security interests of the United States is
      a key to striking the balance between secrecy essential to
      national security and the openness that is central to the proper
      functioning of the political institutions of the United States.

      "SEC. 703. PUBLIC INTEREST DECLASSIFICATION BOARD.
      "(a) Establishment. - (1) There is established within the

      interest.
        "(2) To promote the fullest possible public access to a
      thorough, accurate, and reliable documentary record of

    of this title.
      "(2) The Board may establish liaison and otherwise consult with
    such other historical and advisory committees as the Board

    the Government's need to protect such records or materials, and may
    release such records or materials in accordance with the provisions
    of Executive Order No. 12958 [set out below] or any successor order

    outweighs the public's need for access to such records or
    materials, and may deny release of such records or materials in
    accordance with the provisions of Executive Order No. 12958 or any
    successor order to such Executive order.

         COMMISSION ON PROTECTING AND REDUCING GOVERNMENT SECRECY     
      Pub. L. 103-236, title IX, Apr. 30, 1994, 108 Stat. 525, provided
    that:

      "SEC. 901. SHORT TITLE.
      "This title may be cited as the 'Protection and Reduction of
    Government Secrecy Act'.

      "SEC. 902. FINDINGS.
      "The Congress makes the following findings:
        "(1) During the Cold War an extensive secrecy system developed
      which limited public access to information and reduced the
      ability of the public to participate with full knowledge in the
      process of governmental decisionmaking.
        "(2) In 1992 alone 6,349,532 documents were classified and
      approximately three million persons held some form of security
      clearance.
        "(3) The burden of managing more than 6 million newly
      classified documents every year has led to tremendous
      administrative expense, reduced communication within the
      government and within the scientific community, reduced
      communication between the government and the people of the United
      States, and the selective and unauthorized public disclosure of
      classified information.
        "(4) It has been estimated that private businesses spend more
      than $14 billion each year implementing government mandated
      regulations for protecting classified information.
        "(5) If a smaller amount of truly sensitive information were
      classified the information could be held more securely.
        "(6) In 1970 a Task Force organized by the Defense Science
      Board and headed by Dr. Frederick Seitz concluded that 'more
      might be gained than lost if our Nation were to adopt -
      unilaterally, if necessary - a policy of complete openness in all
      areas of information'.
        "(7) The procedures for granting security clearances have
      themselves become an expensive and inefficient part of the
      secrecy system and should be closely examined.
        "(8) A bipartisan study commission specially constituted for
      the purpose of examining the consequences of the secrecy system
      will be able to offer comprehensive proposals for reform.

      "SEC. 903. PURPOSE.
      "It is the purpose of this title to establish for a two-year
    period a Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy -
    
        "(1) to examine the implications of the extensive
      classification of information and to make recommendations to
      reduce the volume of information classified and thereby to
      strengthen the protection of legitimately classified information;
      and
        "(2) to examine and make recommendations concerning current
      procedures relating to the granting of security clearances.

      "SEC. 904. COMPOSITION OF THE COMMISSION.
      "(a) Establishment. - To carry out the purpose of this title,
    there is established a Commission on Protecting and Reducing
    Government Secrecy (in this title referred to as the 'Commission').
      "(b) Composition. - The Commission shall be composed of twelve
    members, as follows:
        "(1) Four members appointed by the President, of whom two shall
      be appointed from the executive branch of the Government and two
      shall be appointed from private life.
        "(2) Two members appointed by the Majority Leader of the
      Senate, of whom one shall be a Member of the Senate and one shall
      be appointed from private life.
        "(3) Two members appointed by the Minority Leader of the
      Senate, of whom one shall be a Member of the Senate and one shall
      be appointed from private life.
        "(4) Two members appointed by the Speaker of the House of
      Representatives, of whom one shall be a Member of the House and
      one shall be appointed from private life.
        "(5) Two members appointed by the Minority Leader of the House
      of Representatives, of whom one shall be a Member of the House
      and one shall be appointed from private life.
      "(c) Chairman. - The Commission shall elect a Chairman from among
    its members.
      "(d) Quorum; Vacancies. - After its initial meeting, the
    Commission shall meet upon the call of the Chairman or a majority
    of its members. Seven members of the Commission shall constitute a
    quorum. Any vacancy in the Commission shall not affect its powers
    but shall be filled in the same manner in which the original
    appointment was made.
      "(e) Appointment of Members; Initial Meeting. - (1) It is the
    sense of the Congress that members of the Commission should be
    appointed not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of
    this title [Apr. 30, 1994].
      "(2) If after 60 days from the date of enactment of this Act
    seven or more members of the Commission have been appointed, those
    members who have been appointed may meet and select a Chairman who
    thereafter shall have authority to begin the operations of the
    Commission, including the hiring of staff.

      "SEC. 905. FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMISSION.
      "The functions of the Commission shall be - 
        "(1) to conduct, for a period of 2 years from the date of its
      first meeting, an investigation into all matters in any way
      related to any legislation, executive order, regulation,
      practice, or procedure relating to classified information or
      granting security clearances; and
        "(2) to submit to the Congress a final report containing such
      recommendations concerning the classification of national
      security information and the granting of security clearances as
      the Commission shall determine, including proposing new
      procedures, rules, regulations, or legislation.

    authorization may be denied or revoked, which shall be as
    comprehensive and detailed as the national security permits.
      (2) A reasonable opportunity to reply in writing under oath or
    affirmation to the statement of reasons.
      (3) After he has filed under oath or affirmation a written reply
    to the statement of reasons, the form and sufficiency of which may
    be prescribed by regulations issued by the head of the department
    concerned, an opportunity to appear personally before the head of
    the department concerned or his designee including, but not limited
    to, those officials named in section 8 of this order for the
    purpose of supporting his eligibility for access authorization and
    to present evidence on his behalf.
      (4) A reasonable time to prepare for that appearance.
      (5) An opportunity to be represented by counsel.
      (6) An opportunity to cross-examine persons either orally or
    through written interrogatories in accordance with section 4 on
    matters not relating to the characterization in the statement of
    reasons of any organization or individual other than the applicant.
      (7) A written notice of the final decision in his case which, if
    adverse, shall specify whether the head of the department or his
    designee, including, but not limited to, those officials named in
    section 8 of this order, found for or against him with respect to
    each allegation in the statement of reasons.
      Sec. 4. (a) An applicant shall be afforded an opportunity to
    cross-examine persons who have made oral or written statements
    adverse to the applicant relating to a controverted issue except
    that any such statement may be received and considered without
    affording such opportunity in the circumstances described in either
    of the following paragraphs:
      (1) The head of the department supplying the statement certifies
    that the person who furnished the information is a confidential
    informant who has been engaged in obtaining intelligence
    information for the Government and that disclosure of his identity
    would be substantially harmful to the national interest.
      (2) The head of the department concerned or his special designee
    for that particular purpose has preliminarily determined, after
    considering information furnished by the investigative agency
    involved as to the reliability of the person and the accuracy of
    the statement concerned, that the statement concerned appears to be
    reliable and material, and the head of the department or such
    special designee has determined that failure to receive and
    consider such statement would, in view of the level of access
    sought, be substantially harmful to the national security and that
    the person who furnished the information cannot appear to testify
    (A) due to death, severe illness, or similar cause, in which case
    the identity of the person and the information to be considered
    shall be made available to the applicant, or (B) due to some other
    cause determined by the head of the department to be good and
    sufficient.
      (b) Whenever procedures under paragraphs (1) or (2) of subsection
    (a) of this section are used (1) the applicant shall be given a
    summary of the information which shall be as comprehensive and
    detailed as the national security permits, (2) appropriate
    consideration shall be accorded to the fact that the applicant did
    not have an opportunity to cross-examine such person or persons,
    and (3) a final determination adverse to the applicant shall be
    made only by the head of the department based upon his personal
    review of the case.
      Sec. 5. (a) Records compiled in the regular course of business,
    or other physical evidence other than investigative reports, may be
    received and considered subject to rebuttal without authenticating
    witnesses, provided that such information has been furnished to the
    department concerned by an investigative agency pursuant to its
    responsibilities in connection with assisting the head of the
    department concerned to safeguard classified information within
    industry pursuant to this order.
      (b) Records compiled in the regular course of business, or other
    physical evidence other than investigative reports, relating to a
    controverted issue which, because they are classified, may not be
    inspected by the applicant, may be received and considered provided
    that: (1) the head of the department concerned or his special
    designee for that purpose has made a preliminary determination that
    such physical evidence appears to be material, (2) the head of the
    department concerned or such designee has made a determination that
    failure to receive and consider such physical evidence would, in
    view of the level of access sought, be substantially harmful to the
    national security, and (3) to the extent that the national security
    permits, a summary or description of such physical evidence is made
    available to the applicant. In every such case, information as to
    the authenticity and accuracy of such physical evidence furnished
    by the investigative agency involved shall be considered. In such
    instances a final determination adverse to the applicant shall be
    made only by the head of the department based upon his personal
    review of the case.
      Sec. 6. The head of a department of the United States or his
    representative, may issue, in appropriate cases, invitations and
    requests to appear and testify in order that the applicant may have
    the opportunity to cross-examine as provided by this order.
    Whenever a witness is so invited or requested to appear and testify
    at a proceeding and the witness is an officer or employee of the
    executive branch of the Government or a member of the armed forces
    of the United States, and the proceeding involves the activity in
    connection with which the witness is employed, travel expenses and
    per diem are authorized as provided by the Standardized Government
    Travel Regulations or the Joint Travel Regulations, as appropriate.
    In all other cases (including non-Government employees as well as
    officers or employees of the executive branch of the Government or
    members of the armed forces of the United States not covered by the
    foregoing sentence), transportation in kind and reimbursement for
    actual expenses are authorized in an amount not to exceed the
    amount payable under Standardized Government Travel Regulations. An
    officer or employee of the executive branch of the Government or a
    member of the armed forces of the United States who is invited or
    requested to appear pursuant to this paragraph shall be deemed to
    be in the performance of his official duties. So far as the
    national security permits, the head of the investigative agency
    involved shall cooperate with the Secretary, the Administrator, or
    the head of the other department or agency, as the case may be, in
    identifying persons who have made statements adverse to the
    applicant and in assisting him in making them available for cross-
    examination. If a person so invited is an officer or employee of
    the executive branch of the government or a member of the armed
    forces of the United States, the head of the department or agency
    concerned shall cooperate in making that person available for cross-
    examination.
      Sec. 7. Any determination under this order adverse to an
    applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national
    interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty
    of the applicant concerned.
      Sec. 8. Except as otherwise specified in the preceding provisions
    of this order, any authority vested in the head of a department by
    this order may be delegated to the the [sic] deputy of that
    department, or the principal assistant to the head of that
    department, as the case may be.
      Sec. 9. Nothing contained in this order shall be deemed to limit
    or affect the responsibility and powers of the head of a department
    to deny or revoke access to a specific classification category if
    the security of the nation so requires. Such authority may not be
    delegated and may be exercised only when the head of a department
    determines that the procedures prescribed in sections 3, 4, and 5
    cannot be invoked consistently with the national security and such
    determination shall be conclusive.

       EX. ORD. NO. 11932. CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN INFORMATION AND
      MATERIAL OBTAINED FROM ADVISORY BODIES CREATED TO IMPLEMENT THE
                       INTERNATIONAL ENERGY PROGRAM
      Ex. Ord. No. 11932, Aug. 4, 1976, 41 F.R. 32691, provided:
      The United States has entered into the Agreement on an
    International Energy Program of November 18, 1974, which created
    the International Energy Agency. This program is a substantial
    factor in the conduct of our foreign relations and an important
    element of our national security. The effectiveness of the
    Agreement depends significantly upon the provision and exchange of
    information and material by participants in advisory bodies created
    by the International Energy Agency. Confidentiality is essential to
    assure the free and open discussion necessary to accomplish the
    tasks assigned to those bodies. I have consulted with the Secretary
    of State, the Attorney General and the Administrator of the Federal
    Energy Administration concerning the handling and safeguarding of
    information and material in the possession of the United States
    which has been obtained pursuant to the program, and I find that
    some of such information and material requires protection as
    provided in Executive Order No. 11652 of March 8, 1972, as amended
    [formerly set out above].
      NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
    Constitution and statutes of the United States, and as President of
    the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:
      Section 1. Information and material obtained pursuant to the
    International Energy Program and which requires protection against
    unauthorized disclosure in the interest of the national defense or
    foreign relations of the United States shall be classified pursuant
    to Executive Order No. 11652 of March 8, 1972, as amended [formerly
    set out above]. The Secretary of State shall have the
    responsibility for the classification, declassification and
    safeguarding of information and material in the possession of the
    United States Government which has been obtained pursuant to:
      (a) Section 252(c)(3), (d)(2), or (e)(3) of the Energy Policy and
    Conservation Act (89 Stat. 871; 42 U.S.C. 6272(c)(3), (d)(2),
    (e)(3)), or
      (b) The Voluntary Agreement and Program relating to the
    International Energy Program (40 F.R. 16041, April 8, 1975), or
      (c) Any similar Voluntary Agreement and Program entered into
    under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act [42 U.S.C. 6201 et
    seq.] after the date of this Order.
      Sec. 2. Information or material classified pursuant to Section 1
    of this Order may be exempted from the General Declassification
    Schedule established by Section 5 of Executive Order No. 11652
    [formerly set out above] if it was obtained by the United States on
    the understanding that it be kept in confidence, or if it might
    otherwise be exempted under Section 5(B) of such Order.
      Sec. 3. (a) Within 60 days of the date of this Order, the
    Secretary of State shall promulgate regulations which implement his
    responsibilities under this Order.
      (b) The directives issued under Section 6 of Executive Order No.
    11652 [formerly set out above] shall not apply to information and
    material classified under this Order. However, the regulations
    promulgated by the Secretary of State shall:
        (1) conform, to the extent practicable, to the policies set
      forth in Section 6 of Executive Order No. 11652 [formerly set out
      above], and
        (2) provide that he may take such measures as he deems
      necessary and appropriate to ensure the confidentiality of any
      information and material classified under this Order that may
      remain in the custody or control of any person outside the United
      States Government.

    12163, Sept. 29, 1979, 44 F.R. 56673, which related to

    safeguarding national security information, was revoked by Ex. Ord.
    No. 12958, Sec. 6.1(d), Apr. 17, 1995, 60 F.R. 19843, set out
    below.

       EX. ORD. NO. 12812. DECLASSIFICATION AND RELEASE OF MATERIALS
           PERTAINING TO PRISONERS OF WAR AND MISSING IN ACTION
      Ex. Ord. No. 12812, July 22, 1992, 57 F.R. 32879, provided:
      WHEREAS, the Senate, by S. Res. 324 of July 2, 1992, has asked
    that I "expeditiously issue an Executive order requiring all
    executive branch departments and agencies to declassify and
    publicly release without compromising United States national
    security all documents, files, and other materials pertaining to
    POWs and MIAs;" and
      WHEREAS, indiscriminate release of classified material could
    jeopardize continuing United States Government efforts to achieve
    the fullest possible accounting of Vietnam-era POWs and MIAs; and
      WHEREAS, I have concluded that the public interest would be
    served by the declassification and public release of materials
    pertaining to Vietnam-era POWs and MIAs as provided below;
      NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the
    Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby
    order as follows:
      Section 1. All executive departments and agencies shall
    expeditiously review all documents, files, and other materials
    pertaining to American POWs and MIAs lost in Southeast Asia for the
    purposes of declassification in accordance with the standards and
    procedures of Executive Order No. 12356 [formerly set out above].
      Sec. 2. All executive departments and agencies shall make
    publicly available documents, files, and other materials
    declassified pursuant to section 1, except for those the disclosure
    of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of
    personal privacy of returnees, family members of POWs and MIAs, or
    other persons, or would impair the deliberative processes of the
    executive branch.
      Sec. 3. This order is not intended to create any right or
    benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against
    the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers
    or employees, or any other person.

         EX. ORD. NO. 12829. NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM     
      Ex. Ord. No. 12829, Jan. 6, 1993, 58 F.R. 3479, as amended by Ex.
    Ord. No. 12885, Dec. 14, 1993, 58 F.R. 65863, provided:
      This order establishes a National Industrial Security Program to
    safeguard Federal Government classified information that is
    released to contractors, licensees, and grantees of the United
    States Government. To promote our national interests, the United
    States Government issues contracts, licenses, and grants to
    nongovernment organizations. When these arrangements require access
    to classified information, the national security requires that this
    information be safeguarded in a manner equivalent to its protection
    within the executive branch of Government. The national security
    also requires that our industrial security program promote the
    economic and technological interests of the United States.
    Redundant, overlapping, or unnecessary requirements impede those
    interests. Therefore, the National Industrial Security Program
    shall serve as a single, integrated, cohesive industrial security
    program to protect classified information and to preserve our
    Nation's economic and technological interests.
      Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the
    Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
    including the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2011-
    2286) [42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.], the National Security Act of 1947,
    as amended (codified as amended in scattered sections of the United
    States Code) [see Short Title note set out under section 401 of
    this title], and the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5
    U.S.C. App. 2) [5 U.S.C. App.], it is hereby ordered as follows:


-MISC2-
                     PART 1. ESTABLISHMENT AND POLICY                 
      Section 101. Establishment. (a) There is established a National
    Industrial Security Program. The purpose of this program is to
    safeguard classified information that may be released or has been
    released to current, prospective, or former contractors, licensees,
    or grantees of United States agencies. For the purposes of this
    order, the terms "contractor, licensee, or grantee" means current,
    prospective, or former contractors, licensees, or grantees of
    United States agencies. The National Industrial Security Program
    shall be applicable to all executive branch departments and
    agencies.
      (b) The National Industrial Security Program shall provide for
    the protection of information classified pursuant to Executive
    Order No. 12356 of April 2, 1982 [formerly set out above], or its
    successor, and the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended [42 U.S.C.
    2011 et seq.].
      (c) For the purposes of this order, the term "contractor" does
    not include individuals engaged under personal services contracts.
      Sec. 102. Policy Direction. (a) The National Security Council
    shall provide overall policy direction for the National Industrial
    Security Program.
      (b) The Director of the Information Security Oversight Office,
    established under Executive Order No. 12356 of April 2, 1982
    [formerly set out above], shall be responsible for implementing and
    monitoring the National Industrial Security Program and shall:
      (1) develop, in consultation with the agencies, and promulgate
    subject to the approval of the National Security Council,
    directives for the implementation of this order, which shall be
    binding on the agencies;
      (2) oversee agency, contractor, licensee, and grantee actions to
    ensure compliance with this order and implementing directives;
      (3) review all agency implementing regulations, internal rules,
    or guidelines. The Director shall require any regulation, rule, or
    guideline to be changed if it is not consistent with this order or
    implementing directives. Any such decision by the Director may be
    appealed to the National Security Council. The agency regulation,
    rule, or guideline shall remain in effect pending a prompt decision
    on the appeal;
      (4) have the authority, pursuant to terms of applicable
    contracts, licenses, grants, or regulations, to conduct on-site
    reviews of the implementation of the National Industrial Security
    Program by each agency, contractor, licensee, and grantee that has
    access to or stores classified information and to require of each
    agency, contractor, licensee, and grantee those reports,
    information, and other cooperation that may be necessary to fulfill
    the Director's responsibilities. If these reports, inspections, or
    access to specific classified information, or other forms of
    cooperation, would pose an exceptional national security risk, the
    affected agency head or the senior official designated under
    section 203(a) of this order may request the National Security
    Council to deny access to the Director. The Director shall not have
    access pending a prompt decision by the National Security Council;
      (5) report any violations of this order or its implementing
    directives to the head of the agency or to the senior official
    designated under section 203(a) of this order so that corrective
    action, if appropriate, may be taken. Any such report pertaining to
    the implementation of the National Industrial Security Program by a
    contractor, licensee, or grantee shall be directed to the agency
    that is exercising operational oversight over the contractor,
    licensee, or grantee under section 202 of this order;
      (6) consider and take action on complaints and suggestions from
    persons within or outside the Government with respect to the
    administration of the National Industrial Security Program;
      (7) consider, in consultation with the advisory committee
    established by this order, affected agencies, contractors,
    licensees, and grantees, and recommend to the President through the
    National Security Council changes to this order; and
      (8) report at least annually to the President through the
    National Security Council on the implementation of the National
    Industrial Security Program.
      (c) Nothing in this order shall be construed to supersede the
    authority of the Secretary of Energy or the Nuclear Regulatory
    Commission under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended [42
    U.S.C. 2011 et seq.], or the authority of the Director of Central
    Intelligence under the National Security Act of 1947, as amended
    [see Short Title note set out under section 401 of this title], or
    Executive Order No. 12333 of December 8, 1981 [50 U.S.C. 401 note].
      Sec. 103. National Industrial Security Program Policy Advisory
    Committee. (a) Establishment. There is established the National
    Industrial Security Program Policy Advisory Committee
    ("Committee"). The Director of the Information Security Oversight
    Office shall serve as Chairman of the Committee and appoint the
    members of the Committee. The members of the Committee shall be the
    representatives of those departments and agencies most affected by
    the National Industrial Security Program and nongovernment
    representatives of contractors, licensees, or grantees involved
    with classified contracts, licenses, or grants, as determined by
    the Chairman.
      (b) Functions. (1) The Committee members shall advise the
    Chairman of the Committee on all matters concerning the policies of
    the National Industrial Security Program, including recommended
    changes to those policies as reflected in this order, its
    implementing directives, or the operating manual established under
    this order, and serve as a forum to discuss policy issues in
    dispute.
      (2) The Committee shall meet at the request of the Chairman, but
    at least twice during the calendar year.
      (c) Administration. (1) Members of the Committee shall serve
    without compensation for their work on the Committee. However,

      Sec. 201. National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual.
    (a) The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with all affected
    agencies and with the concurrence of the Secretary of Energy, the
    Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Director of Central
    Intelligence, shall issue and maintain a National Industrial
    Security Program Operating Manual ("Manual"). The Secretary of
    Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall prescribe and
    issue that portion of the Manual that pertains to information
    classified under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended [42
    U.S.C. 2011 et seq.]. The Director of Central Intelligence shall
    prescribe and issue that portion of the Manual that pertains to
    intelligence sources and methods, including Sensitive Compartmented
    Information.
      (b) The Manual shall prescribe specific requirements,
    restrictions, and other safeguards that are necessary to preclude
    unauthorized disclosure and control authorized disclosure of
    classified information to contractors, licensees, or grantees. The
    Manual shall apply to the release of classified information during
    all phases of the contracting process including bidding,
    negotiation, award, performance, and termination of contracts, the
    licensing process, or the grant process, with or under the control
    of departments or agencies.
      (c) The Manual shall also prescribe requirements, restrictions,
    and other safeguards that are necessary to protect special classes
    of classified information, including Restricted Data, Formerly
    Restricted Data, intelligence sources and methods information,
    Sensitive Compartmented Information, and Special Access Program
    information.
      (d) In establishing particular requirements, restrictions, and
    other safeguards within the Manual, the Secretary of Defense, the
    Secretary of Energy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the
    Director of Central Intelligence shall take into account these
    factors: (i) the damage to the national security that reasonably
    could be expected to result from an unauthorized disclosure; (ii)
    the existing or anticipated threat to the disclosure of
    information; and (iii) the short- and long-term costs of the
    requirements, restrictions, and other safeguards.
      (e) To the extent that is practicable and reasonable, the
    requirements, restrictions, and safeguards that the Manual
    establishes for the protection of classified information by
    contractors, licensees, and grantees shall be consistent with the
    requirements, restrictions, and safeguards that directives
    implementing Executive Order No. 12356 of April 2, 1982 [formerly
    set out above], or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended,
    establish for the protection of classified information by agencies.
    Upon request by the Chairman of the Committee, the Secretary of
    Defense shall provide an explanation and justification for any
    requirement, restriction, or safeguard that results in a standard
    for the protection of classified information by contractors,
    licensees, and grantees that differs from the standard that applies
    to agencies.
      (f) The Manual shall be issued to correspond as closely as
    possible to pertinent decisions of the Secretary of Defense and the
    Director of Central Intelligence made pursuant to the
    recommendations of the Joint Security Review Commission and to
    revisions to the security classification system that result from
    Presidential Review Directive 29, but in any event no later than
    June 30, 1994.
      Sec. 202. Operational Oversight. (a) The Secretary of Defense
    shall serve as Executive Agent for inspecting and monitoring the
    contractors, licensees, and grantees who require or will require
    access to, or who store or will store classified information; and
    for determining the eligibility for access to classified
    information of contractors, licensees, and grantees and their
    respective employees. The heads of agencies shall enter into
    agreements with the Secretary of Defense that establish the terms
    of the Secretary's responsibilities on behalf of these agency
    heads.
      (b) The Director of Central Intelligence retains authority over
    access to intelligence sources and methods, including Sensitive
    Compartmented Information. The Director of Central Intelligence may
    inspect and monitcr [sic] contractor, licensee, and grantee
    programs and facilities that involve access to such information or
    may enter into written agreements with the Secretary of Defense, as
    Executive Agent, to inspect and monitor these programs or
    facilities, in whole or in part, on the Director's behalf.
      (c) The Secretary of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
    retain authority over access to information under their respective
    programs classified under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended
    [42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.]. The Secretary or the Commission may
    inspect and monitor contractor, licensee, and grantee programs and
    facilities that involve access to such information or may enter
    into written agreements with the Secretary of Defense, as Executive
    Agent, to inspect and monitor these programs or facilities, in
    whole or in part, on behalf of the Secretary or the Commission,
    respectively.
      (d) The Executive Agent shall have the authority to issue, after
    consultation with affected agencies, standard forms or other
    standardization that will promote the implementation of the
    National Industrial Security Program.
      Sec. 203. Implementation. (a) The head of each agency that enters
    into classified contracts, licenses, or grants shall designate a
    senior agency official to direct and administer the agency's
    implementation and compliance with the National Industrial Security
    Program.
      (b) Agency implementing regulations, internal rules, or
    guidelines shall be consistent with this order, its implementing
    directives, and the Manual. Agencies shall issue these regulations,
    rules, or guidelines no later than 180 days from the issuance of
    the Manual. They may incorporate all or portions of the Manual by
    reference.
      (c) Each agency head or the senior official designated under
    paragraph (a) above shall take appropriate and prompt corrective
    action whenever a violation of this order, its implementing
    directives, or the Manual occurs.
      (d) The senior agency official designated under paragraph (a)
    above shall account each year for the costs within the agency
    associated with the implementation of the National Industrial
    Security Program. These costs shall be reported to the Director of
    the Information Security Oversight Office, who shall include them
    in the reports to the President prescribed by this order.
      (e) The Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the
    Administrator of General Services, the Administrator of the
    National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and such other
    agency heads or officials who may be responsible, shall amend the
    Federal Acquisition Regulation to be consistent with the
    implementation of the National Industrial Security Program.
      (f) All contracts, licenses, or grants that involve access to
    classified information and that are advertised or proposed
    following the issuance of agency regulations, rules, or guidelines
    described in paragraph (b) above shall comply with the National
    Industrial Security Program. To the extent that is feasible,
    economical, and permitted by law, agencies shall amend, modify, or
    convert preexisting contracts, licenses, or grants, or previously
    advertised or proposed contracts, licenses, or grants, that involve
    access to classified information for operation under the National
    Industrial Security Program. Any direct inspection or monitoring of
    contractors, licensees, or grantees specified by this order shall
    be carried out pursuant to the terms of a contract, license, grant,
    or regulation.

    comprehensive and exclusive system for the public release of
    imagery acquired by space-based national intelligence

      (b) Nothing contained in this order shall create any right or
    benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by any party
    against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its
    officers or employees, or any other person.

       EX. ORD. NO. 12958. CLASSIFIED NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION   
      Ex. Ord. No. 12958, Apr. 17, 1995, 60 F.R. 19825, as amended by
    Ex. Ord. No. 12972, Sept. 18, 1995, 60 F.R. 48863; Ex. Ord. No.
    13142, Nov. 19, 1999, 64 F.R. 66089; Ex. Ord. No. 13292, Mar. 25,
    2003, 68 F.R. 15315, provided:
      This order prescribes a uniform system for classifying,
    safeguarding, and declassifying national security information,
    including information relating to defense against transnational
    terrorism. Our democratic principles require that the American
    people be informed of the activities of their Government. Also, our
    Nation's progress depends on the free flow of information.
    Nevertheless, throughout our history, the national defense has
    required that certain information be maintained in confidence in
    order to protect our citizens, our democratic institutions, our
    homeland security, and our interactions with foreign nations.
    Protecting information critical to our Nation's security remains a
    priority.
      NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the
    Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is
    hereby ordered as follows:


-MISC3-
                     PART 1 - ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION                 
      Sec. 1.1. Classification Standards. (a) Information may be
    originally classified under the terms of this order only if all of
    the following conditions are met:
      (1) an original classification authority is classifying the
    information;
      (2) the information is owned by, produced by or for, or is under
    the control of the United States Government;
      (3) the information falls within one or more of the categories of
    information listed in section 1.4 of this order; and
      (4) the original classification authority determines that the
    unauthorized disclosure of the information reasonably could be
    expected to result in damage to the national security, which
    includes defense against transnational terrorism, and the original
    classification authority is able to identify or describe the
    damage.
      (b) Classified information shall not be declassified
    automatically as a result of any unauthorized disclosure of
    identical or similar information.
      (c) The unauthorized disclosure of foreign government information
    is presumed to cause damage to the national security.
      Sec. 1.2. Classification Levels. (a) Information may be
    classified at one of the following three levels:
      (1) "Top Secret" shall be applied to information, the
    unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to
    cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security that the
    original classification authority is able to identify or describe.
      (2) "Secret" shall be applied to information, the unauthorized
    disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious
    damage to the national security that the original classification
    authority is able to identify or describe.
      (3) "Confidential" shall be applied to information, the
    unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to
    cause damage to the national security that the original
    classification authority is able to identify or describe.
      (b) Except as otherwise provided by statute, no other terms shall
    be used to identify United States classified information.
      Sec. 1.3. Classification Authority. (a) The authority to classify
    information originally may be exercised only by:
      (1) the President and, in the performance of executive duties,
    the Vice President;
      (2) agency heads and officials designated by the President in the
    Federal Register; and
      (3) United States Government officials delegated this authority
    pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
      (b) Officials authorized to classify information at a specified
    level are also authorized to classify information at a lower level.
      (c) Delegation of original classification authority.
      (1) Delegations of original classification authority shall be
    limited to the minimum required to administer this order. Agency
    heads are responsible for ensuring that designated subordinate
    officials have a demonstrable and continuing need to exercise this
    authority.
      (2) "Top Secret" original classification authority may be
    delegated only by the President; in the performance of executive
    duties, the Vice President; or an agency head or official
    designated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
      (3) "Secret" or "Confidential" original classification authority
    may be delegated only by the President; in the performance of
    executive duties, the Vice President; or an agency head or official
    designated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section; or the
    senior agency official described in section 5.4(d) of this order,
    provided that official has been delegated "Top Secret" original
    classification authority by the agency head.
      (4) Each delegation of original classification authority shall be
    in writing and the authority shall not be redelegated except as
    provided in this order. Each delegation shall identify the official
    by name or position title.
      (d) Original classification authorities must receive training in
    original classification as provided in this order and its
    implementing directives. Such training must include instruction on
    the proper safeguarding of classified information and of the
    criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions that may be brought
    against an individual who fails to protect classified information
    from unauthorized disclosure.
      (e) Exceptional cases. When an employee, government contractor,
    licensee, certificate holder, or grantee of an agency who does not
    have original classification authority originates information
    believed by that person to require classification, the information
    shall be protected in a manner consistent with this order and its
    implementing directives. The information shall be transmitted
    promptly as provided under this order or its implementing
    directives to the agency that has appropriate subject matter
    interest and classification authority with respect to this
    information. That agency shall decide within 30 days whether to
    classify this information. If it is not clear which agency has
    classification responsibility for this information, it shall be
    sent to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office.
    The Director shall determine the agency having primary subject
    matter interest and forward the information, with appropriate
    recommendations, to that agency for a classification determination.
      Sec. 1.4. Classification Categories. Information shall not be
    considered for classification unless it concerns:
      (a) military plans, weapons systems, or operations;
      (b) foreign government information;
      (c) intelligence activities (including special activities),
    intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology;
      (d) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States,
    including confidential sources;
      (e) scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to
    the national security, which includes defense against transnational
    terrorism;
      (f) United States Government programs for safeguarding nuclear
    materials or facilities;
      (g) vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations,
    infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services relating
    to the national security, which includes defense against
    transnational terrorism; or
      (h) weapons of mass destruction.
      Sec. 1.5. Duration of Classification. (a) At the time of original
    classification, the original classification authority shall attempt
    to establish a specific date or event for declassification based
    upon the duration of the national security sensitivity of the
    information. Upon reaching the date or event, the information shall
    be automatically declassified. The date or event shall not exceed
    the time frame established in paragraph (b) of this section.
      (b) If the original classification authority cannot determine an
    earlier specific date or event for declassification, information
    shall be marked for declassification 10 years from the date of the
    original decision, unless the original classification authority
    otherwise determines that the sensitivity of the information
    requires that it shall be marked for declassification for up to 25
    years from the date of the original decision. All information
    classified under this section shall be subject to section 3.3 of
    this order if it is contained in records of permanent historical
    value under title 44, United States Code.
      (c) An original classification authority may extend the duration
    of classification, change the level of classification, or
    reclassify specific information only when the standards and
    procedures for classifying information under this order are
    followed.
      (d) Information marked for an indefinite duration of
    classification under predecessor orders, for example, marked as
    "Originating Agency's Determination Required," or information
    classified under predecessor orders that contains no
    declassification instructions shall be declassified in accordance
    with part 3 of this order.
      Sec. 1.6. Identification and Markings. (a) At the time of
    original classification, the following shall appear on the face of
    each classified document, or shall be applied to other classified
    media in an appropriate manner:
      (1) one of the three classification levels defined in section 1.2
    of this order;
      (2) the identity, by name or personal identifier and position, of
    the original classification authority;
      (3) the agency and office of origin, if not otherwise evident;
      (4) declassification instructions, which shall indicate one of
    the following:
        (A) the date or event for declassification, as prescribed in
      section 1.5(a) or section 1.5(c);
        (B) the date that is 10 years from the date of original
      classification, as prescribed in section 1.5(b); or
        (C) the date that is up to 25 years from the date of original
      classification, as prescribed in section 1.5(b); and
      (5) a concise reason for classification that, at a minimum, cites
    the applicable classification categories in section 1.4 of this
    order.
      (b) Specific information described in paragraph (a) of this
    section may be excluded if it would reveal additional classified
    information.
      (c) With respect to each classified document, the agency
    originating the document shall, by marking or other means, indicate
    which portions are classified, with the applicable classification
    level, and which portions are unclassified. In accordance with
    standards prescribed in directives issued under this order, the
    Director of the Information Security Oversight Office may grant
    waivers of this requirement. The Director shall revoke any waiver
    upon a finding of abuse.
      (d) Markings implementing the provisions of this order, including
    abbreviations and requirements to safeguard classified working
    papers, shall conform to the standards prescribed in implementing
    directives issued pursuant to this order.
      (e) Foreign government information shall retain its original
    classification markings or shall be assigned a U.S. classification
    that provides a degree of protection at least equivalent to that
    required by the entity that furnished the information. Foreign
    government information retaining its original classification
    markings need not be assigned a U.S. classification marking
    provided that the responsible agency determines that the foreign
    government markings are adequate to meet the purposes served by
    U.S. classification markings.
      (f) Information assigned a level of classification under this or
    predecessor orders shall be considered as classified at that level
    of classification despite the omission of other required markings.
    Whenever such information is used in the derivative classification
    process or is reviewed for possible declassification, holders of
    such information shall coordinate with an appropriate
    classification authority for the application of omitted markings.
      (g) The classification authority shall, whenever practicable, use
    a classified addendum whenever classified information constitutes a
    small portion of an otherwise unclassified document.
      (h) Prior to public release, all declassified records shall be
    appropriately marked to reflect their declassification.
      Sec. 1.7. Classification Prohibitions and Limitations.
      (a) In no case shall information be classified in order to:
      (1) conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative
    error;
      (2) prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency;
      (3) restrain competition; or
      (4) prevent or delay the release of information that does not
    require protection in the interest of the national security.
      (b) Basic scientific research information not clearly related to
    the national security shall not be classified.
      (c) Information may be reclassified after declassification and
    release to the public under proper authority only in accordance
    with the following conditions:
      (1) the reclassification action is taken under the personal
    authority of the agency head or deputy agency head, who determines
    in writing that the reclassification of the information is
    necessary in the interest of the national security;
      (2) the information may be reasonably recovered; and
      (3) the reclassification action is reported promptly to the
    Director of the Information Security Oversight Office.
      (d) Information that has not previously been disclosed to the
    public under proper authority may be classified or reclassified
    after an agency has received a request for it under the Freedom of
    Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C.
    552a), or the mandatory review provisions of section 3.5 of this
    order only if such classification meets the requirements of this
    order and is accomplished on a document-by-document basis with the
    personal participation or under the direction of the agency head,
    the deputy agency head, or the senior agency official designated
    under section 5.4 of this order.
      (e) Compilations of items of information that are individually
    unclassified may be classified if the compiled information reveals
    an additional association or relationship that: (1) meets the
    standards for classification under this order; and (2) is not
    otherwise revealed in the individual items of information. As used
    in this order, "compilation" means an aggregation of pre-existing
    unclassified items of information.
      Sec. 1.8. Classification Challenges. (a) Authorized holders of
    information who, in good faith, believe that its classification
    status is improper are encouraged and expected to challenge the
    classification status of the information in accordance with agency
    procedures established under paragraph (b) of this section.
      (b) In accordance with implementing directives issued pursuant to
    this order, an agency head or senior agency official shall
    establish procedures under which authorized holders of information
    are encouraged and expected to challenge the classification of
    information that they believe is improperly classified or
    unclassified. These procedures shall ensure that:
      (1) individuals are not subject to retribution for bringing such
    actions;
      (2) an opportunity is provided for review by an impartial
    official or panel; and
      (3) individuals are advised of their right to appeal agency
    decisions to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel
    (Panel) established by section 5.3 of this order.

                    PART 2 - DERIVATIVE CLASSIFICATION                
      Sec. 2.1. Use of Derivative Classification. (a) Persons who only
    reproduce, extract, or summarize classified information, or who
    only apply classification markings derived from source material or
    as directed by a classification guide, need not possess original
    classification authority.
      (b) Persons who apply derivative classification markings shall:
      (1) observe and respect original classification decisions; and
      (2) carry forward to any newly created documents the pertinent
    classification markings. For information derivatively classified
    based on multiple sources, the derivative classifier shall carry
    forward:
        (A) the date or event for declassification that corresponds to
      the longest period of classification among the sources; and
        (B) a listing of these sources on or attached to the official
      file or record copy.
      Sec. 2.2. Classification Guides. (a) Agencies with original
    classification authority shall prepare classification guides to
    facilitate the proper and uniform derivative classification of
    information. These guides shall conform to standards contained in
    directives issued under this order.
      (b) Each guide shall be approved personally and in writing by an
    official who:
      (1) has program or supervisory responsibility over the
    information or is the senior agency official; and
      (2) is authorized to classify information originally at the
    highest level of classification prescribed in the guide.
      (c) Agencies shall establish procedures to ensure that
    classification guides are reviewed and updated as provided in
    directives issued under this order.

                 PART 3 - DECLASSIFICATION AND DOWNGRADING             
      Sec. 3.1. Authority for Declassification. (a) Information shall
    be declassified as soon as it no longer meets the standards for
    classification under this order.
      (b) It is presumed that information that continues to meet the
    classification requirements under this order requires continued
    protection. In some exceptional cases, however, the need to protect
    such information may be outweighed by the public interest in
    disclosure of the information, and in these cases the information
    should be declassified. When such questions arise, they shall be
    referred to the agency head or the senior agency official. That
    official will determine, as an exercise of discretion, whether the
    public interest in disclosure outweighs the damage to the national
    security that might reasonably be expected from disclosure. This
    provision does not:
      (1) amplify or modify the substantive criteria or procedures for
    classification; or
      (2) create any substantive or procedural rights subject to
    judicial review.
      (c) If the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office
    determines that information is classified in violation of this
    order, the Director may require the information to be declassified
    by the agency that originated the classification. Any such decision
    by the Director may be appealed to the President through the
    Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. The
    information shall remain classified pending a prompt decision on
    the appeal.
      (d) The provisions of this section shall also apply to agencies
    that, under the terms of this order, do not have original
    classification authority, but had such authority under predecessor
    orders.
      Sec. 3.2. Transferred Records. (a) In the case of classified
    records transferred in conjunction with a transfer of functions,
    and not merely for storage purposes, the receiving agency shall be
    deemed to be the originating agency for purposes of this order.
      (b) In the case of classified records that are not officially
    transferred as described in paragraph (a) of this section, but that
    originated in an agency that has ceased to exist and for which
    there is no successor agency, each agency in possession of such
    records shall be deemed to be the originating agency for purposes
    of this order. Such records may be declassified or downgraded by
    the agency in possession after consultation with any other agency
    that has an interest in the subject matter of the records.
      (c) Classified records accessioned into the National Archives and
    Records Administration (National Archives) as of the effective date
    of this order shall be declassified or downgraded by the Archivist
    of the United States (Archivist) in accordance with this order, the
    directives issued pursuant to this order, agency declassification
    guides, and any existing procedural agreement between the Archivist
    and the relevant agency head.
      (d) The originating agency shall take all reasonable steps to
    declassify classified information contained in records determined
    to have permanent historical value before they are accessioned into
    the National Archives. However, the Archivist may require that
    classified records be accessioned into the National Archives when
    necessary to comply with the provisions of the Federal Records Act
    [see References in Text note set out under section 3603 of Title
    44, Public Printing and Documents]. This provision does not apply
    to records being transferred to the Archivist pursuant to section
    2203 of title 44, United States Code, or records for which the
    National Archives serves as the custodian of the records of an
    agency or organization that has gone out of existence.
      (e) To the extent practicable, agencies shall adopt a system of
    records management that will facilitate the public release of
    documents at the time such documents are declassified pursuant to
    the provisions for automatic declassification in section 3.3 of
    this order.
      Sec. 3.3. Automatic Declassification. (a) Subject to paragraphs
    (b)-(e) of this section, on December 31, 2006, all classified
    records that (1) are more than 25 years old and (2) have been
    determined to have permanent historical value under title 44,
    United States Code, shall be automatically declassified whether or
    not the records have been reviewed. Subsequently, all classified
    records shall be automatically declassified on December 31 of the
    year that is 25 years from the date of its original classification,
    except as provided in paragraphs (b)-(e) of this section.
      (b) An agency head may exempt from automatic declassification
    under paragraph (a) of this section specific information, the
    release of which could be expected to:
      (1) reveal the identity of a confidential human source, or a
    human intelligence source, or reveal information about the
    application of an intelligence source or method;
      (2) reveal information that would assist in the development or
    use of weapons of mass destruction;
      (3) reveal information that would impair U.S. cryptologic systems
    or activities;
      (4) reveal information that would impair the application of state
    of the art technology within a U.S. weapon system;
      (5) reveal actual U.S. military war plans that remain in effect;
      (6) reveal information, including foreign government information,
    that would seriously and demonstrably impair relations between the
    United States and a foreign government, or seriously and
    demonstrably undermine ongoing diplomatic activities of the United
    States;
      (7) reveal information that would clearly and demonstrably impair
    the current ability of United States Government officials to
    protect the President, Vice President, and other protectees for
    whom protection services, in the interest of the national security,
    are authorized;
      (8) reveal information that would seriously and demonstrably
    impair current national security emergency preparedness plans or
    reveal current vulnerabilities of systems, installations,
    infrastructures, or projects relating to the national security; or
      (9) violate a statute, treaty, or international agreement.
      (c) An agency head shall notify the President through the
    Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs of any
    specific file series of records for which a review or assessment
    has determined that the information within that file series almost
    invariably falls within one or more of the exemption categories
    listed in paragraph (b) of this section and which the agency
    proposes to exempt from automatic declassification. The
    notification shall include:
      (1) a description of the file series;
      (2) an explanation of why the information within the file series
    is almost invariably exempt from automatic declassification and why
    the information must remain classified for a longer period of time;
    and
      (3) except for the identity of a confidential human source or a
    human intelligence source, as provided in paragraph (b) of this
    section, a specific date or event for declassification of the
    information. The President may direct the agency head not to exempt
    the file series or to declassify the information within that series
    at an earlier date than recommended. File series exemptions
    previously approved by the President shall remain valid without any
    additional agency action.
      (d) At least 180 days before information is automatically
    declassified under this section, an agency head or senior agency
    official shall notify the Director of the Information Security
    Oversight Office, serving as Executive Secretary of the Panel, of
    any specific information beyond that included in a notification to
    the President under paragraph (c) of this section that the agency
    proposes to exempt from automatic declassification. The
    notification shall include:
      (1) a description of the information, either by reference to
    information in specific records or in the form of a
    declassification guide;
      (2) an explanation of why the information is exempt from
    automatic declassification and must remain classified for a longer
    period of time; and
      (3) except for the identity of a confidential human source or a
    human intelligence source, as provided in paragraph (b) of this
    section, a specific date or event for declassification of the
    information. The Panel may direct the agency not to exempt the
    information or to declassify it at an earlier date than
    recommended. The agency head may appeal such a decision to the
    President through the Assistant to the President for National
    Security Affairs. The information will remain classified while such
    an appeal is pending.
      (e) The following provisions shall apply to the onset of
    automatic declassification:
      (1) Classified records within an integral file block, as defined
    in this order, that are otherwise subject to automatic
    declassification under this section shall not be automatically
    declassified until December 31 of the year that is 25 years from
    the date of the most recent record within the file block.
      (2) By notification to the Director of the Information Security
    Oversight Office, before the records are subject to automatic
    declassification, an agency head or senior agency official
    designated under section 5.4 of this order may delay automatic
    declassification for up to 5 additional years for classified
    information contained in microforms, motion pictures, audiotapes,
    videotapes, or comparable media that make a review for possible
    declassification exemptions more difficult or costly.
      (3) By notification to the Director of the Information Security
    Oversight Office, before the records are subject to automatic
    declassification, an agency head or senior agency official
    designated under section 5.4 of this order may delay automatic
    declassification for up to 3 years for classified records that have
    been referred or transferred to that agency by another agency less
    than 3 years before automatic declassification would otherwise be
    required.
      (4) By notification to the Director of the Information Security
    Oversight Office, an agency head or senior agency official
    designated under section 5.4 of this order may delay automatic
    declassification for up to 3 years from the date of discovery of
    classified records that were inadvertently not reviewed prior to
    the effective date of automatic declassification.
      (f) Information exempted from automatic declassification under
    this section shall remain subject to the mandatory and systematic
    declassification review provisions of this order.
      (g) The Secretary of State shall determine when the United States
    should commence negotiations with the appropriate officials of a
    foreign government or international organization of governments to
    modify any treaty or international agreement that requires the
    classification of information contained in records affected by this
    section for a period longer than 25 years from the date of its
    creation, unless the treaty or international agreement pertains to
    information that may otherwise remain classified beyond 25 years
    under this section.
      (h) Records containing information that originated with other
    agencies or the disclosure of which would affect the interests or
    activities of other agencies shall be referred for review to those
    agencies and the information of concern shall be subject to
    automatic declassification only by those agencies, consistent with
    the provisions of subparagraphs (e)(3) and (e)(4) of this section.
      Sec. 3.4. Systematic Declassification Review. (a) Each agency
    that has originated classified information under this order or its
    predecessors shall establish and conduct a program for systematic
    declassification review. This program shall apply to records of
    permanent historical value exempted from automatic declassification
    under section 3.3 of this order. Agencies shall prioritize the
    systematic review of records based upon the degree of researcher
    interest and the likelihood of declassification upon review.
      (b) The Archivist shall conduct a systematic declassification
    review program for classified records: (1) accessioned into the
    National Archives as of the effective date of this order; (2)
    transferred to the Archivist pursuant to section 2203 of title 44,
    United States Code; and (3) for which the National Archives serves
    as the custodian for an agency or organization that has gone out of
    existence. This program shall apply to pertinent records no later
    than 25 years from the date of their creation. The Archivist shall
    establish priorities for the systematic review of these records
    based upon the degree of researcher interest and the likelihood of
    declassification upon review. These records shall be reviewed in
    accordance with the standards of this order, its implementing
    directives, and declassification guides provided to the Archivist
    by each agency that originated the records. The Director of the
    Information Security Oversight Office shall ensure that agencies
    provide the Archivist with adequate and current declassification
    guides.
      (c) After consultation with affected agencies, the Secretary of
    Defense may establish special procedures for systematic review for
    declassification of classified cryptologic information, and the
    Director of Central Intelligence may establish special procedures
    for systematic review for declassification of classified
    information pertaining to intelligence activities (including
    special activities), or intelligence sources or methods.
      Sec. 3.5. Mandatory Declassification Review. (a) Except as
    provided in paragraph (b) of this section, all information
    classified under this order or predecessor orders shall be subject
    to a review for declassification by the originating agency if:
      (1) the request for a review describes the document or material
    containing the information with sufficient specificity to enable
    the agency to locate it with a reasonable amount of effort;
      (2) the information is not exempted from search and review under
    sections 105C [now 702], 105D [now 703], or 701 of the National
    Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 403-5c [now 432], 403-5e [now
    432a], and 431); and
      (3) the information has not been reviewed for declassification
    within the past 2 years. If the agency has reviewed the information
    within the past 2 years, or the information is the subject of
    pending litigation, the agency shall inform the requester of this
    fact and of the requester's appeal rights.
      (b) Information originated by:
      (1) the incumbent President or, in the performance of executive
    duties, the incumbent Vice President;
      (2) the incumbent President's White House Staff or, in the
    performance of executive duties, the incumbent Vice President's
    Staff;
      (3) committees, commissions, or boards appointed by the incumbent
    President; or
      (4) other entities within the Executive Office of the President
    that solely advise and assist the incumbent President is exempted
    from the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. However, the
    Archivist shall have the authority to review, downgrade, and
    declassify papers or records of former Presidents under the control
    of the Archivist pursuant to sections 2107, 2111, 2111 note, or
    2203 of title 44, United States Code. Review procedures developed
    by the Archivist shall provide for consultation with agencies
    having primary subject matter interest and shall be consistent with
    the provisions of applicable laws or lawful agreements that pertain
    to the respective Presidential papers or records. Agencies with
    primary subject matter interest shall be notified promptly of the
    Archivist's decision. Any final decision by the Archivist may be
    appealed by the requester or an agency to the Panel. The
    information shall remain classified pending a prompt decision on
    the appeal.
      (c) Agencies conducting a mandatory review for declassification
    shall declassify information that no longer meets the standards for
    classification under this order. They shall release this
    information unless withholding is otherwise authorized and
    warranted under applicable law.
      (d) In accordance with directives issued pursuant to this order,
    agency heads shall develop procedures to process requests for the
    mandatory review of classified information. These procedures shall
    apply to information classified under this or predecessor orders.
    They also shall provide a means for administratively appealing a
    denial of a mandatory review request, and for notifying the
    requester of the right to appeal a final agency decision to the
    Panel.
      (e) After consultation with affected agencies, the Secretary of
    Defense shall develop special procedures for the review of
    cryptologic information; the Director of Central Intelligence shall
    develop special procedures for the review of information pertaining
    to intelligence activities (including special activities), or
    intelligence sources or methods; and the Archivist shall develop
    special procedures for the review of information accessioned into
    the National Archives.
      Sec. 3.6. Processing Requests and Reviews. In response to a
    request for information under the Freedom of Information Act [5
    U.S.C. 552], the Privacy Act of 1974 [5 U.S.C. 552a], or the
    mandatory review provisions of this order, or pursuant to the
    automatic declassification or systematic review provisions of this
    order:
      (a) An agency may refuse to confirm or deny the existence or
    nonexistence of requested records whenever the fact of their
    existence or nonexistence is itself classified under this order or
    its predecessors.
      (b) When an agency receives any request for documents in its
    custody that contain information that was originally classified by
    another agency, or comes across such documents in the process of
    the automatic declassification or systematic review provisions of
    this order, it shall refer copies of any request and the pertinent
    documents to the originating agency for processing, and may, after
    consultation with the originating agency, inform any requester of
    the referral unless such association is itself classified under
    this order or its predecessors. In cases in which the originating
    agency determines in writing that a response under paragraph (a) of
    this section is required, the referring agency shall respond to the
    requester in accordance with that paragraph.
      Sec. 3.7. Declassification Database. (a) The Director of the
    Information Security Oversight Office, in conjunction with those
    agencies that originate classified information, shall coordinate
    the linkage and effective utilization of existing agency databases
    of records that have been declassified and publicly released.
      (b) Agency heads shall fully cooperate with the Director of the
    Information Security Oversight Office in these efforts.

                           PART 4 - SAFEGUARDING                       
      Sec. 4.1. General Restrictions on Access. (a) A person may have
    access to classified information provided that:
      (1) a favorable determination of eligibility for access has been
    made by an agency head or the agency head's designee;
      (2) the person has signed an approved nondisclosure agreement;
    and
      (3) the person has a need-to-know the information.
      (b) Every person who has met the standards for access to
    classified information in paragraph (a) of this section shall
    receive contemporaneous training on the proper safeguarding of
    classified information and on the criminal, civil, and
    administrative sanctions that may be imposed on an individual who
    fails to protect classified information from unauthorized
    disclosure.
      (c) Classified information shall remain under the control of the
    originating agency or its successor in function. An agency shall
    not disclose information originally classified by another agency
    without its authorization. An official or employee leaving agency
    service may not remove classified information from the agency's
    control.
      (d) Classified information may not be removed from official
    premises without proper authorization.
      (e) Persons authorized to disseminate classified information
    outside the executive branch shall ensure the protection of the
    information in a manner equivalent to that provided within the
    executive branch.
      (f) Consistent with law, directives, and regulation, an agency
    head or senior agency official shall establish uniform procedures
    to ensure that automated information systems, including networks
    and telecommunications systems, that collect, create, communicate,
    compute, disseminate, process, or store classified information have
    controls that:
      (1) prevent access by unauthorized persons; and
      (2) ensure the integrity of the information.
      (g) Consistent with law, directives, and regulation, each agency
    head or senior agency official shall establish controls to ensure
    that classified information is used, processed, stored, reproduced,
    transmitted, and destroyed under conditions that provide adequate
    protection and prevent access by unauthorized persons.
      (h) Consistent with directives issued pursuant to this order, an
    agency shall safeguard foreign government information under
    standards that provide a degree of protection at least equivalent
    to that required by the government or international organization of
    governments that furnished the information. When adequate to
    achieve equivalency, these standards may be less restrictive than
    the safeguarding standards that ordinarily apply to United States
    "Confidential" information, including modified handling and
    transmission and allowing access to individuals with a need-to-know
    who have not otherwise been cleared for access to classified
    information or executed an approved nondisclosure agreement.
      (i) Except as otherwise provided by statute, this order,
    directives implementing this order, or by direction of the
    President, classified information originating in one agency shall
    not be disseminated outside any other agency to which it has been
    made available without the consent of the originating agency. An
    agency head or senior agency official may waive this requirement
    for specific information originated within that agency. For
    purposes of this section, the Department of Defense shall be
    considered one agency. Prior consent is not required when referring
    records for declassification review that contain information
    originating in several agencies.
      Sec. 4.2. Distribution Controls. (a) Each agency shall establish
    controls over the distribution of classified information to ensure
    that it is distributed only to organizations or individuals
    eligible for access and with a need-to-know the information.
      (b) In an emergency, when necessary to respond to an imminent
    threat to life or in defense of the homeland, the agency head or
    any designee may authorize the disclosure of classified information
    to an individual or individuals who are otherwise not eligible for
    access. Such actions shall be taken only in accordance with the
    directives implementing this order and any procedures issued by
    agencies governing the classified information, which shall be
    designed to minimize the classified information that is disclosed
    under these circumstances and the number of individuals who receive
    it. Information disclosed under this provision or implementing
    directives and procedures shall not be deemed declassified as a
    result of such disclosure or subsequent use by a recipient. Such
    disclosures shall be reported promptly to the originator of the
    classified information. For purposes of this section, the Director
    of Central Intelligence may issue an implementing directive
    governing the emergency disclosure of classified intelligence
    information.
      (c) Each agency shall update, at least annually, the automatic,
    routine, or recurring distribution of classified information that
    they distribute. Recipients shall cooperate fully with distributors
    who are updating distribution lists and shall notify distributors
    whenever a relevant change in status occurs.
      Sec. 4.3. Special Access Programs. (a) Establishment of special
    access programs. Unless otherwise authorized by the President, only
    the Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy, and the Director of
    Central Intelligence, or the principal deputy of each, may create a
    special access program. For special access programs pertaining to
    intelligence activities (including special activities, but not
    including military operational, strategic, and tactical programs),
    or intelligence sources or methods, this function shall be
    exercised by the Director of Central Intelligence. These officials
    shall keep the number of these programs at an absolute minimum, and
    shall establish them only when the program is required by statute
    or upon a specific finding that:
      (1) the vulnerability of, or threat to, specific information is
    exceptional; and
      (2) the normal criteria for determining eligibility for access
    applicable to information classified at the same level are not
    deemed sufficient to protect the information from unauthorized
    disclosure.
      (b) Requirements and limitations. (1) Special access programs
    shall be limited to programs in which the number of persons who
    will have access ordinarily will be reasonably small and
    commensurate with the objective of providing enhanced protection
    for the information involved.
      (2) Each agency head shall establish and maintain a system of
    accounting for special access programs consistent with directives
    issued pursuant to this order.
      (3) Special access programs shall be subject to the oversight
    program established under section 5.4(d) of this order. In
    addition, the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office
    shall be afforded access to these programs, in accordance with the
    security requirements of each program, in order to perform the
    functions assigned to the Information Security Oversight Office
    under this order. An agency head may limit access to a special
    access program to the Director and no more than one other employee
    of the Information Security Oversight Office, or, for special
    access programs that are extraordinarily sensitive and vulnerable,
    to the Director only.
      (4) The agency head or principal deputy shall review annually
    each special access program to determine whether it continues to
    meet the requirements of this order.
      (5) Upon request, an agency head shall brief the Assistant to the
    President for National Security Affairs, or a designee, on any or
    all of the agency's special access programs.
      (c) Nothing in this order shall supersede any requirement made by
    or under 10 U.S.C. 119.
      Sec. 4.4. Access by Historical Researchers and Certain Former
    Government Personnel. (a) The requirement in section 4.1(a)(3) of
    this order that access to classified information may be granted
    only to individuals who have a need-to-know the information may be
    waived for persons who:
      (1) are engaged in historical research projects;
      (2) previously have occupied policy-making positions to which
    they were appointed by the President under section 105(a)(2)(A) of
    title 3, United States Code, or the Vice President under
    106(a)(1)(A) of title 3, United States Code; or
      (3) served as President or Vice President.
      (b) Waivers under this section may be granted only if the agency
    head or senior agency official of the originating agency:
      (1) determines in writing that access is consistent with the
    interest of the national security;
      (2) takes appropriate steps to protect classified information
    from unauthorized disclosure or compromise, and ensures that the
    information is safeguarded in a manner consistent with this order;
    and
      (3) limits the access granted to former Presidential appointees
    and Vice Presidential appointees to items that the person
    originated, reviewed, signed, or received while serving as a
    Presidential appointee or a Vice Presidential appointee.

                    PART 5 - IMPLEMENTATION AND REVIEW                
      Sec. 5.1. Program Direction. (a) The Director of the Information
    Security Oversight Office, under the direction of the Archivist and
    in consultation with the Assistant to the President for National
    Security Affairs, shall issue such directives as are necessary to
    implement this order. These directives shall be binding upon the
    agencies. Directives issued by the Director of the Information
    Security Oversight Office shall establish standards for:
      (1) classification and marking principles;
      (2) safeguarding classified information, which shall pertain to
    the handling, storage, distribution, transmittal, and destruction
    of and accounting for classified information;
      (3) agency security education and training programs;
      (4) agency self-inspection programs; and
      (5) classification and declassification guides.
      (b) The Archivist shall delegate the implementation and
    monitoring functions of this program to the Director of the
    Information Security Oversight Office.
      Sec. 5.2. Information Security Oversight Office. (a) There is
    established within the National Archives an Information Security
    Oversight Office. The Archivist shall appoint the Director of the
    Information Security Oversight Office, subject to the approval of
    the President.
      (b) Under the direction of the Archivist, acting in consultation
    with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs,
    the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office shall:
      (1) develop directives for the implementation of this order;
      (2) oversee agency actions to ensure compliance with this order
    and its implementing directives;
      (3) review and approve agency implementing regulations and agency
    guides for systematic declassification review prior to their
    issuance by the agency;
      (4) have the authority to conduct on-site reviews of each
    agency's program established under this order, and to require of
    each agency those reports, information, and other cooperation that
    may be necessary to fulfill its responsibilities. If granting
    access to specific categories of classified information would pose
    an exceptional national security risk, the affected agency head or
    the senior agency official shall submit a written justification
    recommending the denial of access to the President through the
    Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs within 60
    days of the request for access. Access shall be denied pending the
    response;
      (5) review requests for original classification authority from
    agencies or officials not granted original classification authority
    and, if deemed appropriate, recommend Presidential approval through
    the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs;
      (6) consider and take action on complaints and suggestions from
    persons within or outside the Government with respect to the
    administration of the program established under this order;
      (7) have the authority to prescribe, after consultation with
    affected agencies, standardization of forms or procedures that will
    promote the implementation of the program established under this
    order;
      (8) report at least annually to the President on the
    implementation of this order; and
      (9) convene and chair interagency meetings to discuss matters
    pertaining to the program established by this order.
      Sec. 5.3. Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel.
      (a) Establishment and administration.
      (1) There is established an Interagency Security Classification
    Appeals Panel. The Departments of State, Defense, and Justice, the
    Central Intelligence Agency, the National Archives, and the
    Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs shall each
    be represented by a senior-level representative who is a full-time
    or permanent part-time Federal officer or employee designated to
    serve as a member of the Panel by the respective agency head. The
    President shall select the Chair of the Panel from among the Panel
    members.
      (2) A vacancy on the Panel shall be filled as quickly as possible
    as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
      (3) The Director of the Information Security Oversight Office
    shall serve as the Executive Secretary. The staff of the
    Information Security Oversight Office shall provide program and
    administrative support for the Panel.
      (4) The members and staff of the Panel shall be required to meet
    eligibility for access standards in order to fulfill the Panel's
    functions.
      (5) The Panel shall meet at the call of the Chair. The Chair
    shall schedule meetings as may be necessary for the Panel to
    fulfill its functions in a timely manner.
      (6) The Information Security Oversight Office shall include in
    its reports to the President a summary of the Panel's activities.
      (b) Functions. The Panel shall:
      (1) decide on appeals by persons who have filed classification
    challenges under section 1.8 of this order;
      (2) approve, deny, or amend agency exemptions from automatic
    declassification as provided in section 3.3 of this order; and
      (3) decide on appeals by persons or entities who have filed
    requests for mandatory declassification review under section 3.5 of
    this order.
      (c) Rules and procedures. The Panel shall issue bylaws, which
    shall be published in the Federal Register. The bylaws shall
    establish the rules and procedures that the Panel will follow in
    accepting, considering, and issuing decisions on appeals. The rules
    and procedures of the Panel shall provide that the Panel will
    consider appeals only on actions in which:
        (1) the appellant has exhausted his or her administrative
      remedies within the responsible agency;
        (2) there is no current action pending on the issue within the
      Federal courts; and
        (3) the information has not been the subject of review by the
      Federal courts or the Panel within the past 2 years.
      (d) Agency heads shall cooperate fully with the Panel so that it
    can fulfill its functions in a timely and fully informed manner. An
    agency head may appeal a decision of the Panel to the President
    through the Assistant to the President for National Security
    Affairs. The Panel shall report to the President through the
    Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs any
    instance in which it believes that an agency head is not
    cooperating fully with the Panel.
      (e) The Panel is established for the sole purpose of advising and
    assisting the President in the discharge of his constitutional and
    discretionary authority to protect the national security of the
    United States. Panel decisions are committed to the discretion of
    the Panel, unless changed by the President.
      (f) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section,
    whenever the Panel reaches a conclusion that information owned or
    controlled by the Director of Central Intelligence (Director)
    should be declassified, and the Director notifies the Panel that he
    objects to its conclusion because he has determined that the
    information could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the
    national security and to reveal (1) the identity of a human
    intelligence source, or (2) information about the application of an
    intelligence source or method (including any information that
    concerns, or is provided as a result of, a relationship with a
    cooperating intelligence element of a foreign government), the
    information shall remain classified unless the Director's
    determination is appealed to the President, and the President
    reverses the determination.
      Sec. 5.4. General Responsibilities. Heads of agencies that
    originate or handle classified information shall:
      (a) demonstrate personal commitment and commit senior management
    to the successful implementation of the program established under
    this order;
      (b) commit necessary resources to the effective implementation of
    the program established under this order;
      (c) ensure that agency records systems are designed and
    maintained to optimize the safeguarding of classified information,
    and to facilitate its declassification under the terms of this
    order when it no longer meets the standards for continued
    classification; and
      (d) designate a senior agency official to direct and administer
    the program, whose responsibilities shall include:
      (1) overseeing the agency's program established under this order,
    provided, an agency head may designate a separate official to
    oversee special access programs authorized under this order. This
    official shall provide a full accounting of the agency's special
    access programs at least annually;
      (2) promulgating implementing regulations, which shall be
    published in the Federal Register to the extent that they affect
    members of the public;
      (3) establishing and maintaining security education and training
    programs;
      (4) establishing and maintaining an ongoing self-inspection
    program, which shall include the periodic review and assessment of
    the agency's classified product;
      (5) establishing procedures to prevent unnecessary access to
    classified information, including procedures that:
        (A) require that a need for access to classified information is
      established before initiating administrative clearance
      procedures; and
        (B) ensure that the number of persons granted access to
      classified information is limited to the minimum consistent with
      operational and security requirements and needs;

-EXEC-
           EX. ORD. NO. 12968. ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION       
      Ex. Ord. No. 12968, Aug. 2, 1995, 60 F.R. 40245, provided:
      The national interest requires that certain information be
    maintained in confidence through a system of classification in
    order to protect our citizens, our democratic institutions, and our
    participation within the community of nations. The unauthorized
    disclosure of information classified in the national interest can
    cause irreparable damage to the national security and loss of human
    life.
      Security policies designed to protect classified information must
    ensure consistent, cost effective, and efficient protection of our
    Nation's classified information, while providing fair and equitable
    treatment to those Americans upon whom we rely to guard our
    national security.
      This order establishes a uniform Federal personnel security
    program for employees who will be considered for initial or
    continued access to classified information.
      NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the
    Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is
    hereby ordered as follows:

    the effective date of this order, the head of each agency that

    possible, who has a regular need for access to classified
    information that, in the discretion of the agency head, would
    reveal:

    Identities Protection Act of 1982 (50 U.S.C. 421 [et seq.]);

    of any cryptographic equipment; but not including information
    concerning the use of cryptographic equipment and services;
      (4) particularly sensitive special access programs, the
    disclosure of which would substantially negate or impair the
    effectiveness of the information or activity involved; or
      (5) especially sensitive nuclear weapons design information (but
    only for those positions that have been certified as being of a
    high degree of importance or sensitivity, as described in section
    145(f) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended [42 U.S.C.
    2165(f)]).
      (b) An employee may not be granted access, or hold a position
    designated as requiring access, to information described in
    subsection (a) unless, as a condition of access to such
    information, the employee:
      (1) files with the head of the agency a financial disclosure
    report, including information with respect to the spouse and
    dependent children of the employee, as part of all background
    investigations or reinvestigations;
      (2) is subject to annual financial disclosure requirements, if
    selected by the agency head; and
      (3) files relevant information concerning foreign travel, as
    determined by the Security Policy Board.
      (c) Not later than 180 days after the effective date of this
    order, the Security Policy Board shall develop procedures for the
    implementation of this section, including a standard financial
    disclosure form for use by employees under subsection (b) of this
    section, and agency heads shall identify certain employees, by
    position or category, who are subject to annual financial
    disclosure.
      Sec. 1.4. Use of Automated Financial Record Data Bases. As part
    of all investigations and reinvestigations described in section

    Treasury, under terms and conditions prescribed by the Secretary of
    the Treasury, to search automated data bases consisting of reports
    of currency transactions by financial institutions, international
    transportation of currency or monetary instruments, foreign bank
    and financial accounts, transactions under $10,000 that are
    reported as possible money laundering violations, and records of
    foreign travel.
      Sec. 1.5. Employee Education and Assistance. The head of each
    agency that grants access to classified information shall establish
    a program for employees with access to classified information to:
    (a) educate employees about individual responsibilities under this
    order; and
      (b) inform employees about guidance and assistance available
    concerning issues that may affect their eligibility for access to
    classified information, including sources of assistance for
    employees who have questions or concerns about financial matters,
    mental health, or substance abuse.

             PART 2 - ACCESS ELIGIBILITY POLICY AND PROCEDURE         
      Sec. 2.1. Eligibility Determinations. (a) Determinations of
    eligibility for access to classified information shall be based on
    criteria established under this order. Such determinations are
    separate from suitability determinations with respect to the hiring
    or retention of persons for employment by the government or any
    other personnel actions.
      (b) The number of employees that each agency determines are
    eligible for access to classified information shall be kept to the
    minimum required for the conduct of agency functions.
      (1) Eligibility for access to classified information shall not be
    requested or granted solely to permit entry to, or ease of movement
    within, controlled areas when the employee has no need for access
    and access to classified information may reasonably be prevented.
    Where circumstances indicate employees may be inadvertently exposed
    to classified information in the course of their duties, agencies
    are authorized to grant or deny, in their discretion, facility
    access approvals to such employees based on an appropriate level of
    investigation as determined by each agency.
      (2) Except in agencies where eligibility for access is a
    mandatory condition of employment, eligibility for access to
    classified information shall only be requested or granted based on
    a demonstrated, foreseeable need for access. Requesting or
    approving eligibility in excess of actual requirements is
    prohibited.
      (3) Eligibility for access to classified information may be
    granted where there is a temporary need for access, such as one-
    time participation in a classified project, provided the
    investigative standards established under this order have been
    satisfied. In such cases, a fixed date or event for expiration
    shall be identified and access to classified information shall be
    limited to information related to the particular project or
    assignment.
      (4) Access to classified information shall be terminated when an
    employee no longer has a need for access.
      Sec. 2.2. Level of Access Approval. (a) The level at which an
    access approval is granted for an employee shall be limited, and
    relate directly, to the level of classified information for which
    there is a need for access. Eligibility for access to a higher
    level of classified information includes eligibility for access to
    information classified at a lower level.
      (b) Access to classified information relating to a special access
    program shall be granted in accordance with procedures established
    by the head of the agency that created the program or, for programs
    pertaining to intelligence activities (including special activities
    but not including military operational, strategic, and tactical
    programs) or intelligence sources and methods, by the Director of
    Central Intelligence. To the extent possible and consistent with
    the national security interests of the United States, such
    procedures shall be consistent with the standards and procedures
    established by and under this order.
      Sec. 2.3. Temporary Access to Higher Levels. (a) An employee who
    has been determined to be eligible for access to classified
    information based on favorable adjudication of a completed
    investigation may be granted temporary access to a higher level
    where security personnel authorized by the agency head to make
    access eligibility determinations find that such access:
      (1) is necessary to meet operational or contractual exigencies
    not expected to be of a recurring nature;
      (2) will not exceed 180 days; and
      (3) is limited to specific, identifiable information that is made
    the subject of a written access record.
      (b) Where the access granted under subsection (a) of this section
    involves another agency's classified information, that agency must
    concur before access to its information is granted.
      Sec. 2.4. Reciprocal Acceptance of Access Eligibility
    Determinations. (a) Except when an agency has substantial
    information indicating that an employee may not satisfy the
    standards in section 3.1 of this order, background investigations
    and eligibility determinations conducted under this order shall be
    mutually and reciprocally accepted by all agencies.
      (b) Except where there is substantial information indicating that
    the employee may not satisfy the standards in section 3.1 of this
    order, an employee with existing access to a special access program
    shall not be denied eligibility for access to another special
    access program at the same sensitivity level as determined
    personally by the agency head or deputy agency head, or have an
    existing access eligibility readjudicated, so long as the employee
    has a need for access to the information involved.
      (c) This section shall not preclude agency heads from
    establishing additional, but not duplicative, investigative or
    adjudicative procedures for a special access program or for
    candidates for detail or assignment to their agencies, where such
    procedures are required in exceptional circumstances to protect the
    national security.
      (d) Where temporary eligibility for access is granted under
    sections 2.3 or 3.3 of this order or where the determination of
    eligibility for access is conditional, the fact of such temporary
    or conditional access shall be conveyed to any other agency that
    considers affording the employee access to its information.
      Sec. 2.5. Specific Access Requirement. (a) Employees who have
    been determined to be eligible for access to classified information
    shall be given access to classified information only where there is
    a need-to-know that information.
      (b) It is the responsibility of employees who are authorized
    holders of classified information to verify that a prospective
    recipient's eligibility for access has been granted by an
    authorized agency official and to ensure that a need-to-know exists
    prior to allowing such access, and to challenge requests for access
    that do not appear well-founded.
      Sec. 2.6. Access by Non-United States Citizens. (a) Where there
    are compelling reasons in furtherance of an agency mission,
    immigrant alien and foreign national employees who possess a
    special expertise may, in the discretion of the agency, be granted
    limited access to classified information only for specific
    programs, projects, contracts, licenses, certificates, or grants
    for which there is a need for access. Such individuals shall not be
    eligible for access to any greater level of classified information
    than the United States Government has determined may be releasable
    to the country of which the subject is currently a citizen, and
    such limited access may be approved only if the prior 10 years of
    the subject's life can be appropriately investigated. If there are
    any doubts concerning granting access, additional lawful
    investigative procedures shall be fully pursued.
      (b) Exceptions to these requirements may be permitted only by the
    agency head or the senior agency official designated under section
    6.1 of this order to further substantial national security
    interests.

                   PART 3 - ACCESS ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS               
      Sec. 3.1. Standards. (a) No employee shall be deemed to be
    eligible for access to classified information merely by reason of
    Federal service or contracting, licensee, certificate holder, or
    grantee status, or as a matter of right or privilege, or as a
    result of any particular title, rank, position, or affiliation.
      (b) Except as provided in sections 2.6 and 3.3 of this order,
    eligibility for access to classified information shall be granted
    only to employees who are United States citizens for whom an
    appropriate investigation has been completed and whose personal and
    professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United
    States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty,
    reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom
    from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and
    willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use,
    handling, and protection of classified information. A determination
    of eligibility for access to such information is a discretionary
    security decision based on judgments by appropriately trained
    adjudicative personnel. Eligibility shall be granted only where
    facts and circumstances indicate access to classified information
    is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
    United States, and any doubt shall be resolved in favor of the
    national security.
      (c) The United States Government does not discriminate on the
    basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability,
    or sexual orientation in granting access to classified information.
      (d) In determining eligibility for access under this order,
    agencies may investigate and consider any matter that relates to
    the determination of whether access is clearly consistent with the
    interests of national security. No inference concerning the
    standards in this section may be raised solely on the basis of the
    sexual orientation of the employee.
      (e) No negative inference concerning the standards in this
    section may be raised solely on the basis of mental health
    counseling. Such counseling can be a positive factor in eligibility
    determinations. However, mental health counseling, where relevant
    to the adjudication of access to classified information, may
    justify further inquiry to determine whether the standards of
    subsection (b) of this section are satisfied, and mental health may
    be considered where it directly relates to those standards.
      (f) Not later than 180 days after the effective date of this
    order, the Security Policy Board shall develop a common set of
    adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to
    classified information, including access to special access
    programs.
      Sec. 3.2. Basis for Eligibility Approval. (a) Eligibility
    determinations for access to classified information shall be based
    on information concerning the applicant or employee that is
    acquired through the investigation conducted pursuant to this order
    or otherwise available to security officials and shall be made part
    of the applicant's or employee's security record. Applicants or
    employees shall be required to provide relevant information
    pertaining to their background and character for use in
    investigating and adjudicating their eligibility for access.
      (b) Not later than 180 days after the effective date of this
    order, the Security Policy Board shall develop a common set of
    investigative standards for background investigations for access to
    classified information. These standards may vary for the various
    levels of access.
      (c) Nothing in this order shall prohibit an agency from utilizing
    any lawful investigative procedure in addition to the investigative
    requirements set forth in this order and its implementing
    regulations to resolve issues that may arise during the course of a
    background investigation or reinvestigation.
      Sec. 3.3. Special Circumstances. (a) In exceptional circumstances
    where official functions must be performed prior to the completion
    of the investigative and adjudication process, temporary
    eligibility for access to classified information may be granted to
    an employee while the initial investigation is underway. When such
    eligibility is granted, the initial investigation shall be
    expedited.
      (1) Temporary eligibility for access under this section shall
    include a justification, and the employee must be notified in
    writing that further access is expressly conditioned on the
    favorable completion of the investigation and issuance of an access
    eligibility approval. Access will be immediately terminated, along
    with any assignment requiring an access eligibility approval, if
    such approval is not granted.
      (2) Temporary eligibility for access may be granted only by
    security personnel authorized by the agency head to make access
    eligibility determinations and shall be based on minimum
    investigative standards developed by the Security Policy Board not
    later than 180 days after the effective date of this order.
      (3) Temporary eligibility for access may be granted only to
    particular, identified categories of classified information
    necessary to perform the lawful and authorized functions that are
    the basis for the granting of temporary access.
      (b) Nothing in subsection (a) shall be construed as altering the
    authority of an agency head to waive requirements for granting
    access to classified information pursuant to statutory authority.
      (c) Where access has been terminated under section 2.1(b)(4) of
    this order and a new need for access arises, access eligibility up
    to the same level shall be reapproved without further investigation
    as to employees who were determined to be eligible based on a
    favorable adjudication of an investigation completed within the
    prior 5 years, provided they have remained employed by the same
    employer during the period in question, the employee certifies in
    writing that there has been no change in the relevant information
    provided by the employee for the last background investigation, and
    there is no information that would tend to indicate the employee
    may no longer satisfy the standards established by this order for
    access to classified information.
      (d) Access eligibility shall be reapproved for individuals who
    were determined to be eligible based on a favorable adjudication of
    an investigation completed within the prior 5 years and who have
    been retired or otherwise separated from United States Government
    employment for not more than 2 years; provided there is no
    indication the individual may no longer satisfy the standards of
    this order, the individual certifies in writing that there has been
    no change in the relevant information provided by the individual
    for the last background investigation, and an appropriate record
    check reveals no unfavorable information.
      Sec. 3.4. Reinvestigation Requirements. (a) Because circumstances
    and characteristics may change dramatically over time and thereby
    alter the eligibility of employees for continued access to
    classified information, reinvestigations shall be conducted with
    the same priority and care as initial investigations.
      (b) Employees who are eligible for access to classified
    information shall be the subject of periodic reinvestigations and
    may also be reinvestigated if, at any time, there is reason to
    believe that they may no longer meet the standards for access
    established in this order.
      (c) Not later than 180 days after the effective date of this
    order, the Security Policy Board shall develop a common set of
    reinvestigative standards, including the frequency of
    reinvestigations.

              PART 4 - INVESTIGATIONS FOR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS          
      Sec. 4. Authority. Agencies that conduct background
    investigations, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
    the Department of State, are authorized to conduct personnel
    security investigations in the United States when requested by a
    foreign government as part of its own personnel security program
    and with the consent of the individual.

                 PART 5 - REVIEW OF ACCESS DETERMINATIONS             
      Sec. 5.1. Determinations of Need for Access. A determination
    under section 2.1(b)(4) of this order that an employee does not
    have, or no longer has, a need for access is a discretionary
    determination and shall be conclusive.
      Sec. 5.2. Review Proceedings for Denials or Revocations of
    Eligibility for Access. (a) Applicants and employees who are
    determined to not meet the standards for access to classified
    information established in section 3.1 of this order shall be:
      (1) provided as comprehensive and detailed a written explanation
    of the basis for that conclusion as the national security interests
    of the United States and other applicable law permit;
      (2) provided within 30 days, upon request and to the extent the
    documents would be provided if requested under the Freedom of
    Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or the Privacy Act (3 U.S.C. 552a),
    as applicable, any documents, records, and reports upon which a
    denial or revocation is based;
      (3) informed of their right to be represented by counsel or other
    representative at their own expense; to request any documents,
    records, and reports as described in section 5.2(a)(2) upon which a
    denial or revocation is based; and to request the entire
    investigative file, as permitted by the national security and other
    applicable law, which, if requested, shall be promptly provided
    prior to the time set for a written reply;
      (4) provided a reasonable opportunity to reply in writing to, and

    panel, appointed by the agency head, which shall be comprised of at
    least three members, two of whom shall be selected from outside the
    security field. Decisions of the panel shall be in writing, and
    final except as provided in subsection (b) of this section; and
      (7) provided an opportunity to appear personally and to present
    relevant documents, materials, and information at some point in the
    process before an adjudicative or other authority, other than the
    investigating entity, as determined by the agency head. A written
    summary or recording of such appearance shall be made part of the
    applicant's or employee's security record, unless such appearance
    occurs in the presence of the appeals panel described in subsection
    (a)(6) of this section.
      (b) Nothing in this section shall prohibit an agency head from
    personally exercising the appeal authority in subsection (a)(6) of
    this section based upon recommendations from an appeals panel. In
    such case, the decision of the agency head shall be final.
      (c) Agency heads shall promulgate regulations to implement this

    security considerations permit, may provide additional review
    proceedings beyond those required by subsection (a) of this
    section. This section does not require additional proceedings,
    however, and creates no procedural or substantive rights.
      (d) When the head of an agency or principal deputy personally
    certifies that a procedure set forth in this section cannot be made
    available in a particular case without damaging the national
    security interests of the United States by revealing classified
    information, the particular procedure shall not be made available.
    This certification shall be conclusive.
      (e) This section shall not be deemed to limit or affect the
    responsibility and power of an agency head pursuant to any law or
    other Executive order to deny or terminate access to classified
    information in the interests of national security. The power and
    responsibility to deny or terminate access to classified
    information pursuant to any law or other Executive order may be
    exercised only where the agency head determines that the procedures
    prescribed in subsection (a) of this section cannot be invoked in a
    manner that is consistent with national security. This
    determination shall be conclusive.
      (f)(1) This section shall not be deemed to limit or affect the
    responsibility and power of an agency head to make determinations
    of suitability for employment.
      (2) Nothing in this section shall require that an agency provide
    the procedures prescribed in subsection (a) of this section to an
    applicant where a conditional offer of employment is withdrawn for
    reasons of suitability or any other reason other than denial of
    eligibility for access to classified information.
      (3) A suitability determination shall not be used for the purpose
    of denying an applicant or employee the review proceedings of this
    section where there has been a denial or revocation of eligibility
    for access to classified information.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Generally
      (1) Any authorized investigative agency may request from any
    financial agency, financial institution, or holding company, or
    from any consumer reporting agency, such financial records, other
    financial information, and consumer reports as may be necessary in
    order to conduct any authorized law enforcement investigation,
    counterintelligence inquiry, or security determination. Any
    authorized investigative agency may also request records maintained
    by any commercial entity within the United States pertaining to
    travel by an employee in the executive branch of Government outside
    the United States.
      (2) Requests may be made under this section where - 
        (A) the records sought pertain to a person who is or was an
      employee in the executive branch of Government required by the
      President in an Executive order or regulation, as a condition of
      access to classified information, to provide consent, during a
      background investigation and for such time as access to the
      information is maintained, and for a period of not more than
      three years thereafter, permitting access to financial records,
      other financial information, consumer reports, and travel
      records; and
        (B)(i) there are reasonable grounds to believe, based on
      credible information, that the person is, or may be, disclosing
      classified information in an unauthorized manner to a foreign
      power or agent of a foreign power;
        (ii) information the employing agency deems credible indicates
      the person has incurred excessive indebtedness or has acquired a
      level of affluence which cannot be explained by other information
      known to the agency; or
        (iii) circumstances indicate the person had the capability and
      opportunity to disclose classified information which is known to
      have been lost or compromised to a foreign power or an agent of a
      foreign power.

      (3) Each such request - 
        (A) shall be accompanied by a written certification signed by
      the department or agency head or deputy department or agency head
      concerned, or by a senior official designated for this purpose by
      the department or agency head concerned (whose rank shall be no
      lower than Assistant Secretary or Assistant Director), and shall
      certify that - 
          (i) the person concerned is or was an employee within the
        meaning of paragraph (2)(A);
          (ii) the request is being made pursuant to an authorized
        inquiry or investigation and is authorized under this section;
        and
          (iii) the records or information to be reviewed are records
        or information which the employee has previously agreed to make
        available to the authorized investigative agency for review;

        (B) shall contain a copy of the agreement referred to in
      subparagraph (A)(iii);
        (C) shall identify specifically or by category the records or
      information to be reviewed; and
        (D) shall inform the recipient of the request of the
      prohibition described in subsection (b) of this section.
    (b) Prohibition of certain disclosure
      (1) If an authorized investigative agency described in subsection
    (a) certifies that otherwise there may result a danger to the
    national security of the United States, interference with a
    criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation,
    interference with diplomatic relations, or danger to the life or
    physical safety of any person, no governmental or private entity,
    or officer, employee, or agent of such entity, may disclose to any
    person (other than those to whom such disclosure is necessary to
    comply with the request or an attorney to obtain legal advice or
    legal assistance with respect to the request) that such entity has
    received or satisfied a request made by an authorized investigative
    agency under this section.
      (2) The request shall notify the person or entity to whom the
    request is directed of the nondisclosure requirement under
    paragraph (1).
      (3) Any recipient disclosing to those persons necessary to comply
    with the request or to an attorney to obtain legal advice or legal
    assistance with respect to the request shall inform such persons of
    any applicable nondisclosure requirement. Any person who receives a
    disclosure under this subsection shall be subject to the same
    prohibitions on disclosure under paragraph (1).
      (4) At the request of the authorized investigative agency, any
    person making or intending to make a disclosure under this section
    shall identify to the requesting official of the authorized
    investigative agency the person to whom such disclosure will be
    made or to whom such disclosure was made prior to the request,
    except that nothing in this section shall require a person to
    inform the requesting official of the identity of an attorney to
    whom disclosure was made or will be made to obtain legal advice or
    legal assistance with respect to the request under subsection (a).
    (c) Records or information; inspection or copying
      (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law (other than
    section 6103 of title 26), an entity receiving a request for
    records or information under subsection (a) of this section shall,
    if the request satisfies the requirements of this section, make
    available such records or information within 30 days for inspection
    or copying, as may be appropriate, by the agency requesting such
    records or information.
      (2) Any entity (including any officer, employee, or agent
    thereof) that discloses records or information for inspection or
    copying pursuant to this section in good faith reliance upon the
    certifications made by an agency pursuant to this section shall not
    be liable for any such disclosure to any person under this
    subchapter, the constitution of any State, or any law or regulation
    of any State or any political subdivision of any State.
    (d) Reimbursement of costs
      Any agency requesting records or information under this section
    may, subject to the availability of appropriations, reimburse a
    private entity for any cost reasonably incurred by such entity in
    responding to such request, including the cost of identifying,
    reproducing, or transporting records or other data.
    (e) Dissemination of records or information received
      An agency receiving records or information pursuant to a request
    under this section may disseminate the records or information
    obtained pursuant to such request outside the agency only - 
        (1) to the agency employing the employee who is the subject of
      the records or information;
        (2) to the Department of Justice for law enforcement or
      counterintelligence purposes; or
        (3) with respect to dissemination to an agency of the United
      States, if such information is clearly relevant to the authorized
      responsibilities of such agency.
    (f) Construction of section
      Nothing in this section may be construed to affect the authority
    of an investigative agency to obtain information pursuant to the
    Right to Financial Privacy Act (12 U.S.C. 3401 et seq.) or the Fair
    Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.).

-STATUTE-
      Notwithstanding any provision of law identified in section 441c
    of this title, the President may stay the imposition of an
    economic, cultural, diplomatic, or other sanction or related action
    by the United States Government concerning a foreign country,
    organization, or person when the President determines and reports
    to Congress in accordance with section 441b of this title that to
    proceed without delay would seriously risk the compromise of an
    ongoing criminal investigation directly related to the activities
    giving rise to the sanction or an intelligence source or method
    directly related to the activities giving rise to the sanction. Any
    such stay shall be effective for a period of time specified by the
    President, which period may not exceed 120 days, unless such period
    is extended in accordance with section 441a of this title.

    Sec. 441a. Extension of stay

-STATUTE-
      Whenever the President determines and reports to Congress in
    accordance with section 441b of this title that a stay of sanctions
    or related actions pursuant to section 441 of this title has not
    afforded sufficient time to obviate the risk to an ongoing criminal
    investigation or to an intelligence source or method that gave rise
    to the stay, he may extend such stay for a period of time specified
    by the President, which period may not exceed 120 days. The
    authority of this section may be used to extend the period of a
    stay pursuant to section 441 of this title for successive periods
    of not more than 120 days each.

    pending the completion of the full field investigation and the
    clearance for access to classified information required by this
    subsection, if the Secretary determines that such action is clearly
    consistent with the national security.
    (b) Boards of appraisal; establishment; membership; appointment;
      appraisal in doubtful cases; report and recommendation;
      qualifications of members; Secretary's clearance contrary to
      board's recommendation
      To assist the Secretary and the Director of the Agency in
    carrying out their personnel security responsibilities, one or more
    boards of appraisal of three members each, to be appointed by the
    Director of the Agency, shall be established in the Agency. Such a
    board shall appraise the loyalty and suitability of persons for
    access to classified information, in those cases in which the
    Director of the Agency determines that there is a doubt whether
    their access to that information would be clearly consistent with
    the national security, and shall submit a report and recommendation
    on each such a case. However, appraisal by such a board is not
    required before action may be taken under sections 7512 and 7532 of
    title 5, or any other similar provision of law. Each member of such
    a board shall be specially qualified and trained for his duties as
    such a member, shall have been the subject of a full field
    investigation in connection with his appointment as such a member,
    and shall have been cleared by the Director for access to
    classified information at the time of his appointment as such a
    member. No person shall be cleared for access to classified
    information, contrary to the recommendations of any such board,
    unless the Secretary (or his designee for such purpose) shall make
    a determination in writing that such employment, detail,
    assignment, or access to classified information is in the national
    interest.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 841. Findings and declarations of fact

-STATUTE-
      The Congress finds and declares that the Communist Party of the
    United States, although purportedly a political party, is in fact
    an instrumentality of a conspiracy to overthrow the Government of
    the United States. It constitutes an authoritarian dictatorship
    within a republic, demanding for itself the rights and privileges
    accorded to political parties, but denying to all others the
    liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. Unlike political parties,
    which evolve their policies and programs through public means, by
    the reconciliation of a wide variety of individual views, and
    submit those policies and programs to the electorate at large for
    approval or disapproval, the policies and programs of the Communist
    Party are secretly prescribed for it by the foreign leaders of the
    world Communist movement. Its members have no part in determining
    its goals, and are not permitted to voice dissent to party
    objectives. Unlike members of political parties, members of the
    Communist Party are recruited for indoctrination with respect to
    its objectives and methods, and are organized, instructed, and
    disciplined to carry into action slavishly the assignments given
    them by their hierarchical chieftains. Unlike political parties,
    the Communist Party acknowledges no constitutional or statutory
    limitations upon its conduct or upon that of its members. The
    Communist Party is relatively small numerically, and gives scant
    indication of capacity ever to attain its ends by lawful political
    means. The peril inherent in its operation arises not from its
    numbers, but from its failure to acknowledge any limitation as to
    the nature of its activities, and its dedication to the proposition
    that the present constitutional Government of the United States
    ultimately must be brought to ruin by any available means,
    including resort to force and violence. Holding that doctrine, its
    role as the agency of a hostile foreign power renders its existence
    a clear present and continuing danger to the security of the United
    States. It is the means whereby individuals are seduced into the
    service of the world Communist movement, trained to do its bidding,
    and directed and controlled in the conspiratorial performance of
    their revolutionary services. Therefore, the Communist Party should
    be outlawed.

-STATUTE-
      The President may authorize any department or agency of the
    Government which exercises functions in connection with the
    national defense, acting in accordance with regulations prescribed
    by the President for the protection of the Government, to enter
    into contracts or into amendments or modifications of contracts
    heretofore or hereafter made and to make advance payments thereon,
    without regard to other provisions of law relating to the making,
    performance, amendment, or modification of contracts, whenever he
    deems that such action would facilitate the national defense. The
    authority conferred by this section shall not be utilized to
    obligate the United States in an amount in excess of $50,000
    without approval by an official at or above the level of an
    Assistant Secretary or his Deputy, or an assistant head or his
    deputy, of such department or agency, or by a Contract Adjustment
    Board established therein. The authority conferred by this section
    may not be utilized to obligate the United States in any amount in
    excess of $25,000,000 unless the Committees on Armed Services of
    the Senate and the House of Representatives have been notified in
    writing of such proposed obligation and 60 days of continuous
    session of Congress have expired following the date on which such
    notice was transmitted to such Committees. For purposes of this
    section, the continuity of a session of Congress is broken only by
    an adjournment of the Congress sine die at the end of a Congress,
    and the days on which either House is not in session because of an
    adjournment of more than 3 days to a day certain, or because of an
    adjournment sine die other than at the end of a Congress, are
    excluded in the computation of such 60-day period.

      By virtue of the authority vested in me by the act of August 28,
    1958, 72 Stat. 972, hereinafter called the act [this chapter], and
    as President of the United States, and deeming that such action
    will facilitate the national defense, it is hereby ordered as
    follows:

                      PART I - DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE                  
      Under such regulations, which shall be uniform to the extent
    practicable, as may be prescribed or approved by the Secretary of
    Defense:
      1. The Department of Defense is authorized, within the limits of
    the amounts appropriated and the contract authorization provided
    therefor, to enter into contracts and into amendments or
    modifications of contracts heretofore or hereafter made, and to
    make advance payments thereon, without regard to the provisions of
    law relating to the making, performance, amendment, or modification
    of contracts, whenever, in the judgment of the Secretary of
    Defense, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, or
    the Secretary of the Air Force, or the duly authorized
    representative of any such Secretary, the national defense will be
    facilitated thereby.
      1A. (a) The limitation in paragraph 1 to amounts appropriated and
    the contract authorization provided therefor shall not apply to
    contractual provisions which provide that the United States will
    hold harmless and indemnify the contractor against any of the
    claims or losses set forth in subparagraph (b), whether resulting
    from the negligence or wrongful act or omission of the contractor
    or otherwise (except as provided in subparagraph (b)(2)). This
    exception from the limitations of paragraph 1 shall apply only to
    claims or losses arising out of or resulting from risks that the
    contract defines as unusually hazardous or nuclear in nature. Such
    a contractual provision shall be approved in advance by an official
    at a level not below that of the Secretary of a military department
    and may require each contractor so indemnified to provide and
    maintain financial protection of such type and in such amounts as
    is determined by the approving official to be appropriate under the
    circumstances. In deciding whether to approve the use of an
    indemnification provision and in determining the amount of
    financial protection to be provided and maintained by the
    indemnified contractor, the appropriate official shall take into
    account such factors as the availability, cost and terms of private
    insurance, self-insurance, other proof of financial responsibility
    and workmen's compensation insurance. Such approval and
    determination, as required by the preceding two sentences, shall be
    final.
      (b)(1) Subparagraph (a) shall apply to claims (including
    reasonable expenses of litigation and settlement) or losses, not
    compensated by insurance or otherwise, of the following types:
      (A) Claims by third persons, including employees of the
    contractor, for death, personal injury, or loss of, damage to, or
    loss of use of property;
      (B) Loss of, damage to, or loss of use of property of the
    contractor;
      (C) Loss of, damage to, or loss of use of property of the
    Government;
      (D) Claims arising (i) from indemnification agreements between
    the contractor and a subcontractor or subcontractors, or (ii) from
    such arrangements and further indemnification arrangements between
    subcontractors at any tier; provided that all such arrangements
    were entered into pursuant to regulations prescribed or approved by
    the Secretaries of Defense, the Army, the Navy, or the Air Force.
      (2) Indemnification and hold harmless agreements entered into
    pursuant to this subsection, whether between the United States and
    a contractor, or between a contractor and a subcontractor, or
    between two subcontractors, shall not cover claims or losses caused
    by the willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of any
    of the contractor's or subcontractor's directors or officers or
    principal officials which are (i) claims by the United States
    (other than those arising through subrogation) against the
    contractor or subcontractor, or (ii) losses affecting the property
    of such contractor or subcontractor. Regulations to be prescribed
    or approved by the Secretaries of Defense, the Army, the Navy or
    the Air Force shall define the scope of the term principal
    officials.
      (3) The United States may discharge its obligation under a
    provision authorized by subparagraph (a) by making payments
    directly to subcontractors or to third persons to whom a contractor
    or subcontractor may be liable.
      (c) A contractual provision made under subparagraph (a) that
    provides for indemnification must also provide for - 
      (1) notice to the United States of any claim or action against,
    or of any loss by, the contractor or subcontractor which is covered
    by such contractual provision; and
      (2) control or assistance by the United States, at its election,
    in the settlement or defense of any such claim or action.
      2. The Secretaries of Defense, the Army, the Navy, and the Air
    Force, respectively, may exercise the authority herein conferred
    and, in their discretion and by their direction, may delegate such
    authority to any other military or civilian officers or officials
    of their respective departments, and may confer upon any such
    military or civilian officers or officials the power to make
    further delegations of such authority within their respective
    commands or organizations: Provided, That the authority herein
    conferred shall not be utilized to obligate the United States in an
    amount in excess of $50,000 without approval by an official at or
    above the level of an Assistant Secretary or his Deputy, or by a
    departmental Contract Adjustment Board.
      3. The contracts hereby authorized to be made shall include
    agreements of all kinds (whether in the form of letters of intent,
    purchase orders, or otherwise) for all types and kinds of property
    or services necessary, appropriate, or convenient for the national
    defense, or for the invention, development, or production of, or
    research concerning, any such property or services, including, but
    not limited to, aircraft, missiles, buildings, vessels, arms,
    armament, equipment or supplies of any kind, or any portion
    thereof, including plans, spare parts and equipment therefor,
    materials, supplies, facilities, utilities, machinery, machine
    tools, and any other equipment without any restriction of any kind
    as to type, character, location, or form.
      4. The Department of Defense may by agreement modify or amend or
    settle claims under contracts heretofore or hereafter made, may
    make advance payments upon such contracts of any portion of the
    contract price, and may enter into agreements with contractors or
    obligors modifying or releasing accrued obligations of any sort,
    including accrued liquidated damages or liability under surety or
    other bonds. Amendments or modifications of contracts may be with
    or without consideration and may be utilized to accomplish the same
    things as any original contract could have accomplished hereunder,
    irrespective of the time or circumstances of the making, or the
    form, of the contract amended or modified, or of the amending or
    modifying contract, and irrespective of rights which may have
    accrued under the contract or the amendments or modifications
    thereof.
      5. Proper records of all actions taken under the authority of the
    act shall be maintained within the Department of Defense. The
    Secretaries of Defense, the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force shall
    make such records available for public inspection except to the
    extent that they, or their duly authorized representatives, may
    respectively deem the disclosure of information therein to be
    detrimental to the national security.
      6. The Department of Defense shall, by March 15 of each year,
    report to the Congress all actions taken within that department
    under the authority of the act during the preceding calendar year.
    With respect to actions which involve actual or potential cost to
    the United States in excess of $50,000, the report shall (except as
    the disclosure of such information may be deemed to be detrimental
    to the national security) - 
      (a) name the contractor;
      (b) state the actual cost or estimated potential cost involved;
      (c) describe the property or services involved; and
      (d) state further the circumstances justifying the action taken.
      7. There shall be no discrimination in any act performed
    hereunder against any person on the ground of race, religion,
    color, or national origin, and all contracts entered into, amended,
    or modified hereunder shall contain such nondiscrimination
    provision as otherwise may be required by statute or Executive
    order.
      8. No claim against the United States arising under any purchase
    or contract made under the authority of the act and this order
    shall be assigned except in accordance with the Assignment of
    Claims Act of 1940 (54 Stat. 1029), as amended [section 3727 of
    Title 31, Money and Finance, and section 15 of Title 41, Public
    Contracts].
      9. Advance payments shall be made hereunder only upon obtaining
    adequate security.
      10. Every contract entered into, amended, or modified pursuant to
    this order shall contain a warranty by the contractor in
    substantially the following terms:
      "The Contractor warrants that no person or selling agency has
    been employed or retained to solicit or secure this contract upon
    an agreement or understanding for a commission, percentage,
    brokerage, or contingent fee, except bonafide employees or bonafide
    established commercial or selling agencies maintained by the
    Contractor for the purpose of securing business. For breach or
    violation of this warranty the Government shall have the right to
    annul this contract without liability or, in its discretion, to
    deduct from the contract price or consideration, or otherwise
    recover, the full amount of such commission, percentage, brokerage,
    or contingent fee."
      11. Except as provided in the Act of September 27, 1966, 80 Stat.
    850 [which amended section 1433 of this title, sections 2310 and
    2313 of Title 10, Armed Forces, and section 254 of Title 41, Public
    Contracts] contracts entered into, amended, or modified pursuant to
    authority of this order shall include a clause to the effect that
    the Comptroller General of the United States or any of his duly
    authorized representatives shall, until the expiration of three
    years after final payment, have access to and the right to examine
    any directly pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of the
    contractor or any of his subcontractors engaged in the performance
    of, and involving transactions related to, such contracts or
    subcontracts. Before exercising the authority provided in the Act
    of September 27, 1966, 80 Stat. 850 the Secretaries of Defense, the
    Army, the Navy, or the Air Force, or their designees, shall first
    determine that all reasonable efforts have been made to include the
    clause prescribed above and that alternate sources of supply are
    not reasonably available.
      12. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to constitute
    authorization hereunder for - 
      (a) the use of the cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost system of
    contracting;
      (b) any contract in violation of existing law relating to
    limitation of profits or fees;
      (c) the negotiation of purchases of or contracts for property or
    services required by law to be procured by formal advertising and
    competitive bidding;
      (d) the waiver of any bid, payment, performance, or other bond
    required by law;
      (e) the amendment of a contract negotiated under section
    2304(a)(15) of Title 10 of the United States Code to increase the
    contract price to an amount higher than the lowest rejected bid of
    any responsible bidder; or
      (f) the formalization of an informal commitment, unless the

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1433. Public record; examination of records by Comptroller
      General; exemptions: exceptional conditions; reports to Congress

-STATUTE-
      (a) All actions under the authority of this chapter shall be made
    a matter of public record under regulations prescribed by the
    President and when deemed by him not to be detrimental to the
    national security.
      (b) All contracts entered into, amended, or modified pursuant to
    authority contained in this chapter shall include a clause to the
    effect that the Comptroller General of the United States or any of
    his duly authorized representatives shall, until the expiration of
    three years after final payment, have access to and the right to
    examine any directly pertinent books, documents, papers, and
    records of the contractor or any of his subcontractors engaged in
    the performance of and involving transactions related to such
    contracts or subcontracts. Under regulations to be prescribed by
    the President, however, such clause may be omitted from contracts
    with foreign contractors or foreign subcontractors if the agency
    head determines, with the concurrence of the Comptroller General of
    the United States or his designee, that the omission will serve the
    best interests of the United States. However, the concurrence of
    the Comptroller General of the United States or his designee is not
    required for the omission of such clause - 
        (1) where the contractor or subcontractor is a foreign
      government or agency thereof or is precluded by the laws of the
      country involved from making its books, documents, papers, or
      records available for examination; and
        (2) where the agency head determines, after taking into account
      the price and availability of the property or services from
      United States sources, that the public interest would be best
      served by the omission of the clause.

    If the clause is omitted based on a determination under clause (2),
    a written report shall be furnished to the Congress.

-STATUTE-
      None of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act or
    any other Act may be used for the transportation of any lethal
    chemical or any biological warfare agent to or from any military
    installation in the United States, or the open air testing of any
    such agent within the United States, or the disposal of any such
    agent within the United States until the following procedures have
    been implemented:
        (1) the Secretary of Defense (hereafter referred to in this
      chapter as the "Secretary") has determined that the
      transportation or testing proposed to be made is necessary in the
      interests of national security;
        (2) the Secretary has brought the particulars of the proposed
      transportation, testing, or disposal to the attention of the
      Secretary of Health and Human Services, who in turn may direct
      the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service and other
      qualified persons to review such particulars with respect to any
      hazards to public health and safety which such transportation,
      testing, or disposal may pose and to recommend what precautionary
      measures are necessary to protect the public health and safety;
        (3) the Secretary has implemented any precautionary measures
      recommended in accordance with paragraph (2) above (including,
      where practicable, the detoxification of any such agent, if such
      agent is to be transported to or from a military installation for
      disposal): Provided, however, That in the event the Secretary
      finds the recommendation submitted by the Surgeon General would
      have the effect of preventing the proposed transportation,
      testing, or disposal, the President may determine that overriding
      considerations of national security require such transportation,
      testing, or disposal be conducted. Any transportation, testing,
      or disposal conducted pursuant to such a Presidential
      determination shall be carried out in the safest practicable
      manner, and the President shall report his determination and an
      explanation thereof to the President of the Senate and the
      Speaker of the House of Representatives as far in advance as
      practicable; and
        (4) the Secretary has provided notification that the
      transportation, testing, or disposal will take place, except
      where a Presidential determination has been made: (A) to the
      President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of
      Representatives at least 10 days before any such transportation
      will be commenced and at least 30 days before any such testing or
      disposal will be commenced; (B) to the Governor of any State
      through which such agents will be transported, such notification
      to be provided appropriately in advance of any such
      transportation.

      Ex. Ord. No. 11850, Apr. 8, 1975, 40 F.R. 16187, provided:
      The United States renounces, as a matter of national policy,
    first use of herbicides in war except use, under regulations
    applicable to their domestic use, for control of vegetation within
    U.S. bases and installations or around their immediate defensive
    perimeters, and first use of riot control agents in war except in
    defensive military modes to save lives such as:
      (a) Use of riot control agents in riot control situations in
    areas under direct and distinct U.S. military control, to include
    controlling rioting prisoners of war.
      (b) Use of riot control agents in situations in which civilians
    are used to mask or screen attacks and civilian casualties can be
    reduced or avoided.
      (c) Use of riot control agents in rescue missions in remotely
    isolated areas, of downed aircrews and passengers, and escaping
    prisoners.
      (d) Use of riot control agents in rear echelon areas outside the

    observance of such national policy.
      NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as
    President of the United States of America by the Constitution and
    laws of the United States and as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed
    Forces of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:
      Section 1. The Secretary of Defense shall take all necessary

    Congress that for each 155-millimeter binary artillery shell or
    aircraft-delivered binary aerial bomb produced a serviceable
    unitary artillery shell from the existing arsenal shall be rendered
    permanently useless for military purposes.
      (b)(1) Funds appropriated pursuant to the authorization of
    appropriations for the Army in section 101 of this Act may be used
    for the establishment of a production base for binary chemical
    munitions and for the procurement of components for 155-millimeter
    binary chemical artillery projectiles, but such funds may not be
    used for the actual production of binary chemical munitions before
    October 1, 1985.
      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), before the
    production of binary chemical munitions may begin after September
    30, 1985, the President must certify to Congress in writing that,
    in light of circumstances prevailing at the time the certification
    is made, the production of such munitions is essential to the
    national interest.
      (3) For purposes of this subsection, "production of binary
    chemical munitions" means the final assembly of weapon components
    and the filling or loading of components with binary chemicals.

    (j) Definitions
      For purposes of this section:
        (1) The term "chemical agent and munition" means an agent or
      munition that, through its chemical properties, produces lethal
      or other damaging effects on human beings, except that such term
      does not include riot control agents, chemical herbicides, smoke
      and other obscuration materials.
        (2) The term "lethal chemical agent and munition" means a
      chemical agent or munition that is designed to cause death,
      through its chemical properties, to human beings in field
      concentrations.
        (3) The term "destruction" means, with respect to chemical
      munitions or agents - 
          (A) the demolishment of such munitions or agents by
        incineration or by any other means; or
          (B) the dismantling or other disposal of such munitions or
        agents so as to make them useless for military purposes and
        harmless to human beings under normal circumstances.
    (k) Operational verification
      (1) Until the Secretary of the Army successfully completes
    (through the prove-out work to be conducted at Johnston Atoll)
    operational verification of the technology to be used for the
    destruction of live chemical agents and munitions under this
    section, the Secretary may not conduct any activity for equipment
    prove out and systems test before live chemical agents are
    introduced at a facility (other than the Johnston Atoll facility)
    at which the destruction of chemical agent (!1) and munitions
    weapons is to take place under this section. The limitation in the
    preceding sentence shall not apply with respect to the Chemical
    Agent Munition Disposal System in Tooele, Utah.

      (2) Upon the successful completion of the prove out of the
    equipment and facility at Johnston Atoll, the Secretary of Defense
    shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and
    the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives a
    report certifying that the prove out is completed.
      (3) If the Secretary determines at any time that there will be a
    delay in meeting the deadline of December 31, 1990, scheduled by
    the Department of Defense for completion of the operational
    verification at Johnston Atoll referred to in paragraph (1), the
    Secretary shall immediately notify the Committees of that projected
    delay.

      this section shall specify the target incentive ranges of costs
      for completion of destruction operations and facility closure
      activities, respectively, as jointly agreed upon by the
      contracting officer and the contractor concerned. An incentives
      clause shall require a proportionate reduction in the maximum
      incentive payment amounts in the event that the contractor
      exceeds an agreed-upon target cost if such excess costs are the
      responsibility of the contractor.
        "(4) Calculation of incentive payments. - The amount of the
      incentive payment earned by a contractor for a chemical
      demilitarization facility under an incentives clause under this
      section shall be based upon a determination by the Secretary on
      how early in the target incentive range specified in such clause
      destruction operations or facility closure activities, as the
      case may be, are completed.
        "(5) Consistency with existing obligations. - The provisions of
      any incentives clause under this section shall be consistent with
      the obligation of the Secretary of Defense under section
      1412(c)(1)(A) of the Department of Defense Authorization Act,
      1986 [50 U.S.C. 1521(c)(1)(A)], to provide for maximum protection

      are involved in the destruction of the lethal chemical agents and
      munitions.
        "(6) Additional terms and conditions. - In negotiating the
      inclusion of an incentives clause in a contract under this
      section, the Secretary may include in such clause such additional
      terms and conditions as the Secretary considers appropriate.
      "(c) Additional Limitation on Payments. - 
        "(1) Payment conditional on performance. - No payment may be
      made under an incentives clause under this section unless the
      Secretary determines that the contractor concerned has
      satisfactorily performed its duties under such incentives clause.
        "(2) Payment contingent on appropriations. - An incentives
      clause under this section shall specify that the obligation of
      the Government to make payment under such incentives clause is
      subject to the availability of appropriations for that purpose.
      Amounts appropriated for Chemical Agents and Munitions

        one or more exposures to the agent and other dangerous
        exposures referred to in subparagraph (B), over time.
        "(2) To provide for - 
          "(A) the prevention of and protection against, and the
        detection (including confirmation) of, exposures to a chemical
        warfare agent (whether intentional or inadvertent) at levels
        that, even if not sufficient to endanger health immediately,
        are greater than the level that is recognized under Department
        of Defense policies as being the maximum safe level of exposure
        to that agent for the general population; and
          "(B) the recording, reporting, coordinating, and retaining of
        information on possible exposures described in subparagraph
        (A), including the monitoring of the health effects of
        exposures on humans and animals, environmental effects, and
        ecological effects, and the documenting and reporting of those
        effects specifically by location.
        "(3) To provide solutions for the concerns and mission
      requirements that are specifically applicable for one or more of
      the Armed Forces in a protracted conflict when exposures to
      chemical agents could be complex, dynamic, and occurring over an
      extended period.
      "(c) Research Program. - The Secretary of Defense shall develop
    and carry out a plan to establish a research program for
    determining the effects of exposures to chemical warfare agents of
    the type described in subsection (b). The research shall be
    designed to yield results that can guide the Secretary in the
    evolution of policy and doctrine on exposures to chemical warfare
    agents and to develop new risk assessment methods and instruments
    with respect to such exposures. The plan shall state the objectives
    and scope of the program and include a 5-year funding plan.
      "(d) Report. - Not later than May 1, 1999, the Secretary of
    Defense shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the
    Senate and the Committee on National Security of the House of
    Representatives [now Committee on Armed Services of the House of

-STATUTE-
    (a) Congressional declaration
      It is the purpose of this chapter to fulfill the intent of the
    framers of the Constitution of the United States and insure that
    the collective judgment of both the Congress and the President will
    apply to the introduction of United States Armed Forces into
    hostilities, or into situations where imminent involvement in
    hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, and to the
    continued use of such forces in hostilities or in such situations.
    (b) Congressional legislative power under necessary and proper
      clause
      Under article I, section 8, of the Constitution, it is
    specifically provided that the Congress shall have the power to
    make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution, not
    only its own powers but also all other powers vested by the
    Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any
    department or officer hereof.
    (c) Presidential executive power as Commander-in-Chief; limitation
      The constitutional powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief
    to introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into

    Stat. 3465, provided that:
      "(a) Short Title. - This section may be cited as the 'United
    States Policy in Iraq Act'.
      "(b) Sense of Congress. - It is the sense of the Congress that,
    in order to succeed in Iraq - 
        "(1) members of the United States Armed Forces who are serving
      or have served in Iraq and their families deserve the utmost
      respect and the heartfelt gratitude of the American people for
      their unwavering devotion to duty, service to the Nation, and
      selfless sacrifice under the most difficult circumstances; the
      United States Congress supports our troops and supports a
      successful conclusion to their mission;
        "(2) it is important to recognize that the Iraqi people have
      made enormous sacrifices and that the overwhelming majority of
      Iraqis want to live in peace and security; and that the Iraqi
      security forces in a growing number of incidences are fighting
      side-by-side with coalition forces, are increasing in numbers and
      improving in military capability;
        "(3) the terrorists seeking to prevent the emergence of a
      secure, stable, peaceful, and democratic Iraq are led by
      individuals seeking to restore dictatorship in Iraq or who want
      to advance al Qaeda's broad vision of violently extreme Islam in
      the Middle East;
        "(4) calendar year 2006 should be a period of significant
      transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi security forces
      taking the lead for the security of a free and sovereign Iraq,
      thereby creating the conditions for the phased redeployment of
      United States forces from Iraq;
        "(5) United States military forces should not stay in Iraq any
      longer than required and the professional military judgment of
      our senior military should be a key factor in future decisions;
        "(6) the Administration should tell the leaders of all groups
      and political parties in Iraq that they need to make the
      compromises necessary to achieve the broad-based and sustainable
      political settlement that is essential for defeating the
      insurgency in Iraq, within the schedule they set for themselves;
      and
        "(7) the President has committed to continue to explain to
      Congress and the American people progress toward a successful
      completion of the mission in Iraq.
      "(c) Reports to Congress on United States Policy and Military
    Operations in Iraq. - Not later than 90 days after the date of the
    enactment of this Act [Jan. 6, 2006], and every three months
    thereafter until all United States combat brigades have redeployed
    from Iraq, the President shall submit to Congress a report on
    United States policy and military operations in Iraq. To the
    maximum extent practicable, the report required in (c) shall be
    unclassified, with a classified annex if necessary. Each report
    shall include to the extent practical, the following information:
        "(1) The current military mission and the diplomatic,
      political, economic, and military measures that are being or have
      been undertaken to successfully complete or support that mission,
      including:
          "(A) Efforts to convince Iraq's main communities to make the
        compromises necessary for a broad-based and sustainable
        political settlement.
          "(B) Engaging the international community and the region in
        efforts to stabilize Iraq and to forge a broad-based and
        sustainable political settlement.
          "(C) Strengthening the capacity of Iraq's government
        ministries.
          "(D) Accelerating the delivery of basic services.
          "(E) Securing the delivery of pledged economic assistance
        from the international community and additional pledges of
        assistance.
          "(F) Training Iraqi security forces and transferring
        additional security responsibilities to those forces and the
        government of Iraq.
        "(2) Whether the Iraqis have made the compromises necessary to
      achieve the broad-based and sustainable political settlement that
      is essential for defeating the insurgency in Iraq.
        "(3) Any specific conditions included in the April 2005 Multi-
      National Forces-Iraq campaign action plan (referred to in United
      States Government Accountability Office October 2005 report on
      Rebuilding Iraq: DOD Reports Should Link Economic, Governance,
      and Security Indicators to Conditions for Stabilizing Iraq), and
      any subsequent updates to that campaign plan, that must be met in
      order to provide for the transition of additional security
      responsibility to Iraqi security forces.
        "(4) To the extent that these conditions are not covered under
      paragraph (3), the following should also be addressed:
          "(A) The number of battalions of the Iraqi Armed Forces that
        must be able to operate independently or to take the lead in
        counterinsurgency operations and the defense of Iraq's
        territory.
          "(B) The number of Iraqi special police units that must be
        able to operate independently or to take the lead in
        maintaining law and order and fighting the insurgency.
          "(C) The number of regular police that must be trained and
        equipped to maintain law and order.
          "(D) The ability of Iraq's Federal ministries and provincial
        and local governments to independently sustain, direct, and
        coordinate Iraq's security forces.
        "(5) The criteria to be used to evaluate progress toward
      meeting such conditions.
        "(6) A plan for meeting such conditions, an assessment of the
      extent to which such conditions have been met, information
      regarding variables that could alter that plan, and the reasons
      for any subsequent changes to that plan."

    AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE AGAINST IRAQ RESOLUTION OF
                                   2002
      Pub. L. 107-243, Oct. 16, 2002, 116 Stat. 1498, provided that:
    "Whereas in 1990 in response to Iraq's war of aggression against
      and illegal occupation of Kuwait, the United States forged a
      coalition of nations to liberate Kuwait and its people in order
      to defend the national security of the United States and enforce
      United Nations Security Council resolutions relating to Iraq;
    "Whereas after the liberation of Kuwait in 1991, Iraq entered into
      a United Nations sponsored cease-fire agreement pursuant to which
      Iraq unequivocally agreed, among other things, to eliminate its
      nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons programs and the means
      to deliver and develop them, and to end its support for
      international terrorism;
    "Whereas the efforts of international weapons inspectors, United
      States intelligence agencies, and Iraqi defectors led to the
      discovery that Iraq had large stockpiles of chemical weapons and
      a large scale biological weapons program, and that Iraq had an
      advanced nuclear weapons development program that was much closer
      to producing a nuclear weapon than intelligence reporting had
      previously indicated;
    "Whereas Iraq, in direct and flagrant violation of the cease-fire,
      attempted to thwart the efforts of weapons inspectors to identify
      and destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction stockpiles and
      development capabilities, which finally resulted in the
      withdrawal of inspectors from Iraq on October 31, 1998;
    "Whereas in Public Law 105-235 (August 14, 1998) [112 Stat. 1538],
      Congress concluded that Iraq's continuing weapons of mass
      destruction programs threatened vital United States interests and
      international peace and security, declared Iraq to be in
      'material and unacceptable breach of its international
      obligations' and urged the President 'to take appropriate action,
      in accordance with the Constitution and relevant laws of the
      United States, to bring Iraq into compliance with its
      international obligations';
    "Whereas Iraq both poses a continuing threat to the national
      security of the United States and international peace and
      security in the Persian Gulf region and remains in material and
      unacceptable breach of its international obligations by, among
      other things, continuing to possess and develop a significant
      chemical and biological weapons capability, actively seeking a
      nuclear weapons capability, and supporting and harboring
      terrorist organizations;
    "Whereas Iraq persists in violating resolution [sic] of the United
      Nations Security Council by continuing to engage in brutal
      repression of its civilian population thereby threatening
      international peace and security in the region, by refusing to
      release, repatriate, or account for non-Iraqi citizens wrongfully
      detained by Iraq, including an American serviceman, and by
      failing to return property wrongfully seized by Iraq from Kuwait;
    "Whereas the current Iraqi regime has demonstrated its capability
      and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction against other
      nations and its own people;
    "Whereas the current Iraqi regime has demonstrated its continuing
      hostility toward, and willingness to attack, the United States,
      including by attempting in 1993 to assassinate former President
      Bush and by firing on many thousands of occasions on United
      States and Coalition Armed Forces engaged in enforcing the
      resolutions of the United Nations Security Council;
    "Whereas members of al Qaida, an organization bearing
      responsibility for attacks on the United States, its citizens,
      and interests, including the attacks that occurred on September
      11, 2001, are known to be in Iraq;
    "Whereas Iraq continues to aid and harbor other international
      terrorist organizations, including organizations that threaten
      the lives and safety of United States citizens;
    "Whereas the attacks on the United States of September 11, 2001,
      underscored the gravity of the threat posed by the acquisition of
      weapons of mass destruction by international terrorist
      organizations;
    "Whereas Iraq's demonstrated capability and willingness to use
      weapons of mass destruction, the risk that the current Iraqi
      regime will either employ those weapons to launch a surprise
      attack against the United States or its Armed Forces or provide
      them to international terrorists who would do so, and the extreme
      magnitude of harm that would result to the United States and its
      citizens from such an attack, combine to justify action by the
      United States to defend itself;
    "Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 (1990)
      authorizes the use of all necessary means to enforce United
      Nations Security Council Resolution 660 (1990) and subsequent
      relevant resolutions and to compel Iraq to cease certain
      activities that threaten international peace and security,
      including the development of weapons of mass destruction and
      refusal or obstruction of United Nations weapons inspections in
      violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 687
      (1991), repression of its civilian population in violation of
      United Nations Security Council Resolution 688 (1991), and
      threatening its neighbors or United Nations operations in Iraq in
      violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 949
      (1994);
    "Whereas in the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against
      Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1) [set out as a note below],
      Congress has authorized the President 'to use United States Armed
      Forces pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 678
      (1990) in order to achieve implementation of Security Council
      Resolution 660, 661, 662, 664, 665, 666, 667, 669, 670, 674, and
      677';
    "Whereas in December 1991, Congress expressed its sense that it
      'supports the use of all necessary means to achieve the goals of
      United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 as being
      consistent with the Authorization of Use of Military Force
      Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1),' that Iraq's
      repression of its civilian population violates United Nations
      Security Council Resolution 688 and 'constitutes a continuing
      threat to the peace, security, and stability of the Persian Gulf
      region,' and that Congress, 'supports the use of all necessary
      means to achieve the goals of United Nations Security Council
      Resolution 688';
    "Whereas the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-338) [22
      U.S.C. 2151 note] expressed the sense of Congress that it should
      be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove
      from power the current Iraqi regime and promote the emergence of
      a democratic government to replace that regime;
    "Whereas on September 12, 2002, President Bush committed the United
      States to 'work with the United Nations Security Council to meet
      our common challenge' posed by Iraq and to 'work for the
      necessary resolutions,' while also making clear that 'the
      Security Council resolutions will be enforced, and the just
      demands of peace and security will be met, or action will be
      unavoidable';
    "Whereas the United States is determined to prosecute the war on
      terrorism and Iraq's ongoing support for international terrorist
      groups combined with its development of weapons of mass
      destruction in direct violation of its obligations under the 1991
      cease-fire and other United Nations Security Council resolutions
      make clear that it is in the national security interests of the
      United States and in furtherance of the war on terrorism that all
      relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions be enforced,
      including through the use of force if necessary;
    "Whereas Congress has taken steps to pursue vigorously the war on
      terrorism through the provision of authorities and funding
      requested by the President to take the necessary actions against
      international terrorists and terrorist organizations, including
      those nations, organizations, or persons who planned, authorized,
      committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on
      September 11, 2001, or harbored such persons or organizations;
    "Whereas the President and Congress are determined to continue to
      take all appropriate actions against international terrorists and
      terrorist organizations, including those nations, organizations,
      or persons who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the
      terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or
      harbored such persons or organizations;
    "Whereas the President has authority under the Constitution to take
      action in order to deter and prevent acts of international
      terrorism against the United States, as Congress recognized in
      the joint resolution on Authorization for Use of Military Force
      (Public Law 107-40) [set out as a note below]; and
    "Whereas it is in the national security interests of the United
      States to restore international peace and security to the Persian
      Gulf region: Now, therefore, be it

                               "SHORT TITLE                           
      "Section 1. This joint resolution may be cited as the
    'Multinational Force in Lebanon Resolution'.

                           "FINDINGS AND PURPOSE                       
      "Sec. 2. (a) The Congress finds that - 
        "(1) the removal of all foreign forces from Lebanon is an
      essential United States foreign policy objective in the Middle
      East;
        "(2) in order to restore full control by the Government of
      Lebanon over its own territory, the United States is currently
      participating in the multinational peacekeeping force (hereafter
      in this resolution referred to as the 'Multinational Force in
      Lebanon') which was established in accordance with the exchange
      of letters between the Governments of the United States and
      Lebanon dated September 25, 1982;
        "(3) the Multinational Force in Lebanon better enables the
      Government of Lebanon to establish its unity, independence, and
      territorial integrity;
        "(4) progress toward national political reconciliation in
      Lebanon is necessary; and
        "(5) United States Armed Forces participating in the
      Multinational Force in Lebanon are now in hostilities requiring
      authorization of their continued presence under the War Powers
      Resolution [50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.].
      "(b) The Congress determines that the requirements of section
    4(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution [50 U.S.C. 1543(a)(1)] became
    operative on August 29, 1983. Consistent with section 5(b) of the
    War Powers Resolution [50 U.S.C. 1544(b)], the purpose of this
    joint resolution is to authorize the continued participation of
    United States Armed Forces in the Multinational Force in Lebanon.
      "(c) The Congress intends this joint resolution to constitute the
    necessary specific statutory authorization under the War Powers
    Resolution for continued participation by United States Armed
    Forces in the Multinational Force in Lebanon.

     "AUTHORIZATION FOR CONTINUED PARTICIPATION OF UNITED STATES ARMED
               FORCES IN THE MULTINATIONAL FORCE IN LEBANON
      "Sec. 3. The President is authorized, for purposes of section
    5(b) of the War Powers Resolution [50 U.S.C. 1544(b)], to continue
    participation by United States Armed Forces in the Multinational
    Force in Lebanon, subject to the provisions of section 6 of this
    joint resolution. Such participation shall be limited to
    performance of the functions, and shall be subject to the
    limitations, specified in the agreement establishing the
    Multinational Force in Lebanon as set forth in the exchange of
    letters between the Governments of the United States and Lebanon
    dated September 25, 1982, except that this shall not preclude such
    protective measures as may be necessary to ensure the safety of the
    Multinational Force in Lebanon.

                         "REPORTS TO THE CONGRESS                     
      "Sec. 4. As required by section 4(c) of the War Powers Resolution
    [50 U.S.C. 1543(c)], the President shall report periodically to the
    Congress with respect to the situation in Lebanon, but in no event
    shall he report less often than once every three months. In
    addition to providing the information required by that section on
    the status, scope, and duration of hostilities involving United
    States Armed Forces, such reports shall describe in detail - 
        "(1) the activities being performed by the Multinational Force
      in Lebanon;
        "(2) the present composition of the Multinational Force in
      Lebanon, including a description of the responsibilities and
      deployment of the armed forces of each participating country;
        "(3) the results of efforts to reduce and eventually eliminate
      the Multinational Force in Lebanon;
        "(4) how continued United States participation in the
      Multinational Force in Lebanon is advancing United States foreign
      policy interests in the Middle East; and
        "(5) what progress has occurred toward national political
      reconciliation among all Lebanese groups.

                           "STATEMENTS OF POLICY                       
      "Sec. 5. (a) The Congress declares that the participation of the
    armed forces of other countries in the Multinational Force in
    Lebanon is essential to maintain the international character of the
    peacekeeping function in Lebanon.
      "(b) The Congress believes that it should continue to be the
    policy of the United States to promote continuing discussions with
    Israel, Syria, and Lebanon with the objective of bringing about the
    withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanon and establishing an
    environment which will permit the Lebanese Armed Forces to carry
    out their responsibilities in the Beirut area.
      "(c) It is the sense of the Congress that, not later than one
    year after the date of enactment of this joint resolution [Oct. 12,
    1983] and at least once a year thereafter, the United States should
    discuss with the other members of the Security Council of the
    United Nations the establishment of a United Nations peacekeeping
    force to assume the responsibilities of the Multinational Force in
    Lebanon. An analysis of the implications of the response to such
    discussions for the continuation of the Multinational Force in
    Lebanon shall be included in the reports required under paragraph
    (3) of section 4 of this resolution.

     "DURATION OF AUTHORIZATION FOR UNITED STATES PARTICIPATION IN THE
                      MULTINATIONAL FORCE IN LEBANON
      "Sec. 6. The participation of United States Armed Forces in the
    Multinational Force in Lebanon shall be authorized for purposes of
    the War Powers Resolution [50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.] until the end of
    the eighteen-month period beginning on the date of enactment of
    this resolution [Oct. 12, 1983] unless the Congress extends such
    authorization, except that such authorization shall terminate
    sooner upon the occurrence of any one of the following:
        "(1) the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, unless
      the President determines and certifies to the Congress that
      continued United States Armed Forces participation in the
      Multinational Force in Lebanon is required after such withdrawal
      in order to accomplish the purposes specified in the September
      25, 1982, exchange of letters providing for the establishment of
      the Multinational Force in Lebanon; or
        "(2) the assumption by the United Nations or the Government of
      Lebanon of the responsibilities of the Multinational Force in
      Lebanon; or
        "(3) the implementation of other effective security
      arrangements in the area; or
        "(4) the withdrawal of all other countries from participation
      in the Multinational Force in Lebanon.

                    "INTERPRETATION OF THIS RESOLUTION                
      "Sec. 7. (a) Nothing in this joint resolution shall preclude the
    President from withdrawing United States Armed Forces participation
    in the Multinational Force in Lebanon if circumstances warrant, and
    nothing in this joint resolution shall preclude the Congress by
    joint resolution from directing such a withdrawal.
      "(b) Nothing in this joint resolution modifies, limits, or
    supersedes any provision of the War Powers Resolution [50 U.S.C.
    1541 et seq.] or the requirement of section 4(a) of the Lebanon
    Emergency Assistance Act of 1983, relating to congressional
    authorization for any substantial expansion in the number or role
    of United States Armed Forces in Lebanon.

    repeal this Act shall be referred to the Committee on Foreign
    Affairs [now Committee on International Relations] of the House of
    Representatives or the Committee on Foreign Relations of the
    Senate, as the case may be. Such joint resolution or bill shall be
    considered by such committee within fifteen calendar days and may
    be reported out, together with its recommendations, unless such
    House shall otherwise determine pursuant to its rules.
      "(b) Any joint resolution or bill so reported shall become the
    pending business of the House in question (in the case of the
    Senate the time for debate shall be equally divided between the
    proponents and the opponents) and shall be voted on within three
    calendar days thereafter, unless such House shall otherwise
    determine by the yeas and nays.
      "(c) Such a joint resolution or bill passed by one House shall be
    referred to the committee of the other House named in subsection
    (a) and shall be reported out by such committee together with its
    recommendations within fifteen calendar days and shall thereupon
    become the pending business of such House and shall be voted upon
    within three calendar days, unless such House shall otherwise
    determine by the yeas and nays.
      "(d) In the case of any disagreement between the two Houses of
    Congress with respect to a joint resolution or bill passed by both
    Houses, conferees shall be promptly appointed and the committee of
    conference shall make and file a report with respect to such joint
    resolution within six calendar days after the legislation is
    referred to the committee of conference. Notwithstanding any rule
    in either House concerning the printing of conference reports in
    the Record or concerning any delay in the consideration of such
    reports, such report shall be acted on by both Houses not later
    than six calendar days after the conference report is filed. In the
    event the conferees are unable to agree within forty-eight hours,
    they shall report back to their respective Houses in disagreement."

      Pub. L. 96-342, title X, Sec. 1008, Sept. 8, 1980, 94 Stat. 1122,
    provided that: "Whereas, the National Command Authority must have
    the capacity to carry out any military mission which is essential
    to the national security of the United States having in its hands
    in the Rapid Deployment Force an increased capability to extend the
    reach of our military power in an expedited manner; and whereas,
    without the significant safeguard of the War Powers Resolution
    (Public Law 93-148) [this chapter], United States foreign and
    defense policies could be subject to misinterpretation; it is
    therefore the sense of the Congress that the provisions of the War
    Powers Resolution be strictly adhered to and that the congressional
    consultation process specified by such Resolution be utilized
    strictly according to the terms of the War Powers Resolution."

-STATUTE-
    (a) Inferences from any law or treaty
      Authority to introduce United States Armed Forces into
    hostilities or into situations wherein involvement in hostilities
    is clearly indicated by the circumstances shall not be inferred - 
        (1) from any provision of law (whether or not in effect before
      November 7, 1973), including any provision contained in any
      appropriation Act, unless such provision specifically authorizes
      the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities
      or into such situations and states that it is intended to
      constitute specific statutory authorization within the meaning of
      this chapter; or
        (2) from any treaty heretofore or hereafter ratified unless
      such treaty is implemented by legislation specifically
      authorizing the introduction of United States Armed Forces into
      hostilities or into such situations and stating that it is
      intended to constitute specific statutory authorization within
      the meaning of this chapter.
    (b) Joint headquarters operations of high-level military commands
      Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require any further
    specific statutory authorization to permit members of United States
    Armed Forces to participate jointly with members of the armed
    forces of one or more foreign countries in the headquarters
    operations of high-level military commands which were established
    prior to November 7, 1973, and pursuant to the United Nations
    Charter or any treaty ratified by the United States prior to such
    date.
    (c) Introduction of United States Armed Forces
      For purposes of this chapter, the term "introduction of United
    States Armed Forces" includes the assignment of members of such
    armed forces to command, coordinate, participate in the movement
    of, or accompany the regular or irregular military forces of any
    foreign country or government when such military forces are
    engaged, or there exists an imminent threat that such forces will
    become engaged, in hostilities.
    (d) Constitutional authorities or existing treaties unaffected;
      construction against grant of Presidential authority respecting
      use of United States Armed Forces
      Nothing in this chapter - 
        (1) is intended to alter the constitutional authority of the
      Congress or of the President, or the provisions of existing
      treaties; or
        (2) shall be construed as granting any authority to the
      President with respect to the introduction of United States Armed
      Forces into hostilities or into situations wherein involvement in
      hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances which
      authority he would not have had in the absence of this chapter.

      A national emergency exists by reason of the terrorist attacks at
    the World Trade Center, New York, New York, and the Pentagon, and
    the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the
    United States.
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States
    of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President by
    the Constitution and the laws of the United States, I hereby
    declare that the national emergency has existed since September 11,
    2001, and, pursuant to the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601
    et seq.), I intend to utilize the following statutes: sections 123,
    123a, 527, 2201(c), 12006, and 12302 of title 10, United States
    Code, and sections 331, 359, and 367 of title 14, United States
    Code.
      This proclamation immediately shall be published in the Federal
    Register or disseminated through the Emergency Federal Register,
    and transmitted to the Congress.
      This proclamation is not intended to create any right or benefit,
    substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against
    the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.
      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth
    day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand one, and of
    the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
    and twenty-sixth.
                                                         George W. Bush.

       CONTINUATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARED BY PROC. NO. 7463   
      Notice of President of the United States, dated Sept. 5, 2006, 71
    F.R. 52733, provided:
      Consistent with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act
    (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national
    emergency I declared on September 14, 2001, in Proclamation 7463
    [set out above], with respect to the terrorist attacks at the World
    Trade Center, New York, New York, the Pentagon, and aboard United
    Airlines flight 93, and the continuing and immediate threat of
    further attacks on the United States.
      Because the terrorist threat continues, the national emergency
    declared on September 14, 2001, and the measures adopted to deal
    with that emergency must continue in effect beyond September 14,
    2006. Therefore, I am continuing in effect for an additional year
    the national emergency I declared on September 14, 2001, with
    respect to the terrorist threat.
      This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and
    transmitted to the Congress.
                                                         George W. Bush.

        (C) any rights or duties that matured or penalties that were
      incurred prior to such date.
    (b) Termination review of national emergencies by Congress
      Not later than six months after a national emergency is declared,
    and not later than the end of each six-month period thereafter that
    such emergency continues, each House of Congress shall meet to

    emergency shall be terminated.
    (c) Joint resolution; referral to Congressional committees;
      conference committee in event of disagreement; filing of report;
      termination procedure deemed part of rules of House and Senate
      (1) A joint resolution to terminate a national emergency declared

    the House of Representatives or the Senate, as the case may be. One
    such joint resolution shall be reported out by such committee
    together with its recommendations within fifteen calendar days
    after the day on which such resolution is referred to such
    committee, unless such House shall otherwise determine by the yeas
    and nays.
      (2) Any joint resolution so reported shall become the pending
    business of the House in question (in the case of the Senate the
    time for debate shall be equally divided between the proponents and
    the opponents) and shall be voted on within three calendar days
    after the day on which such resolution is reported, unless such
    House shall otherwise determine by yeas and nays.
      (3) Such a joint resolution passed by one House shall be referred
    to the appropriate committee of the other House and shall be
    reported out by such committee together with its recommendations
    within fifteen calendar days after the day on which such resolution
    is referred to such committee and shall thereupon become the
    pending business of such House and shall be voted upon within three
    calendar days after the day on which such resolution is reported,
    unless such House shall otherwise determine by yeas and nays.
      (4) In the case of any disagreement between the two Houses of
    Congress with respect to a joint resolution passed by both Houses,
    conferees shall be promptly appointed and the committee of
    conference shall make and file a report with respect to such joint
    resolution within six calendar days after the day on which managers
    on the part of the Senate and the House have been appointed.
    Notwithstanding any rule in either House concerning the printing of
    conference reports or concerning any delay in the consideration of
    such reports, such report shall be acted on by both Houses not
    later than six calendar days after the conference report is filed
    in the House in which such report is filed first. In the event the
    conferees are unable to agree within forty-eight hours, they shall
    report back to their respective Houses in disagreement.
      (5) Paragraphs (1)-(4) of this subsection, subsection (b) of this
    section, and section 1651(b) of this title are enacted by Congress -
     
        (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and
      the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such they are
      deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but
      applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in
      the House in the case of resolutions described by this
      subsection; and they supersede other rules only to the extent
      that they are inconsistent therewith; and
        (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of either
      House to change the rules (so far as relating to the procedure of
      that House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same
      extent as in the case of any other rule of that House.
    (d) Automatic termination of national emergency; continuation
      notice from President to Congress; publication in Federal
      Register
      Any national emergency declared by the President in accordance
    with this subchapter, and not otherwise previously terminated,
    shall terminate on the anniversary of the declaration of that
    emergency if, within the ninety-day period prior to each
    anniversary date, the President does not publish in the Federal
    Register and transmit to the Congress a notice stating that such
    emergency is to continue in effect after such anniversary.

      "Congress makes the following findings:
        "(1) On July 23, 2004, Congress declared, 'the atrocities
      unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, are genocide'.
        "(2) On September 9, 2004, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
      stated before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate,
      'genocide has occurred and may still be occurring in Darfur', and
      'the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed bear responsibility'.
        "(3) On September 21, 2004, in an address before the United
      Nations General Assembly, President George W. Bush affirmed the
      Secretary of State's finding and stated, '[a]t this hour, the
      world is witnessing terrible suffering and horrible crimes in the
      Darfur region of Sudan, crimes my government has concluded are
      genocide'.
        "(4) On July 30, 2004, the United Nations Security Council
      passed Security Council Resolution 1556 (2004), calling upon the
      Government of Sudan to disarm the Janjaweed militias and to
      apprehend and bring to justice Janjaweed leaders and their
      associates who have incited and carried out violations of human
      rights and international humanitarian law, and establishing a ban
      on the sale or supply of arms and related materiel of all types,
      including the provision of related technical training or
      assistance, to all nongovernmental entities and individuals,
      including the Janjaweed.
        "(5) On September 18, 2004, the United Nations Security Council
      passed Security Council Resolution 1564 (2004), determining that
      the Government of Sudan had failed to meet its obligations under
      Security Council Resolution 1556 (2004), calling for a military
      flight ban in and over the Darfur region, demanding the names of
      Janjaweed militiamen disarmed and arrested for verification,
      establishing an International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur to
      investigate violations of international humanitarian and human
      rights laws, and threatening sanctions should the Government of
      Sudan fail to fully comply with Security Council Resolutions 1556
      (2004) and 1564 (2004), including such actions as to affect
      Sudan's petroleum sector or individual members of the Government
      of Sudan.
        "(6) The Report of the International Commission of Inquiry on
      Darfur, submitted to the United Nations Secretary-General on
      January 25, 2005, established that the 'Government of the Sudan
      and the Janjaweed are responsible for serious violations of
      international human rights and humanitarian law amounting to
      crimes under international law,' that 'these acts were conducted
      on a widespread and systematic basis, and therefore may amount to
      crimes against humanity,' and that officials of the Government of
      Sudan and other individuals may have acted with 'genocidal
      intent'.
        "(7) On March 24, 2005, the United Nations Security Council
      passed Security Council Resolution 1590 (2005), establishing the
      United Nations Mission in Sudan (referred to in this section as
      the 'UNMIS'), consisting of up to 10,000 military personnel and
      715 civilian police tasked with supporting the implementation of
      the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan and to 'closely and
      continuously liaise and coordinate at all levels with the African
      Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS)', which had been established by the
      African Union on May 24, 2004, to monitor the implementation of
      the N'Djamena Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement, signed on April
      8, 2004, 'with a view towards expeditiously reinforcing the
      effort to foster peace in Darfur'.
        "(8) On March 29, 2005, the United Nations Security Council
      passed Security Council Resolution 1591 (2005), extending the
      military embargo established by Security Council Resolution 1556
      (2004) to all the parties to the N'Djamena Ceasefire Agreement of
      April 8, 2004, and any other belligerents in the states of North
      Darfur, South Darfur, and West Darfur, calling for an asset
      freeze and travel ban against those individuals who impede the
      peace process, constitute a threat to stability in Darfur and the
      region, commit violations of international humanitarian or human
      rights law or other atrocities, are responsible for offensive
      military overflights, or violate the military embargo, and
      establishing a Committee of the Security Council and a panel of
      experts to assist in monitoring compliance with Security Council
      Resolutions 1556 (2004) and 1591 (2005).
        "(9) On March 31, 2005, the United Nations Security Council
      passed Security Council Resolution 1593 (2005), referring the
      situation in Darfur since July 1, 2002, to the prosecutor of the
      International Criminal Court and calling on the Government of
      Sudan and all parties to the conflict to cooperate fully with the
      Court.
        "(10) On July 30, 2005, Dr. John Garang de Mabior, the newly
      appointed Vice President of Sudan and the leader of the SPLM/A
      for the past 21 years, was killed in a tragic helicopter crash in
      Southern Sudan, sparking riots in Khartoum and challenging the
      commitment of all Sudanese to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement
      for Sudan.
        "(11) On January 12, 2006, the African Union Peace and Security
      Council issued a communique endorsing, in principle, a transition
      from AMIS to a United Nations peacekeeping operation and
      requested the Chairperson of the Council to initiate
      consultations with the United Nations and other stakeholders
      toward this end.
        "(12) On February 3, 2006, the United Nations Security Council
      issued a Presidential Statement authorizing the initiation of
      contingency planning for a transition from AMIS to a United
      Nations peacekeeping operation.
        "(13) On March 10, 2006, the African Union Peace and Security
      Council extended the mandate of AMIS, which had reached a force
      size of 7,000, to September 30, 2006, while simultaneously
      endorsing the transition of AMIS to a United Nations peacekeeping
      operation and setting April 30, 2006 as the deadline for reaching
      an agreement to resolve the crisis in Darfur.
        "(14) On March 24, 2006, the United Nations Security Council
      passed Security Council Resolution 1663 (2006), which - 
          "(A) welcomes the African Peace and Security Council's March
        10, 2006 communique; and
          "(B) requests that the United Nations Secretary-General,
        jointly with the African Union and in consultation with the
        parties to the Abuja Peace Talks, expedite planning for the
        transition of AMIS to a United Nations peacekeeping operation.
        "(15) On March 29, 2006, during a speech at Freedom House,
      President Bush called for a transition to a United Nations
      peacekeeping operation and 'additional forces with a NATO overlay
      . . . to provide logistical and command-and-control and airlift
      capacity, but also to send a clear signal to parties involved
      that the west is determined to help effect a settlement.'.
        "(16) On April 25, 2006, the United Nations Security Council
      passed Security Council Resolution 1672 (2006), unanimously
      imposing targeted financial sanctions and travel restrictions on
      4 individuals who had been identified as those who, among other
      acts, 'impede the peace process, constitute a threat to stability
      in Darfur and the region, commit violations of international
      humanitarian or human rights law or other atrocities', including
      the Commander of the Western Military Region for the armed forces
      of Sudan, the Paramount Chief of the Jalul Tribe in North Darfur,
      the Commander of the Sudan Liberation Army, and the Field
      Commander of the National Movement for Reform and Development.
        "(17) On May 5, 2006, under the auspices of African Union
      mediation and the direct engagement of the international
      community, including the United States, the Government of Sudan
      and the largest rebel faction in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation
      Movement, led by Minni Minnawi, signed the Darfur Peace
      Agreement, which addresses security, power sharing, and wealth
      sharing issues between the parties.
        "(18) In August 2006, the Sudanese government began to amass
      military forces and equipment in the Darfur region in
      contravention of the Darfur Peace Agreement to which they are
      signatories in what appears to be preliminary to full scale war.
        "(19) On August 30, 2006, the United Nations Security Council
      passed Security Council Resolution 1706 (2006), without dissent
      and with abstentions by China, Russian Federation, and Qatar,
      thereby asserting that the existing United Nations Mission in
      Sudan 'shall take over from AMIS responsibility for supporting
      the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement upon the
      expiration of AMIS' mandate but in any event no later than 31
      December 2006', and that UNMIS 'shall be strengthened by up to
      17,300 military personnel . . . 3,300 civilian police personnel
      and up to 16 Formed Police Units', which 'shall begin to be
      deployed [to Darfur] no later than 1 October 2006'.
        "(20) Between August 30 and September 3, 2006, President Bashir
      and other senior members of his administration have publicly
      rejected United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706 (2006),
      calling it illegal and a western invasion of his country, despite
      the current presence of 10,000 United Nations peacekeepers under
      the UNMIS peacekeeping force.
        "(21) Since 1993, the Secretary of State has determined,
      pursuant to section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979
      (50 App. U.S.C. 2405(j)), that Sudan is a country, the government
      of which has repeatedly provided support for acts of
      international terrorism, thereby restricting United States
      assistance, defense exports and sales, and financial and other
      transactions with the Government of Sudan.

      "SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
      "It is the sense of Congress that - 
        "(1) the genocide unfolding in the Darfur region of Sudan is
      characterized by acts of terrorism and atrocities directed
      against civilians, including mass murder, rape, and sexual
      violence committed by the Janjaweed and associated militias with
      the complicity and support of the National Congress Party-led
      faction of the Government of Sudan;
        "(2) all parties to the conflict in the Darfur region have
      continued to violate the N'Djamena Ceasefire Agreement of April
      8, 2004, and the Abuja Protocols of November 9, 2004, and
      violence against civilians, humanitarian aid workers, and
      personnel of AMIS is increasing;
        "(3) the African Union should immediately make all necessary
      preparations for an orderly transition to a United Nations
      peacekeeping operation, which will maintain an appropriate level
      of African participation, with a mandate to protect civilians and
      humanitarian operations, assist in the implementation of the
      Darfur Peace Agreement, and deter violence in the Darfur region;
        "(4) the international community, including the United States
      and the European Union, should immediately act to mobilize
      sufficient political, military, and financial resources through
      the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to
      support the transition of AMIS to a United Nations peacekeeping
      operation with the size, strength, and capacity necessary to
      protect civilians and humanitarian operations, to assist with the
      implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement, and to end the
      continued violence in the Darfur region;
        "(5) if an expanded and reinforced AMIS or subsequent United
      Nations peacekeeping operation fails to stop genocide in the
      Darfur region, the international community should take additional
      measures to prevent and suppress acts of genocide in the Darfur
      region;
        "(6) acting under article 5 of the Charter of the United
      Nations, the United Nations Security Council should call for
      suspension of the Government of Sudan's rights and privileges of
      membership by the General Assembly until such time as the
      Government of Sudan has honored pledges to cease attacks upon
      civilians, demobilize and demilitarize the Janjaweed and
      associated militias, and grant free and unfettered access for
      deliveries of humanitarian assistance in the Darfur region;
        "(7) the President should use all necessary and appropriate
      diplomatic means to ensure the full discharge of the
      responsibilities of the Committee of the United Nations Security
      Council and the panel of experts established pursuant to section
      3(a) of Security Council Resolution 1591 (2005);
        "(8) the President should direct the United States Permanent
      Representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, and
      influence of the United States to urge the adoption of a
      resolution by the United Nations Security Council that - 
          "(A) extends the military embargo established by United
        Nations Security Resolutions 1556 (2004) and 1591 (2005) to
        include a total ban on the sale or supply of offensive military
        equipment to the Government of Sudan, except for use in an
        internationally recognized demobilization program or for
        nonlethal assistance necessary to carry out elements of the
        Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan or the Darfur Peace
        Agreement; and
          "(B) calls upon those member states of the United Nations
        that continue to undermine efforts to foster peace in Sudan by
        providing military assistance to the Government of Sudan,
        government supported militias, or any rebel group operating in
        Darfur in violation of the embargo on such assistance and
        equipment, as called for in United Nations Security Council
        Resolutions 1556 (2004) and 1591 (2005), to immediately cease
        and desist.
        "(9) the United States should not provide assistance to the
      Government of Sudan, other than assistance necessary for the
      implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan and
      the Darfur Peace Agreement, the support of the regional
      Government of Southern Sudan, the Transitional Darfur Regional
      Authority, and marginalized areas in Northern Sudan (including
      the Nuba Mountains, Southern Blue Nile, Abyei, Eastern Sudan
      (Beja), Darfur, and Nubia), or for humanitarian purposes in
      Sudan, until the Government of Sudan has honored pledges to cease
      attacks upon civilians, demobilize and demilitarize the Janjaweed
      and associated militias, grant free and unfettered access for
      deliveries of humanitarian assistance in the Darfur region, and
      allow for the safe and voluntary return of refugees and
      internally displaced persons;
        "(10) the President should seek to assist members of the
      Sudanese diaspora in the United States by establishing a student
      loan forgiveness program for those individuals who commit to
      return to Southern Sudan for a period of not less than 5 years
      for the purpose of contributing professional skills needed for
      the reconstruction of Southern Sudan;
        "(11) the Presidential Special Envoy for Sudan should be
      provided with appropriate resources and a clear mandate to - 
          "(A) provide stewardship of efforts to implement the
        Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan and the Darfur Peace
        Agreement;
          "(B) seek ways to bring stability and peace to the Darfur
        region;
          "(C) address instability elsewhere in Sudan, Chad, and
        northern Uganda; and
          "(D) pursue a truly comprehensive peace throughout the
        region;
        "(12) the international community should strongly condemn
      attacks against humanitarian workers and African Union personnel,
      and the forcible recruitment of refugees and internally displaced
      persons from camps in Chad and Sudan, and demand that all armed
      groups in the region, including the forces of the Government of
      Sudan, the Janjaweed, associated militias, the Sudan Liberation
      Movement/Army, the Justice and Equality Movement, the National
      Movement for Reform and Development (NMRD), and all other armed
      groups refrain from such activities;
        "(13) the United States should fully support the Comprehensive
      Peace Agreement for Sudan and the Darfur Peace Agreement and urge
      rapid implementation of their terms;
        "(14) the May 5, 2006[,] signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement
      between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan Liberation Movement
      was a positive development in a situation that has seen little
      political progress in 2 years and should be seized upon by all
      sides to begin the arduous process of post-conflict
      reconstruction, restitution, justice, and reconciliation; and
        "(15) the new leadership of the Sudan People's Liberation
      Movement (referred to in this paragraph as 'SPLM') should - 
          "(A) seek to transform SPLM into an inclusive, transparent,
        and democratic body;
          "(B) reaffirm the commitment of SPLM to - 
            "(i) bring peace to Southern Sudan, the Darfur region, and
          Eastern Sudan; and
            "(ii) eliminate safe haven for regional rebel movements,
          such as the Lord's Resistance Army; and
          "(C) remain united in the face of efforts to undermine SPLM.

      "SEC. 5. SANCTIONS IN SUPPORT OF PEACE IN DARFUR.

    commit violations of international humanitarian or human rights law
    or other atrocities'.

      "SEC. 6. ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES TO DETER AND SUPPRESS GENOCIDE IN
        DARFUR.
      "(a) Presidential Assistance To Support AMIS. - Subject to
    subsection (b) and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the
    President is authorized to provide AMIS with - 
        "(1) assistance for any expansion of the mandate, size,
      strength, and capacity to protect civilians and humanitarian
      operations in order to help stabilize the Darfur region of Sudan
      and dissuade and deter air attacks directed against civilians and
      humanitarian workers; and
        "(2) assistance in the areas of logistics, transport,

        anyone not an officer, employee or agent of AMIS (or subsequent
        United Nations peacekeeping operation), and not to use or to
        permit the use of such assistance for any purposes other than
        those for which such assistance was furnished, unless the
        consent of the President has first been obtained, and written

      Pub. L. 108-61, July 28, 2003, 117 Stat. 864, as amended by Pub.
    L. 109-251, Sec. 1, Aug. 1, 2006, 120 Stat. 654, provided that:

      "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
      "This Act may be cited as the 'Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act
    of 2003'.

      "SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
      "Congress makes the following findings:
        "(1) The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has failed
      to transfer power to the National League for Democracy (NLD)
      whose parliamentarians won an overwhelming victory in the 1990
      elections in Burma.
        "(2) The SPDC has failed to enter into meaningful, political
      dialogue with the NLD and ethnic minorities and has dismissed the
      efforts of United Nations Special Envoy Razali bin Ismail to
      further such dialogue.
        "(3) According to the State Department's 'Report to the
      Congress Regarding Conditions in Burma and U.S. Policy Toward
      Burma' dated March 28, 2003, the SPDC has become 'more
      confrontational' in its exchanges with the NLD.
        "(4) On May 30, 2003, the SPDC, threatened by continued support
      for the NLD throughout Burma, brutally attacked NLD supporters,
      killed and injured scores of civilians, and arrested democracy
      advocate Aung San Suu Kyi and other activists.
        "(5) The SPDC continues egregious human rights violations
      against Burmese citizens, uses rape as a weapon of intimidation
      and torture against women, and forcibly conscripts child-soldiers
      for the use in fighting indigenous ethnic groups.
        "(6) The SPDC is engaged in ethnic cleansing against minorities
      within Burma, including the Karen, Karenni, and Shan people,
      which constitutes a crime against humanity and has directly led
      to more than 600,000 internally displaced people living within
      Burma and more than 130,000 people from Burma living in refugee
      camps along the Thai-Burma border.
        "(7) The ethnic cleansing campaign of the SPDC is in sharp
      contrast to the traditional peaceful coexistence in Burma of
      Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, and people of traditional
      beliefs.
        "(8) The SPDC has demonstrably failed to cooperate with the
      United States in stopping the flood of heroin and
      methamphetamines being grown, refined, manufactured, and
      transported in areas under the control of the SPDC serving to
      flood the region and much of the world with these illicit drugs.
        "(9) The SPDC provides safety, security, and engages in
      business dealings with narcotics traffickers under indictment by
      United States authorities, and other producers and traffickers of
      narcotics.
        "(10) The International Labor Organization (ILO), for the first
      time in its 82-year history, adopted in 2000, a resolution
      recommending that governments, employers, and workers
      organizations take appropriate measures to ensure that their
      relations with the SPDC do not abet the government-sponsored
      system of forced, compulsory, or slave labor in Burma, and that
      other international bodies reconsider any cooperation they may be
      engaged in with Burma and, if appropriate, cease as soon as
      possible any activity that could abet the practice of forced,
      compulsory, or slave labor.
        "(11) The SPDC has integrated the Burmese military and its
      surrogates into all facets of the economy effectively destroying
      any free enterprise system.
        "(12) Investment in Burmese companies and purchases from them
      serve to provide the SPDC with currency that is used to finance
      its instruments of terror and repression against the Burmese
      people.
        "(13) On April 15, 2003, the American Apparel and Footwear
      Association expressed its 'strong support for a full and
      immediate ban on U.S. textiles, apparel and footwear imports from
      Burma' and called upon the United States Government to 'impose an
      outright ban on U.S. imports' of these items until Burma
      demonstrates respect for basic human and labor rights of its
      citizens.
        "(14) The policy of the United States, as articulated by the
      President on April 24, 2003, is to officially recognize the NLD
      as the legitimate representative of the Burmese people as
      determined by the 1990 election.
        "(15) The United States must work closely with other nations,
      including Thailand, a close ally of the United States, to
      highlight attention to the SPDC's systematic abuses of human
      rights in Burma, to ensure that nongovernmental organizations
      promoting human rights and political freedom in Burma are allowed
      to operate freely and without harassment, and to craft a
      multilateral sanctions regime against Burma in order to pressure
      the SPDC to meet the conditions identified in section 3(a)(3) of
      this Act.

      "SEC. 3. BAN AGAINST TRADE THAT SUPPORTS THE MILITARY REGIME OF
        BURMA.
      "(a) General Ban. - 
        "(1) In general. - Notwithstanding any other provision of law,
      until such time as the President determines and certifies to
      Congress that Burma has met the conditions described in paragraph
      (3), beginning 30 days after the date of the enactment of this
      Act [July 28, 2003], the President shall ban the importation of
      any article that is a product of Burma.
        "(2) Ban on imports from certain companies. - The import
      restrictions contained in paragraph (1) shall apply to, among
      other entities - 
          "(A) the SPDC, any ministry of the SPDC, a member of the SPDC
        or an immediate family member of such member;
          "(B) known narcotics traffickers from Burma or an immediate
        family member of such narcotics trafficker;
          "(C) the Union of Myanmar Economics Holdings Incorporated
        (UMEHI) or any company in which the UMEHI has a fiduciary
        interest;
          "(D) the Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) or any company in
        which the MEC has a fiduciary interest;
          "(E) the Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA);
        and
          "(F) any successor entity for the SPDC, UMEHI, MEC, or USDA.
        "(3) Conditions described. - The conditions described in this
      paragraph are the following:
          "(A) The SPDC has made substantial and measurable progress to
        end violations of internationally recognized human rights
        including rape, and the Secretary of State, after consultation
        with the ILO Secretary General and relevant nongovernmental
        organizations, reports to the appropriate congressional
        committees that the SPDC no longer systematically violates
        workers rights, including the use of forced and child labor,
        and conscription of child-soldiers.
          "(B) The SPDC has made measurable and substantial progress
        toward implementing a democratic government including - 
            "(i) releasing all political prisoners;
            "(ii) allowing freedom of speech and the press;
            "(iii) allowing freedom of association;
            "(iv) permitting the peaceful exercise of religion; and
            "(v) bringing to a conclusion an agreement between the SPDC
          and the democratic forces led by the NLD and Burma's ethnic
          nationalities on the transfer of power to a civilian
          government accountable to the Burmese people through
          democratic elections under the rule of law.
          "(C) Pursuant to section 706(2) of the Foreign Relations
        Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228) [22
        U.S.C. 2291j-1(2)], Burma has not been designated as a country
        that has failed demonstrably to make substantial efforts to
        adhere to its obligations under international counternarcotics
        agreements and to take other effective counternarcotics
        measures, including, but not limited to (i) the arrest and
        extradition of all individuals under indictment in the United
        States for narcotics trafficking, (ii) concrete and measurable
        actions to stem the flow of illicit drug money into Burma's
        banking system and economic enterprises, and (iii) actions to
        stop the manufacture and export of methamphetamines.
        "(4) Appropriate congressional committees. - In this
      subsection, the term 'appropriate congressional committees' means
      the Committees on Foreign Relations and Appropriations of the
      Senate and the Committees on International Relations and
      Appropriations of the House of Representatives.
      "(b) Waiver Authorities. - The President may waive the
    prohibitions described in this section for any or all articles that
    are a product of Burma if the President determines and notifies the
    Committees on Appropriations, Finance, and Foreign Relations of the
    Senate and the Committees on Appropriations, International
    Relations, and Ways and Means of the House of Representatives that
    to do so is in the national interest of the United States.

      "SEC. 4. FREEZING ASSETS OF THE BURMESE REGIME IN THE UNITED
        STATES.
      "(a) Reporting Requirement. - Not later than 60 days after the
    date of enactment of this Act [July 28, 2003], the President shall
    take such action as is necessary to direct, and promulgate
    regulations to the same, that any United States financial
    institution holding funds belonging to the SPDC or the assets of
    those individuals who hold senior positions in the SPDC or its
    political arm, the Union Solidarity Development Association, shall
    promptly report those funds or assets to the Office of Foreign
    Assets Control.
      "(b) Additional Authority. - The President may take such action
    as may be necessary to impose a sanctions regime to freeze such
    funds or assets, subject to such terms and conditions as the
    President determines to be appropriate.
      "(c) Delegation. - The President may delegate the duties and
    authorities under this section to such Federal officers or other
    officials as the President deems appropriate.

      "The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States
    executive director to each appropriate international financial
    institution in which the United States participates, to oppose, and
    vote against the extension by such institution of any loan or
    financial or technical assistance to Burma until such time as the
    conditions described in section 3(a)(3) are met.

      "SEC. 6. EXPANSION OF VISA BAN.

      Liberation Movement.

      "SEC. 3. FINDINGS.
      "Congress makes the following findings:
        "(1) A comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan, as envisioned
      in the Sudan Peace Act [Pub. L. 107-245] (50 U.S.C. 1701 note)
      and the Machakos Protocol of 2002, could be in jeopardy if the
      parties do not implement and honor the agreements they have
      signed.
        "(2) Since seizing power through a military coup in 1989, the
      Government of Sudan repeatedly has attacked and dislocated
      civilian populations in southern Sudan in a coordinated policy of
      ethnic cleansing and genocide that has cost the lives of more
      than 2,000,000 people and displaced more than 4,000,000 people.
        "(3) In response to two decades of civil conflict in Sudan, the
      United States has helped to establish an internationally
      supported peace process to promote a negotiated settlement to the
      war that has resulted in a framework peace agreement, the Nairobi
      Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan, signed on
      June 5, 2004.
        "(4) At the same time that the Government of Sudan was
      negotiating for a comprehensive and all inclusive peace
      agreement, enumerated in the Nairobi Declaration on the Final
      Phase of Peace in the Sudan, it refused to engage in any
      meaningful discussion with regard to its ongoing campaign of
      ethnic cleansing and genocide in the Darfur region of western
      Sudan.
        "(5) The Government of Sudan reluctantly agreed to attend talks
      to bring peace to the Darfur region only after considerable
      international pressure and outrage was expressed through high
      level visits by Secretary of State Colin Powell and others, and
      through United Nations Security Council Resolution 1556 (July 30,
      2004).
        "(6) The Government of the United States, in both the executive
      branch and Congress, has concluded that genocide has been
      committed and may still be occurring in the Darfur region, and
      that the Government of Sudan and militias supported by the
      Government of Sudan, known as the Janjaweed, bear responsibility
      for the genocide.
        "(7) Evidence collected by international observers in the
      Darfur region between February 2003 and November 2004 indicate a
      coordinated effort to target African Sudanese civilians in a
      scorched earth policy, similar to that which was employed in
      southern Sudan, that has destroyed African Sudanese villages,
      killing and driving away their people, while Arab Sudanese
      villages have been left unscathed.
        "(8) As a result of this genocidal policy in the Darfur region,
      an estimated 70,000 people have died, more than 1,600,000 people
      have been internally displaced, and more than 200,000 people have
      been forced to flee to neighboring Chad.
        "(9) Reports further indicate the systematic rape of thousands
      of women and girls, the abduction of women and children, and the
      destruction of hundreds of ethnically African villages, including
      the poisoning of their wells and the plunder of their crops and
      cattle upon which the people of such villages sustain themselves.
        "(10) Despite the threat of international action expressed
      through United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1556 (July
      30, 2004) and 1564 (September 18, 2004), the Government of Sudan
      continues to obstruct and prevent efforts to reverse the
      catastrophic consequences that loom over the Darfur region.
        "(11) In addition to the thousands of violent deaths directly
      caused by ongoing Sudanese military and government-sponsored
      Janjaweed attacks in the Darfur region, the Government of Sudan
      has restricted access by humanitarian and human rights workers to
      the Darfur area through intimidation by military and security
      forces, and through bureaucratic and administrative obstruction,
      in an attempt to inflict the most devastating harm on those
      individuals displaced from their villages and homes without any
      means of sustenance or shelter.
        "(12) The Government of Sudan's continued support for the
      Janjaweed and their obstruction of the delivery of food, shelter,
      and medical care to the Darfur region is estimated by the World
      Health Organization to be causing up to 10,000 deaths per month
      and, should current conditions persist, is projected to escalate
      to thousands of deaths each day by December 2004.
        "(13) The Government of Chad served an important role in
      facilitating the humanitarian cease-fire (the N'Djamena Agreement
      dated April 8, 2004) for the Darfur region between the Government
      of Sudan and the two opposition rebel groups in the Darfur region
      (the JEM and the SLA), although both sides have violated the
      cease-fire agreement repeatedly.
        "(14) The people of Chad have responded courageously to the
      plight of over 200,000 Darfur refugees by providing assistance to
      them even though such assistance has adversely affected their own
      means of livelihood.
        "(15) On September 9, 2004, Secretary of State Colin Powell
      stated before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate:
      'When we reviewed the evidence compiled by our team, along with
      other information available to the State Department, we concluded
      that genocide has been committed in Darfur and that the
      Government of Sudan and the [Janjaweed] bear responsibility - and
      genocide may still be occurring.'.
        "(16) The African Union has demonstrated renewed vigor in
      regional affairs through its willingness to respond to the crisis
      in the Darfur region, by convening talks between the parties and
      deploying several hundred monitors and security forces to the
      region, as well as by recognizing the need for a far larger force
      with a broader mandate.
        "(17) The Government of Sudan's complicity in the atrocities
      and genocide in the Darfur region raises fundamental questions
      about the Government of Sudan's commitment to peace and stability
      in Sudan.

      "SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE CONFLICT IN DARFUR,
        SUDAN.
      "(a) Sudan Peace Act. - It is the sense of Congress that the
    Sudan Peace Act [Pub. L. 107-245] (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) remains
    relevant and should be extended to include the Darfur region of
    Sudan.
      "(b) Actions To Address the Conflict. - It is the sense of
    Congress that - 
        "(1) a legitimate countrywide peace in Sudan will only be
      possible if those principles enumerated in the 1948 Universal
      Declaration of Human Rights, that are affirmed in the Machakos
      Protocol of 2002 and the Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase
      of Peace in the Sudan signed on June 5, 2004, are applied to all
      of Sudan, including the Darfur region;
        "(2) the parties to the N'Djamena Agreement (the Government of
      Sudan, the JEM, and the SLA) must meet their obligations under
      that Agreement to allow safe and immediate delivery of all
      humanitarian assistance throughout the Darfur region and must
      expedite the conclusion of a political agreement to end the
      genocide and conflict in the Darfur region;
        "(3) the United States should continue to provide humanitarian
      assistance to the areas of Sudan to which the United States has
      access and, at the same time, implement a plan to provide
      assistance to the areas of Sudan to which access has been
      obstructed or denied;
        "(4) the international community, including African, Arab, and
      Muslim nations, should immediately provide resources necessary to
      save the lives of hundreds of thousands of individuals at risk as
      a result of the crisis in the Darfur region;
        "(5) the United States and the international community should -
      
          "(A) provide all necessary assistance to deploy and sustain
        an African Union Force to the Darfur region; and
          "(B) work to increase the authorized level and expand the
        mandate of such forces commensurate with the gravity and scope
        of the problem in a region the size of France;
        "(6) the President, acting through the Secretary of State and
      the Permanent Representative of the United States to the United
      Nations, should - 
          "(A) condemn any failure on the part of the Government of
        Sudan to fulfill its obligations under United Nations Security
        Council Resolutions 1556 (July 30, 2004) and 1564 (September
        18, 2004), and press the United Nations Security Council to
        respond to such failure by immediately imposing the penalties
        suggested in paragraph (14) of United Nations Security Council
        Resolution 1564;
          "(B) press the United Nations Security Council to pursue
        accountability for those individuals who are found responsible
        for orchestrating and carrying out the atrocities in the Darfur
        region, consistent with relevant United Nations Security
        Council Resolutions; and
          "(C) encourage member states of the United Nations to - 
            "(i) cease to import Sudanese oil; and
            "(ii) take the following actions against Sudanese
          Government and military officials and other individuals, who
          are planning, carrying out, or otherwise involved in the
          policy of genocide in the Darfur region, as well as their
          families, and businesses controlled by the Government of
          Sudan and the National Congress Party:
         "(I) freeze the assets held by such individuals or businesses
          in each such member state; and
         "(II) restrict the entry or transit of such officials through
          each such member state;
        "(7) the President should impose targeted sanctions, including
      a ban on travel and the freezing of assets, on those officials of
      the Government of Sudan, including military officials, and other
      individuals who have planned or carried out, or otherwise been
      involved in the policy of genocide in the Darfur region, and
      should also freeze the assets of businesses controlled by the
      Government of Sudan or the National Congress Party;
        "(8) the Government of the United States should not normalize
      relations with Sudan, including through the lifting of any
      sanctions, until the Government of Sudan agrees to, and takes
      demonstrable steps to implement, peace agreements for all areas
      of Sudan, including the Darfur region;
        "(9) those individuals found to be involved in the planning or
      carrying out of genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity
      should not hold leadership positions in the Government of Sudan
      or the coalition government established pursuant to the
      agreements reached in the Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase
      of Peace in the Sudan; and
        "(10) the Government of Sudan has a primary responsibility to
      guarantee the safety and welfare of its citizens, which includes
      allowing them access to humanitarian assistance and providing
      them protection from violence.

      "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
      "This Act may be cited as the 'Sudan Peace Act'.

      "SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
      "The Congress makes the following findings:
        "(1) The Government of Sudan has intensified its prosecution of
      the war against areas outside of its control, which has already
      cost more than 2,000,000 lives and has displaced more than
      4,000,000 people.
        "(2) A viable, comprehensive, and internationally sponsored
      peace process, protected from manipulation, presents the best
      chance for a permanent resolution of the war, protection of human
      rights, and a self-sustaining Sudan.
        "(3) Continued strengthening and reform of humanitarian relief
      operations in Sudan is an essential element in the effort to
      bring an end to the war.
        "(4) Continued leadership by the United States is critical.
        "(5) Regardless of the future political status of the areas of
      Sudan outside of the control of the Government of Sudan, the
      absence of credible civil authority and institutions is a major
      impediment to achieving self-sustenance by the Sudanese people
      and to meaningful progress toward a viable peace process. It is
      critical that credible civil authority and institutions play an
      important role in the reconstruction of post-war Sudan.
        "(6) Through the manipulation of traditional rivalries among
      peoples in areas outside of its full control, the Government of
      Sudan has used divide-and-conquer techniques effectively to
      subjugate its population. However, internationally sponsored
      reconciliation efforts have played a critical role in reducing
      human suffering and the effectiveness of this tactic.
        "(7) The Government of Sudan utilizes and organizes militias,
      Popular Defense Forces, and other irregular units for raiding and
      enslaving parties in areas outside of the control of the
      Government of Sudan in an effort to disrupt severely the ability
      of the populations in those areas to sustain themselves. The
      tactic helps minimize the Government of Sudan's accountability
      internationally.
        "(8) The Government of Sudan has repeatedly stated that it
      intends to use the expected proceeds from future oil sales to
      increase the tempo and lethality of the war against the areas
      outside of its control.
        "(9) By regularly banning air transport relief flights by the
      United Nations relief operation OLS, the Government of Sudan has
      been able to manipulate the receipt of food aid by the Sudanese
      people from the United States and other donor countries as a
      devastating weapon of war in the ongoing effort by the Government
      of Sudan to starve targeted groups and subdue areas of Sudan
      outside of the Government's control.
        "(10) The acts of the Government of Sudan, including the acts
      described in this section, constitute genocide as defined by the
      Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of
      Genocide (78 U.N.T.S. 277).
        "(11) The efforts of the United States and other donors in
      delivering relief and assistance through means outside of OLS
      have played a critical role in addressing the deficiencies in OLS
      and offset the Government of Sudan's manipulation of food
      donations to advantage in the civil war in Sudan.
        "(12) While the immediate needs of selected areas in Sudan
      facing starvation have been addressed in the near term, the
      population in areas of Sudan outside of the control of the
      Government of Sudan are still in danger of extreme disruption of
      their ability to sustain themselves.
        "(13) The Nuba Mountains and many areas in Bahr al Ghazal and
      the Upper Nile and the Blue Nile regions have been excluded
      completely from relief distribution by OLS, consequently placing
      their populations at increased risk of famine.
        "(14) At a cost which has sometimes exceeded $1,000,000 per
      day, and with a primary focus on providing only for the immediate
      food needs of the recipients, the current international relief
      operations are neither sustainable nor desirable in the long
      term.
        "(15) The ability of populations to defend themselves against
      attack in areas outside of the control of the Government of Sudan
      has been severely compromised by the disengagement of the front-
      line states of Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Uganda, fostering the
      belief among officials of the Government of Sudan that success on
      the battlefield can be achieved.
        "(16) The United States should use all means of pressure
      available to facilitate a comprehensive solution to the war in
      Sudan, including - 
          "(A) the multilateralization of economic and diplomatic tools
        to compel the Government of Sudan to enter into a good faith
        peace process;
          "(B) the support or creation of viable democratic civil
        authority and institutions in areas of Sudan outside of
        government control;
          "(C) continued active support of people-to-people
        reconciliation mechanisms and efforts in areas outside of
        government control;
          "(D) the strengthening of the mechanisms to provide
        humanitarian relief to those areas; and
          "(E) cooperation among the trading partners of the United
        States and within multilateral institutions toward those ends.

        "(1) condemns - 
          "(A) violations of human rights on all sides of the conflict
        in Sudan;
          "(B) the Government of Sudan's overall human rights record,
        with regard to both the prosecution of the war and the denial
        of basic human and political rights to all Sudanese;
          "(C) the ongoing slave trade in Sudan and the role of the
        Government of Sudan in abetting and tolerating the practice;

      raiding and slaving parties is a tool for creating food shortages
      and is used as a systematic means to destroy the societies,
      culture, and economies of the Dinka, Nuer, and Nuba peoples in a
      policy of low-intensity ethnic cleansing.

        "(1) recognizes that - 
          "(A) a single, viable internationally and regionally
        sanctioned peace process holds the greatest opportunity to
        promote a negotiated, peaceful settlement to the war in Sudan;
        and
          "(B) resolution to the conflict in Sudan is best made through
        a peace process based on the Declaration of Principles reached
        in Nairobi, Kenya, on July 20, 1994, and on the Machakos
        Protocol in July 2002; and
        "(2) commends the efforts of Special Presidential Envoy,
      Senator Danforth and his team in working to assist the parties to

      "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
      "This Act may be cited as the 'Iran Sanctions Act of 1996'.

      "SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
      "The Congress makes the following findings:
        "(1) The efforts of the Government of Iran to acquire weapons
      of mass destruction and the means to deliver them and its support
      of acts of international terrorism endanger the national security
      and foreign policy interests of the United States and those
      countries with which the United States shares common strategic
      and foreign policy objectives.
        "(2) The objective of preventing the proliferation of weapons
      of mass destruction and acts of international terrorism through
      existing multilateral and bilateral initiatives requires
      additional efforts to deny Iran the financial means to sustain
      its nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile weapons programs.
        "(3) The Government of Iran uses its diplomatic facilities and
      quasi-governmental institutions outside of Iran to promote acts
      of international terrorism and assist its nuclear, chemical,
      biological, and missile weapons programs.

      "SEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY.
      "The Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States
    to deny Iran the ability to support acts of international terrorism
    and to fund the development and acquisition of weapons of mass
    destruction and the means to deliver them by limiting the
    development of Iran's ability to explore for, extract, refine, or
    transport by pipeline petroleum resources of Iran.

      "SEC. 4. MULTILATERAL REGIME.
      "(a) Multilateral Negotiations. - In order to further the
    objectives of section 3, the Congress urges the President to
    commence immediately diplomatic efforts, both in appropriate
    international fora such as the United Nations, and bilaterally with
    allies of the United States, to establish a multilateral sanctions
    regime against Iran, including provisions limiting the development
    of petroleum resources, that will inhibit Iran's efforts to carry
    out activities described in section 2.
      "(b) Reports to Congress. - The President shall report to the
    appropriate congressional committees, not later than 1 year after
    the date of the enactment of this Act [Aug. 5, 1996], and
    periodically thereafter, on the extent that diplomatic efforts
    described in subsection (a) have been successful. Each report shall
    include - 
        "(1) the countries that have agreed to undertake measures to
      further the objectives of section 3 with respect to Iran, and a
      description of those measures; and
        "(2) the countries that have not agreed to measures described
      in paragraph (1), and, with respect to those countries, other
      measures (in addition to that provided in subsection (d)) the
      President recommends that the United States take to further the
      objectives of section 3 with respect to Iran.
      "(c) Waiver. - 
        "(1) In general. - The President may, on a case by case basis,
      waive for a period of not more than six months the application of
      section 5(a) with respect to a national of a country, if the
      President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees
      at least 30 days before such waiver is to take effect that such
      waiver is vital to the national security interests of the United
      States.
        "(2) Subsequent renewal of waiver. - If the President
      determines that, in accordance with paragraph (1), such a waiver
      is appropriate, the President may, at the conclusion of the
      period of a waiver under paragraph (1), renew such waiver for
      subsequent periods of not more than six months each.
      "(d) Enhanced Sanction. - 
        "(1) Sanction. - With respect to nationals of countries except
      those with respect to which the President has exercised the
      waiver authority of subsection (c), at any time after the first
      report is required to be submitted under subsection (b), section
      5(a) shall be applied by substituting '$20,000,000' for
      '$40,000,000' each place it appears, and by substituting
      '$5,000,000' for '$10,000,000'.
        "(2) Report to congress. - The President shall report to the
      appropriate congressional committees any country with respect to
      which paragraph (1) applies.
      "(e) Interim Report on Multilateral Sanctions; Monitoring. - The
    President, not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment
    of this Act, shall report to the appropriate congressional

      Republic of Korea, Australia, Israel, or Japan have legislative
      or administrative standards providing for the imposition of trade
      sanctions on persons or their affiliates doing business or having
      investments in Iran or Libya;
        "(2) the extent and duration of each instance of the
      application of such sanctions; and
        "(3) the disposition of any decision with respect to such
      sanctions by the World Trade Organization or its predecessor
      organization.
      "(f) Investigations. - 
        "(1) In general. - The President should initiate an
      investigation into the possible imposition of sanctions under
      section 5(a) against a person upon receipt by the United States
      of credible information indicating that such person is engaged in
      investment activity in Iran as described in such section.
        "(2) Determination and notification. - Not later than 180 days
      after an investigation is initiated in accordance with paragraph
      (1), the President should determine, pursuant to section 5(a), if
      a person has engaged in investment activity in Iran as described
      in such section and shall notify the appropriate congressional
      committees of the basis for any such determination.

      "(b) Mandatory Sanctions With Respect to Development of Weapons
    of Mass Destruction or Other Military Capabilities. - The President
    shall impose two or more of the sanctions described in paragraphs

    5, 1996], exported, transferred, or otherwise provided to Iran any
    goods, services, technology, or other items knowing that the

      weapons or related technologies; or

      "(b) Import Sanctions. - If the President considers that the

    interest, the President may prohibit, for such a period of time as
    he considers appropriate, the importation into the United States of

        VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.
      "(a) Iraq's Violations of International Law. - The Congress
    determines that - 
        "(1) the Government of Iraq has demonstrated repeated and
      blatant disregard for its obligations under international law by
      violating the Charter of the United Nations, the Protocol for the
      Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other
      Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare (done at Geneva,
      June 17, 1925), as well as other international treaties;
        "(2) the Government of Iraq is a party to the International
      Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International
      Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights and is
      obligated under the Covenants, as well as the Universal
      Declaration of Human Rights, to respect internationally
      recognized human rights;
        "(3) the State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights
      Practices for 1989 again characterizes Iraq's human rights record
      as 'abysmal';
        "(4) Amnesty International, Middle East Watch, and other
      independent human rights organizations have documented extensive,
      systematic, and continuing human rights abuses by the Government
      of Iraq, including summary executions, mass political killings,
      disappearances, widespread use of torture, arbitrary arrests and
      prolonged detention without trial of thousands of political
      opponents, forced relocation and deportation, denial of nearly
      all civil and political rights such as freedom of association,
      assembly, speech, and the press, and the imprisonment, torture,
      and execution of children;
        "(5) since 1987, the Government of Iraq has intensified its
      severe repression of the Kurdish minority of Iraq, deliberately
      destroyed more than 3,000 villages and towns in the Kurdish
      regions, and forcibly expelled more than 500,000 people, thus
      effectively depopulating the rural areas of Iraqi Kurdistan;
        "(6) Iraq has blatantly violated international law by
      initiating use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war;
        "(7) Iraq has also violated international law by using chemical
      weapons against its own Kurdish citizens, resulting in tens of
      thousands of deaths and more than 65,000 refugees;
        "(8) Iraq continues to expand its chemical weapons capability,
      and President Saddam Hussein has threatened to use chemical
      weapons against other nations;
        "(9) persuasive evidence exists that Iraq is developing
      biological weapons in violation of international law;
        "(10) there are strong indications that Iraq has taken steps to
      produce nuclear weapons and has attempted to smuggle from the
      United States, in violation of United States law, components for
      triggering devices used in nuclear warheads whose manufacture
      would contravene the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
      Weapons, to which Iraq is a party; and
        "(11) Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has threatened to use
      terrorism against other nations in violation of international law
      and has increased Iraq's support for the Palestine Liberation
      Organization and other Palestinian groups that have conducted
      terrorist acts.
      "(b) Human Rights Violations. - The Congress determines that the
    Government of Iraq is engaged in a consistent pattern of gross
    violations of internationally recognized human rights. All
    provisions of law that impose sanctions against a country whose
    government is engaged in a consistent pattern of gross violations
    of internationally recognized human rights shall be fully enforced
    against Iraq.
      "(c) Support for International Terrorism. - (1) The Congress
    determines that Iraq is a country which has repeatedly provided
    support for acts of international terrorism, a country which grants
    sanctuary from prosecution to individuals or groups which have
    committed an act of international terrorism, and a country which
    otherwise supports international terrorism. The provisions of law
    specified in paragraph (2) and all other provisions of law that
    impose sanctions against a country which has repeatedly provided
    support for acts of international terrorism, which grants sanctuary
    from prosecution to an individual or group which has committed an
    act of international terrorism, or which otherwise supports
    international terrorism shall be fully enforced against Iraq.
      "(2) The provisions of law referred to in paragraph (1) are - 
        "(A) section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C.
      2780];
        "(B) section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22
      U.S.C. 2371];
        "(C) sections 555 and 556 of this Act [104 Stat. 2021, 2022]
      (and the corresponding sections of predecessor foreign operations
      appropriations Acts); and
        "(D) section 555 of the International Security and Development
      Cooperation Act of 1985 [99 Stat. 227].
      "(d) Multilateral Cooperation. - The Congress calls on the
    President to seek multilateral cooperation - 
        "(1) to deny dangerous technologies to Iraq;
        "(2) to induce Iraq to respect internationally recognized human
      rights; and
        "(3) to induce Iraq to allow appropriate international
      humanitarian and human rights organizations to have access to
      Iraq and Kuwait, including the areas in northern Iraq
      traditionally inhabited by Kurds.

      (1) At the times and to the extent specified in section 1701 of
    this title, the President may, under such regulations as he may
    prescribe, by means of instructions, licenses, or otherwise - 
        (A) investigate, regulate, or prohibit - 
          (i) any transactions in foreign exchange,
          (ii) transfers of credit or payments between, by, through, or
        to any banking institution, to the extent that such transfers
        or payments involve any interest of any foreign country or a
        national thereof,
          (iii) the importing or exporting of currency or securities,

      by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the
      jurisdiction of the United States;
        (B) investigate, block during the pendency of an investigation,
      regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit,
      any acquisition, holding, withholding, use, transfer, withdrawal,
      transportation, importation or exportation of, or dealing in, or
      exercising any right, power, or privilege with respect to, or
      transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country
      or a national thereof has any interest by any person, or with
      respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the
      United States; and.(!1)

        (C) when the United States is engaged in armed hostilities or
      has been attacked by a foreign country or foreign nationals,
      confiscate any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the
      United States, of any foreign person, foreign organization, or
      foreign country that he determines has planned, authorized,
      aided, or engaged in such hostilities or attacks against the
      United States; and all right, title, and interest in any property
      so confiscated shall vest, when, as, and upon the terms directed
      by the President, in such agency or person as the President may
      designate from time to time, and upon such terms and conditions
      as the President may prescribe, such interest or property shall
      be held, used, administered, liquidated, sold, or otherwise dealt
      with in the interest of and for the benefit of the United States,
      and such designated agency or person may perform any and all acts
      incident to the accomplishment or furtherance of these purposes.

      (2) In exercising the authorities granted by paragraph (1), the
    President may require any person to keep a full record of, and to
    furnish under oath, in the form of reports or otherwise, complete
    information relative to any act or transaction referred to in
    paragraph (1) either before, during, or after the completion
    thereof, or relative to any interest in foreign property, or
    relative to any property in which any foreign country or any
    national thereof has or has had any interest, or as may be
    otherwise necessary to enforce the provisions of such paragraph. In
    any case in which a report by a person could be required under this
    paragraph, the President may require the production of any books of
    account, records, contracts, letters, memoranda, or other papers,
    in the custody or control of such person.
      (3) Compliance with any regulation, instruction, or direction
    issued under this chapter shall to the extent thereof be a full
    acquittance and discharge for all purposes of the obligation of the
    person making the same. No person shall be held liable in any court
    for or with respect to anything done or omitted in good faith in
    connection with the administration of, or pursuant to and in
    reliance on, this chapter, or any regulation, instruction, or
    direction issued under this chapter.
    (b) Exceptions to grant of authority
      The authority granted to the President by this section does not
    include the authority to regulate or prohibit, directly or
    indirectly - 
        (1) any postal, telegraphic, telephonic, or other personal
      communication, which does not involve a transfer of anything of
      value;
        (2) donations, by persons subject to the jurisdiction of the
      United States, of articles, such as food, clothing, and medicine,
      intended to be used to relieve human suffering, except to the
      extent that the President determines that such donations (A)
      would seriously impair his ability to deal with any national
      emergency declared under section 1701 of this title, (B) are in
      response to coercion against the proposed recipient or donor, or
      (C) would endanger Armed Forces of the United States which are
      engaged in hostilities or are in a situation where imminent
      involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the
      circumstances; or (!2)

        (3) the importation from any country, or the exportation to any
      country, whether commercial or otherwise, regardless of format or
      medium of transmission, of any information or informational
      materials, including but not limited to, publications, films,
      posters, phonograph records, photographs, microfilms, microfiche,
      tapes, compact disks, CD ROMs, artworks, and news wire feeds. The
      exports exempted from regulation or prohibition by this paragraph
      do not include those which are otherwise controlled for export
      under section 2404 of the Appendix to this title, or under
      section 2405 of the Appendix to this title to the extent that
      such controls promote the nonproliferation or antiterrorism
      policies of the United States, or with respect to which acts are
      prohibited by chapter 37 of title 18; or
        (4) any transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from
      any country, including importation of accompanied baggage for
      personal use, maintenance within any country including payment of
      living expenses and acquisition of goods or services for personal
      use, and arrangement or facilitation of such travel including
      nonscheduled air, sea, or land voyages.
    (c) Classified information
      In any judicial review of a determination made under this
    section, if the determination was based on classified information
    (as defined in section 1(a) of the Classified Information
    Procedures Act) such information may be submitted to the reviewing
    court ex parte and in camera. This subsection does not confer or
    imply any right to judicial review.

    be confiscated and vested.
      Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to perform,

    notwithstanding the termination pursuant to the National
    Emergencies Act [50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] of a national emergency
    declared for purposes of this chapter, any authorities granted by
    this chapter, which are exercised on the date of such termination
    on the basis of such national emergency to prohibit transactions
    involving property in which a foreign country or national thereof
    has any interest, may continue to be so exercised to prohibit
    transactions involving that property if the President determines
    that the continuation of such prohibition with respect to that
    property is necessary on account of claims involving such country
    or its nationals.
      (2) Notwithstanding the termination of the authorities described
    in section 101(b) of this Act, any such authorities, which are
    exercised with respect to a country on the date of such termination
    to prohibit transactions involving any property in which such
    country or any national thereof has any interest, may continue to
    be exercised to prohibit transactions involving that property if

    with respect to that property is necessary on account of claims
    involving such country or its nationals.
    (b) Congressional termination of national emergencies by concurrent
      resolution
      The authorities described in subsection (a)(1) of this section

    emergency is terminated by the Congress by concurrent resolution
    pursuant to section 202 of the National Emergencies Act [50 U.S.C.

    provisions of section 101(a) [50 U.S.C. 1601(a)] and of title II
    [50 U.S.C. 1621 et seq.] of the National Emergencies Act to the

    CHAPTER 36 - FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE
    SUBCHAPTER I - ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1802. Electronic surveillance authorization without court
      order; certification by Attorney General; reports to
      Congressional committees; transmittal under seal; duties and
      compensation of communication common carrier; applications;
      jurisdiction of court

-STATUTE-
      (a)(1) Notwithstanding any other law, the President, through the
    Attorney General, may authorize electronic surveillance without a
    court order under this subchapter to acquire foreign intelligence
    information for periods of up to one year if the Attorney General
    certifies in writing under oath that - 
        (A) the electronic surveillance is solely directed at - 
          (i) the acquisition of the contents of communications
        transmitted by means of communications used exclusively between
        or among foreign powers, as defined in section 1801(a)(1), (2),
        or (3) of this title; or
          (ii) the acquisition of technical intelligence, other than
        the spoken communications of individuals, from property or
        premises under the open and exclusive control of a foreign
        power, as defined in section 1801(a)(1), (2), or (3) of this
        title;

        (B) there is no substantial likelihood that the surveillance
      will acquire the contents of any communication to which a United
      States person is a party; and
        (C) the proposed minimization procedures with respect to such
      surveillance meet the definition of minimization procedures under
      section 1801(h) of this title; and

    if the Attorney General reports such minimization procedures and
    any changes thereto to the House Permanent Select Committee on
    Intelligence and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence at
    least thirty days prior to their effective date, unless the
    Attorney General determines immediate action is required and
    notifies the committees immediately of such minimization procedures
    and the reason for their becoming effective immediately.
      (2) An electronic surveillance authorized by this subsection may
    be conducted only in accordance with the Attorney General's
    certification and the minimization procedures adopted by him. The
    Attorney General shall assess compliance with such procedures and
    shall report such assessments to the House Permanent Select
    Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Select Committee on
    Intelligence under the provisions of section 1808(a) of this title.
      (3) The Attorney General shall immediately transmit under seal to
    the court established under section 1803(a) of this title a copy of
    his certification. Such certification shall be maintained under
    security measures established by the Chief Justice with the
    concurrence of the Attorney General, in consultation with the
    Director of National Intelligence, and shall remain sealed unless -
    
        (A) an application for a court order with respect to the
      surveillance is made under sections 1801(h)(4) and 1804 of this
      title; or
        (B) the certification is necessary to determine the legality of
      the surveillance under section 1806(f) of this title.

      (4) With respect to electronic surveillance authorized by this
    subsection, the Attorney General may direct a specified
    communication common carrier to - 
        (A) furnish all information, facilities, or technical
      assistance necessary to accomplish the electronic surveillance in
      such a manner as will protect its secrecy and produce a minimum
      of interference with the services that such carrier is providing
      its customers; and
        (B) maintain under security procedures approved by the Attorney
      General and the Director of National Intelligence any records
      concerning the surveillance or the aid furnished which such
      carrier wishes to retain.

    The Government shall compensate, at the prevailing rate, such
    carrier for furnishing such aid.
      (b) Applications for a court order under this subchapter are
    authorized if the President has, by written authorization,
    empowered the Attorney General to approve applications to the court
    having jurisdiction under section 1803 of this title, and a judge
    to whom an application is made may, notwithstanding any other law,
    grant an order, in conformity with section 1805 of this title,
    approving electronic surveillance of a foreign power or an agent of
    a foreign power for the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence
    information, except that the court shall not have jurisdiction to
    grant any order approving electronic surveillance directed solely
    as described in paragraph (1)(A) of subsection (a) of this section
    unless such surveillance may involve the acquisition of
    communications of any United States person.

      transmittal to court of review
      The Chief Justice of the United States shall publicly designate
    11 district court judges from seven of the United States judicial
    circuits of whom no fewer than 3 shall reside within 20 miles of
    the District of Columbia who shall constitute a court which shall
    have jurisdiction to hear applications for and grant orders
    approving electronic surveillance anywhere within the United States
    under the procedures set forth in this chapter, except that no
    judge designated under this subsection shall hear the same
    application for electronic surveillance under this chapter which
    has been denied previously by another judge designated under this
    subsection. If any judge so designated denies an application for an
    order authorizing electronic surveillance under this chapter, such
    judge shall provide immediately for the record a written statement
    of each reason of his decision and, on motion of the United States,
    the record shall be transmitted, under seal, to the court of review
    established in subsection (b) of this section.
    (b) Court of review; record, transmittal to Supreme Court
      The Chief Justice shall publicly designate three judges, one of
    whom shall be publicly designated as the presiding judge, from the
    United States district courts or courts of appeals who together
    shall comprise a court of review which shall have jurisdiction to
    review the denial of any application made under this chapter. If
    such court determines that the application was properly denied, the
    court shall immediately provide for the record a written statement
    of each reason for its decision and, on petition of the United
    States for a writ of certiorari, the record shall be transmitted
    under seal to the Supreme Court, which shall have jurisdiction to
    review such decision.
    (c) Expeditious conduct of proceedings; security measures for
      maintenance of records
      Proceedings under this chapter shall be conducted as
    expeditiously as possible. The record of proceedings under this
    chapter, including applications made and orders granted, shall be
    maintained under security measures established by the Chief Justice
    in consultation with the Attorney General and the Director of
    National Intelligence.
    (d) Tenure
      Each judge designated under this section shall so serve for a
    maximum of seven years and shall not be eligible for redesignation,
    except that the judges first designated under subsection (a) of
    this section shall be designated for terms of from one to seven
    years so that one term expires each year, and that judges first
    designated under subsection (b) of this section shall be designated
    for terms of three, five, and seven years.
    (e) Jurisdiction and procedures for review of petitions
      (1) Three judges designated under subsection (a) who reside
    within 20 miles of the District of Columbia, or, if all of such
    judges are unavailable, other judges of the court established under
    subsection (a) as may be designated by the presiding judge of such
    court, shall comprise a petition review pool which shall have
    jurisdiction to review petitions filed pursuant to section
    1861(f)(1) of this title.
      (2) Not later than 60 days after March 9, 2006, the court
    established under subsection (a) shall adopt and, consistent with
    the protection of national security, publish procedures for the
    review of petitions filed pursuant to section 1861(f)(1) of this
    title by the panel established under paragraph (1). Such procedures
    shall provide that review of a petition shall be conducted in
    camera and shall also provide for the designation of an acting
    presiding judge.
    (f) Establishment and transmittal of rules and procedures
      (1) The courts established pursuant to subsections (a) and (b)
    may establish such rules and procedures, and take such actions, as
    are reasonably necessary to administer their responsibilities under
    this chapter.

    Sec. 1805. Issuance of order

-STATUTE-
    (a) Necessary findings

        power or an agent of a foreign power: Provided, That no United
        States person may be considered a foreign power or an agent of

        States; and
          (B) each of the facilities or places at which the electronic
        surveillance is directed is being used, or is about to be used,

        (4) the proposed minimization procedures meet the definition of
      minimization procedures under section 1801(h) of this title; and
        (5) the application which has been filed contains all
      statements and certifications required by section 1804 of this
      title and, if the target is a United States person, the
      certification or certifications are not clearly erroneous on the
      basis of the statement made under section 1804(a)(7)(E) of this
      title and any other information furnished under section 1804(d)
      of this title.
    (b) Determination of probable cause
      In determining whether or not probable cause exists for purposes
    of an order under subsection (a)(3) of this section, a judge may
    consider past activities of the target, as well as facts and
    circumstances relating to current or future activities of the
    target.
    (c) Specifications and directions of orders
      (1) Specifications. - An order approving an electronic
    surveillance under this section shall specify -

        effected and whether physical entry will be used to effect the
        surveillance;
          (E) the period of time during which the electronic
        surveillance is approved; and
          (F) whenever more than one electronic, mechanical, or other
        surveillance device is to be used under the order, the
        authorized coverage of the devices involved and what
        minimization procedures shall apply to information subject to
        acquisition by each device.

        (2) Directions. - An order approving an electronic surveillance
      under this section shall direct - 
          (A) that the minimization procedures be followed;
          (B) that, upon the request of the applicant, a specified
        communication or other common carrier, landlord, custodian, or
        other specified person, or in circumstances where the Court
        finds, based upon specific facts provided in the application,
        that the actions of the target of the application may have the
        effect of thwarting the identification of a specified person,
        such other persons, furnish the applicant forthwith all
        information, facilities, or technical assistance necessary to
        accomplish the electronic surveillance in such a manner as will
        protect its secrecy and produce a minimum of interference with
        the services that such carrier, landlord, custodian, or other
        person is providing that target of electronic surveillance;
          (C) that such carrier, landlord, custodian, or other person
        maintain under security procedures approved by the Attorney
        General and the Director of National Intelligence any records
        concerning the surveillance or the aid furnished that such
        person wishes to retain; and
          (D) that the applicant compensate, at the prevailing rate,
        such carrier, landlord, custodian, or other person for
        furnishing such aid.

        (3) Special directions for certain orders. - An order approving
      an electronic surveillance under this section in circumstances
      where the nature and location of each of the facilities or places
      at which the surveillance will be directed is unknown shall
      direct the applicant to provide notice to the court within ten
      days after the date on which surveillance begins to be directed
      at any new facility or place, unless the court finds good cause
      to justify a longer period of up to 60 days, of - 
          (A) the nature and location of each new facility or place at
        which the electronic surveillance is directed;
          (B) the facts and circumstances relied upon by the applicant
        to justify the applicant's belief that each new facility or
        place at which the electronic surveillance is directed is or
        was being used, or is about to be used, by the target of the
        surveillance;
          (C) a statement of any proposed minimization procedures that
        differ from those contained in the original application or
        order, that may be necessitated by a change in the facility or
        place at which the electronic surveillance is directed; and
          (D) the total number of electronic surveillances that have
        been or are being conducted under the authority of the order.
    (d) Exclusion of certain information respecting foreign power
      targets
      Whenever the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign
    power, as defined in section 1801(a)(1), (2), or (3) of this title,
    and each of the facilities or places at which the surveillance is
    directed is owned, leased, or exclusively used by that foreign
    power, the order need not contain the information required by
    subparagraphs (C), (D), and (F) of subsection (c)(1) of this
    section, but shall generally describe the information sought, the
    communications or activities to be subjected to the surveillance,
    and the type of electronic surveillance involved, including whether
    physical entry is required.
    (e) Duration of order; extensions; review of circumstances under
      which information was acquired, retained or disseminated
      (1) An order issued under this section may approve an electronic
    surveillance for the period necessary to achieve its purpose, or
    for ninety days, whichever is less, except that (A) an order under
    this section shall approve an electronic surveillance targeted
    against a foreign power, as defined in section 1801(a)(1), (2), or
    (3) of this title, for the period specified in the application or
    for one year, whichever is less, and (B) an order under this
    chapter for a surveillance targeted against an agent of a foreign
    power who is not a United States person may be for the period
    specified in the application or for 120 days, whichever is less.
      (2) Extensions of an order issued under this subchapter may be
    granted on the same basis as an original order upon an application
    for an extension and new findings made in the same manner as
    required for an original order, except that (A) an extension of an
    order under this chapter for a surveillance targeted against a
    foreign power, as defined in section 1801(a)(5) or (6) of this
    title, or against a foreign power as defined in section 1801(a)(4)
    of this title that is not a United States person, may be for a
    period not to exceed one year if the judge finds probable cause to
    believe that no communication of any individual United States
    person will be acquired during the period, and (B) an extension of
    an order under this chapter for a surveillance targeted against an
    agent of a foreign power who is not a United States person may be
    for a period not to exceed 1 year.
      (3) At or before the end of the period of time for which
    electronic surveillance is approved by an order or an extension,
    the judge may assess compliance with the minimization procedures by
    reviewing the circumstances under which information concerning
    United States persons was acquired, retained, or disseminated.
    (f) Emergency orders
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, when the
    Attorney General reasonably determines that - 
        (1) an emergency situation exists with respect to the
      employment of electronic surveillance to obtain foreign
      intelligence information before an order authorizing such
      surveillance can with due diligence be obtained; and
        (2) the factual basis for issuance of an order under this
      subchapter to approve such surveillance exists;

    he may authorize the emergency employment of electronic
    surveillance if a judge having jurisdiction under section 1803 of
    this title is informed by the Attorney General or his designee at
    the time of such authorization that the decision has been made to
    employ emergency electronic surveillance and if an application in
    accordance with this subchapter is made to that judge as soon as
    practicable, but not more than 72 hours after the Attorney General
    authorizes such surveillance. If the Attorney General authorizes
    such emergency employment of electronic surveillance, he shall
    require that the minimization procedures required by this
    subchapter for the issuance of a judicial order be followed. In the
    absence of a judicial order approving such electronic surveillance,
    the surveillance shall terminate when the information sought is
    obtained, when the application for the order is denied, or after
    the expiration of 72 hours from the time of authorization by the
    Attorney General, whichever is earliest. In the event that such
    application for approval is denied, or in any other case where the
    electronic surveillance is terminated and no order is issued
    approving the surveillance, no information obtained or evidence
    derived from such surveillance shall be received in evidence or
    otherwise disclosed in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in
    or before any court, grand jury, department, office, agency,
    regulatory body, legislative committee, or other authority of the
    United States, a State, or political subdivision thereof, and no
    information concerning any United States person acquired from such
    surveillance shall subsequently be used or disclosed in any other
    manner by Federal officers or employees without the consent of such
    person, except with the approval of the Attorney General if the
    information indicates a threat of death or serious bodily harm to
    any person. A denial of the application made under this subsection
    may be reviewed as provided in section 1803 of this title.
    (g) Testing of electronic equipment; discovering unauthorized
      electronic surveillance; training of intelligence personnel
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, officers,
    employees, or agents of the United States are authorized in the
    normal course of their official duties to conduct electronic
    surveillance not targeted against the communications of any
    particular person or persons, under procedures approved by the
    Attorney General, solely to - 
        (1) test the capability of electronic equipment, if - 
          (A) it is not reasonable to obtain the consent of the persons
        incidentally subjected to the surveillance;
          (B) the test is limited in extent and duration to that
        necessary to determine the capability of the equipment;
          (C) the contents of any communication acquired are retained
        and used only for the purpose of determining the capability of
        the equipment, are disclosed only to test personnel, and are
        destroyed before or immediately upon completion of the test;
        and:
          (D) Provided, That the test may exceed ninety days only with
        the prior approval of the Attorney General;

        (2) determine the existence and capability of electronic
      surveillance equipment being used by persons not authorized to
      conduct electronic surveillance, if - 
          (A) it is not reasonable to obtain the consent of persons
        incidentally subjected to the surveillance;
          (B) such electronic surveillance is limited in extent and
        duration to that necessary to determine the existence and
        capability of such equipment; and
          (C) any information acquired by such surveillance is used
        only to enforce chapter 119 of title 18, or section 605 of
        title 47, or to protect information from unauthorized
        surveillance; or

        (3) train intelligence personnel in the use of electronic
      surveillance equipment, if - 
          (A) it is not reasonable to - 
            (i) obtain the consent of the persons incidentally
          subjected to the surveillance;
            (ii) train persons in the course of surveillances otherwise
          authorized by this subchapter; or
            (iii) train persons in the use of such equipment without
          engaging in electronic surveillance;

          (B) such electronic surveillance is limited in extent and
        duration to that necessary to train the personnel in the use of
        the equipment; and
          (C) no contents of any communication acquired are retained or
        disseminated for any purpose, but are destroyed as soon as
        reasonably possible.
    (h) Retention of certifications, applications and orders
      Certifications made by the Attorney General pursuant to section
    1802(a) of this title and applications made and orders granted
    under this subchapter shall be retained for a period of at least
    ten years from the date of the certification or application.
    (i) Bar to legal action
      No cause of action shall lie in any court against any provider of
    a wire or electronic communication service, landlord, custodian, or
    other person (including any officer, employee, agent, or other
    specified person thereof) that furnishes any information,
    facilities, or technical assistance in accordance with a court
    order or request for emergency assistance under this chapter for
    electronic surveillance or physical search.

    proceeding in or before any court, department, officer, agency,
    regulatory body, or other authority of the United States, against
    an aggrieved person, any information obtained or derived from an
    electronic surveillance of that aggrieved person pursuant to the
    authority of this subchapter, the Government shall, prior to the
    trial, hearing, or other proceeding or at a reasonable time prior
    to an effort to so disclose or so use that information or submit it
    in evidence, notify the aggrieved person and the court or other
    authority in which the information is to be disclosed or used that
    the Government intends to so disclose or so use such information.
    (d) Notification by States or political subdivisions
      Whenever any State or political subdivision thereof intends to
    enter into evidence or otherwise use or disclose in any trial,
    hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, department,
    officer, agency, regulatory body, or other authority of a State or
    a political subdivision thereof, against an aggrieved person any
    information obtained or derived from an electronic surveillance of
    that aggrieved person pursuant to the authority of this subchapter,
    the State or political subdivision thereof shall notify the
    aggrieved person, the court or other authority in which the
    information is to be disclosed or used, and the Attorney General
    that the State or political subdivision thereof intends to so
    disclose or so use such information.
    (e) Motion to suppress
      Any person against whom evidence obtained or derived from an
    electronic surveillance to which he is an aggrieved person is to
    be, or has been, introduced or otherwise used or disclosed in any
    trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court,
    department, officer, agency, regulatory body, or other authority of
    the United States, a State, or a political subdivision thereof, may
    move to suppress the evidence obtained or derived from such
    electronic surveillance on the grounds that - 
        (1) the information was unlawfully acquired; or
        (2) the surveillance was not made in conformity with an order
      of authorization or approval.

    Such a motion shall be made before the trial, hearing, or other
    proceeding unless there was no opportunity to make such a motion or
    the person was not aware of the grounds of the motion.
    (f) In camera and ex parte review by district court
      Whenever a court or other authority is notified pursuant to
    subsection (c) or (d) of this section, or whenever a motion is made
    pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, or whenever any motion
    or request is made by an aggrieved person pursuant to any other
    statute or rule of the United States or any State before any court
    or other authority of the United States or any State to discover or
    obtain applications or orders or other materials relating to
    electronic surveillance or to discover, obtain, or suppress
    evidence or information obtained or derived from electronic
    surveillance under this chapter, the United States district court
    or, where the motion is made before another authority, the United
    States district court in the same district as the authority, shall,
    notwithstanding any other law, if the Attorney General files an
    affidavit under oath that disclosure or an adversary hearing would
    harm the national security of the United States, review in camera
    and ex parte the application, order, and such other materials
    relating to the surveillance as may be necessary to determine
    whether the surveillance of the aggrieved person was lawfully
    authorized and conducted. In making this determination, the court
    may disclose to the aggrieved person, under appropriate security
    procedures and protective orders, portions of the application,
    order, or other materials relating to the surveillance only where
    such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of
    the legality of the surveillance.
    (g) Suppression of evidence; denial of motion
      If the United States district court pursuant to subsection (f) of
    this section determines that the surveillance was not lawfully
    authorized or conducted, it shall, in accordance with the
    requirements of law, suppress the evidence which was unlawfully
    obtained or derived from electronic surveillance of the aggrieved
    person or otherwise grant the motion of the aggrieved person. If
    the court determines that the surveillance was lawfully authorized
    and conducted, it shall deny the motion of the aggrieved person
    except to the extent that due process requires discovery or
    disclosure.
    (h) Finality of orders
      Orders granting motions or requests under subsection (g) of this
    section, decisions under this section that electronic surveillance
    was not lawfully authorized or conducted, and orders of the United
    States district court requiring review or granting disclosure of
    applications, orders, or other materials relating to a surveillance
    shall be final orders and binding upon all courts of the United
    States and the several States except a United States court of
    appeals and the Supreme Court.
    (i) Destruction of unintentionally acquired information
      In circumstances involving the unintentional acquisition by an
    electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device of the
    contents of any radio communication, under circumstances in which a
    person has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant would
    be required for law enforcement purposes, and if both the sender
    and all intended recipients are located within the United States,
    such contents shall be destroyed upon recognition, unless the
    Attorney General determines that the contents indicate a threat of
    death or serious bodily harm to any person.
    (j) Notification of emergency employment of electronic
      surveillance; contents; postponement, suspension or elimination
      If an emergency employment of electronic surveillance is
    authorized under section 1805(e) (!1) of this title and a
    subsequent order approving the surveillance is not obtained, the
    judge shall cause to be served on any United States person named in
    the application and on such other United States persons subject to
    electronic surveillance as the judge may determine in his
    discretion it is in the interest of justice to serve, notice of - 

        (1) the fact of the application;
        (2) the period of the surveillance; and
        (3) the fact that during the period information was or was not
      obtained.

    On an ex parte showing of good cause to the judge the serving of
    the notice required by this subsection may be postponed or
    suspended for a period not to exceed ninety days. Thereafter, on a
    further ex parte showing of good cause, the court shall forego
    ordering the serving of the notice required under this subsection.
    (k) Coordination with law enforcement on national security matters
      (1) Federal officers who conduct electronic surveillance to
    acquire foreign intelligence information under this subchapter may
    consult with Federal law enforcement officers or law enforcement
    personnel of a State or political subdivision of a State (including
    the chief executive officer of that State or political subdivision
    who has the authority to appoint or direct the chief law
    enforcement officer of that State or political subdivision) to
    coordinate efforts to investigate or protect against - 
        (A) actual or potential attack or other grave hostile acts of a
      foreign power or an agent of a foreign power;
        (B) sabotage or international terrorism by a foreign power or
      an agent of a foreign power; or
        (C) clandestine intelligence activities by an intelligence
      service or network of a foreign power or by an agent of a foreign
      power.

      (2) Coordination authorized under paragraph (1) shall not
    preclude the certification required by section 1804(a)(7)(B) of
    this title or the entry of an order under section 1805 of this
    title.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1822. Authorization of physical searches for foreign
      intelligence purposes

-STATUTE-
    (a) Presidential authorization
      (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the President,
    acting through the Attorney General, may authorize physical
    searches without a court order under this subchapter to acquire
    foreign intelligence information for periods of up to one year if -
    
        (A) the Attorney General certifies in writing under oath that -
      
          (i) the physical search is solely directed at premises,
        information, material, or property used exclusively by, or
        under the open and exclusive control of, a foreign power or
        powers (as defined in section 1801(a)(1), (2), or (3) of this
        title);
          (ii) there is no substantial likelihood that the physical
        search will involve the premises, information, material, or
        property of a United States person; and
          (iii) the proposed minimization procedures with respect to
        such physical search meet the definition of minimization
        procedures under paragraphs (1) through (4) (!1) of section
        1821(4) of this title; and


        (B) the Attorney General reports such minimization procedures
      and any changes thereto to the Permanent Select Committee on
      Intelligence of the House of Representatives and the Select
      Committee on Intelligence of the Senate at least 30 days before
      their effective date, unless the Attorney General determines that
      immediate action is required and notifies the committees
      immediately of such minimization procedures and the reason for
      their becoming effective immediately.

      (2) A physical search authorized by this subsection may be
    conducted only in accordance with the certification and
    minimization procedures adopted by the Attorney General. The
    Attorney General shall assess compliance with such procedures and
    shall report such assessments to the Permanent Select Committee on
    Intelligence of the House of Representatives and the Select
    Committee on Intelligence of the Senate under the provisions of
    section 1826 of this title.
      (3) The Attorney General shall immediately transmit under seal to
    the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court a copy of the
    certification. Such certification shall be maintained under
    security measures established by the Chief Justice of the United
    States with the concurrence of the Attorney General, in
    consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, and shall
    remain sealed unless - 
        (A) an application for a court order with respect to the
      physical search is made under section 1821(4) of this title and
      section 1823 of this title; or
        (B) the certification is necessary to determine the legality of
      the physical search under section 1825(g) of this title.

      (4)(A) With respect to physical searches authorized by this
    subsection, the Attorney General may direct a specified landlord,
    custodian, or other specified person to - 
        (i) furnish all information, facilities, or assistance
      necessary to accomplish the physical search in such a manner as
      will protect its secrecy and produce a minimum of interference
      with the services that such landlord, custodian, or other person
      is providing the target of the physical search; and
        (ii) maintain under security procedures approved by the
      Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence any
      records concerning the search or the aid furnished that such
      person wishes to retain.

      (B) The Government shall compensate, at the prevailing rate, such
    landlord, custodian, or other person for furnishing such aid.
    (b) Application for order; authorization
      Applications for a court order under this subchapter are
    authorized if the President has, by written authorization,
    empowered the Attorney General to approve applications to the
    Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Notwithstanding any other
    provision of law, a judge of the court to whom application is made
    may grant an order in accordance with section 1824 of this title
    approving a physical search in the United States of the premises,
    property, information, or material of a foreign power or an agent
    of a foreign power for the purpose of collecting foreign
    intelligence information.
    (c) Jurisdiction of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court
      The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court shall have
    jurisdiction to hear applications for and grant orders approving a
    physical search for the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence
    information anywhere within the United States under the procedures
    set forth in this subchapter, except that no judge shall hear the
    same application which has been denied previously by another judge
    designated under section 1803(a) of this title. If any judge so
    designated denies an application for an order authorizing a
    physical search under this subchapter, such judge shall provide
    immediately for the record a written statement of each reason for
    such decision and, on motion of the United States, the record shall
    be transmitted, under seal, to the court of review established
    under section 1803(b) of this title.
    (d) Court of review; record; transmittal to Supreme Court
      The court of review established under section 1803(b) of this
    title shall have jurisdiction to review the denial of any
    application made under this subchapter. If such court determines
    that the application was properly denied, the court shall
    immediately provide for the record a written statement of each
    reason for its decision and, on petition of the United States for a
    writ of certiorari, the record shall be transmitted under seal to
    the Supreme Court, which shall have jurisdiction to review such
    decision.
    (e) Expeditious conduct of proceedings; security measures for
      maintenance of records
      Judicial proceedings under this subchapter shall be concluded as
    expeditiously as possible. The record of proceedings under this
    subchapter, including applications made and orders granted, shall
    be maintained under security measures established by the Chief
    Justice of the United States in consultation with the Attorney
    General and the Director of National Intelligence.

      title and any other information furnished under section 1823(c)
      of this title.
    (b) Determination of probable cause
      In determining whether or not probable cause exists for purposes
    of an order under subsection (a)(3) of this section, a judge may
    consider past activities of the target, as well as facts and
    circumstances relating to current or future activities of the
    target.
    (c) Specifications and directions of orders
      An order approving a physical search under this section shall - 
        (1) specify - 
          (A) the identity, if known, or a description of the target of
        the physical search;
          (B) the nature and location of each of the premises or
        property to be searched;
          (C) the type of information, material, or property to be

          (D) a statement of the manner in which the physical search is
        to be conducted and, whenever more than one physical search is
        authorized under the order, the authorized scope of each search
        and what minimization procedures shall apply to the information
        acquired by each search; and
          (E) the period of time during which physical searches are
        approved; and

        (2) direct - 
          (A) that the minimization procedures be followed;
          (B) that, upon the request of the applicant, a specified
        landlord, custodian, or other specified person furnish the
        applicant forthwith all information, facilities, or assistance
        necessary to accomplish the physical search in such a manner as
        will protect its secrecy and produce a minimum of interference
        with the services that such landlord, custodian, or other
        person is providing the target of the physical search;
          (C) that such landlord, custodian, or other person maintain
        under security procedures approved by the Attorney General and
        the Director of National Intelligence any records concerning
        the search or the aid furnished that such person wishes to
        retain;
          (D) that the applicant compensate, at the prevailing rate,
        such landlord, custodian, or other person for furnishing such
        aid; and
          (E) that the Federal officer conducting the physical search
        promptly report to the court the circumstances and results of
        the physical search.
    (d) Duration of order; extensions; assessment of compliance
      (1) An order issued under this section may approve a physical
    search for the period necessary to achieve its purpose, or for 90
    days, whichever is less, except that (A) an order under this
    section shall approve a physical search targeted against a foreign
    power, as defined in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of section 1801(a)
    of this title, for the period specified in the application or for
    one year, whichever is less, and (B) an order under this section
    for a physical search targeted against an agent of a foreign power
    who is not a United States person may be for the period specified
    in the application or for 120 days, whichever is less.
      (2) Extensions of an order issued under this subchapter may be
    granted on the same basis as the original order upon an application
    for an extension and new findings made in the same manner as
    required for the original order, except that an extension of an
    order under this chapter for a physical search targeted against a
    foreign power, as defined in section 1801(a)(5) or (6) of this
    title, or against a foreign power, as defined in section 1801(a)(4)
    of this title, that is not a United States person, or against an
    agent of a foreign power who is not a United States person, may be
    for a period not to exceed one year if the judge finds probable
    cause to believe that no property of any individual United States
    person will be acquired during the period.
      (3) At or before the end of the period of time for which a
    physical search is approved by an order or an extension, or at any
    time after a physical search is carried out, the judge may assess
    compliance with the minimization procedures by reviewing the
    circumstances under which information concerning United States
    persons was acquired, retained, or disseminated.
    (e) Emergency orders
      (1)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter,
    whenever the Attorney General reasonably makes the determination
    specified in subparagraph (B), the Attorney General may authorize
    the execution of an emergency physical search if - 
        (i) a judge having jurisdiction under section 1803 of this
      title is informed by the Attorney General or the Attorney
      General's designee at the time of such authorization that the
      decision has been made to execute an emergency search, and
        (ii) an application in accordance with this subchapter is made
      to that judge as soon as practicable but not more than 72 hours
      after the Attorney General authorizes such search.

      (B) The determination referred to in subparagraph (A) is a
    determination that - 
        (i) an emergency situation exists with respect to the execution
      of a physical search to obtain foreign intelligence information
      before an order authorizing such search can with due diligence be
      obtained, and
        (ii) the factual basis for issuance of an order under this
      subchapter to approve such a search exists.

      (2) If the Attorney General authorizes an emergency search under
    paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall require that the
    minimization procedures required by this subchapter for the
    issuance of a judicial order be followed.
      (3) In the absence of a judicial order approving such a physical
    search, the search shall terminate the earlier of - 
        (A) the date on which the information sought is obtained;
        (B) the date on which the application for the order is denied;
      or
        (C) the expiration of 72 hours from the time of authorization
      by the Attorney General.

      (4) In the event that such application for approval is denied, or
    in any other case where the physical search is terminated and no
    order is issued approving the search, no information obtained or
    evidence derived from such search shall be received in evidence or
    otherwise disclosed in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in
    or before any court, grand jury, department, office, agency,
    regulatory body, legislative committee, or other authority of the
    United States, a State, or political subdivision thereof, and no
    information concerning any United States person acquired from such
    search shall subsequently be used or disclosed in any other manner
    by Federal officers or employees without the consent of such
    person, except with the approval of the Attorney General, if the
    information indicates a threat of death or serious bodily harm to
    any person. A denial of the application made under this subsection
    may be reviewed as provided in section 1822 of this title.
    (f) Retention of applications and orders
      Applications made and orders granted under this subchapter shall
    be retained for a period of at least 10 years from the date of the
    application.

    CHAPTER 36 - FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE
    SUBCHAPTER II - PHYSICAL SEARCHES

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1825. Use of information

-STATUTE-
    (a) Compliance with minimization procedures; lawful purposes
      Information acquired from a physical search conducted pursuant to
    this subchapter concerning any United States person may be used and
    disclosed by Federal officers and employees without the consent of
    the United States person only in accordance with the minimization
    procedures required by this subchapter. No information acquired
    from a physical search pursuant to this subchapter may be used or
    disclosed by Federal officers or employees except for lawful
    purposes.
    (b) Notice of search and identification of property seized,
      altered, or reproduced
      Where a physical search authorized and conducted pursuant to
    section 1824 of this title involves the residence of a United
    States person, and, at any time after the search the Attorney
    General determines there is no national security interest in
    continuing to maintain the secrecy of the search, the Attorney
    General shall provide notice to the United States person whose
    residence was searched of the fact of the search conducted pursuant
    to this chapter and shall identify any property of such person
    seized, altered, or reproduced during such search.
    (c) Statement for disclosure
      No information acquired pursuant to this subchapter shall be
    disclosed for law enforcement purposes unless such disclosure is
    accompanied by a statement that such information, or any
    information derived therefrom, may only be used in a criminal
    proceeding with the advance authorization of the Attorney General.
    (d) Notification by United States
      Whenever the United States intends to enter into evidence or
    otherwise use or disclose in any trial, hearing, or other
    proceeding in or before any court, department, officer, agency,
    regulatory body, or other authority of the United States, against
    an aggrieved person, any information obtained or derived from a
    physical search pursuant to the authority of this subchapter, the
    United States shall, prior to the trial, hearing, or the other
    proceeding or at a reasonable time prior to an effort to so
    disclose or so use that information or submit it in evidence,
    notify the aggrieved person and the court or other authority in
    which the information is to be disclosed or used that the United
    States intends to so disclose or so use such information.
    (e) Notification by States or political subdivisions
      Whenever any State or political subdivision thereof intends to
    enter into evidence or otherwise use or disclose in any trial,
    hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, department,
    officer, agency, regulatory body, or other authority of a State or
    a political subdivision thereof against an aggrieved person any
    information obtained or derived from a physical search pursuant to
    the authority of this subchapter, the State or political
    subdivision thereof shall notify the aggrieved person, the court or
    other authority in which the information is to be disclosed or
    used, and the Attorney General that the State or political
    subdivision thereof intends to so disclose or so use such
    information.
    (f) Motion to suppress
      (1) Any person against whom evidence obtained or derived from a
    physical search to which he is an aggrieved person is to be, or has
    been, introduced or otherwise used or disclosed in any trial,
    hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, department,
    officer, agency, regulatory body, or other authority of the United
    States, a State, or a political subdivision thereof, may move to
    suppress the evidence obtained or derived from such search on the
    grounds that - 
        (A) the information was unlawfully acquired; or
        (B) the physical search was not made in conformity with an
      order of authorization or approval.

      (2) Such a motion shall be made before the trial, hearing, or
    other proceeding unless there was no opportunity to make such a
    motion or the person was not aware of the grounds of the motion.
    (g) In camera and ex parte review by district court
      Whenever a court or other authority is notified pursuant to
    subsection (d) or (e) of this section, or whenever a motion is made
    pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, or whenever any motion
    or request is made by an aggrieved person pursuant to any other
    statute or rule of the United States or any State before any court
    or other authority of the United States or any State to discover or
    obtain applications or orders or other materials relating to a
    physical search authorized by this subchapter or to discover,
    obtain, or suppress evidence or information obtained or derived
    from a physical search authorized by this subchapter, the United
    States district court or, where the motion is made before another
    authority, the United States district court in the same district as
    the authority shall, notwithstanding any other provision of law, if
    the Attorney General files an affidavit under oath that disclosure
    or any adversary hearing would harm the national security of the
    United States, review in camera and ex parte the application,
    order, and such other materials relating to the physical search as
    may be necessary to determine whether the physical search of the
    aggrieved person was lawfully authorized and conducted. In making
    this determination, the court may disclose to the aggrieved person,
    under appropriate security procedures and protective orders,
    portions of the application, order, or other materials relating to
    the physical search, or may require the Attorney General to provide
    to the aggrieved person a summary of such materials, only where
    such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of
    the legality of the physical search.
    (h) Suppression of evidence; denial of motion
      If the United States district court pursuant to subsection (g) of
    this section determines that the physical search was not lawfully
    authorized or conducted, it shall, in accordance with the
    requirements of law, suppress the evidence which was unlawfully
    obtained or derived from the physical search of the aggrieved
    person or otherwise grant the motion of the aggrieved person. If
    the court determines that the physical search was lawfully
    authorized or conducted, it shall deny the motion of the aggrieved
    person except to the extent that due process requires discovery or
    disclosure.
    (i) Finality of orders
      Orders granting motions or requests under subsection (h) of this
    section, decisions under this section that a physical search was
    not lawfully authorized or conducted, and orders of the United
    States district court requiring review or granting disclosure of
    applications, orders, or other materials relating to the physical
    search shall be final orders and binding upon all courts of the
    United States and the several States except a United States Court
    of Appeals or the Supreme Court.
    (j) Notification of emergency execution of physical search;
      contents; postponement, suspension, or elimination
      (1) If an emergency execution of a physical search is authorized
    under section 1824(d) (!1) of this title and a subsequent order
    approving the search is not obtained, the judge shall cause to be
    served on any United States person named in the application and on
    such other United States persons subject to the search as the judge
    may determine in his discretion it is in the interests of justice
    to serve, notice of - 

        (A) the fact of the application;
        (B) the period of the search; and
        (C) the fact that during the period information was or was not
      obtained.

      (2) On an ex parte showing of good cause to the judge, the
    serving of the notice required by this subsection may be postponed
    or suspended for a period not to exceed 90 days. Thereafter, on a
    further ex parte showing of good cause, the court shall forego
    ordering the serving of the notice required under this subsection.
    (k) Coordination with law enforcement on national security matters
      (1) Federal officers who conduct physical searches to acquire
    foreign intelligence information under this subchapter may consult
    with Federal law enforcement officers or law enforcement personnel
    of a State or political subdivision of a State (including the chief
    executive officer of that State or political subdivision who has
    the authority to appoint or direct the chief law enforcement
    officer of that State or political subdivision) to coordinate
    efforts to investigate or protect against - 
        (A) actual or potential attack or other grave hostile acts of a
      foreign power or an agent of a foreign power;
        (B) sabotage or international terrorism by a foreign power or
      an agent of a foreign power; or
        (C) clandestine intelligence activities by an intelligence
      service or network of a foreign power or by an agent of a foreign
      power.

      (2) Coordination authorized under paragraph (1) shall not
    preclude the certification required by section 1823(a)(7) of this
    title or the entry of an order under section 1824 of this title.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1843. Authorization during emergencies

-STATUTE-
    (a) Requirements for authorization
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, when the
    Attorney General makes a determination described in subsection (b)
    of this section, the Attorney General may authorize the
    installation and use of a pen register or trap and trace device on
    an emergency basis to gather foreign intelligence information not
    concerning a United States person or information to protect against
    international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities,
    provided that such investigation of a United States person is not
    conducted solely upon the basis of activities protected by the
    first amendment to the Constitution if - 
        (1) a judge referred to in section 1842(b) of this title is
      informed by the Attorney General or his designee at the time of
      such authorization that the decision has been made to install and
      use the pen register or trap and trace device, as the case may
      be, on an emergency basis; and
        (2) an application in accordance with section 1842 of this
      title is made to such judge as soon as practicable, but not more
      than 48 hours, after the Attorney General authorizes the
      installation and use of the pen register or trap and trace
      device, as the case may be, under this section.
    (b) Determination of emergency and factual basis
      A determination under this subsection is a reasonable
    determination by the Attorney General that - 
        (1) an emergency requires the installation and use of a pen
      register or trap and trace device to obtain foreign intelligence
      information not concerning a United States person or information
      to protect against international terrorism or clandestine
      intelligence activities, provided that such investigation of a
      United States person is not conducted solely upon the basis of
      activities protected by the first amendment to the Constitution
      before an order authorizing the installation and use of the pen
      register or trap and trace device, as the case may be, can with
      due diligence be obtained under section 1842 of this title; and
        (2) the factual basis for issuance of an order under such
      section 1842 of this title to approve the installation and use of
      the pen register or trap and trace device, as the case may be,
      exists.
    (c) Effect of absence of order
      (1) In the absence of an order applied for under subsection
    (a)(2) of this section approving the installation and use of a pen
    register or trap and trace device authorized under this section,
    the installation and use of the pen register or trap and trace
    device, as the case may be, shall terminate at the earlier of - 
        (A) when the information sought is obtained;
        (B) when the application for the order is denied under section
      1842 of this title; or
        (C) 48 hours after the time of the authorization by the
      Attorney General.

      (2) In the event that an application for an order applied for
    under subsection (a)(2) of this section is denied, or in any other
    case where the installation and use of a pen register or trap and
    trace device under this section is terminated and no order under
    section 1842 of this title is issued approving the installation and
    use of the pen register or trap and trace device, as the case may
    be, no information obtained or evidence derived from the use of the
    pen register or trap and trace device, as the case may be, shall be
    received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial, hearing,
    or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department,
    office, agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other
    authority of the United States, a State, or political subdivision
    thereof, and no information concerning any United States person
    acquired from the use of the pen register or trap and trace device,
    as the case may be, shall subsequently be used or disclosed in any
    other manner by Federal officers or employees without the consent
    of such person, except with the approval of the Attorney General if
    the information indicates a threat of death or serious bodily harm
    to any person.

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      (1) Information acquired from the use of a pen register or trap
    and trace device installed pursuant to this subchapter concerning
    any United States person may be used and disclosed by Federal
    officers and employees without the consent of the United States
    person only in accordance with the provisions of this section.
      (2) No information acquired from a pen register or trap and trace
    device installed and used pursuant to this subchapter may be used
    or disclosed by Federal officers or employees except for lawful
    purposes.
    (b) Disclosure for law enforcement purposes
      No information acquired pursuant to this subchapter shall be
    disclosed for law enforcement purposes unless such disclosure is
    accompanied by a statement that such information, or any
    information derived therefrom, may only be used in a criminal
    proceeding with the advance authorization of the Attorney General.
    (c) Notification of intended disclosure by United States
      Whenever the United States intends to enter into evidence or
    otherwise use or disclose in any trial, hearing, or other
    proceeding in or before any court, department, officer, agency,
    regulatory body, or other authority of the United States against an
    aggrieved person any information obtained or derived from the use
    of a pen register or trap and trace device pursuant to this
    subchapter, the United States shall, before the trial, hearing, or
    the other proceeding or at a reasonable time before an effort to so
    disclose or so use that information or submit it in evidence,
    notify the aggrieved person and the court or other authority in
    which the information is to be disclosed or used that the United
    States intends to so disclose or so use such information.
    (d) Notification of intended disclosure by State or political
      subdivision
      Whenever any State or political subdivision thereof intends to
    enter into evidence or otherwise use or disclose in any trial,
    hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, department,
    officer, agency, regulatory body, or other authority of the State
    or political subdivision thereof against an aggrieved person any
    information obtained or derived from the use of a pen register or
    trap and trace device pursuant to this subchapter, the State or
    political subdivision thereof shall notify the aggrieved person,
    the court or other authority in which the information is to be
    disclosed or used, and the Attorney General that the State or
    political subdivision thereof intends to so disclose or so use such
    information.
    (e) Motion to suppress
      (1) Any aggrieved person against whom evidence obtained or
    derived from the use of a pen register or trap and trace device is
    to be, or has been, introduced or otherwise used or disclosed in
    any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court,
    department, officer, agency, regulatory body, or other authority of
    the United States, or a State or political subdivision thereof, may
    move to suppress the evidence obtained or derived from the use of
    the pen register or trap and trace device, as the case may be, on
    the grounds that - 
        (A) the information was unlawfully acquired; or
        (B) the use of the pen register or trap and trace device, as
      the case may be, was not made in conformity with an order of
      authorization or approval under this subchapter.

      (2) A motion under paragraph (1) shall be made before the trial,
    hearing, or other proceeding unless there was no opportunity to
    make such a motion or the aggrieved person concerned was not aware
    of the grounds of the motion.
    (f) In camera and ex parte review
      (1) Whenever a court or other authority is notified pursuant to
    subsection (c) or (d) of this section, whenever a motion is made
    pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, or whenever any motion
    or request is made by an aggrieved person pursuant to any other
    statute or rule of the United States or any State before any court
    or other authority of the United States or any State to discover or
    obtain applications or orders or other materials relating to the
    use of a pen register or trap and trace device authorized by this
    subchapter or to discover, obtain, or suppress evidence or
    information obtained or derived from the use of a pen register or
    trap and trace device authorized by this subchapter, the United
    States district court or, where the motion is made before another
    authority, the United States district court in the same district as
    the authority shall, notwithstanding any other provision of law and
    if the Attorney General files an affidavit under oath that
    disclosure or any adversary hearing would harm the national
    security of the United States, review in camera and ex parte the
    application, order, and such other materials relating to the use of
    the pen register or trap and trace device, as the case may be, as
    may be necessary to determine whether the use of the pen register
    or trap and trace device, as the case may be, was lawfully
    authorized and conducted.
      (2) In making a determination under paragraph (1), the court may
    disclose to the aggrieved person, under appropriate security
    procedures and protective orders, portions of the application,
    order, or other materials relating to the use of the pen register
    or trap and trace device, as the case may be, or may require the
    Attorney General to provide to the aggrieved person a summary of
    such materials, only where such disclosure is necessary to make an
    accurate determination of the legality of the use of the pen
    register or trap and trace device, as the case may be.
    (g) Effect of determination of lawfulness
      (1) If the United States district court determines pursuant to
    subsection (f) of this section that the use of a pen register or
    trap and trace device was not lawfully authorized or conducted, the
    court may, in accordance with the requirements of law, suppress the
    evidence which was unlawfully obtained or derived from the use of
    the pen register or trap and trace device, as the case may be, or
    otherwise grant the motion of the aggrieved person.
      (2) If the court determines that the use of the pen register or
    trap and trace device, as the case may be, was lawfully authorized
    or conducted, it may deny the motion of the aggrieved person except
    to the extent that due process requires discovery or disclosure.
    (h) Binding final orders
      Orders granting motions or requests under subsection (g) of this
    section, decisions under this section that the use of a pen
    register or trap and trace device was not lawfully authorized or
    conducted, and orders of the United States district court requiring
    review or granting disclosure of applications, orders, or other
    materials relating to the installation and use of a pen register or
    trap and trace device shall be final orders and binding upon all
    courts of the United States and the several States except a United
    States Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court.

    same manner as such person.
      (B) Any person who discloses to a person described in

    person to whom such disclosure will be made or to whom such
    disclosure was made prior to the request.
    (e) Liability for good faith disclosure; waiver
      A person who, in good faith, produces tangible things under an
    order pursuant to this section shall not be liable to any other
    person for such production. Such production shall not be deemed to
    constitute a waiver of any privilege in any other proceeding or
    context.
    (f) Judicial review of FISA orders
      (1) In this subsection - 
        (A) the term "production order" means an order to produce any
      tangible thing under this section; and
        (B) the term "nondisclosure order" means an order imposed under
      subsection (d).

      (2)(A)(i) A person receiving a production order may challenge the
    legality of that order by filing a petition with the pool
    established by section 1803(e)(1) of this title. Not less than 1
    year after the date of the issuance of the production order, the
    recipient of a production order may challenge the nondisclosure
    order imposed in connection with such production order by filing a
    petition to modify or set aside such nondisclosure order,
    consistent with the requirements of subparagraph (C), with the pool
    established by section 1803(e)(1) of this title.
      (ii) The presiding judge shall immediately assign a petition
    under clause (i) to 1 of the judges serving in the pool established
    by section 1803(e)(1) of this title. Not later than 72 hours after
    the assignment of such petition, the assigned judge shall conduct
    an initial review of the petition. If the assigned judge determines
    that the petition is frivolous, the assigned judge shall
    immediately deny the petition and affirm the production order or
    nondisclosure order. If the assigned judge determines the petition
    is not frivolous, the assigned judge shall promptly consider the
    petition in accordance with the procedures established under
    section 1803(e)(2) of this title.
      (iii) The assigned judge shall promptly provide a written
    statement for the record of the reasons for any determination under
    this subsection. Upon the request of the Government, any order
    setting aside a nondisclosure order shall be stayed pending review
    pursuant to paragraph (3).
      (B) A judge considering a petition to modify or set aside a
    production order may grant such petition only if the judge finds
    that such order does not meet the requirements of this section or
    is otherwise unlawful. If the judge does not modify or set aside
    the production order, the judge shall immediately affirm such
    order, and order the recipient to comply therewith.
      (C)(i) A judge considering a petition to modify or set aside a
    nondisclosure order may grant such petition only if the judge finds
    that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the
    national security of the United States, interfere with a criminal,
    counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation, interfere
    with diplomatic relations, or endanger the life or physical safety
    of any person.
      (ii) If, upon filing of such a petition, the Attorney General,
    Deputy Attorney General, an Assistant Attorney General, or the
    Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation certifies that
    disclosure may endanger the national security of the United States
    or interfere with diplomatic relations, such certification shall be
    treated as conclusive, unless the judge finds that the
    certification was made in bad faith.
      (iii) If the judge denies a petition to modify or set aside a
    nondisclosure order, the recipient of such order shall be precluded
    for a period of 1 year from filing another such petition with
    respect to such nondisclosure order.
      (D) Any production or nondisclosure order not explicitly modified
    or set aside consistent with this subsection shall remain in full
    effect.
      (3) A petition for review of a decision under paragraph (2) to
    affirm, modify, or set aside an order by the Government or any
    person receiving such order shall be made to the court of review
    established under section 1803(b) of this title, which shall have
    jurisdiction to consider such petitions. The court of review shall
    provide for the record a written statement of the reasons for its
    decision and, on petition by the Government or any person receiving
    such order for writ of certiorari, the record shall be transmitted
    under seal to the Supreme Court of the United States, which shall
    have jurisdiction to review such decision.
      (4) Judicial proceedings under this subsection shall be concluded
    as expeditiously as possible. The record of proceedings, including
    petitions filed, orders granted, and statements of reasons for
    decision, shall be maintained under security measures established
    by the Chief Justice of the United States, in consultation with the
    Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence.
      (5) All petitions under this subsection shall be filed under
    seal. In any proceedings under this subsection, the court shall,
    upon request of the Government, review ex parte and in camera any
    Government submission, or portions thereof, which may include
    classified information.
    (g) Minimization procedures
      (1) In general
        Not later than 180 days after March 9, 2006, the Attorney
      General shall adopt specific minimization procedures governing
      the retention and dissemination by the Federal Bureau of
      Investigation of any tangible things, or information therein,

      order under this subchapter.
      (2) Defined
        In this section, the term "minimization procedures" means - 
          (A) specific procedures that are reasonably designed in light
        of the purpose and technique of an order for the production of
        tangible things, to minimize the retention, and prohibit the
        dissemination, of nonpublicly available information concerning
        unconsenting United States persons consistent with the need of
        the United States to obtain, produce, and disseminate foreign
        intelligence information;
          (B) procedures that require that nonpublicly available
        information, which is not foreign intelligence information, as
        defined in section 1801(e)(1) of this title, shall not be
        disseminated in a manner that identifies any United States
        person, without such person's consent, unless such person's
        identity is necessary to understand foreign intelligence
        information or assess its importance; and
          (C) notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B), procedures
        that allow for the retention and dissemination of information
        that is evidence of a crime which has been, is being, or is
        about to be committed and that is to be retained or
        disseminated for law enforcement purposes.
    (h) Use of information
      Information acquired from tangible things received by the Federal
    Bureau of Investigation in response to an order under this
    subchapter concerning any United States person may be used and
    disclosed by Federal officers and employees without the consent of
    the United States person only in accordance with the minimization
    procedures adopted pursuant to subsection (g). No otherwise
    privileged information acquired from tangible things received by
    the Federal Bureau of Investigation in accordance with the
    provisions of this subchapter shall lose its privileged character.
    No information acquired from tangible things received by the
    Federal Bureau of Investigation in response to an order under this
    subchapter may be used or disclosed by Federal officers or
    employees except for lawful purposes.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Short title
      This chapter may be cited as the "David L. Boren National
    Security Education Act of 1991".
    (b) Findings
      The Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The security of the United States is and will continue to
      depend on the ability of the United States to exercise
      international leadership.
        (2) The ability of the United States to exercise international
      leadership is, and will increasingly continue to be, based on the
      political and economic strength of the United States, as well as
      on United States military strength around the world.
        (3) Recent changes in the world pose threats of a new kind to
      international stability as Cold War tensions continue to decline
      while economic competition, regional conflicts, terrorist
      activities, and weapon proliferations have dramatically
      increased.
        (4) The future national security and economic well-being of the
      United States will depend substantially on the ability of its
      citizens to communicate and compete by knowing the languages and
      cultures of other countries.
        (5) The Federal Government has an interest in ensuring that the
      employees of its departments and agencies with national security
      responsibilities are prepared to meet the challenges of this
      changing international environment.
        (6) The Federal Government also has an interest in taking
      actions to alleviate the problem of American undergraduate and
      graduate students being inadequately prepared to meet the
      challenges posed by increasing global interaction among nations.
        (7) American colleges and universities must place a new
      emphasis on improving the teaching of foreign languages, area
      studies, counterproliferation studies, and other international
      fields to help meet those challenges.
    (c) Purposes
      The purposes of this chapter are as follows:
        (1) To provide the necessary resources, accountability, and
      flexibility to meet the national security education needs of the
      United States, especially as such needs change over time.
        (2) To increase the quantity, diversity, and quality of the
      teaching and learning of subjects in the fields of foreign
      languages, area studies, counterproliferation studies, and other
      international fields that are critical to the Nation's interest.
        (3) To produce an increased pool of applicants for work in the
      departments and agencies of the United States Government with
      national security responsibilities.
        (4) To expand, in conjunction with other Federal programs, the
      international experience, knowledge base, and perspectives on
      which the United States citizenry, Government employees, and
      leaders rely.
        (5) To permit the Federal Government to advocate the cause of
      international education.

          counterproliferation studies, and other international fields
          relating to the national security interests of the United

            linguists; and
              (II) are not proficient at a professional level in the
            English language with respect to reading, writing, and

      (2) Funding allocations
        Of the amount available for obligation out of the National

      procedures. In addition, the Secretary may enter into personal
      service contracts for periods up to one year for program
      administration, except that not more than 10 such contracts may

    (b) Service agreement
      In awarding a scholarship or fellowship under the program, the
    Secretary or contract organization referred to in subsection (a)(4)
    of this section, as the case may be, shall require a recipient of
    any fellowship or any scholarship to enter into an agreement that,
    in return for such assistance, the recipient - 
        (1) will maintain satisfactory academic progress, as determined
      in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary, and
      agrees that failure to maintain such progress shall constitute
      grounds upon which the Secretary or contract organization
      referred to in subsection (a)(4) of this section may terminate
      such assistance;
        (2)(A) will (in accordance with regulations prescribed by the
      Secretary of Defense in coordination with the heads of the other
      Federal departments and agencies concerned) begin work not later
      than three years after the recipient's completion of degree study
      during which scholarship assistance was provided under the
      program - 
          (i) for not less than one year in a position certified by the
        Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Director of
        National Intelligence, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and
        the Secretary of State (as appropriate), as contributing to the
        national security of the United States in the Department of
        Defense, any element of the intelligence community, the
        Department of Homeland Security, or the Department of State; or
          (ii) for not less than one year in a position in a Federal
        agency or office that is identified by the Secretary of Defense
        under subsection (g) as having national security
        responsibilities if the recipient demonstrates to the Secretary
        that no position is available in the departments and agencies
        covered by clause (i); or

        (B) will (in accordance with such regulations) begin work not
      later than two years after the recipient's completion or
      termination of study for which fellowship assistance was provided
      under the program - 
          (i) for not less than one year in a position certified by the
        Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Director of
        National Intelligence, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and
        the Secretary of State (as appropriate), as contributing to the
        national security of the United States in the Department of
        Defense, any element of the intelligence community, the
        Department of Homeland Security, or the Department of State; or
          (ii) for not less than one year in a position in a Federal
        agency or office that is identified by the Secretary of Defense
        under subsection (g) as having national security
        responsibilities if the recipient demonstrates to the Secretary
        that no position is available in the departments and agencies
        covered by clause (i); and

        (3) if the recipient fails to meet either of the obligations
      set forth in paragraph (1) or (2), will reimburse the United
      States Government for the amount of the assistance provided the
      recipient under the program, together with interest at a rate
      determined in accordance with regulations issued by the
      Secretary.
    (c) Evaluation of progress in language skills
      The Secretary shall, through the National Security Education
    Program office, administer a test of the foreign language skills of
    each recipient of a scholarship or fellowship under this chapter
    before the commencement of the study or education for which the
    scholarship or fellowship is awarded and after the completion of
    such study or education. The purpose of these tests is to evaluate
    the progress made by recipients of scholarships and fellowships in
    developing foreign language skills as a result of assistance under
    this chapter.
    (d) Distribution of assistance
      In selecting the recipients for awards of scholarships,
    fellowships, or grants pursuant to this chapter, the Secretary or a
    contract organization referred to in subsection (a)(4) of this
    section, as the case may be, shall take into consideration (1) the
    extent to which the selections will result in there being an
    equitable geographic distribution of such scholarships,
    fellowships, or grants (as the case may be) among the various
    regions of the United States, and (2) the extent to which the
    distribution of scholarships and fellowships to individuals
    reflects the cultural, racial, and ethnic diversity of the
    population of the United States.
    (e) Merit review
      The Secretary shall award scholarships, fellowships, and grants
    under the program based upon a merit review process.

    other type of assistance under this chapter shall, as a condition
    of receiving such assistance or under any other circumstances, be
    used by any department, agency, or entity of the United States
    Government engaged in intelligence activities to undertake any
    activity on its behalf during the period such person is pursuing a
    program of education for which funds are provided under the program

      the Federal Government employing the employee for the period of
      such training;
        (ii) to continue in the service of such department or agency,
      following completion by the employee of such training, for a
      period of two years for each year, or part of the year, of such
      training;
        (iii) if, before the completion by the employee of such

      by such department or agency is terminated either by such
      department or agency due to misconduct by the employee, or by the
      employee voluntarily, to reimburse the United States in an amount
      that bears the same ratio to the total cost of such training
      (excluding the employee's pay and allowances) provided to the
      employee as the unserved portion of such period of service bears
      to the total period of service required by clause (ii).

      (C) (!1) Subject to subparagraph (D), the obligation to reimburse
    the United States under an agreement under subparagraph (A) is for
    all purposes a debt owing the United States.

      (D) The head of the element of the intelligence community
    concerned may release an employee, in whole or in part, from the
    obligation to reimburse the United States under an agreement under
    subparagraph (A) when, in the discretion of the head of the
    element, the head of the element determines that equity or the
    interests of the United States so require.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1904. National Security Education Trust Fund

-STATUTE-
    (a) Establishment of Fund
      There is established in the Treasury of the United States a trust
    fund to be known as the "National Security Education Trust Fund".
    The assets of the Fund consist of amounts appropriated to the Fund
    and amounts credited to the Fund under subsection (e) of this
    section.
    (b) Availability of sums in Fund
      Sums in the Fund shall, to the extent provided in appropriations
    Acts, be available - 
        (1) for awarding scholarships, fellowships, and grants in
      accordance with the provisions of this chapter; and
        (2) for properly allocable costs of the Federal Government for
      the administration of the program under this chapter.
    (c) Investment of Fund assets
      The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest in full the amount in
    the Fund that is not immediately necessary for expenditure. Such
    investments may be made only in interest-bearing obligations of the
    United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and
    interest by the United States. For such purpose, such obligations
    may be acquired on original issue at the issue price or by purchase
    of outstanding obligations at the market price. The purposes for
    which obligations of the United States may be issued under chapter
    31 of title 31 are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par
    of special obligations exclusively to the Fund. Such special
    obligations shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average rate
    of interest, computed as to the end of the calendar month next
    preceding the date of such issue, borne by all marketable interest-
    bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of
    the public debt, except that where such average rate is not a
    multiple of  1/8  of 1 percent, the rate of interest of such
    special obligations shall be the multiple of  1/8  of 1 percent
    next lower than such average rate. Such special obligations shall
    be issued only if the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the
    purchases of other interest-bearing obligations of the United
    States, or of obligations guaranteed as to both principal and
    interest by the United States or original issue or at the market
    price, is not in the public interest.
    (d) Authority to sell obligations
      Any obligation acquired by the Fund (except special obligations
    issued exclusively to the Fund) may be sold by the Secretary of the
    Treasury at the market price, and such special obligations may be
    redeemed at par plus accrued interest.
    (e) Amounts credited to Fund
      (1) The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption
    of, any obligations held in the Fund shall be credited to and form
    a part of the Fund.
      (2) Any amount paid to the United States under section 1902(b)(3)
    of this title shall be credited to and form a part of the Fund.
      (3) Any gifts of money shall be credited to and form a part of
    the Fund.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2031. Computation of annuities

-STATUTE-
    (a) Annuity of participant
      (1) Computation of annuity
        The annuity of a participant is the product of - 
          (A) the participant's high-3 average pay (as defined in
        paragraph (4)); and
          (B) the number of years, not exceeding 35, of service credit
        (determined in accordance with sections 2081 and 2082 of this
        title) multiplied by 2 percent.
      (2) Credit for unused sick leave
        The total service of a participant who retires on an immediate
      annuity (except under section 2051 of this title) or who dies
      leaving a survivor or survivors entitled to an annuity shall
      include (without regard to the 35-year limitation prescribed in
      paragraph (1)) the days of unused sick leave to the credit of the
      participant. Days of unused sick leave may not be counted in
      determining average basic pay or eligibility for an annuity under
      this subchapter. A deposit shall not be required for days of
      unused sick leave credited under this paragraph.
      (3) Crediting of part-time service
        (A) In general
          In the case of a participant whose service includes service
        on a part-time basis performed after April 6, 1986, the
        participant's annuity shall be the sum of the amounts
        determined under subparagraphs (B) and (C).
        (B) Computation of pre-April 7, 1986, annuity
          The portion of an annuity referred to in subparagraph (A)
        with respect to service before April 7, 1986, shall be the
        amount computed under paragraph (1) using the participant's
        length of service before that date (increased by the unused
        sick leave to the credit of the participant at the time of
        retirement) and the participant's high-3 average pay.
        (C) Computation of post-April 6, 1986, annuity
          The portion of an annuity referred to in subparagraph (A)
        with respect to service after April 6, 1986, shall be the
        product of - 
            (i) the amount computed under paragraph (1), using the
          participant's length of service after that date and the
          participant's high-3 average pay, as determined by using the
          annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time
          service; and
            (ii) the ratio which the participant's actual service after
          April 6, 1986 (as determined by prorating the participant's
          total service after that date to reflect the service that was
          performed on a part-time basis) bears to the total service
          after that date that would be creditable for the participant
          if all the service had been performed on a full-time basis.
        (D) Treatment of employment on temporary or intermittent basis
          Employment on a temporary or intermittent basis shall not be
        considered to be service on a part-time basis for purposes of
        this paragraph.
      (4) High-3 average pay defined
        For purposes of this subsection, a participant's high-3 average
      pay is the amount of the participant's average basic pay for the
      highest 3 consecutive years of the participant's service for
      which full contributions have been made to the fund.
      (5) Computation of service
        In determining the aggregate period of service upon which an
      annuity is to be based, any fractional part of a month shall not
      be counted.
    (b) Spouse or former spouse survivor annuity
      (1) Reduction in participant's annuity to provide spouse or
        former spouse survivor annuity
        (A) General rule
          Except to the extent provided otherwise under a written
        election under subparagraph (B) or (C), if at the time of
        retirement a participant or former participant is married (or
        has a former spouse who has not remarried before attaining age
        55), the participant shall receive a reduced annuity and
        provide a survivor annuity for the participant's spouse under
        this subsection or former spouse under section 2032(b) of this
        title, or a combination of such annuities, as the case may be.
        (B) Joint election for waiver or reduction of spouse survivor
          annuity
          A married participant or former participant and the
        participant's spouse may jointly elect in writing at the time
        of retirement to waive a survivor annuity for that spouse under
        this section or to reduce such survivor annuity under this
        section by designating a portion of the annuity of the
        participant as the base for the survivor annuity. If the
        marriage is dissolved following an election for such a reduced
        annuity and the spouse qualifies as a former spouse, the base
        used in calculating any annuity of the former spouse under
        section 2032(b) of this title may not exceed the portion of the
        participant's annuity designated under this subparagraph.
        (C) Joint election of participant and former spouse
          If a participant or former participant has a former spouse,
        such participant and the participant's former spouse may
        jointly elect by spousal agreement under section 2094(b) of
        this title to waive, reduce, or increase a survivor annuity
        under section 2032(b) of this title for that former spouse. Any
        such election must be made (i) before the end of the 12-month
        period beginning on the date on which the divorce or annulment
        involving that former spouse becomes final, or (ii) at the time
        of retirement of the participant, whichever is later.
        (D) Unilateral elections in absence of spouse or former spouse
          The Director may prescribe regulations under which a
        participant or former participant may make an election under
        subparagraph (B) or (C) without the participant's spouse or
        former spouse if the participant establishes to the
        satisfaction of the Director that the participant does not
        know, and has taken all reasonable steps to determine, the
        whereabouts of the spouse or former spouse.
      (2) Amount of reduction in participant's annuity
        The annuity of a participant or former participant providing a
      survivor annuity under this section (or section 2032(b) of this
      title), excluding any portion of the annuity not designated or
      committed as a base for any survivor annuity, shall be reduced by
      2 1/2  percent of the first $3,600 plus 10 percent of any amount
      over $3,600. The reduction under this paragraph shall be
      calculated before any reduction under section 2032(a)(5) of this
      title.
      (3) Amount of surviving spouse annuity
        (A) In general
          If a retired participant receiving a reduced annuity under
        this subsection dies and is survived by a spouse, a survivor
        annuity shall be paid to the surviving spouse. The amount of
        the annuity shall be equal to 55 percent of (i) the full amount
        of the participant's annuity computed under subsection (a) of
        this section, or (ii) any lesser amount elected as the base for
        the survivor annuity under paragraph (1)(B).
        (B) Limitation
          Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the amount of the annuity
        calculated under subparagraph (A) for a surviving spouse in any
        case in which there is also a surviving former spouse of the
        retired participant who qualifies for an annuity under section
        2032(b) of this title may not exceed 55 percent of the portion
        (if any) of the base for survivor annuities which remains
        available under section 2032(b)(4)(B) of this title.
        (C) Effective date and termination of annuity
          An annuity payable from the fund to a surviving spouse under
        this paragraph shall commence on the day after the retired
        participant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the
        month before the surviving spouse's death or remarriage before
        attaining age 55. If such survivor annuity is terminated
        because of remarriage, it shall be restored at the same rate
        commencing on the date such remarriage is dissolved by death,
        annulment, or divorce if any lump sum paid upon termination of
        the annuity is returned to the fund.
    (c) 18-month open period after retirement to provide spouse
      coverage
      (1) Survivor annuity elections
        (A) Election when spouse coverage waived at time of retirement

        31, 1992 and who - 
            (i) is married at the time of retirement; and
            (ii) elects at that time (in accordance with subsection (b)
          of this section) to waive a survivor annuity for the spouse,

        may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of the
        retirement of the participant, elect to have a reduction under
        subsection (b) of this section made in the annuity of the
        participant (or in such portion thereof as the participant may
        designate) in order to provide a survivor annuity for the
        participant's spouse.
        (B) Election when reduced spouse annuity elected

            (ii) who, at that time designates (in accordance with
          subsection (b) of this section) that a portion of the annuity
          of such participant is to be used as the base for a survivor
          annuity,

        may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of the
        retirement of such participant, elect to have a greater portion
        of the annuity of such participant so used.
      (2) Deposit required

        fund before the end of that 18-month period.
        (B) Amount of deposit
          The amount to be deposited with respect to an election under
        this subsection is the amount equal to the sum of the
        following:
          (i) Additional cost to system
            The additional cost to the system that is associated with
          providing a survivor annuity under subsection (b) of this
          section and that results from such election, taking into
          account - 
              (I) the difference (for the period between the date on
            which the annuity of the participant or former participant
            commences and the date of the election) between the amount
            paid to such participant or former participant under this
            subchapter and the amount which would have been paid if
            such election had been made at the time the participant or
            former participant applied for the annuity; and
              (II) the costs associated with providing for the later
            election.
          (ii) Interest
            Interest on the additional cost determined under clause
          (i), computed using the interest rate specified or determined
          under section 8334(e) of title 5 for the calendar year in
          which the amount to be deposited is determined.
      (3) Voiding of previous elections
        An election by a participant or former participant under this
      subsection voids prospectively any election previously made in
      the case of such participant under subsection (b) of this
      section.
      (4) Reductions in annuity
        An annuity that is reduced in connection with an election under
      this subsection shall be reduced by the same percentage
      reductions as were in effect at the time of the retirement of the
      participant or former participant whose annuity is so reduced.
      (5) Rights and obligations resulting from reduced annuity
        election
        Rights and obligations resulting from the election of a reduced
      annuity under this subsection shall be the same as the rights and
      obligations that would have resulted had the participant involved
      elected such annuity at the time of retirement.
    (d) Annuities for surviving children
      (1) Participants dying before April 1, 1992

        annuity determined under paragraph (3)(A); and
          (B) if the retired participant is not survived by a spouse or
        former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a
        surviving child of the participant, there shall be paid to or

      subsection (or covered by paragraph (1)(A) or (2)(A) of section
      2052(c) of this title) is the smallest of the following:
          (i) 60 percent of the participant's high-3 average pay, as
        determined under subsection (a)(4) of this section, divided by
        the number of children.
          (ii) $900, as adjusted under section 2131 of this title.
          (iii) $2,700, as adjusted under section 2131 of this title,
        divided by the number of children.

        (B) The amount of an annuity for the surviving child of a
      participant covered by paragraph (1)(B) or (2)(B) of this
      subsection (or covered by paragraph (1)(B) or (2)(B) of section
      2052(c) of this title) is the smallest of the following:
          (i) 75 percent of the participant's high-3 average pay, as
        determined under subsection (a)(4) of this section, divided by

          (iii) $3,240, as adjusted under section 2131 of this title,

      (4) Recomputation of child annuities
        (A) In the case of a child annuity payable under paragraph (1),
      upon the death of a surviving spouse or the termination of the
      annuity of a child, the annuities of any remaining children shall
      be recomputed and paid as though the spouse or child had not
      survived the retired participant.
        (B) In the case of a child annuity payable under paragraph (2),
      upon the death of a surviving spouse or former spouse or
      termination of the annuity of a child, the annuities of any
      remaining children shall be recomputed and paid as though the
      spouse, former spouse, or child had not survived the retired
      participant. If the annuity of a surviving child who has not been
      receiving an annuity is initiated or resumed, the annuities of
      any other children shall be recomputed and paid from that date as
      though the annuities of all currently eligible children were then
      being initiated.
      (5) "Former spouse" defined
        For purposes of this subsection, the term "former spouse"
      includes any former wife or husband of the retired participant,
      regardless of the length of marriage or the amount of creditable
      service completed by the participant.
    (e) Commencement and termination of child annuities
      (1) Commencement
        An annuity payable to a child under subsection (d) of this
      section, or under section 2052(c) of this title, shall begin on
      the day after the date on which the participant or retired
      participant dies or, in the case of an individual over the age of
      18 who is not a child within the meaning of section 2002(b) of
      this title, shall begin or resume on the first day of the month
      in which the individual later becomes or again becomes a student
      as described in section 2002(b) of this title. Such annuity may
      not commence until any lump-sum that has been paid is returned to
      the fund.
      (2) Termination
        Such an annuity shall terminate on the last day of the month
      before the month in which the recipient of the annuity dies or no
      longer qualifies as a child (as defined in section 2002(b) of
      this title).
    (f) Participants not married at time of retirement
      (1) Designation of persons with insurable interest
        (A) Authority to make designation
          Subject to the rights of former spouses under subsection (b)
        of this section and section 2032 of this title, at the time of
        retirement an unmarried participant found by the Director to be
        in good health may elect to receive an annuity reduced in
        accordance with subparagraph (B) and designate in writing an
        individual having an insurable interest in the participant to
        receive an annuity under the system after the participant's
        death. The amount of such an annuity shall be equal to 55
        percent of the participant's reduced annuity.
        (B) Reduction in participant's annuity
          The annuity payable to the participant making such election
        shall be reduced by 10 percent of an annuity computed under
        subsection (a) of this section and by an additional 5 percent
        for each full 5 years the designated individual is younger than
        the participant. The total reduction under this subparagraph
        may not exceed 40 percent.
        (C) Commencement of survivor annuity
          The annuity payable to the designated individual shall begin
        on the day after the retired participant dies and terminate on
        the last day of the month before the designated individual
        dies.
        (D) Recomputation of participant's annuity on death of
          designated individual
          An annuity which is reduced under this paragraph shall,
        effective the first day of the month following the death of the
        designated individual, be recomputed and paid as if the annuity
        had not been so reduced.
      (2) Election of survivor annuity upon subsequent marriage
        A participant who is unmarried at the time of retirement and
      who later marries may irrevocably elect, in a signed writing
      received by the Director within one year after the marriage, to
      receive a reduced annuity as provided in subsection (b) of this
      section. Such election and reduction shall be effective on the
      first day of the month beginning 9 months after the date of
      marriage. The election voids prospectively any election
      previously made under paragraph (1).
    (g) Effect of divorce after retirement
      (1) Recomputation of retired participant's annuity upon divorce
        An annuity which is reduced under this section (or any similar
      prior provision of law) to provide a survivor annuity for a
      spouse shall, if the marriage of the retired participant to such
      spouse is dissolved, be recomputed and paid for each full month
      during which a retired participant is not married (or is
      remarried, if there is no election in effect under paragraph (2))
      as if the annuity had not been so reduced, subject to any
      reduction required to provide a survivor annuity under subsection
      (b) or (c) of section 2032 of this title or under section 2036 of
      this title.
      (2) Election of survivor annuity upon subsequent remarriage
        (A) In general
          Upon remarriage, the retired participant may irrevocably
        elect, by means of a signed writing received by the Director
        within one year after such remarriage, to receive a reduced
        annuity for the purpose of providing an annuity for the new
        spouse of the retired participant in the event such spouse
        survives the retired participant. Such reduction shall be equal
        to the reduction in effect immediately before the dissolution
        of the previous marriage (unless such reduction is adjusted
        under section 2032(b)(5) of this title or elected under
        subparagraph (B)).
        (B) When annuity previously not (or not fully) reduced
          (i) Election
            If the retired participant's annuity was not reduced (or
          was not fully reduced) to provide a survivor annuity for the
          participant's spouse or former spouse as of the time of
          retirement, the retired participant may make an election
          under the first sentence of subparagraph (A) upon remarriage
          to a spouse other than the spouse at the time of retirement.
          For any remarriage that occurred before August 14, 1991, the
          retired participant may make such an election within 2 years
          after such date.
          (ii) Deposit required
            (I) The retired participant shall, within one year after
          the date of the remarriage (or by August 14, 1993 for any
          remarriage that occurred before August 14, 1991), deposit in
          the fund an amount determined by the Director, as nearly as
          may be administratively feasible, to reflect the amount by
          which the retired participant's annuity would have been
          reduced if the election had been in effect since the date the
          annuity commenced, plus interest.
            (II) The annual rate of interest for each year during which
          the retired participant's annuity would have been reduced if
          the election had been in effect since the date the annuity
          commenced shall be 6 percent.
            (III) If the retired participant does not make the deposit,
          the Director shall collect such amount by offset against the
          participant's annuity, up to a maximum of 25 percent of the
          net annuity otherwise payable to the retired participant, and
          the retired participant is deemed to consent to such offset.
            (IV) The deposit required by this subparagraph may be made
          by the surviving spouse of the retired participant.
        (C) Effects of election
          An election under this paragraph and the reduction in the
        participant's annuity shall be effective on the first day of
        the month beginning 9 months after the date of remarriage. A
        survivor annuity elected under this paragraph shall be treated
        in all respects as a survivor annuity under subsection (b) of
        this section.
    (h) Coordination of annuities
      (1) Surviving spouse
        A surviving spouse whose survivor annuity was terminated
      because of remarriage before attaining age 55 shall not be
      entitled under subsection (b)(3)(C) of this section to the
      restoration of that survivor annuity payable from the fund unless
      the surviving spouse elects to receive it instead of any other
      survivor annuity to which the surviving spouse may be entitled
      under the system or any other retirement system for Government
      employees by reason of the remarriage.
      (2) Former spouse
        A surviving former spouse of a participant or retired
      participant shall not become entitled under section 2032(b) or
      2034 of this title to a survivor annuity or to the restoration of
      a survivor annuity payable from the fund unless the surviving
      former spouse elects to receive it instead of any other survivor
      annuity to which the surviving former spouse may be entitled
      under this or any other retirement system for Government
      employees on the basis of a marriage to someone other than the
      participant.
      (3) Surviving spouse of post-retirement marriage
        A surviving spouse who married a participant after the
      participant's retirement shall be entitled to a survivor annuity
      payable from the fund only upon electing that annuity instead of
      any other survivor annuity to which the surviving spouse may be
      entitled under this or any other retirement system for Government
      employees on the basis of a marriage to someone other than the
      retired participant.
    (i) Supplemental survivor annuities
      (1) Spouse of recalled annuitant
        A married recalled annuitant who reverts to retired status with
      entitlement to a supplemental annuity under section 2111(b) of
      this title shall, unless the annuitant and the annuitant's spouse
      jointly elect in writing to the contrary at the time of reversion
      to retired status, have the supplemental annuity reduced by 10
      percent to provide a supplemental survivor annuity for the
      annuitant's spouse. Such supplemental survivor annuity shall be
      equal to 55 percent of the supplemental annuity of the annuitant.
      (2) Regulations
        The Director shall prescribe regulations to provide for the
      application of paragraph (1) of this subsection and of subsection
      (b) of section 2111 of this title in any case in which an
      annuitant has a former spouse who was married to the recalled
      annuitant at any time during the period of recall service and who
      qualifies for an annuity under section 2032(b) of this title.
    (j) Offset of annuities by amount of social security benefit
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, an
    annuity (including a disability annuity) payable under this
    subchapter to an individual described in sections 2021(d)(1) and
    2151(c)(1) of this title and any survivor annuity payable under
    this subchapter on the basis of the service of such individual
    shall be reduced in a manner consistent with section 8349 of title
    5, under conditions consistent with the conditions prescribed in
    that section.
    (k) Information from other agencies
      (1) Other agencies
        For the purpose of ensuring the accuracy of the information
      used in the determination of eligibility for and the computation
      of annuities payable from the fund under this subchapter, at the
      request of the Director -

      Director determines is necessary.
      (3) Limitation on uses of information
        The Director, in consultation with the officials from whom
      information is requested, shall ensure that information made
      available under this subsection is used only for the purposes
      authorized.

      The Director shall, on an annual basis -

      of election under subsections (c), (f)(2), and (g) of this
      section; and

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2032. Annuities for former spouses

-STATUTE-
    (a) Former spouse share of participant's annuity
      (1) Pro rata share
        Unless otherwise expressly provided by a spousal agreement or
      court order under section 2094(b) of this title, a former spouse
      of a participant, former participant, or retired participant is
      entitled to an annuity - 
          (A) if married to the participant, former participant, or
        retired participant throughout the creditable service of the
        participant, equal to 50 percent of the annuity of the
        participant; or
          (B) if not married to the participant throughout such
        creditable service, equal to that proportion of 50 percent of
        such annuity that is the proportion that the number of days of
        the marriage of the former spouse to the participant during
        periods of creditable service of such participant under this
        subchapter bears to the total number of days of such creditable
        service.
      (2) Disqualification upon remarriage before age 55
        A former spouse is not qualified for an annuity under this
      subsection if before the commencement of that annuity the former
      spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age.
      (3) Commencement of annuity
        The annuity of a former spouse under this subsection commences
      on the day the participant upon whose service the annuity is
      based becomes entitled to an annuity under this subchapter or on
      the first day of the month after the divorce or annulment
      involved becomes final, whichever is later.
      (4) Termination of annuity
        The annuity of such former spouse and the right thereto
      terminate on - 
          (A) the last day of the month before the month in which the
        former spouse dies or remarries before 55 years of age; or
          (B) the date on which the annuity of the participant
        terminates (except in the case of an annuity subject to
        paragraph (5)(B)).
      (5) Treatment of participant's annuity
        (A) Reduction in participant's annuity
          The annuity payable to any participant shall be reduced by
        the amount of an annuity under this subsection paid to any
        former spouse based upon the service of that participant. Such
        reduction shall be disregarded in calculating - 
            (i) the survivor annuity for any spouse, former spouse, or
          other survivor under this subchapter; and
            (ii) any reduction in the annuity of the participant to
          provide survivor benefits under subsection (b) of this
          section or under section 2031(b) of this title.
        (B) Treatment when annuitant returns to service
          If an annuitant whose annuity is reduced under subparagraph
        (A) is recalled to service under section 2111 of this title, or
        reinstated or reappointed, in the case of a recovered
        disability annuitant, or if any annuitant is reemployed as
        provided for under sections 2112 and 2113 of this title, the
        pay of that annuitant shall be reduced by the same amount as
        the annuity would have been reduced if it had continued.
        Amounts equal to the reductions under this subparagraph shall
        be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit
        of the fund.
      (6) Disability annuitant
        Notwithstanding paragraph (3), in the case of a former spouse
      of a disability annuitant - 
          (A) the annuity of that former spouse shall commence on the
        date on which the participant would qualify on the basis of the
        participant's creditable service for an annuity under this
        subchapter (other than a disability annuity) or the date on
        which the disability annuity begins, whichever is later, and
          (B) the amount of the annuity of the former spouse shall be
        calculated on the basis of the annuity for which the
        participant would otherwise so qualify.
      (7) Election of benefits
        A former spouse of a participant, former participant, or
      retired participant shall not become entitled under this
      subsection to an annuity payable from the fund unless the former
      spouse elects to receive it instead of any survivor annuity to
      which the former spouse may be entitled under this or any other
      retirement system for Government employees on the basis of a
      marriage to someone other than the participant.
      (8) Limitation in case of multiple former spouse annuities
        No spousal agreement or court order under section 2094(b) of
      this title involving a participant may provide for an annuity or
      a combination of annuities under this subsection that exceeds the
      annuity of the participant.
    (b) Former spouse survivor annuity
      (1) Pro rata share
        Subject to any election under section 2031(b)(1)(B) and (C) of
      this title and unless otherwise expressly provided by a spousal
      agreement or court order under section 2094(b) of this title, if
      an annuitant is survived by a former spouse, the former spouse
      shall be entitled - 
          (A) if married to the annuitant throughout the creditable
        service of the annuitant, to a survivor annuity equal to 55
        percent of the unreduced amount of the annuitant's annuity, as
        computed under section 2031(a) of this title; and
          (B) if not married to the annuitant throughout such
        creditable service, to a survivor annuity equal to that
        proportion of 55 percent of the unreduced amount of such
        annuity that is the proportion that the number of days of the
        marriage of the former spouse to the participant during periods
        of creditable service of such participant under this subchapter
        bears to the total number of days of such creditable service.
      (2) Disqualification upon remarriage before age 55
        A former spouse shall not be qualified for an annuity under
      this subsection if before the commencement of that annuity the
      former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age.
      (3) Commencement, termination, and restoration of annuity
        An annuity payable from the fund under this subchapter to a
      surviving former spouse under this subsection shall commence on
      the day after the annuitant dies and shall terminate on the last
      day of the month before the former spouse's death or remarriage
      before attaining age 55. If such a survivor annuity is terminated
      because of remarriage, it shall be restored at the same rate
      commencing on the date such remarriage is dissolved by death,
      annulment, or divorce if any lump sum paid upon termination of
      the annuity is returned to the fund.
      (4) Survivor annuity amount
        (A) Maximum amount
          The maximum survivor annuity or combination of survivor
        annuities under this subsection (and section 2031(b)(3) of this
        title) with respect to any participant may not exceed 55
        percent of the full amount of the participant's annuity, as
        calculated under section 2031(a) of this title.
        (B) Limitation on other survivor annuities based on service of
          same participant
          Once a survivor annuity has been provided under this
        subsection for any former spouse, a survivor annuity for
        another individual may thereafter be provided under this
        subsection (or section 2031(b)(3) of this title) with respect
        to the participant only for that portion (if any) of the
        maximum available which is not committed for survivor benefits
        for any former spouse whose prospective right to such annuity
        has not terminated by reason of death or remarriage.
        (C) Finality of court order upon death of participant
          After the death of a participant or retired participant, a
        court order under section 2094(b) of this title may not adjust
        the amount of the annuity of a former spouse of that
        participant or retired participant under this section.
      (5) Effect of termination of former spouse entitlement
        (A) Recomputation of participant's annuity
          If a former spouse of a retired participant dies or remarries
        before attaining age 55, the annuity of the retired
        participant, if reduced to provide a survivor annuity for that
        former spouse, shall be recomputed and paid, effective on the
        first day of the month beginning after such death or
        remarriage, as if the annuity had not been so reduced, unless
        an election is in effect under subparagraph (B).
        (B) Election of spouse annuity
          Subject to paragraph (4)(B), the participant may elect in
        writing within one year after receipt of notice of the death or
        remarriage of the former spouse to continue the reduction in
        order to provide a higher survivor annuity under section
        2031(b)(3) of this title for any spouse of the participant.
    (c) Optional additional survivor annuities for other former spouse
      or surviving spouse
      (1) In general
        In the case of any participant providing a survivor annuity
      under subsection (b) of this section for a former spouse - 
          (A) such participant may elect, or
          (B) a spousal agreement or court order under section 2094(b)
        of this title may provide for,

      an additional survivor annuity under this subsection for any
      other former spouse or spouse surviving the participant, if the
      participant satisfactorily passes a physical examination as
      prescribed by the Director.
      (2) Limitation
        Neither the total amount of survivor annuity or annuities under
      this subsection with respect to any participant, nor the survivor
      annuity or annuities for any one surviving spouse or former
      spouse of such participant under this section or section 2031 of
      this title, may exceed 55 percent of the unreduced amount of the
      participant's annuity, as computed under section 2031(a) of this
      title.
      (3) Contribution for additional annuities
        (A) Provision of additional survivor annuity
          In accordance with regulations which the Director shall
        prescribe, the participant involved may provide for any annuity
        under this subsection - 
            (i) by a reduction in the annuity or an allotment from the
          basic pay of the participant;
            (ii) by a lump-sum payment or installment payments to the
          fund; or
            (iii) by any combination thereof.
        (B) Actuarial equivalence to benefit
          The present value of the total amount to accrue to the fund
        under subparagraph (A) to provide any annuity under this
        subsection shall be actuarially equivalent in value to such
        annuity, as calculated upon such tables of mortality as may
        from time to time be prescribed for this purpose by the
        Director.
        (C) Effect of former spouse's death or disqualification
          If a former spouse predeceases the participant or remarries
        before attaining age 55 (or, in the case of a spouse, the
        spouse predeceases the participant or does not qualify as a
        former spouse upon dissolution of the marriage) - 
            (i) if an annuity reduction or pay allotment under
          subparagraph (A) is in effect for that spouse or former
          spouse, the annuity shall be recomputed and paid as if it had
          not been reduced or the pay allotment terminated, as the case
          may be; and
            (ii) any amount accruing to the fund under subparagraph (A)
          shall be refunded, but only to the extent that such amount
          may have exceeded the actuarial cost of providing benefits
          under this subsection for the period such benefits were
          provided, as determined under regulations prescribed by the
          Director.
        (D) Recomputation upon death or remarriage of former spouse
          Under regulations prescribed by the Director, an annuity
        shall be recomputed (or a pay allotment terminated or
        adjusted), and a refund provided (if appropriate), in a manner
        comparable to that provided under subparagraph (C), in order to
        reflect a termination or reduction of future benefits under
        this subsection for a spouse in the event a former spouse of
        the participant dies or remarries before attaining age 55 and
        an increased annuity is provided for that spouse in accordance
        with this section.
      (4) Commencement and termination of additional survivor annuity
        An annuity payable under this subsection to a spouse or former
      spouse shall commence on the day after the participant dies and
      shall terminate on the last day of the month before the spouse's
      or the former spouse's death or remarriage before attaining age
      55.
      (5) Nonapplicability of COLA provision
        Section 2131 of this title does not apply to an annuity under
      this subsection, unless authorized under regulations prescribed
      by the Director.

        Retirement and Disability System or any other retirement system
        for Government employees on the basis of a marriage to someone

          application under clause (i), the appropriate annuity shall
          be payable to the former wife or husband with respect to all
          periods before such approval during which the former wife or

      wife or husband of a participant under the Central Intelligence

        participant's annuity, as computed under section 2031(a) of
        this title; or
          (B) the unreduced amount of what such annuity as so computed

      former spouse under section 2033 of this title.
    (b) Limitations
      A former spouse is not entitled to a survivor annuity under this
    section if -

        Upon approval of an application provided under paragraph (1),
      the appropriate survivor annuity shall be payable to the former
      spouse with respect to all periods before such approval during

        A former spouse of a participant or retired participant shall
      not become entitled under this section to an annuity or to the
      restoration of an annuity payable from the fund unless the former

      which the former spouse may be entitled under this or any other

      marriage to someone other than the participant.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2051. Retirement for disability or incapacity; medical
      examination; recovery

-STATUTE-
    (a) Disability retirement
      (1) Eligibility
        A participant who has become disabled shall, upon the
      participant's own application or upon order of the Director, be
      retired on an annuity computed under subsection (b) of this
      section.
      (2) Standard for disability determination
        A participant shall be considered to be disabled only if the
      participant - 
          (A) is found by the Director to be unable, because of disease
        or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the
        participant's position; and
          (B) is not qualified for reassignment, under procedures
        prescribed by the Director, to a vacant position in the Agency
        at the same grade or level and in which the participant would
        be able to render useful and efficient service.
      (3) Time limit for application
        (A) One year requirement
          A claim may be allowed under this section only if the
        application is submitted before the participant is separated
        from the Agency or within one year thereafter.
        (B) Waiver for mentally incompetent participant
          The time limitation may be waived by the Director for a
        participant who, at the date of separation from the Agency or
        within one year thereafter, is mentally incompetent, if the
        application is filed with the Agency within one year from the
        date of restoration of the participant to competency or the
        appointment of a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.
    (b) Computation of disability annuity
      (1) In general
        Except as provided in paragraph (2), an annuity payable under
      subsection (a) of this section shall be computed under section
      2031(a) of this title. However, if the disabled or incapacitated
      participant has less than 20 years of service credit toward
      retirement under the system at the time of retirement, the
      annuity shall be computed on the assumption that the participant
      has had 20 years of service, but the additional service credit
      that may accrue to a participant under this paragraph may not
      exceed the difference between the participant's age at the time
      of retirement and age 60.
      (2) Coordination with military retired pay and veterans'
        compensation and pension
        If a participant retiring under this section is receiving
      retired pay or retainer pay for military service (except that
      specified in section 2082(e)(3) of this title) or Department of
      Veterans Affairs compensation or pension in lieu of such retired
      or retainer pay, the annuity of that participant shall be
      computed under section 2031(a) of this title, excluding credit
      for such military service from that computation. If the amount of
      the annuity so computed, plus the retired or retainer pay which
      is received, or which would be received but for the application
      of the limitation in section 5532 (!1) of title 5, or the
      Department of Veterans Affairs compensation or pension in lieu of
      such retired or retainer pay, is less than the annuity that would
      be payable under this section in the absence of the previous
      sentence, an amount equal to the difference shall be added to the
      annuity payable under section 2031(a) of this title.

    (c) Medical examinations
      (1) Medical examination required for determination of disability
        In each case, the participant shall be given a medical
      examination by one or more duly qualified physicians or surgeons
      designated by the Director to conduct examinations, and
      disability shall be determined by the Director on the basis of
      the advice of such physicians or surgeons.
      (2) Annual reexaminations until age 60
        Unless the disability is permanent, like examinations shall be
      made annually until the annuitant becomes age 60. If the Director
      determines on the basis of the advice of one or more duly
      qualified physicians or surgeons conducting such examinations
      that an annuitant has recovered to the extent that the annuitant
      can return to duty, the annuitant may apply for reinstatement or
      reappointment in the Agency within one year from the date the
      annuitant's recovery is determined.
      (3) Reinstatement
        Upon application, the Director may reinstate any such recovered
      disability annuitant in the grade held at time of retirement, or
      the Director may, taking into consideration the age,
      qualifications, and experience of such annuitant, and the present
      grade of the annuitant's contemporaries in the Agency, appoint
      the annuitant to a grade higher than the one held before
      retirement.
      (4) Termination of disability annuity
        Payment of the annuity shall continue until a date one year
      after the date of examination showing recovery or until the date
      of reinstatement or reappointment in the Agency, whichever is
      earlier.
      (5) Payment of fees
        Fees for examinations under this subsection, together with
      reasonable traveling and other expenses incurred in order to
      submit to examination, may be paid out of the fund.
      (6) Suspension of annuity pending required examination
        If the annuitant fails to submit to examination as required
      under this section, payment of the annuity shall be suspended
      until continuance of the disability is satisfactorily
      established.
      (7) Termination of annuity upon restoration of earning capacity
        If the annuitant receiving a disability retirement annuity is
      restored to earning capacity before becoming age 60, payment of
      the annuity terminates on reemployment by the Government or 180
      days after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity
      is restored, whichever is earlier. Earning capacity shall be
      considered to be restored if in any calendar year the income of
      the annuitant from wages or self-employment, or both, equals at
      least 80 percent of the current rate of pay for the grade and
      step the annuitant held at the time of retirement.
    (d) Treatment of recovered disability annuitant who is not
      reinstated
      (1) Separation
        If a recovered or restored disability annuitant whose annuity
      is discontinued is for any reason not reinstated or reappointed
      in the Agency, the annuitant shall be considered, except for
      service credit, to have been separated within the meaning of
      section 2054 of this title as of the date of termination of the
      disability annuity.
      (2) Retirement
        After such termination, the recovered or restored annuitant
      shall be entitled to the benefits of section 2054 or 2071(a) of
      this title, except that the annuitant may elect voluntary
      retirement under section 2053 of this title, if qualified
      thereunder, or may be placed by the Director in an involuntary
      retirement status under section 2055(a) of this title, if
      qualified thereunder. Retirement rights under this paragraph
      shall be based on the provisions of this subchapter in effect as
      of the date on which the disability annuity is discontinued.
      (3) Further disability before age 62
        If, based on a current medical examination, the Director
      determines that a recovered annuitant has, before reaching age
      62, again become totally disabled due to recurrence of the
      disability for which the annuitant was originally retired, the
      annuitant's terminated disability annuity (same type and rate)
      shall be reinstated from the date of such medical examination. If
      a restored-to-earning-capacity annuitant has not medically
      recovered from the disability for which retired and establishes
      to the Director's satisfaction that the annuitant's income from
      wages and self-employment in any calendar year before reaching
      age 62 was less than 80 percent of the rate of pay for the grade
      and step the annuitant held at the time of retirement, the
      annuitant's terminated disability annuity (same type and rate)
      shall be reinstated from the first of the next following year. If
      the annuitant has been allowed an involuntary or voluntary
      retirement annuity in the meantime, the annuitant's reinstated
      disability annuity shall be substituted for it unless the
      annuitant elects to retain the former benefit.
    (e) Coordination of benefits
      (1) Workers' compensation
        A participant is not entitled to receive for the same period of
      time - 
          (A) an annuity under this subchapter, and
          (B) compensation for injury to, or disability of, such
        participant under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5, other
        than compensation payable under section 8107 of such title.
      (2) Survivor annuities
        An individual is not entitled to receive an annuity under this
      subchapter and a concurrent benefit under subchapter I of chapter
      81 of title 5 on account of the death of the same person.
      (3) Greater benefit
        Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not bar the right of a claimant to
      the greater benefit conferred by either this subchapter or
      subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5.
    (f) Offset from survivor annuity for workers' compensation payment
      (1) Refund to Department of Labor
        If an individual is entitled to an annuity under this
      subchapter and the individual receives a lump-sum payment for
      compensation under section 8135 of title 5 based on the
      disability or death of the same person, so much of the
      compensation as has been paid for a period extended beyond the
      date payment of the annuity commences, as determined by the
      Secretary of Labor, shall be refunded to the Department for
      credit to the Employees' Compensation Fund. Before the individual
      may receive the annuity, the individual shall - 
          (A) refund to the Secretary of Labor the amount representing
        the commuted compensation payments for the extended period; or
          (B) authorize the deduction of the amount from the annuity.
      (2) Source of deduction
        Deductions from the annuity may be made from accrued or
      accruing payments. The amounts deducted and withheld from the
      annuity shall be transmitted to the Secretary for reimbursement
      to the Employees' Compensation Fund.
      (3) Prorating deduction
        If the Secretary finds that the financial circumstances of an
      individual entitled to an annuity under this subchapter warrant
      deferred refunding, deductions from the annuity may be prorated
      against and paid from accruing payments in such manner as the
      Secretary determines appropriate.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Return of contributions when no annuity payable
      If a participant dies and no claim for an annuity is payable
    under this subchapter, the participant's lump-sum credit and any
    voluntary contributions made under section 2121 of this title, with
    interest, shall be paid in the order of precedence shown in section
    2071(c) of this title.
    (b) Survivor annuity for surviving spouse or former spouse
      (1) In general
        If a participant dies before separation or retirement from the
      Agency and is survived by a spouse or by a former spouse
      qualifying for a survivor annuity under section 2032(b) of this
      title, such surviving spouse shall be entitled to an annuity
      equal to 55 percent of the annuity computed in accordance with
      paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection and section 2031(a) of
      this title, and any such surviving former spouse shall be
      entitled to an annuity computed in accordance with section
      2032(b) of this title and paragraph (2) of this subsection as if
      the participant died after being entitled to an annuity under
      this subchapter. The annuity of such surviving spouse or former
      spouse shall commence on the day after the participant dies and
      shall terminate on the last day of the month before the death or
      remarriage before attaining age 55 of the surviving spouse or
      former spouse (subject to the payment and restoration provisions
      of sections 2031(b)(3)(C), 2031(h), and 2032(b)(3) of this
      title).
      (2) Computation
        The annuity payable under paragraph (1) shall be computed in
      accordance with section 2031(a) of this title, except that the
      computation of the annuity of the participant under such section
      shall be at least the smaller of (A) 40 percent of the
      participant's high-3 average pay, or (B) the sum obtained under
      such section after increasing the participant's length of service
      by the difference between the participant's age at the time of
      death and age 60.
      (3) Limitation
        Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if the participant had a former
      spouse qualifying for an annuity under section 2032(b) of this
      title, the annuity of a surviving spouse under this section shall
      be subject to the limitation of section 2031(b)(3)(B) of this
      title, and the annuity of a former spouse under this section
      shall be subject to the limitation of section 2032(b)(4)(B) of
      this title.
      (4) Precedence of section 2034 survivor annuity over death-in-
        service annuity
        If a former spouse who is eligible for a death-in-service
      annuity under this section is or becomes eligible for an annuity
      under section 2034 of this title, the annuity provided under this
      section shall not be payable and shall be superseded by the
      annuity under section 2034 of this title.
    (c) Annuities for surviving children
      (1) Participants dying before April 1, 1992
        In the case of a participant who before April 1, 1992, died
      before separation or retirement from the Agency and who was
      survived by a child or children - 
          (A) if the participant was survived by a spouse, there shall
        be paid from the fund to or on behalf of each such surviving
        child an annuity determined under section 2031(d)(3)(A) of this
        title; and
          (B) if the participant was not survived by a spouse, there
        shall be paid from the fund to or on behalf of each such
        surviving child an annuity determined under section
        2031(d)(3)(B) of this title.
      (2) Participants dying on or after April 1, 1992
        In the case of a participant who on or after April 1, 1992,
      dies before separation or retirement from the Agency and who is
      survived by a child or children - 
          (A) if the participant is survived by a spouse or former
        spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2071. Lump-sum payments

-STATUTE-
    (a) Entitlement to lump-sum credit
      Subject to section 2082(d) of this title and subsection (b) of
    this section, a participant who - 
        (1) is separated from the Agency for at least 31 consecutive
      days and is not transferred to employment covered by another
      retirement system for Government employees;
        (2) files an application with the Director for payment of the
      lump-sum credit;
        (3) is not reemployed in a position in which the participant is
      subject to this subchapter at the time the participant files the
      application; and
        (4) will not become eligible to receive an annuity under this
      subchapter within 31 days after filing the application,

    is entitled to be paid the lump-sum credit. Receipt of the payment
    of the lump-sum credit by the former participant voids all annuity
    rights under this subchapter based on the service on which the lump-
    sum credit is based, until the former participant is reemployed in
    service subject to this subchapter.
    (b) Conditions for payment of lump-sum credit
      (1) In general
        Whenever a former participant becomes entitled to receive
      payment of the lump-sum credit under subsection (a) of this
      section, such lump-sum credit shall be paid to the former
      participant and to any former spouse or former wife or husband of
      the former participant in accordance with paragraphs (2) through
      (4). The former participant's lump-sum credit shall be reduced by
      the amount of the lump-sum credit payable to any former spouse or
      former wife or husband.
      (2) Pro rata share for former spouse
        Unless otherwise expressly provided by any spousal agreement or
      court order under section 2094(b) of this title, a former spouse
      of the former participant shall be entitled to receive a share of
      such participant's lump-sum credit - 
          (A) if married to the participant throughout the period of
        creditable service of the participant, equal to 50 percent of
        such lump-sum credit; or
          (B) if not married to the participant throughout such
        creditable service, equal to a proportion of 50 percent of such
        lump-sum credit which is the proportion that the number of days
        of the marriage of the former spouse to the participant during
        periods of creditable service of such participant bears to the
        total number of days of such creditable service.
      (3) Share for former wife or husband
        Payment of the former participant's lump-sum credit shall be
      subject to the terms of a court order under section 2094(c) of
      this title concerning any former wife or husband of the former
      participant if - 
          (A) the court order expressly relates to any portion of such
        lump-sum credit; and
          (B) payment of the lump-sum credit would extinguish
        entitlement of such former wife or husband to a survivor
        annuity under section 2036 of this title or to any portion of
        the participant's annuity under section 2094(c) of this title.
      (4) Notification
        A lump-sum credit may be paid to or for the benefit of a former
      participant - 
          (A) only upon written notification to (i) the current spouse,
        if any, (ii) any former spouse, and (iii) any former wife or
        husband who has a court order covered by paragraph (3); and
          (B) only if the express written concurrence of the current
        spouse has been received by the Director.

      This paragraph may be waived under circumstances described in
      section 2031(b)(1)(D) of this title.
    (c) Order of precedence of payment
      A lump-sum payment authorized by subsection (d) or (e) of this
    section 2121(d) (!1) of this title and a payment of any accrued and
    unpaid annuity authorized by subsection (f) of this section shall
    be paid in the following order of precedence to individuals
    surviving the participant and alive on the date entitlement to the
    payment arises, upon establishment of a valid claim therefor, and
    such payment bars recovery by any other individual:

        (1) To the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by such
      participant in a signed and witnessed writing received by the
      Director before the participant's death. For this purpose, a
      designation, change, or cancellation of beneficiary in a will or
      other document not so executed and filed with the Director shall
      have no force or effect.
        (2) If there is no designated beneficiary, to the surviving
      wife or husband of such participant.
        (3) If none of the above, to the child or children of such
      participant and descendent of deceased children by
      representation.
        (4) If none of the above, to the parents of such participant or
      the survivor of them.
        (5) If none of the above, to the duly appointed executor or
      administrator of the estate of such participant.
        (6) If none of the above, to such other next of kin of such
      participant as the Director determines to be legally entitled to
      such payment.
    (d) Death of former participant before retirement
      (1) In general
        Except as provided in paragraph (2), if a former participant
      eligible for a deferred annuity under section 2054 of this title
      dies before reaching age 62, such former participant's lump-sum
      credit shall be paid in accordance with subsection (c) of this
      section.
      (2) Limitation
        In any case where there is a surviving former spouse or
      surviving former wife or husband of such participant who is
      entitled to a share of such participant's lump-sum credit under
      paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (b) of this section, the
      lump-sum credit payable under paragraph (1) shall be reduced by
      the lump-sum credit payable to such former spouse or former wife
      or husband.
    (e) Termination of all annuity rights
      If all annuity rights under this subchapter based on the service
    of a deceased participant or annuitant terminate before the total

    paid in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.

    death, of the annuity of a survivor annuitant shall be paid to that
    individual. An annuity accrued and unpaid on the death of a
    survivor annuitant shall be paid in the following order of
    precedence, and the payment bars recovery by any other individual:
        (1) To the duly appointed executor or administrator of the
      estate of the survivor annuitant.
        (2) If there is no executor or administrator, to such next of
      kin of the survivor annuitant as the Director determines to be
      legally entitled to such payment, except that no payment shall be
      made under this paragraph until after the expiration of 30 days
      from the date of death of the survivor annuitant.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2081. Computation of length of service

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      (1) Crediting service as participant
        For the purposes of this subchapter, the period of service of a
      participant shall be computed from the date on which the
      participant becomes a participant under this subchapter.
      (2) Exclusion of certain periods
        In computing the period of service of a participant, all
      periods of separation from the Agency and so much of any leave of
      absence without pay as may exceed six months in the aggregate in
      any calendar year shall be excluded, except leaves of absence
      while receiving benefits under chapter 81 of title 5 and leaves
      of absence granted participants while performing active and
      honorable service in the Armed Forces.
      (3) Crediting certain periods of separation
        A participant or former participant who returns to Government
      duty after a period of separation shall have included in the
      participant or former participant's period of service that part
      of the period of separation in which the participant or former
      participant was receiving benefits under chapter 81 of title 5.
    (b) Extra credit for periods served at unhealthful posts overseas
      (1) Classification of certain posts as unhealthful
        The Director may from time to time establish a list of places
      outside the United States that, by reason of climatic or other
      extreme conditions, are to be classed as unhealthful posts. Such
      list shall be established in consultation with the Secretary of
      State.
      (2) Extra credit
        Each year of duty at a post on the list established under
      paragraph (1), inclusive of regular leaves of absence, shall be
      counted as one and a half years in computing the length of
      service of a participant under this subchapter for the purpose of
      retirement. In computing such service, any fractional month shall
      be treated as a full month.
      (3) Coordination with benefits under title 5
        Extra credit for service at an unhealthful post may not be
      credited to a participant who is paid a differential under
      section 5925 or 5928 of title 5 for the same service.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2082. Prior service credit

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      A participant may, subject to the provisions of this section,
    include in the participant's period of service - 
        (1) civilian service in the Government before becoming a
      participant that would be creditable toward retirement under
      subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5 (as determined under
      section 8332(b) of such title); and
        (2) honorable active service in the Armed Forces before the
      date of the separation upon which eligibility for an annuity is
      based, or honorable active service in the Regular or Reserve
      Corps of the Public Health Service after June 30, 1960, or as a
      commissioned officer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
      Administration after June 30, 1961.
    (b) Limitations
      (1) In general
        Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), the total service
      of any participant shall exclude - 
          (A) any period of civilian service on or after October 1,
        1982, for which retirement deductions or deposits have not been
        made,
          (B) any period of service for which a refund of contributions
        has been made, or
          (C) any period of service for which contributions were not
        transferred pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section;

      unless the participant makes a deposit to the fund in an amount
      equal to the percentages of basic pay received for such service
      as specified in the table contained in section 8334(c) of title
      5, together with interest computed in accordance with section
      8334(e) of such title. The deposit may be made in one or more
      installments (including by allotment from pay), as determined by
      the Director.
      (2) Effect of retirement deductions not made
        If a participant has not paid a deposit for civilian service
      performed before October 1, 1982, for which retirement deductions
      were not made, such participant's annuity shall be reduced by 10
      percent of the deposit described in paragraph (1) remaining
      unpaid, unless the participant elects to eliminate the service
      involved for the purpose of the annuity computation.
      (3) Effect of refund of retirement contributions
        A participant who received a refund of retirement contributions
      under this or any other retirement system for Government
      employees covering service for which the participant may be
      allowed credit under this subchapter may deposit the amount
      received, with interest computed under paragraph (1). Credit may
      not be allowed for the service covered by the refund until the
      deposit is made, except that a participant who - 
          (A) separated from Government service before October 1, 1990,
        and received a refund of the participant's retirement
        contributions covering a period of service ending before
        October 1, 1990;
          (B) is entitled to an annuity under this subchapter (other
        than a disability annuity) which commences after December 1,
        1992; and
          (C) does not make the deposit required to receive credit for
        the service covered by the refund;

      shall be entitled to an annuity actuarially reduced in accordance
      with section 8334(d)(2)(B) of title 5.
      (4) Entitlement under another system
        Credit toward retirement under the system shall not be allowed
      for any period of civilian service on the basis of which the
      participant is receiving (or will in the future be entitled to
      receive) an annuity under another retirement system for
      Government employees, unless the right to such annuity is waived
      and a deposit is made under paragraph (1) covering that period of
      service, or a transfer is made pursuant to subsection (c) of this
      section.
    (c) Transfer from other Government retirement systems
      (1) In general
        If an employee who is under another retirement system for
      Government employees becomes a participant in the system by
      direct transfer, the Government's contributions (including
      interest accrued thereon computed in accordance with section
      8334(e) of title 5) under such retirement system on behalf of the
      employee as well as such employee's total contributions and
      deposits (including interest accrued thereon), except voluntary
      contributions, shall be transferred to the employee's credit in
      the fund effective as of the date such employee becomes a
      participant in the system.
      (2) Consent of employee
        Each such employee shall be deemed to consent to the transfer
      of such funds, and such transfer shall be a complete discharge
      and acquittance of all claims and demands against the other
      Government retirement fund on account of service rendered before
      becoming a participant in the system.
      (3) Additional contributions; refunds
        A participant whose contributions are transferred pursuant to
      paragraph (1) shall not be required to make additional
      contributions for periods of service for which full contributions
      were made to the other Government retirement fund, nor shall any
      refund be made to any such participant on account of
      contributions made during any period to the other Government
      retirement fund at a higher rate than that fixed for employees by
      section 8334(c) of title 5 for contributions to the fund.
    (d) Transfer to other Government retirement systems
      (1) In general
        If a participant in the system becomes an employee under
      another Government retirement system by direct transfer to
      employment covered by such system, the Government's contributions
      (including interest accrued thereon computed in accordance with
      section 8334(e) of title 5) to the fund on the participant's
      behalf as well as the participant's total contributions and
      deposits (including interest accrued thereon), except voluntary
      contributions, shall be transferred to the participant's credit
      in the fund of such other retirement system effective as of the
      date on which the participant becomes eligible to participate in
      such other retirement system.
      (2) Consent of employee
        Each such employee shall be deemed to consent to the transfer
      of such funds, and such transfer shall be a complete discharge
      and acquittance of all claims and demands against the fund on
      account of service rendered before the participant's becoming
      eligible for participation in that other system.
    (e) Prior military service credit
      (1) Application to obtain credit
        If a deposit required to obtain credit for prior military
      service described in subsection (a)(2) of this section was not
      made to another Government retirement fund and transferred under
      subsection (c)(1) of this section, the participant may obtain
      credit for such military service, subject to the provisions of
      this subsection and subsections (f) through (h) of this section,
      by applying for it to the Director before retirement or
      separation from the Agency.
      (2) Employment starting before, on, or after October 1, 1982
        Except as provided in paragraph (3) - 
          (A) the service of a participant who first became a Federal
        employee before October 1, 1982, shall include credit for each
        period of military service performed before the date of
        separation on which entitlement to an annuity under this
        subchapter is based, subject to subsection (f) of this section;
        and
          (B) the service of a participant who first becomes a Federal
        employee on or after October 1, 1982, shall include credit for -
         
            (i) each period of military service performed before
          January 1, 1957, and
            (ii) each period of military service performed after
          December 31, 1956, and before the separation on which
          entitlement to an annuity under this subchapter is based,
          only if a deposit (with interest, if any) is made with
          respect to that period, as provided in subsection (h) of this
          section.
      (3) Effect of receipt of military retired pay
        In the case of a participant who is entitled to retired pay
      based on a period of military service, the participant's service
      may not include credit for such period of military service unless
      the retired pay is paid - 
          (A) on account of a service-connected disability - 
            (i) incurred in combat with an enemy of the United States;
          or
            (ii) caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in
          the line of duty during a period of war (as defined in
          section 1101 of title 38); or

          (B) under chapter 67 (!1) of title 10.

      (4) Survivor annuity
        Notwithstanding paragraph (3), the survivor annuity of a
      survivor of a participant - 
          (A) who was awarded retired pay based on any period of
        military service, and
          (B) whose death occurs before separation from the Agency,

      shall be computed in accordance with section 8332(c)(3) of title
      5.
    (f) Effect of entitlement to social security benefits
      (1) In general
        Notwithstanding any other provision of this section (except
      paragraph (3) of this subsection) or section 2083 of this title,
      any military service (other than military service covered by
      military leave with pay from a civilian position) performed by a
      participant after December 1956 shall be excluded in determining
      the aggregate period of service on which an annuity payable under
      this subchapter to such participant or to the participant's
      spouse, former spouse, previous spouse, or child is based, if
      such participant, spouse, former spouse, previous spouse, or
      child is entitled (or would upon proper application be entitled),
      at the time of such determination, to monthly old-age or
      survivors' insurance benefits under section 402 of title 42,
      based on such participant's wages and self-employment income. If
      the military service is not excluded under the preceding
      sentence, but upon attaining age 62, the participant or spouse,
      former spouse, or previous spouse becomes entitled (or would upon
      proper application be entitled) to such benefits, the aggregate
      period of service on which the annuity is based shall be
      redetermined, effective as of the first day of the month in which
      the participant or spouse, former spouse, or previous spouse
      attains age 62, so as to exclude such service.
      (2) Limitation
        The provisions of paragraph (1) relating to credit for military
      service do not apply to - 
          (A) any period of military service of a participant with
        respect to which the participant has made a deposit with
        interest, if any, under subsection (h) of this section; or
          (B) the military service of any participant described in
        subsection (e)(2)(B) of this section.
      (3) Effect of entitlement before September 8, 1982
        (A) The annuity recomputation required by paragraph (1) shall
      not apply to any participant who was entitled to an annuity under
      this subchapter on or before September 8, 1982, or who is
      entitled to a deferred annuity based on separation from the
      Agency occurring on or before such date. Instead of an annuity
      recomputation, the annuity of such participant shall be reduced
      at age 62 by an amount equal to a fraction of the participant's
      old-age or survivors' insurance benefits under section 402 of
      title 42. The reduction shall be determined by multiplying the
      participant's monthly Social Security benefit by a fraction, the
      numerator of which is the participant's total military wages and
      deemed additional wages (within the meaning of section 429 of
      title 42) that were subject to Social Security deductions and the
      denominator of which is the total of all the participant's wages,
      including military wages, and all self-employment income that
      were subject to Social Security deductions before the calendar
      year in which the determination month occurs.
        (B) The reduction determined in accordance with subparagraph
      (A) shall not be greater than the reduction that would be
      required under paragraph (1) if such paragraph applied to the
      participant. The new formula shall be applicable to any annuity
      payment payable after October 1, 1982, including annuity payments
      to participants who had previously reached age 62 and whose
      annuities had already been recomputed.
        (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term "determination
      month" means - 
          (i) the first month for which the participant is entitled to
        old-age or survivors' insurance benefits (or would be entitled
        to such benefits upon application therefor); or
          (ii) October 1982, in the case of any participant entitled to
        such benefits for that month.
    (g) Deposits paid by survivors
      For the purpose of survivor annuities, deposits authorized by
    subsections (b) and (h) of this section may also be made by the
    survivor of a participant.
    (h) Deposits for periods of military service
      (1)(A) Each participant who has performed military service before
    the date of separation on which entitlement to an annuity under
    this subchapter is based may pay to the Agency an amount equal to 7
    percent of the amount of basic pay paid under section 204 of title
    37 to the participant for each period of military service after
    December 1956; except, the amount to be paid for military service
    performed beginning on January 1, 1999, through December 31, 2000,
    shall be as follows:



                   7.25 percent of     January 1, 1999, to December 31, 
                    basic pay           1999.                           
                   7.4 percent of      January 1, 2000, to December 31, 
                    basic pay           2000.                           
    --------------------------------------------------------------------


      (B) The amount of such payments shall be based on such evidence
    of basic pay for military service as the participant may provide
    or, if the Director determines sufficient evidence has not been
    provided to adequately determine basic pay for military service,
    such payment shall be based upon estimates of such basic pay
    provided to the Director under paragraph (4).
      (2) Any deposit made under paragraph (1) more than two years
    after the later of - 
        (A) October 1, 1983, or
        (B) the date on which the participant making the deposit first
      becomes an employee of the Federal Government,

    shall include interest on such amount computed and compounded
    annually beginning on the date of expiration of the two-year
    period. The interest rate that is applicable in computing interest
    in any year under this paragraph shall be equal to the interest
    rate that is applicable for such year under section 8334(e) of
    title 5.
      (3) Any payment received by the Director under this subsection
    shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the
    credit of the fund.
      (4) The provisions of section 2031(k) of this title shall apply
    with respect to such information as the Director determines to be

-STATUTE-
    (a) Estimates of annual appropriations
      The Director shall prepare the estimates of the annual
    appropriations required to be made to the fund.
    (b) Actuarial valuations
      The Director shall cause to be made actuarial valuations of the
    fund at such intervals as the Director determines to be necessary,
    but not less often than every five years.
    (c) Changes in law affecting actuarial status of fund
      Any statute which authorizes - 
        (1) new or increased benefits payable from the fund under this
      subchapter, including annuity increases other than under section
      2131 of this title;
        (2) extension of the coverage of this subchapter to new groups
      of employees; or
        (3) increases in pay on which benefits are computed;

    is deemed to authorize appropriations to the fund in order to
    provide funding for the unfunded liability created by that statute,
    in 30 equal annual installments with interest computed at the rate
    used in the then most recent valuation of the system and with the
    first payment thereof due as of the end of the fiscal year in which
    such new or liberalized benefit, extension of coverage, or increase
    in pay is effective.
    (d) Authorization
      There is hereby authorized to be appropriated to the fund for
    each fiscal year such amounts as may be necessary to meet the
    amount of normal cost for each year that is not met by
    contributions under section 2021(a) of this title.
    (e) Unfunded liability; credit allowed for military service
      There is hereby authorized to be appropriated to the fund for
    each fiscal year such sums as may be necessary to provide the
    amount equivalent to - 
        (1) interest on the unfunded liability computed for that year
      at the interest rate used in the then most recent valuation of
      the system; and
        (2) that portion of disbursement for annuities for that year
      that the Director estimates is attributable to credit allowed for
      military service,

    less an amount determined by the Director to be appropriate to
    reflect the value of the deposits made to the credit of the fund
    under section 2082(h) of this title.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2093. Payment of benefits

-STATUTE-
    (a) Annuities stated as annual amounts
      Each annuity is stated as an annual amount,  1/12  of which,
    rounded to the next lowest dollar, constitutes the monthly rate
    payable on the first business day of the month after the month or
    other period for which it has accrued.
    (b) Commencement of annuity
      (1) Commencement of annuity for participants generally
        Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2), the annuity of a
      participant who has met the eligibility requirements for an
      annuity shall commence on the first day of the month after
      separation from the Agency or after pay ceases and the service
      and age requirements for title to an annuity are met.
      (2) Exceptions
        The annuity of - 
          (A) a participant involuntarily separated from the Agency;
          (B) a participant retiring under section 2051 of this title
        due to a disability; and
          (C) a participant who serves 3 days or less in the month of
        retirement;

      shall commence on the day after separation from the Agency or the
      day after pay ceases and the service and age or disability
      requirements for title to annuity are met.
      (3) Other annuities
        Any other annuity payable from the fund commences on the first
      day of the month after the occurrence of the event on which
      payment thereof is based.
    (c) Termination of annuity
      An annuity payable from the fund shall terminate - 
        (1) in the case of a retired participant, on the day death or
      any other terminating event provided by this subchapter occurs;
      or
        (2) in the case of a former spouse or a survivor, on the last
      day of the month before death or any other terminating event
      occurs.
    (d) Application for survivor annuities
      The annuity to a survivor shall become effective as otherwise
    specified but shall not be paid until the survivor submits an
    application for such annuity, supported by such proof of
    eligibility as the Director may require. If such application or
    proof of eligibility is not submitted during the lifetime of an
    otherwise eligible individual, no annuity shall be due or payable
    to the individual's estate.
    (e) Waiver of annuity
      An individual entitled to an annuity from the fund may decline to
    accept all or any part of the annuity by submitting a signed waiver
    to the Director. The waiver may be revoked in writing at any time.
    Payment of the annuity waived may not be made for the period during
    which the waiver is in effect.
    (f) Limitations
      (1) Application before 115th anniversary
        No payment shall be made from the fund unless an application
      for benefits based on the service of the participant is received
      by the Director before the 115th anniversary of the participant's
      birth.
      (2) Application within 30 years
        Notwithstanding paragraph (1), after the death of a participant
      or retired participant, no benefit based on that participant's
      service may be paid from the fund unless an application for the
      benefit is received by the Director within 30 years after the
      death or other event which gives rise to eligibility for the
      benefit.
    (g) Withholding of State income tax from annuities
      (1) Agreements with States
        The Director shall, in accordance with this subsection, enter
      into an agreement with any State within 120 days of a request for
      agreement from the proper State official. The agreement shall
      provide that the Director shall withhold State income tax in the
      case of the monthly annuity of any annuitant who voluntarily
      requests, in writing, such withholding. The amounts withheld
      during any calendar quarter shall be held in the Fund (!1) and
      disbursed to the States during the month following that calendar
      quarter.

      (2) Limitation on multiple requests
        An annuitant may have in effect at any time only one request
      for withholding under this subsection, and an annuitant may not
      have more than two such requests during any one calendar year.
      (3) Change in State designation
        Subject to paragraph (2), an annuitant may change the State
      designated by that annuitant for purposes of having withholdings
      made, and may request that the withholdings be remitted in
      accordance with such change. An annuitant also may revoke any
      request of that annuitant for withholding. Any change in the
      State designated or revocation is effective on the first day of
      the month after the month in which the request or the revocation
      is processed by the Director, but in no event later than on the
      first day of the second month beginning after the day on which
      such request or revocation is received by the Director.
      (4) General provisions
        This subsection does not give the consent of the United States
      to the application of a statute which imposes more burdensome
      requirements of the United States than on employers generally, or
      which subjects the United States or any annuitant to a penalty or
      liability because of this subsection. The Director may not accept
      pay from a State for services performed in withholding State
      income taxes from annuities. Any amount erroneously withheld from
      an annuity and paid to a State by the Director shall be repaid by
      the State in accordance with regulations prescribed by the
      Director.
      (5) "State" defined
        For the purpose of this subsection, the term "State" includes
      the District of Columbia and any territory or possession of the
      United States.

      multiples of one percent of the participant's basic pay, but not
      in excess of 10 percent of such basic pay.
      (2) Interest
        The voluntary contribution account in each case is the sum of
      unrefunded contributions, plus interest - 
          (A) for periods before January 1, 1985, at 3 percent a year;
        and

        (1) returned in a lump sum;
        (2) used to purchase an additional life annuity;

      participant and to provide for a cash payment on the
      participant's death to a beneficiary; or
        (4) used to purchase an additional life annuity for the
      participant and a life annuity commencing on the participant's
      death payable to a beneficiary, with a guaranteed return to the
      beneficiary or the beneficiary's legal representative of an
      amount equal to the cash payment referred to in paragraph (3).

    In the case of a benefit provided under paragraph (3) or (4), the

    calculated upon such tables of mortality as may be from time to
    time prescribed for this purpose by the Director.
    (d) Lump-sum payment
      A voluntary contribution account shall be paid in a lump sum at
    such time as the participant dies or separates from the Agency
    without entitlement to an annuity. In the case of death, the
    account shall be paid in the order of precedence specified in
    section 2071(c) of this title.
    (e) Benefits in addition to other benefits
      Any benefit payable to a participant or to the participant's
    beneficiary with respect to the additional contributions provided
    under this section shall be in addition to benefits otherwise
    provided under this subchapter.

        (2) A cost-of-living increase made under paragraph (1) shall
      become effective under this section on the effective date of each
      such increase under section 8340(b) of title 5. Except as

      increase.
    (b) Eligibility
      Eligibility for an annuity increase under this section shall be
    governed by the commencing date of each annuity payable from the

        (1) The first cost-of-living increase (if any) made under
      subsection (a) of this section to an annuity which is payable
      from the fund to a participant who retires, to the surviving
      spouse, former spouse, or previous spouse of a participant who
      dies in service, or to the surviving spouse, former spouse,
      previous spouse, or insurable interest designee of a deceased
      annuitant whose annuity has not been increased under this
      subsection or subsection (a) of this section, shall be equal to
      the product (adjusted to the nearest  1/10  of one percent) of - 
          (A)  1/12  of the applicable percent change computed under
        subsection (a) of this section, multiplied by
          (B) the number of months (not to exceed 12 months, counting
        any portion of a month as a month) - 
            (i) for which the annuity was payable from the fund before
          the effective date of the increase, or
            (ii) in the case of a surviving spouse, former spouse,
          previous spouse, or insurable interest designee of a deceased
          annuitant whose annuity has not been so increased, since the
          annuity was first payable to the deceased annuitant.

        (2) Effective from its commencing date, an annuity payable from
      the fund to an annuitant's survivor (other than a child entitled
      to an annuity under section 2031(d) of this title) shall be
      increased by the total percentage increase the annuitant was
      receiving under this section at death.
        (3) For purposes of computing the annuity of a child under
      section 2031(d) of this title that commences after October 31,
      1969, the dollar amounts specified in section 2031(d)(3) of this
      title shall each be increased by the total percentage increases
      allowed and in force under this section on or after such day and,
      in the case of a deceased annuitant, the percentages specified in
      that section shall be increased by the total percent allowed and
      in force to the annuitant under this section on or after such
      day.
    (c) Limitation
      An annuity increase provided by this section may not be computed
    on any additional annuity purchased at retirement by voluntary
    contributions.
    (d) Rounding to next lower dollar
      The monthly annuity installment, after adjustment under this
    section, shall be rounded to the next lowest dollar, except that
    such installment shall, after adjustment, reflect an increase of at
    least $1.
    (e) Limitation on maximum amount of annuity
      (1) In general
        An annuity shall not be increased by reason of an adjustment
      under this section to an amount which exceeds the greater of - 
          (A) the maximum pay payable for GS-15 30 days before the
        effective date of the adjustment under this section; or
          (B) the final pay (or average pay, if higher) of the
        participant with respect to whom the annuity is paid, increased
        by the overall annual average percentage adjustments
        (compounded) in the rates of pay of the General Schedule under
        subchapter I of chapter 53 of title 5 during the period - 
            (i) beginning on the date on which the annuity commenced
          (or, in the case of a survivor of the retired participant,
          the date on which the participant's annuity commenced), and
            (ii) ending on the effective date of the adjustment under
          this section.
      (2) "Pay" defined
        For purposes of paragraph (1), the term "pay" means the rate of
      salary or basic pay as payable under any provision of law,
      including any provision of law limiting the expenditure of
      appropriated funds.

      (3) Disqualification upon remarriage before age 55

            (ii) the first day of the second month beginning after the
          date on which the Director receives written notice of the

          terminate (except in the case of benefits subject to
          paragraph (5)(B)).
      (5) Payments to retired employees
        (A) Calculation of survivor annuity
          Any reduction in payments to a retired employee as a result
        of payments to a qualified former spouse under this subsection
        shall be disregarded in calculating - 
            (i) the survivor annuity for any spouse, former spouse
          (qualified or otherwise), or other survivor under chapter 84
          of title 5, and
            (ii) any reduction in the annuity of the retired employee
          to provide survivor benefits under subsection (d) of this
          section or under sections (!2) 8442 or 8445 of title 5.

        (B) Reduction in basic pay upon recall to service
          If a retired employee whose annuity is reduced under
        paragraph (1) is recalled to service under section 2152(c) of
        this title, the basic pay of that annuitant shall be reduced by
        the same amount as the annuity would have been reduced if it
        had continued. Amounts equal to the reductions under this
        subparagraph shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United
        States to the credit of the Civil Service Retirement and
        Disability Fund.
      (6) Special rules for disability annuitants
        Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (4), in the case of any
      qualified former spouse of a disability annuitant - 
          (A) the annuity of such former spouse shall commence on the
        date on which the employee would qualify, on the basis of the
        employee's creditable service, for benefits under subchapter II
        of chapter 84 of title 5 or on the date on which the disability
        annuity begins, whichever is later; and
          (B) the amount of the annuity of the qualified former spouse
        shall be calculated on the basis of the benefits for which the
        employee would otherwise qualify under subchapter II of chapter
        84 of such title.
      (7) Pro rata share in case of employees transferred to FERS
        Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(B), in the case of an employee
      who has elected to become subject to chapter 84 of title 5, the
      share of such employee's qualified former spouse shall equal the
      sum of - 
          (A) 50 percent of the employee's annuity under subchapter III
        of chapter 83 of title 5 or under subchapter II of this chapter
        (computed in accordance with section 302(a) of the Federal
        Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 or section 2157 of
        this title), multiplied by the proportion that the number of
        days of marriage during the period of the employee's creditable
        service before the effective date of the election to transfer
        bears to the employee's total creditable service before such
        effective date; and
          (B) if applicable, 50 percent of the employee's benefits
        under chapter 84 of title 5 or section 2152(a) of this title
        (computed in accordance with section 302(a) of the Federal
        Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 or section 2157 of
        this title), multiplied by the proportion that the number of
        days of marriage during the period of the employee's creditable
        service on and after the effective date of the election to
        transfer bears to the employee's total creditable service after
        such effective date.
      (8) Treatment of pro rata share under title 26
        For purposes of title 26, payments to a qualified former spouse
      under this subsection shall be treated as income to the qualified
      former spouse and not to the employee.
    (d) Qualified former spouse survivor benefits
      (1) Entitlement
        (A) In general
          Subject to an election under section 8416(a) of title 5, and
        unless otherwise expressly provided by any spousal agreement or
        court order governing survivor benefits payable under this
        subsection to a qualified former spouse, such former spouse is
        entitled to a share, determined under subparagraph (B), of all
        survivor benefits that would otherwise be payable under
        subchapter IV of chapter 84 of title 5 to an eligible surviving
        spouse of the employee.
        (B) Amount of share
          The share referred to in subparagraph (A) equals - 
            (i) 100 percent, if the qualified former spouse was married
          to the employee throughout the entire period of the
          employee's service which is creditable under chapter 84 of
          title 5; or
            (ii) a pro rata share of 100 percent, if the qualified
          former spouse was not married to the employee throughout such
          creditable service.
      (2) Survivor benefits
        (A) The survivor benefits payable under this subsection to a
      qualified former spouse shall include the amount payable under
      section 8442(b)(1)(A) of title 5 and any supplementary annuity
      under section 8442(f) of such title that would be payable if such
      former spouse were a widow or widower entitled to an annuity
      under such section.
        (B) Any calculation under section 8442(f) of title 5 of the
      supplementary annuity payable to a widow or widower of an
      employee referred to in section 2152(a) of this title shall be
      based on an "assumed CIARDS annuity" rather than an "assumed CSRS
      annuity" as stated in section 8442(f) of such title. For the
      purpose of this subparagraph, the term "assumed CIARDS annuity"
      means the amount of the survivor annuity to which the widow or
      widower would be entitled under subchapter II of this chapter
      based on the service of the deceased annuitant determined under
      section 8442(f)(5) of such title.
      (3) Disqualification upon remarriage before age 55
        A qualified former spouse shall not be entitled to any benefit
      under this subsection if, before commencement of any benefit, the
      qualified former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of
      age.
      (4) Restoration
        If the survivor annuity payable under this subsection to a
      surviving qualified former spouse is terminated because of
      remarriage before becoming age 55, the annuity shall be restored
      at the same rate commencing on the date such remarriage is
      dissolved by death, divorce, or annulment, if - 
          (A) such former spouse elects to receive this survivor
        annuity instead of any other survivor benefit to which such
        former spouse may be entitled under subchapter IV of chapter 84
        of title 5, or under another retirement system for Government
        employees by reason of the remarriage; and
          (B) any lump sum paid on termination of the annuity is
        returned to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.
      (5) Modification of court order or spousal agreement
        A modification in a court order or spousal agreement to adjust
      a qualified former spouse's share of the survivor benefits shall
      not be effective if issued after the retirement or death of the
      employee, former employee, or annuitant, whichever occurs first.
      (6) Effect of termination of qualified former spouse's
        entitlement
        After a qualified former spouse of a retired employee remarries
      before becoming age 55 or dies, the reduction in the retired
      employee's annuity for the purpose of providing a survivor
      annuity for such former spouse shall be terminated. The annuitant
      may elect, in a signed writing received by the Director within 2
      years after the qualified former spouse's remarriage or death, to
      continue the reduction in order to provide or increase the
      survivor annuity for such annuitant's spouse. The annuitant
      making such election shall pay a deposit in accordance with the
      provisions of section 8418 of title 5.
      (7) Pro rata share in case of employees transferred to FERS
        Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(B), in the case of an employee
      who has elected to become subject to chapter 84 of title 5, the
      share of such employee's qualified former spouse to survivor
      benefits shall equal the sum of - 
          (A) 50 percent of the employee's annuity under subchapter III
        of chapter 83 of title 5 or under subchapter II of this chapter
        (computed in accordance with section 302(a) of the Federal
        Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 or section 2157 of
        this title), multiplied by the proportion that the number of
        days of marriage during the period of the employee's creditable
        service before the effective date of the election to transfer
        bears to the employee's total creditable service before such
        effective date; and
          (B) if applicable - 
            (i) 50 percent of the employee's annuity under chapter 84
          of title 5 or section 2152(a) of this title (computed in
          accordance with section 302(a) of the Federal Employees'
          Retirement System Act of 1986 or section 2157 of this title),
          plus
            (ii) the survivor benefits referred to in subsection
          (d)(2)(A) of this section,

        multiplied by the proportion that the number of days of
        marriage during the period of the employee's creditable service
        on and after the effective date of the election to transfer
        bears to the employee's total creditable service after such
        effective date.
    (e) Qualified former spouse Thrift Savings Plan benefit
      (1) Entitlement
        (A) In general
          Unless otherwise expressly provided by a spousal agreement or
        court order governing disposition of the balance of an account
        in the Thrift Savings Fund under subchapter III of chapter 84
        of title 5, a qualified former spouse of an employee is
        entitled to a share (determined under subparagraph (B)) of the
        balance in the employee's account in the Thrift Savings Fund on
        the date the divorce of the qualified former spouse and
        employee becomes final.
        (B) Amount of share
          The share referred to in subparagraph (A) equals 50 percent
        of the employee's account balance in the Thrift Savings Fund
        that accrued during the period of marriage. For purposes of
        this subsection, the employee's account balance shall not
        include the amount of any outstanding loan.
      (2) Payment of benefit
        (A) Time of payment
          The entitlement of a qualified former spouse under paragraph
        (1) shall be effective on the date the divorce of the qualified
        former spouse and employee becomes final. The qualified former
        spouse's benefit shall be payable after the date on which the
        Director receives the divorce decree or any applicable court
        order or spousal agreement, together with such additional
        information or documentation as the Director may require.
        (B) Method of payment
          The qualified former spouse's benefit under this subsection
        shall be paid in a lump sum.
        (C) Limitation
          A spousal agreement or court order may not provide for
        payment to a qualified former spouse under this subsection of
        an amount that exceeds the employee's account balance in the
        Thrift Savings Fund.
        (D) Death of qualified former spouse
          If the qualified former spouse dies before payment of the
        benefit provided under this subsection, such payment shall be
        made to the estate of the qualified former spouse.
        (E) Bar to recovery
          Any payment under this subsection to an individual bars
        recovery by any other individual.
      (3) Closed account
        No payment under this subsection may be made by the Director if
      the date on which the divorce becomes final is after the date on
      which the total amount of the employee's account balance has been
      withdrawn or transferred, or the date on which an annuity
      contract has been purchased, in accordance with section 8433 of
      title 5.
    (f) Preservation of rights of qualified former spouses
      An employee may not make an election or modification of election
    under section 8417 or 8418 of title 5, or other section relating to
    the employee's annuity under subchapter II of chapter 84 of title
    5, that would diminish the entitlement of a qualified former spouse
    to any benefit granted to such former spouse by this section or by
    court order or spousal agreement.
    (g) Payment of share of lump-sum credit
      Whenever an employee or former employee becomes entitled to
    receive the lump-sum credit under section 8424(a) of title 5, a
    share (determined under subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section) of
    that lump-sum credit shall be paid to any qualified former spouse
    of such employee, unless otherwise expressly provided by any
    spousal agreement or court order governing disposition of the lump-
    sum credit involved.
    (h) Payment to qualified former spouses under court order or
      spousal agreement
      In the case of any employee or retired employee who has a
    qualified former spouse who is covered by a court order or who is a
    party to a spousal agreement - 
        (1) any right of the qualified former spouse to any retirement
      benefits under subsection (c) of this section and to any survivor
      benefits under subsection (d) of this section, and the amount of
      any such benefits;
        (2) any right of the qualified former spouse to any Thrift
      Savings Plan benefit under subsection (e) of this section, and
      the amount of any such benefit; and
        (3) any right of the qualified former spouse to any payment of
      a lump-sum credit under subsection (g) of this section, and the
      amount of any such payment;

    shall be determined in accordance with that spousal agreement or
    court order, if and to the extent expressly provided for in the
    terms of the spousal agreement or court order that are not
    inconsistent with the requirements of this section.
    (i) Applicability of CIARDS former spouse benefits
      (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), in the case of an
    employee who has elected to become subject to chapter 84 of title
    5, the provisions of sections 2034 and 2035 of this title shall
    apply to such employee's former spouse (as defined in section
    2002(a)(4) of this title) who would otherwise be eligible for
    benefits under sections 2034 and 2035 of this title but for the
    employee having elected to become subject to such chapter.
      (2) For the purposes of computing such former spouse's benefits
    under sections 2034 and 2035 of this title - 
        (A) the retirement benefits shall be equal to the amount
      determined under subsection (c)(7)(A) of this section; and
        (B) the survivor benefits shall be equal to 55 percent of the
      full amount of the employee's annuity computed in accordance with
      section 302(a) of the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of
      1986 or regulations prescribed under section 2157 of this title.

      (3) Benefits provided pursuant to this subsection shall be
    payable from the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and
    Disability Fund.

-EXPCITE-
    TITLE 50 - WAR AND NATIONAL DEFENSE
    CHAPTER 40 - DEFENSE AGAINST WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2301. Findings

-STATUTE-
      Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) Weapons of mass destruction and related materials and
      technologies are increasingly available from worldwide sources.
      Technical information relating to such weapons is readily
      available on the Internet, and raw materials for chemical,
      biological, and radiological weapons are widely available for
      legitimate commercial purposes.
        (2) The former Soviet Union produced and maintained a vast
      array of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons of mass
      destruction.
        (3) Many of the states of the former Soviet Union retain the
      facilities, materials, and technologies capable of producing
      additional quantities of weapons of mass destruction.
        (4) The disintegration of the former Soviet Union was
      accompanied by disruptions of command and control systems,
      deficiencies in accountability for weapons, weapons-related
      materials and technologies, economic hardships, and significant
      gaps in border control among the states of the former Soviet
      Union. The problems of organized crime and corruption in the
      states of the former Soviet Union increase the potential for
      proliferation of nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical
      weapons and related materials.
        (5) The conditions described in paragraph (4) have
      substantially increased the ability of potentially hostile
      nations, terrorist groups, and individuals to acquire weapons of
      mass destruction and related materials and technologies from
      within the states of the former Soviet Union and from unemployed
      scientists who worked on those programs.
        (6) As a result of such conditions, the capability of
      potentially hostile nations and terrorist groups to acquire
      nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical weapons is
      greater than at any time in history.
        (7) The President has identified North Korea, Iraq, Iran, and
      Libya as hostile states which already possess some weapons of
      mass destruction and are developing others.
        (8) The acquisition or the development and use of weapons of
      mass destruction is well within the capability of many extremist
      and terrorist movements, acting independently or as proxies for
      foreign states.
        (9) Foreign states can transfer weapons to or otherwise aid
      extremist and terrorist movements indirectly and with plausible
      deniability.
        (10) Terrorist groups have already conducted chemical attacks
      against civilian targets in the United States and Japan, and a
      radiological attack in Russia.
        (11) The potential for the national security of the United
      States to be threatened by nuclear, radiological, chemical, or
      biological terrorism must be taken seriously.
        (12) There is a significant and growing threat of attack by
      weapons of mass destruction on targets that are not military
      targets in the usual sense of the term.
        (13) Concomitantly, the threat posed to the citizens of the
      United States by nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical
      weapons delivered by unconventional means is significant and
      growing.
        (14) Mass terror may result from terrorist incidents involving
      nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical materials.
        (15) Facilities required for production of radiological,
      biological, and chemical weapons are much smaller and harder to
      detect than nuclear weapons facilities, and biological and
      chemical weapons can be deployed by alternative delivery means
      other than long-range ballistic missiles.
        (16) Covert or unconventional means of delivery of nuclear,
      radiological, biological, and chemical weapons include cargo
      ships, passenger aircraft, commercial and private vehicles and
      vessels, and commercial cargo shipments routed through multiple
      destinations.
        (17) Traditional arms control efforts assume large state
      efforts with detectable manufacturing programs and weapons
      production programs, but are ineffective in monitoring and
      controlling smaller, though potentially more dangerous,
      unconventional proliferation efforts.
        (18) Conventional counterproliferation efforts would do little
      to detect or prevent the rapid development of a capability to
      suddenly manufacture several hundred chemical or biological
      weapons with nothing but commercial supplies and equipment.
        (19) The United States lacks adequate planning and
      countermeasures to address the threat of nuclear, radiological,
      biological, and chemical terrorism.
        (20) The Department of Energy has established a Nuclear
      Emergency Response Team which is available in case of nuclear or
      radiological emergencies, but no comparable units exist to deal
      with emergencies involving biological or chemical weapons or
      related materials.
        (21) State and local emergency response personnel are not
      adequately prepared or trained for incidents involving nuclear,
      radiological, biological, or chemical materials.
        (22) Exercises of the Federal, State, and local response to
      nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical terrorism have
      revealed serious deficiencies in preparedness and severe problems
      of coordination.
        (23) The development of, and allocation of responsibilities
      for, effective countermeasures to nuclear, radiological,
      biological, or chemical terrorism in the United States requires
      well-coordinated participation of many Federal agencies, and
      careful planning by the Federal Government and State and local
      governments.
        (24) Training and exercises can significantly improve the
      preparedness of State and local emergency response personnel for
      emergencies involving nuclear, radiological, biological, or
      chemical weapons or related materials.
        (25) Sharing of the expertise and capabilities of the
      Department of Defense, which traditionally has provided
      assistance to Federal, State, and local officials in
      neutralizing, dismantling, and disposing of explosive ordnance,
      as well as radiological, biological, and chemical materials, can
      be a vital contribution to the development and deployment of
      countermeasures against nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons
      of mass destruction.
        (26) The United States lacks effective policy coordination
      regarding the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of
      mass destruction.

    Sec. 2357. Findings

-STATUTE-
      Congress finds that - 
        (1) United States nonproliferation efforts in the independent
      states of the former Soviet Union have achieved important results
      in ensuring that weapons of mass destruction, weapons-usable
      material and technology, and weapons-related knowledge remain
      beyond the reach of terrorists and weapons-proliferating states;
        (2) although these efforts are in the United States national
      security interest, the effectiveness of these efforts has
      suffered from a lack of coordination within and among United
      States Government agencies;
        (3) increased spending and investment by the United States
      private sector on nonproliferation efforts in the independent
      states of the former Soviet Union, specifically, spending and
      investment by the United States private sector in job creation
      initiatives and proposals for unemployed Russian Federation
      weapons scientists and technicians, are making an important
      contribution in ensuring that knowledge related to weapons of
      mass destruction remains beyond the reach of terrorists and
      weapons-proliferating states; and
        (4) increased spending and investment by the United States
      private sector on nonproliferation efforts in the independent
      states of the former Soviet Union make advisable the
      establishment of a coordinating body to ensure that United States
      public and private efforts are not in conflict, and to ensure
      that public spending on efforts by the independent states of the
      former Soviet Union is maximized to ensure efficiency and further
      United States national security interests.

      including, to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with the
      objective specified in paragraph (2), components that are well
      understood or are certifiable without the need to resume
      underground nuclear weapons testing.
        (4) To ensure that the nuclear weapons infrastructure can
      respond to unforeseen problems, to include the ability to produce
      replacement warheads that are safer to manufacture, more cost-
      effective to produce, and less costly to maintain than existing
      warheads.
        (5) To achieve reductions in the future size of the nuclear
      weapons stockpile based on increased reliability of the reliable
      replacement warheads.
        (6) To use the design, certification, and production expertise
      resident in the nuclear complex to develop reliable replacement
      components to fulfill current mission requirements of the
      existing stockpile.
        (7) To serve as a complement to, and potentially a more cost-
      effective and reliable long-term replacement for, the current
      Stockpile Life Extension Programs.
    (b) Consultation
      The Secretary of Energy shall carry out the Reliable Replacement
    Warhead program in consultation with the Secretary of Defense.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2527. Nuclear test ban readiness program

-STATUTE-
    (a) Findings
      The Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) On September 17, 1987, the United States and the Soviet
      Union announced that they would resume full-scale, stage-by-stage
      negotiations on issues relating to nuclear testing, including
      further intermediate limitations on nuclear testing leading to
      the ultimate objective of a comprehensive nuclear test ban.
        (2) It was agreed that the first step in these negotiations
      would be to reach agreement on verification measures that will
      make possible the ratification of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty
      of 1974 and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty of 1976.
        (3) To achieve the agreement on verification measures, the
      United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to design and
      conduct a Joint Verification Experiment at the test sites of each
      country during the summer of 1988.
        (4) At the Moscow summit in May 1988, President Reagan and
      General Secretary Gorbachev reaffirmed their commitment to
      negotiations on "effective verification measures which will make
      it possible to ratify the Threshold Test Ban Treaty of 1974 and
      Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty of 1976, and proceed to
      negotiating further intermediate limitations on nuclear testing
      leading to the ultimate objective of the complete cessation of
      nuclear testing as part of an effective disarmament process".
    (b) Establishment of program
      The Secretary of Energy shall establish and support a program to
    assure that the United States is in a position to maintain the
    reliability, safety, and continued deterrent effect of its
    stockpile of existing nuclear weapons designs in the event that a
    low-threshold or comprehensive ban on nuclear explosives testing is
    negotiated and ratified within the framework agreed to by the
    United States and the Soviet Union.
    (c) Purposes of program
      The purposes of the program under subsection (b) shall be the
    following:
        (1) To assure that the United States maintains a vigorous
      program of stockpile inspection and non-explosive testing so
      that, if a low-threshold or comprehensive test ban is entered
      into, the United States remains able to detect and identify
      potential problems in stockpile reliability and safety in
      existing designs of nuclear weapons.
        (2) To assure that the specific materials, components,
      processes, and personnel needed for the remanufacture of existing
      nuclear weapons or the substitution of alternative nuclear
      warheads are available to support such remanufacture or
      substitution if such action becomes necessary in order to satisfy
      reliability and safety requirements under a low-threshold or
      comprehensive test ban agreement.
        (3) To assure that a vigorous program of research in areas
      related to nuclear weapons science and engineering is supported
      so that, if a low-threshold or comprehensive test ban agreement
      is entered into, the United States is able to maintain a base of
      technical knowledge about nuclear weapons design and nuclear
      weapons effects.
    (d) Conduct of program
      The Secretary of Energy shall carry out the program provided for
    in subsection (b). The program shall be carried out with the
    participation of representatives of the Department of Defense, the
    nuclear weapons production facilities, and the national nuclear
    weapons laboratories.

    Sec. 2534. Plan for transformation of National Nuclear Security
      Administration nuclear weapons complex

-STATUTE-
    (a) Plan required
      The Secretary of Energy shall develop a plan to transform the
    nuclear weapons complex so as to achieve a responsive
    infrastructure by 2030. The plan shall be designed to accomplish
    the following objectives:
        (1) To maintain the safety, reliability, and security of the
      United States nuclear weapons stockpile.
        (2) To continue Stockpile Life Extension Programs that the
      Nuclear Weapons Council considers necessary.
        (3) To prepare to produce replacement warheads under the
      Reliable Replacement Warhead program at a rate necessary to meet
      future stockpile requirements, commencing with a first production
      unit in 2012 and achieving steady-state production using modern
      manufacturing processes by 2025.
        (4) To eliminate, within the nuclear weapons complex,
      duplication of production capability except to the extent
      required to ensure the safety, reliability, and security of the
      stockpile.
        (5) To maintain the current philosophy within the national
      security laboratories of peer review of nuclear weapons designs
      while eliminating duplication of laboratory capabilities except
      to the extent required to ensure the safety, reliability, and
      security of the stockpile.
        (6) To maintain the national security mission, and in
      particular the science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program, as
      the primary mission of the national security laboratories while
      optimizing the work-for-others activities of those laboratories
      to support other national security objectives in fields such as
      defense, intelligence, and homeland security.
        (7) To consolidate to the maximum extent practicable, and to
      provide for the ultimate disposition of, special nuclear material
      throughout the nuclear weapons complex, with the ultimate goal of
      eliminating Category I and II special nuclear material from the
      national security laboratories no later than March 1, 2012, so as
      to further reduce the footprint of the nuclear weapons complex,
      reduce security costs, and reduce transportation costs for
      special nuclear material. This objective does not preclude the
      retention of Category I and II special nuclear materials at a
      national security laboratory if the transformation plan required
      by this subsection envisions a pit production capability
      (including interim pit production) at a national security
      laboratory.
        (8) To employ a risk-based approach to ensure compliance with
      Design Basis Threat security requirements.
        (9) To expeditiously dismantle inactive nuclear weapons to
      reduce the size of the stockpile to the lowest level required by
      the Nuclear Weapons Council.
        (10) To operate the nuclear weapons complex in a more cost-
      effective manner.
    (b) Report
      Not later than February 1, 2007, the Secretary of Energy shall
    submit to the congressional defense committees a report on the
    transformation plan required by subsection (a). The report shall
    address each of the objectives required by subsection (c) (!1) and
    also include each of the following:

        (1) A comprehensive list of the capabilities, facilities, and
      project staffing that the National Nuclear Security
      Administration will need to have in place at the nuclear weapons
      complex as of 2030 to meet the requirements of the transformation
      plan.
        (2) A comprehensive list of the capabilities and facilities
      that the National Nuclear Security Administration currently has
      in place at the nuclear weapons complex that will not be needed
      as of 2030 to meet the requirements of the transformation plan.
        (3) A plan for implementing the transformation plan, including
      a schedule with incremental milestones.
    (c) Consultation
      The Secretary of Energy shall develop the transformation plan
    required by subsection (a) in consultation with the Secretary of
    Defense and the Nuclear Weapons Council.
    (d) Definition
      In this section, the term "national security laboratory" has the

    subsection (a). The report shall include a specification of - 
        (1) the planned expenditures of the Department during fiscal
      year 1996 for any of the alternative means for tritium production
      assessed under subsection (a)(2);
        (2) the amount of funds required to be expended by the
      Department, and the program milestones (including feasibility
      demonstrations) required to be met, during fiscal years 1997
      through 2001 to ensure tritium production beginning not later
      than 2005 that is adequate to meet the tritium requirements of
      the United States for nuclear weapons; and
        (3) the amount of such funds to be expended and such program
      milestones to be met during such fiscal years to ensure such
      tritium production beginning not later than 2011.
    (f) Tritium targets
      Of the funds made available pursuant to subsection (b), not more
    than $5,000,000 shall be available for the Idaho National

    nuclear materials from the facility in order to reduce
    significantly or eliminate future costs at the facility.
    (c) Eligible projects
      (1) The Secretary of Energy may establish a closure-acceleration
    project as eligible for selection under subsection (e) by - 
        (A) developing a plan for the project that meets the criteria
      under paragraph (2); and
        (B) determining that the project will achieve significant long-
      term cost savings to the Federal Government from the baseline
      cost estimate made by the Department of Energy for the project.

      (2) A plan for a closure-acceleration project under this section
    shall - 
        (A) define a clear, delineated scope of work for completion of

      Reservation

-STATUTE-
    (a) Identification and monitoring of tanks
      Not later than February 3, 1991, the Secretary of Energy shall
    identify which single-shelled or double-shelled high-level nuclear
    waste tanks at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, Richland,
    Washington, may have a serious potential for release of high-level
    waste due to uncontrolled increases in temperature or pressure.
    After completing such identification, the Secretary shall determine
    whether continuous monitoring is being carried out to detect a
    release or excessive temperature or pressure at each tank so
    identified. If such monitoring is not being carried out, as soon as
    practicable the Secretary shall install such monitoring, but only
    if a type of monitoring that does not itself increase the danger of
    a release can be installed.
    (b) Action plans
      Not later than March 5, 1991, the Secretary of Energy shall
    develop action plans to respond to excessive temperature or
    pressure or a release from any tank identified under subsection
    (a).
    (c) Prohibition
      Beginning March 5, 1991, no additional high-level nuclear waste
    (except for small amounts removed and returned to a tank for
    analysis) may be added to a tank identified under subsection (a)
    unless the Secretary determines that no safer alternative than
    adding such waste to the tank currently exists or that the tank
    does not pose a serious potential for release of high-level nuclear
    waste.
    (d) Report
      Not later than May 5, 1991, the Secretary shall submit to
    Congress a report on actions taken to promote tank safety,
    including actions taken pursuant to this section, and the
    Secretary's timetable for resolving outstanding issues on how to
    handle the waste in such tanks.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Required notification
      The Secretary of Energy shall submit to the Committees on Armed
    Services of the Senate and House of Representatives a notification
    of each significant nuclear defense intelligence loss. Any such
    notification shall be provided only after consultation with the
    Director of Central Intelligence and the Director of the Federal
    Bureau of Investigation, as appropriate.
    (b) Significant nuclear defense intelligence losses
      In this section, the term "significant nuclear defense
    intelligence loss" means any national security or
    counterintelligence failure or compromise of classified information
    at a facility of the Department of Energy or operated by a
    contractor of the Department that the Secretary considers likely to
    cause significant harm or damage to the national security interests
    of the United States.
    (c) Manner of notification
      Notification of a significant nuclear defense intelligence loss
    under subsection (a) shall be provided, in accordance with the

    section and that are otherwise necessary to carry out the
    provisions of this section.
    (e) Statutory construction
      (1) Nothing in this section shall be construed as authority to
    withhold any information from the Committees on Armed Services of

    Sec. 2672. Protection against inadvertent release of Restricted
      Data and Formerly Restricted Data

-STATUTE-
    (a) Plan for protection against release
      The Secretary of Energy and the Archivist of the United States
    shall, after consultation with the members of the National Security
    Council and in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the
    heads of other appropriate Federal agencies, develop a plan to
    prevent the inadvertent release of records containing Restricted
    Data or Formerly Restricted Data during the automatic
    declassification of records under Executive Order No. 12958 (50
    U.S.C. 435 note).
    (b) Plan elements
      The plan under subsection (a) shall include the following:
        (1) The actions to be taken in order to ensure that records
      subject to Executive Order No. 12958 are reviewed on a page-by-
      page basis for Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data
      unless they have been determined to be highly unlikely to contain
      Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data.
        (2) The criteria and process by which documents are determined
      to be highly unlikely to contain Restricted Data or Formerly
      Restricted Data.
        (3) The actions to be taken in order to ensure proper training,
      supervision, and evaluation of personnel engaged in
      declassification under that Executive order so that such
      personnel recognize Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data.
        (4) The extent to which automated declassification technologies
      will be used under that Executive order to protect Restricted
      Data and Formerly Restricted Data from inadvertent release.
        (5) Procedures for periodic review and evaluation by the
      Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Director of the
      Information Security Oversight Office of the National Archives
      and Records Administration, of compliance by Federal agencies
      with the plan.
        (6) Procedures for resolving disagreements among Federal
      agencies regarding declassification procedures and decisions
      under the plan.
        (7) The funding, personnel, and other resources required to
      carry out the plan.
        (8) A timetable for implementation of the plan.
    (c) Limitation on declassification of certain records
      (1) Effective on October 17, 1998, and except as provided in
    paragraph (3), a record referred to in subsection (a) may not be
    declassified unless the agency having custody of the record reviews
    the record on a page-by-page basis to ensure that the record does
    not contain Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data.
      (2) Any record determined as a result of a review under paragraph
    (1) to contain Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data may not
    be declassified until the Secretary of Energy, in conjunction with
    the head of the agency having custody of the record, determines
    that the document is suitable for declassification.
      (3) After the date occurring 60 days after the submission of the
    plan required by subsection (a) to the committees referred to in
    paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (d), the requirement under
    paragraph (1) to review a record on a page-by-page basis shall not
    apply in the case of a record determined, under the actions
    specified in the plan pursuant to subsection (b)(1), to be a record
    that is highly unlikely to contain Restricted Data or Formerly
    Restricted Data.
    (d) Submission of plan
      The Secretary of Energy shall submit the plan required under
    subsection (a) to the following:
        (1) The Committee on Armed Services of the Senate.
        (2) The Committee on Armed Services of the House of
      Representatives.
        (3) The Assistant to the President for National Security
      Affairs.
    (e) Submission of reviews
      The Secretary of Energy shall, on a periodic basis, submit a
    summary of the results of the periodic reviews and evaluations
    specified in the plan pursuant to subsection (b)(4) to the
    committees and Assistant to the President specified in subsection
    (d).
    (f) Report and notification regarding inadvertent releases
      (1) The Secretary of Energy shall submit to the committees and
    Assistant to the President specified in subsection (d) a report on
    inadvertent releases of Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data
    under Executive Order No. 12958 that occurred before October 17,
    1998.
      (2) Commencing with inadvertent releases discovered on or after
    October 30, 2000, the Secretary of Energy shall, on a quarterly
    basis, submit a report to the committees and Assistant to the
    President specified in subsection (d). The report shall state
    whether any inadvertent releases described in paragraph (1)
    occurred during the immediately preceding quarter and, if so, shall
    identify each such release.
    (g) Definition
      In this section, the term "Restricted Data" has the meaning given
    that term in section 2014(y) of title 42.

      Department will be unable to review for declassification before
      any such date and the effect on national security of the
      automatic declassification of those records.
        (3) An estimate of the length of time by which any such date

    (d) Incentives
      The incentives that the Secretary may provide under this section
    are the following:
        (1) The right to accumulate annual leave provided by section
      6303 of title 5 for use in succeeding years until it totals not

          (A) any annual leave that remains unused when an employee
        transfers to a position in a department or agency of the
        Federal Government shall be liquidated upon the transfer by
        payment to the employee of a lump sum for leave in excess of 30
        days, or in excess of 240 hours based on a standard work week;
        and
          (B) upon separation from service, annual leave accumulated
        under this paragraph shall be treated as any other accumulated
        annual leave is treated.

        (2) The right to be paid a retention allowance in a lump sum in
      compliance with paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 5754(b) (!1) of
      title 5 if the employee meets the requirements of section 5754(a)
      (!1) of that title, except that the retention allowance may
      exceed 25 percent, but may not be more than 30 percent, of the
      employee's rate of basic pay.

    (e) Agreement
      An eligible employee of the Department of Energy provided an
    incentive under this section shall enter into an agreement with the
    Secretary to remain employed at the closure facility at which the
    employee is employed as of the date of the agreement until a
    specific date or for a specific period of time.
    (f) Violation of agreement
      (1) Except as provided under paragraph (3), an eligible employee
    of the Department of Energy who violates an agreement under
    subsection (e), or is dismissed for cause, shall forfeit
    eligibility for any incentives under this section as of the date of
    the violation or dismissal, as the case may be.
      (2) Except as provided under paragraph (3), an eligible employee
    of the Department of Energy who is paid a retention allowance under
    subsection (d)(2) and who violates an agreement under subsection
    (e), or is dismissed for cause, before the end of the period or
    date of employment agreed upon under such agreement shall refund to
    the United States an amount that bears the same ratio to the
    aggregate amount so paid to or received by the employee as the
    unserved part of such employment bears to the total period of
    employment agreed upon under such agreement.
      (3) The Secretary may waive the applicability of paragraph (1) or
    (2) to an employee otherwise covered by such paragraph if the
    Secretary determines that there is good and sufficient reason for
    the waiver.
    (g) Report
      The Secretary shall include in each report on a closure project
    under section 2601(h) of this title a report on the incentives, if
    any, provided under this section with respect to the project for
    the period covered by such report.
    (h) Omitted
    (i) Authority with respect to voluntary separations
      (1) The Secretary may - 
        (A) separate from service any employee at a Department of
      Energy facility at which the Secretary is carrying out a closure
      project selected under section 2601 of this title who volunteers
      to be separated under this subparagraph even though the employee
      is not otherwise subject to separation due to a reduction in
      force; and
        (B) for each employee voluntarily separated under subparagraph
      (A), retain an employee in a similar position who would otherwise
      be separated due to a reduction in force.

      (2) The separation of an employee under paragraph (1)(A) shall be
    treated as an involuntary separation due to a reduction in force.
      (3) An employee with critical knowledge and skills (as defined by
    the Secretary) may not participate in a voluntary separation under
    paragraph (1)(A) if the Secretary determines that such
    participation would impair the performance of the mission of the
    Department of Energy.
    (j) Termination
      The authority to provide incentives under this section terminates
    on March 31, 2007.

    Sec. 2704. Department of Energy defense nuclear facilities
      workforce restructuring plan

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      Upon determination that a change in the workforce at a defense
    nuclear facility is necessary, the Secretary of Energy shall
    develop a plan for restructuring the workforce for the defense
    nuclear facility that takes into account - 
        (1) the reconfiguration of the defense nuclear facility; and
        (2) the plan for the nuclear weapons stockpile that is the most
      recently prepared plan at the time of the development of the plan
      referred to in this subsection.
    (b) Consultation
      (1) In developing a plan referred to in subsection (a) and any
    updates of the plan under subsection (e), the Secretary shall
    consult with the Secretary of Labor, appropriate representatives of
    local and national collective-bargaining units of individuals
    employed at Department of Energy defense nuclear facilities,
    appropriate representatives of departments and agencies of State
    and local governments, appropriate representatives of State and
    local institutions of higher education, and appropriate
    representatives of community groups in communities affected by the
    restructuring plan.
      (2) The Secretary shall determine appropriate representatives of
    the units, governments, institutions, and groups referred to in
    paragraph (1).
    (c) Objectives
      In preparing the plan required under subsection (a), the
    Secretary shall be guided by the following objectives:
        (1) Changes in the workforce at a Department of Energy defense
      nuclear facility - 
          (A) should be accomplished so as to minimize social and
        economic impacts;
          (B) should be made only after the provision of notice of such
        changes not later than 120 days before the commencement of such
        changes to such employees and the communities in which such
        facilities are located; and
          (C) should be accomplished, when possible, through the use of
        retraining, early retirement, attrition, and other options that
        minimize layoffs.

        (2) Employees whose employment in positions at such facilities
      is terminated shall, to the extent practicable, receive
      preference in any hiring of the Department of Energy (consistent
      with applicable employment seniority plans or practices of the
      Department of Energy and with section 3152 of the National
      Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public
      Law 101-189; 103 Stat. 1682)).
        (3) Employees shall, to the extent practicable, be retrained
      for work in environmental restoration and waste management
      activities at such facilities or other facilities of the
      Department of Energy.
        (4) The Department of Energy should provide relocation
      assistance to employees who are transferred to other Department
      of Energy facilities as a result of the plan.
        (5) The Department of Energy should assist terminated employees
      in obtaining appropriate retraining, education, and reemployment
      assistance (including employment placement assistance).
        (6) The Department of Energy should provide local impact
      assistance to communities that are affected by the restructuring
      plan and coordinate the provision of such assistance with - 
          (A) programs carried out by the Secretary of Labor under
        title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 [29 U.S.C. 2801
        et seq.];
          (B) programs carried out pursuant to the Defense Economic
        Adjustment, Diversification, Conversion, and Stabilization Act
        of 1990 (division D of Public Law 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2391
        note); and
          (C) programs carried out by the Department of Commerce
        pursuant to title II of the Public Works and Economic
        Development Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3141 et seq.).
    (d) Implementation
      The Secretary shall, subject to the availability of
    appropriations for such purpose, work on an ongoing basis with
    representatives of the Department of Labor, workforce bargaining
    units, and States and local communities in carrying out a plan
    required under subsection (a).
    (e) Plan updates
      Not later than one year after issuing a plan referred to in
    subsection (a) and on an annual basis thereafter, the Secretary
    shall issue an update of the plan. Each updated plan under this
    subsection shall - 
        (1) be guided by the objectives referred to in subsection (c),
      taking into account any changes in the function or mission of the
      Department of Energy defense nuclear facilities and any other
      changes in circumstances that the Secretary determines to be
      relevant;
        (2) contain an evaluation by the Secretary of the
      implementation of the plan during the year preceding the report;
      and
        (3) contain such other information and provide for such other
      matters as the Secretary determines to be relevant.
    (f) Submittal to Congress
      (1) The Secretary shall submit to Congress a plan referred to in
    subsection (a) with respect to a defense nuclear facility within 90
    days after the date on which a notice of changes described in
    subsection (c)(1)(B) is provided to employees of the facility, or
    90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act,(!1) whichever
    is later.

      (2) The Secretary shall submit to Congress any updates of the
    plan under subsection (e) immediately upon completion of any such
    update.

    Sec. 2783. Contractor liability for injury or loss of property
      arising out of atomic weapons testing programs

-STATUTE-
    (a) Short title
      This section may be cited as the "Atomic Testing Liability Act".
    (b) Federal remedies applicable; exclusiveness of remedies
      (1) Remedy
        The remedy against the United States provided by sections
      1346(b) and 2672 of title 28, by the Act of March 9, 1920 (46
      U.S.C. App. 741-752),(!1) or by the Act of March 3, 1925 (46
      U.S.C. App. 781-790),(!1) as appropriate, for injury, loss of
      property, personal injury, or death shall apply to any civil
      action for injury, loss of property, personal injury, or death
      due to exposure to radiation based on acts or omissions by a
      contractor in carrying out an atomic weapons testing program
      under a contract with the United States.

      (2) Exclusivity
        The remedies referred to in paragraph (1) shall be exclusive of
      any other civil action or proceeding for the purpose of
      determining civil liability arising from any act or omission of
      the contractor without regard to when the act or omission
      occurred. The employees of a contractor referred to in paragraph
      (1) shall be considered to be employees of the Federal
      Government, as provided in section 2671 of title 28, for the
      purposes of any such civil action or proceeding; and the civil
      action or proceeding shall proceed in the same manner as any
      action against the United States filed pursuant to section
      1346(b) of such title and shall be subject to the limitations and
      exceptions applicable to those actions.
    (c) Procedure
      A contractor against whom a civil action or proceeding described
    in subsection (b) is brought shall promptly deliver all processes
    served upon that contractor to the Attorney General of the United
    States. Upon certification by the Attorney General that the suit
    against the contractor is within the provisions of subsection (b),
    a civil action or proceeding commenced in a State court shall be
    removed without bond at any time before trial by the Attorney
    General to the district court of the United States for the district
    and division embracing the place wherein it is pending and the
    proceedings shall be deemed a tort action brought against the
    United States under the provisions of section 1346(b), 2401(b), or
    2402, or sections 2671 through 2680 of title 28. For purposes of
    removal, the certification by the Attorney General under this
    subsection establishes contractor status conclusively.
    (d) Actions covered
      The provisions of this section shall apply to any action, within
    the provisions of subsection (b), which is pending on November 5,
    1990, or commenced on or after such date. Notwithstanding section
    2401(b) of title 28, if a civil action or proceeding to which this
    section applies is pending on November 5, 1990, and is dismissed
    because the plaintiff in such action or proceeding did not file an
    administrative claim as required by section 2672 of that title, the
    plaintiff in that action or proceeding shall have 30 days from the
    date of the dismissal or two years from the date upon which the
    claim accrued, whichever is later, to file an administrative claim,
    and any claim or subsequent civil action or proceeding shall
    thereafter be subject to the provisions of section 2401(b) of title
    28.
    (e) "Contractor" defined
      For purposes of this section, the term "contractor" includes a
    contractor or cost reimbursement subcontractor of any tier
    participating in the conduct of the United States atomic weapons
    testing program for the Department of Energy (or its predecessor
    agencies, including the Manhattan Engineer District, the Atomic
    Energy Commission, and the Energy Research and Development
    Administration). Such term also includes facilities which conduct
    or have conducted research concerning health effects of ionizing
    radiation in connection with the testing under contract with the
    Department of Energy (or any of its predecessor agencies).
