    land, the mineral deposits of which are not the property of the
    United States, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of
    Commerce jointly shall enter into a contract or contracts with the
    owners or lessees, or both, of the mineral rights therein, and the
    aforesaid contract or contracts shall provide, among other things,
    that, if deposits of potash minerals or oil shall be discovered in
    pursuance of operations under said contract or contracts and if and
    when said mineral deposits shall be mined and sold, the owners or
    lessees, or both, of said mineral rights shall pay to the
    Government and its cooperators a royalty of not less than 2 1/2 
    per centum of the sale value of any potash minerals and oil
    therefrom, said payments to continue until such time as the total
    amount derived from said royalty is equal to not more than the cost
    of the exploration, as may be determined by the Secretary of the
    Interior and the Secretary of Commerce jointly: Provided further,
    That all Federal claims for reimbursement under this section shall
    automatically expire twenty years from the date of approval of the

    That said contract or contracts shall not restrict the Secretary of
    the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce jointly in the choice of
    drilling locations within the property or in the conduct of the
    exploratory operations, so long as such selection or conduct do not
    interfere unreasonably with the surface of the land or with the
    improvements thereof, and said contract or contracts shall provide
    that the United States shall not be liable for damages on account
    of such reasonable use of the surface as may be necessary in the
    proper conduct of the work.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 21a. National mining and minerals policy; "minerals" defined;
      execution of policy under other authorized programs

-STATUTE-
      The Congress declares that it is the continuing policy of the
    Federal Government in the national interest to foster and encourage
    private enterprise in (1) the development of economically sound and
    stable domestic mining, minerals, metal and mineral reclamation
    industries, (2) the orderly and economic development of domestic
    mineral resources, reserves, and reclamation of metals and minerals
    to help assure satisfaction of industrial, security and
    environmental needs, (3) mining, mineral, and metallurgical
    research, including the use and recycling of scrap to promote the
    wise and efficient use of our natural and reclaimable mineral
    resources, and (4) the study and development of methods for the
    disposal, control, and reclamation of mineral waste products, and
    the reclamation of mined land, so as to lessen any adverse impact
    of mineral extraction and processing upon the physical environment
    that may result from mining or mineral activities.
      For the purpose of this section "minerals" shall include all
    minerals and mineral fuels including oil, gas, coal, oil shale and
    uranium.
      It shall be the responsibility of the Secretary of the Interior
    to carry out this policy when exercising his authority under such
    programs as may be authorized by law other than this section.

    place bearing gold, silver, cinnabar, lead, tin, copper, or other
    valuable deposits, located prior to May 10, 1872, shall be governed
    as to length along the vein or lode by the customs, regulations,
    and laws in force at the date of their location. A mining claim
    located after the 10th day of May 1872, whether located by one or
    more persons, may equal, but shall not exceed, one thousand five
    hundred feet in length along the vein or lode; but no location of a
    mining claim shall be made until the discovery of the vein or lode
    within the limits of the claim located. No claim shall extend more
    than three hundred feet on each side of the middle of the vein at
    the surface, nor shall any claim be limited by any mining
    regulation to less than twenty-five feet on each side of the middle
    of the vein at the surface, except where adverse rights existing on
    the 10th day of May 1872 render such limitation necessary. The end
    lines of each claim shall be parallel to each other.

-STATUTE-
      The locators of all mining locations made on any mineral vein,
    lode, or ledge, situated on the public domain, their heirs and
    assigns, where no adverse claim existed on the 10th day of May 1872
    so long as they comply with the laws of the United States, and with
    State, territorial, and local regulations not in conflict with the
    laws of the United States governing their possessory title, shall
    have the exclusive right of possession and enjoyment of all the
    surface included within the lines of their locations, and of all
    veins, lodes, and ledges throughout their entire depth, the top or
    apex of which lies inside of such surface lines extended downward
    vertically, although such veins, lodes, or ledges may so far depart
    from a perpendicular in their course downward as to extend outside
    the vertical side lines of such surface locations. But their right
    of possession to such outside parts of such veins or ledges shall
    be confined to such portions thereof as lie between vertical planes
    drawn downward as above described, through the end lines of their
    locations, so continued in their own direction that such planes
    will intersect such exterior parts of such veins or ledges. Nothing
    in this section shall authorize the locator or possessor of a vein
    or lode which extends in its downward course beyond the vertical
    lines of his claim to enter upon the surface of a claim owned or
    possessed by another.

      recordation, and amount of work; marking of location on ground;
      records; annual labor or improvements on claims pending issue of
      patent; co-owner's succession in interest upon delinquency in
      contributing proportion of expenditures; tunnel as lode
      expenditure

-STATUTE-
      The miners of each mining district may make regulations not in
    conflict with the laws of the United States, or with the laws of
    the State or Territory in which the district is situated, governing
    the location, manner of recording, amount of work necessary to hold
    possession of a mining claim, subject to the following
    requirements: The location must be distinctly marked on the ground
    so that its boundaries can be readily traced. All records of mining
    claims made after May 10, 1872, shall contain the name or names of
    the locators, the date of the location, and such a description of
    the claim or claims located by reference to some natural object or
    permanent monument as will identify the claim. On each claim
    located after the 10th day of May 1872, that is granted a waiver
    under section 28f of this title, and until a patent has been issued
    therefor, not less than $100 worth of labor shall be performed or
    improvements made during each year. On all claims located prior to
    the 10th day of May 1872, $10 worth of labor shall be performed or
    improvements made each year, for each one hundred feet in length
    along the vein until a patent has been issued therefor; but where
    such claims are held in common, such expenditure may be made upon
    any one claim; and upon a failure to comply with these conditions,
    the claim or mine upon which such failure occurred shall be open to
    relocation in the same manner as if no location of the same had
    ever been made, provided that the original locators, their heirs,
    assigns, or legal representatives, have not resumed work upon the
    claim after failure and before such location. Upon the failure of
    any one of several coowners to contribute his proportion of the
    expenditures required hereby, the coowners who have performed the
    labor or made the improvements may, at the expiration of the year,
    give such delinquent co-owner personal notice in writing or notice
    by publication in the newspaper published nearest the claim, for at
    least once a week for ninety days, and if at the expiration of
    ninety days after such notice in writing or by publication such
    delinquent should fail or refuse to contribute his proportion of
    the expenditure required by this section, his interest in the claim
    shall become the property of his co-owners who have made the
    required expenditures. The period within which the work required to
    be done annually on all unpatented mineral claims located since May
    10, 1872, including such claims in the Territory of Alaska, shall
    commence at 12:01 ante meridian on the first day of September
    succeeding the date of location of such claim.
      Where a person or company has or may run a tunnel for the
    purposes of developing a lode or lodes, owned by said person or
    company, the money so expended in said tunnel shall be taken and
    considered as expended on said lode or lodes, whether located prior
    to or since May 10, 1872; and such person or company shall not be
    required to perform work on the surface of said lode or lodes in
    order to hold the same as required by this section. On all such
    valid claims the annual period ending December 31, 1921, shall
    continue to 12 o'clock meridian July 1, 1922.

      sites, or any combination thereof, on public lands; and
        (B) have performed assessment work required under the Mining
      Law of 1872 (30 U.S.C. 28-28e) (!2) to maintain the mining claims
      held by the claimant and such related parties for the assessment
      year ending on noon of September 1 of the calendar year in which
      payment of the claim maintenance fee was due.

    defective for any reason, the claimant shall have a period of 60
    days after receipt of written notification of the defect or defects
    by the Bureau of Land Management to: (A) cure such defect or
    defects, or (B) pay the $100 claim maintenance fee due for such

      A patent for any land claimed and located for valuable deposits
    may be obtained in the following manner: Any person, association,
    or corporation authorized to locate a claim under sections 21, 22
    to 24, 26 to 28, 29, 30, 33 to 48, 50 to 52, 71 to 76 of this title
    and section 661 of title 43, having claimed and located a piece of
    land for such purposes, who has, or have, complied with the terms
    of sections 21, 22 to 24, 26 to 28, 29, 30, 33 to 48, 50 to 52, 71
    to 76 of this title, and section 661 of title 43, may file in the
    proper land office an application for a patent, under oath, showing
    such compliance, together with a plat and field notes of the claim
    or claims in common, made by or under the direction of the Director
    of the Bureau of Land Management, showing accurately the boundaries
    of the claim or claims, which shall be distinctly marked by
    monuments on the ground, and shall post a copy of such plat,
    together with a notice of such application for a patent, in a
    conspicuous place on the land embraced in such plat previous to the
    filing of the application for a patent, and shall file an affidavit
    of at least two persons that such notice has been duly posted, and
    shall file a copy of the notice in such land office, and shall
    thereupon be entitled to a patent for the land, in the manner
    following: The register of the land office, upon the filing of such
    application, plat, field notes, notices, and affidavits, shall
    publish a notice that such application has been made, for the
    period of sixty days, in a newspaper to be by him designated as
    published nearest to such claim; and he shall also post such notice
    in his office for the same period. The claimant at the time of
    filing this application, or at any time thereafter, within the
    sixty days of publication, shall file with the register a
    certificate of the Director of the Bureau of Land Management that
    $500 worth of labor has been expended or improvements made upon the
    claim by himself or grantors; that the plat is correct, with such
    further description by such reference to natural objects or
    permanent monuments as shall identify the claim, and furnish an
    accurate description, to be incorporated in the patent. At the
    expiration of the sixty days of publication the claimant shall file
    his affidavit, showing that the plat and notice have been posted in
    a conspicuous place on the claim during such period of publication.
    If no adverse claim shall have been filed with the register of the
    proper land office at the expiration of the sixty days of
    publication, it shall be assumed that the applicant is entitled to
    a patent, upon the payment to the proper officer of $5 per acre,
    and that no adverse claim exists; and thereafter no objection from
    third parties to the issuance of a patent shall be heard, except it
    be shown that the applicant has failed to comply with the terms of
    sections 21, 22 to 24, 26 to 28, 29, 30, 33 to 48, 50 to 52, 71 to
    76 of this title and section 661 of title 43. Where the claimant
    for a patent is not a resident of or within the land district
    wherein the vein, lode, ledge, or deposit sought to be patented is
    located, the application for patent and the affidavits required to
    be made in this section by the claimant for such patent may be made
    by his, her, or its authorized agent, where said agent is
    conversant with the facts sought to be established by said
    affidavits.

-STATUTE-
      Where an adverse claim is filed during the period of publication,
    it shall be upon oath of the person or persons making the same, and
    shall show the nature, boundaries, and extent of such adverse
    claim, and all proceedings, except the publication of notice and
    making and filing of the affidavit thereof, shall be stayed until
    the controversy shall have been settled or decided by a court of
    competent jurisdiction, or the adverse claim waived. It shall be
    the duty of the adverse claimant, within thirty days after filing
    his claim, to commence proceedings in a court of competent
    jurisdiction, to determine the question of the right of possession,
    and prosecute the same with reasonable diligence to final judgment;
    and a failure so to do shall be a waiver of his adverse claim.
    After such judgment shall have been rendered, the party entitled to
    the possession of the claim, or any portion thereof, may, without
    giving further notice, file a certified copy of the judgment roll
    with the register of the land office, together with the certificate
    of the Director of the Bureau of Land Management that the requisite
    amount of labor has been expended or improvements made thereon, and
    the description required in other cases, and shall pay to the
    register $5 per acre for his claim, together with the proper fees,
    whereupon the whole proceedings and the judgment roll shall be
    certified by the register to the Director of the Bureau of Land
    Management, and a patent shall issue thereon for the claim, or such
    portion thereof as the applicant shall appear, from the decision of
    the court, to rightly possess. If it appears from the decision of
    the court that several parties are entitled to separate and
    different portions of the claim, each party may pay for his portion
    of the claim, with the proper fees, and file the certificate and
    description by the Director of the Bureau of Land Management
    whereupon the register shall certify the proceedings and judgment
    roll to the Director of the Bureau of Land Management, as in the
    preceding case, and patents shall issue to the several parties
    according to their respective rights. Nothing herein contained
    shall be construed to prevent the alienation of the title conveyed
    by a patent for a mining claim to any person whatever.

      lands; monuments on ground to govern conflicting calls

-STATUTE-
      The description of vein or lode claims upon surveyed lands shall
    designate the location of the claims with reference to the lines of
    the public survey, but need not conform therewith; but where
    patents have been or shall be issued for claims upon unsurveyed
    lands, the Director of the Bureau of Land Management in extending
    the public survey, shall adjust the same to the boundaries of said
    patented claims so as in no case to interfere with or change the
    true location of such claims as they are officially established
    upon the ground. Where patents have issued for mineral lands, those
    lands only shall be segregated and shall be deemed to be patented
    which are bounded by the lines actually marked, defined, and
    established upon the ground by the monuments of the official survey
    upon which the patent grant is based, and the Director of the
    Bureau of Land Management in executing subsequent patent surveys,
    whether upon surveyed or unsurveyed lands, shall be governed
    accordingly. The said monuments shall at all times constitute the
    highest authority as to what land is patented, and in case of any
    conflict between the said monuments of such patented claims and the
    descriptions of said claims in the patents issued therefor the
    monuments on the ground shall govern, and erroneous or inconsistent
    descriptions or calls in the patent descriptions shall give way
    thereto.

    Department as might be designated by the Secretary. Under that
    authority, the functions and powers formerly exercised by the

    Engineer, subject to the supervision of the Director of the Bureau
    of Land Management. In the general reorganization and realignment

      Claims usually called "placers," including all forms of deposit,
    excepting veins of quartz, or other rock in place, shall be subject
    to entry and patent, under like circumstances and conditions, and
    upon similar proceedings, as are provided for vein or lode claims;

    subdivisions of the public lands. And where placer claims are upon
    surveyed lands, and conform to legal subdivisions, no further
    survey or plat shall be required, and all placer-mining claims
    located after the 10th day of May 1872, shall conform as near as
    practicable with the United States system of public-land surveys,
    and the rectangular subdivisions of such surveys, and no such
    location shall include more than twenty acres for each individual
    claimant; but where placer claims cannot be conformed to legal
    subdivisions, survey and plat shall be made as on unsurveyed lands;
    and where by the segregation of mineral land in any legal
    subdivision a quantity of agricultural land less than forty acres
    remains, such fractional portion of agricultural land may be
    entered by any party qualified by law, for homestead purposes.

      Director of the Bureau of Land Management substituted for United
    States Supervisor of Surveys in sentence beginning "The Director of
    the Bureau of Land Management may appoint". In the establishment of
    the Bureau of Land Management by Reorg. Plan No. 3 of 1946, Sec.
    403, eff. July 16, 1946, 11 F.R. 7876, 60 Stat. 1100, set out in
    the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees, the
    office of Supervisor of Surveys was abolished and the functions and
    powers were transferred to the Secretary of the Interior, to be
    performed by such officers or agencies of the Department as might
    be designated by the Secretary. Under that authority, the functions
    and powers formerly exercised by the Supervisor of Surveys were
    delegated to the Chief Cadastral Engineer, subject to the
    supervision of the Director of the Bureau of Land Management. In
    the general reorganization and realignment of functions of the
    Bureau, the office of the Chief Cadastral Engineer was abolished,
    and the functions of that office have been delegated to the
    Director of the Bureau of Land Management. See 43 C.F.R. Sec.
    9180.0-3(a)(1).
      In sentence beginning "The Director of the Bureau of Land
    Management shall also have power", "Director of the Bureau of Land
    Management" substituted for "Commissioner of the General Land
    Office" in two instances and "Director" for "Commissioner" on
    authority of Reorg. Plan No. 3 of 1946, Sec. 403, set out in the
    Appendix to Title 5. Section 403 of Reorg. Plan No. 3 of 1946,
    abolished the office of the Commissioner of the General Land Office
    and consolidated the functions of the General Land Office with the
    Grazing Service to form the Bureau of Land Management.
      Office of register of district land office abolished and all

    TITLE 30 - MINERAL LANDS AND MINING
    CHAPTER 2 - MINERAL LANDS AND REGULATIONS IN GENERAL

-HEAD-
    Sec. 49a. Mining laws of United States extended to Alaska;
      exploration and mining for precious metals; regulations; conflict
      of laws; permits; dumping tailings; pumping from sea; reservation
      of roadway; title to land below line of high tide or high-water
      mark; transfer of title to future State

-STATUTE-
      The laws of the United States relating to mining claims, mineral
    locations, and rights incident thereto are extended to the
    Territory of Alaska: Provided, That, subject only to the laws
    enacted by Congress for the protection and preservation of the
    navigable waters of the United States, and to the laws for the
    protection of fish and game, and subject also to such general rules
    and regulations as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe for
    the preservation of order and the prevention of injury to the fish
    and game, all land below the line of ordinary high tide on tidal
    waters and all land below the line of ordinary high-water mark on
    nontidal water navigable in fact, within the jurisdiction of the
    United States, shall be subject to exploration and mining for gold
    and other precious metals, and in the Chilkat River, and its
    tributaries, within two and three-tenths miles of United States
    survey numbered 991 for all metals, by citizens of the United
    States, or persons who have legally declared their intentions to
    become such, under such reasonable rules and regulations as the
    miners in organized mining districts may have heretofore made or
    may hereafter make governing the temporary possession thereof for
    exploration and mining purposes until otherwise provided by law:
    Provided further, That the rules and regulations established by the
    miners shall not be in conflict with the mining laws of the United
    States; and no exclusive permit shall be granted by the Secretary
    of the Interior authorizing any person or persons, corporation, or
    company to excavate or mine under any of said waters, and if such
    exclusive permit has been granted it is revoked and declared null
    and void. The rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of
    the Interior under this section shall not, however, deprive miners
    on the beach of the right given to dump tailings into or pump from
    the sea opposite their claims, except where such dumping would
    actually obstruct navigation or impair the fish and game, and the
    reservation of a roadway sixty feet wide under section 687a-2 (!1)
    of title 43, shall not apply to mineral lands or town sites. No
    person shall acquire by virtue of this section any title to any
    land below the line of ordinary high tide or the line of ordinary
    high-water mark, as the case may be, of the waters described in
    this section. Any rights or privileges acquired hereunder with
    respect to mining operations in land, title to which is transferred
    to a future State upon its admission to the Union and which is
    situated within its boundaries, shall be terminable by such State,
    and the said mining operations shall be subject to the laws of such
    State.

    the said recorder of the district in which the claims shall be
    situated an affidavit showing the performance of labor or making of
    improvements to the amount of $100 as aforesaid and specifying the
    character and extent of such work. Such affidavits shall set forth

    affidavit shall be prima facie evidence of the performance of such
    work or making of such improvements, but if such affidavits be not
    filed within the time fixed by this section the burden of proof
    shall be upon the claimant to establish the performance of such

    the Department of the Interior says:
      "While there may be some Indian lands still subject to coal entry

    Sec. 81. Rights of entrymen of lands subsequently classified as

-STATUTE-
      Any person who has in good faith located, selected, or entered
    under the nonmineral land laws of the United States any lands which
    subsequently are classified, claimed, or reported as being valuable
    for coal, may, if he shall so elect, and upon making satisfactory
    proof of compliance with the laws under which such lands are
    claimed, receive a patent therefor, which shall contain a
    reservation to the United States of all coal in said lands, and the
    right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same. The coal deposits
    in such lands shall be subject to disposal by the United States in
    accordance with the provisions of the coal land laws in force at
    the time of such disposal, but no person shall enter upon said
    lands to prospect for, or mine and remove coal therefrom, without
    previous consent of the owner under such patent, except upon such
    conditions as to security for and payment of all damages to such
    owner caused thereby as may be determined by a court of competent
    jurisdiction. The owner under such patent shall have the right to
    mine coal for use on the land for domestic purposes prior to the
    disposal by the United States of the coal deposit. Nothing herein
    contained shall be held to affect or abridge the right of any
    locator, selector, or entryman to a hearing for the purpose of
    determining the character of the land located, selected, or entered
    by him. Such locator, selector, or entryman who has made or shall
    make final proof showing good faith and satisfactory compliance
    with the law under which his land is claimed shall be entitled to a
    patent without reservation unless at the time of such final proof
    and entry it shall be shown that the land is chiefly valuable for
    coal.

    this title, the entryman shall be entitled to a patent to the land
    entered by him, which patent shall contain a reservation to the
    United States of all the coal in the lands so patented, together
    with the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same. The coal
    deposits in such lands shall be subject to disposal by the United
    States in accordance with the provisions of the coal-land laws in
    force at the time of such disposal. Any person qualified to acquire
    coal deposits or the right to mine and remove the coal under the
    laws of the United States shall have the right, at all times, to
    enter upon the lands selected, entered, or patented, as provided by
    sections 83 to 85 of this title, for the purpose of prospecting for
    coal thereon upon the approval by the Secretary of the Interior of
    a bond or undertaking to be filed with him as security for the
    payment of all damages to the crops and improvements on such lands
    by reason of such prospecting. Any person who has acquired from the
    United States the coal deposits in any such land, or the right to
    mine or remove the same, may reenter and occupy so much of the
    surface thereof as may be required for all purposes reasonably
    incident to the mining and removal of the coal therefrom, and mine
    and remove the coal, upon payment of the damages caused thereby to
    the owner thereof, or upon giving a good and sufficient bond or
    undertaking in an action instituted in any competent court to
    ascertain and fix said damages. The owner under such limited patent
    shall have the right to mine coal for use upon the land for
    domestic purposes at any time prior to the disposal by the United
    States of the coal deposits. Nothing herein contained shall be held
    to deny or abridge the right to present and have prompt
    consideration of applications to locate, enter, or select, under
    the land laws of the United States, lands which have been
    classified as coal lands with a view of disproving such
    classification and securing a patent without reservation.

-STATUTE-
      If the coal-land laws have been or shall be extended over lands
    applied for, entered, or patented hereunder the coal deposits
    therein shall be subject to disposal by the United States in
    accordance with the provisions of the coal-land laws in force at

    deposits or the right to mine and remove the coal under the laws of
    the United States shall have the right at all times to enter upon
    the lands applied for, entered, or patented under sections 86 to 89

    approval by the Secretary of the Interior of a bond or undertaking
    to be filed with him as security for the payment of all damages to
    the crops and improvements on such lands by reason of such
    prospecting. Any person who has acquired from the United States the
    coal deposits in any such lands, or the right to mine or remove the
    same, may reenter and occupy so much of the surface thereof as may
    be required for all purposes reasonably incident to the mining and
    removal of the coal therefrom, and mine and remove the coal, upon
    payment of the damages caused thereby to the owner thereof, or upon
    giving a good and sufficient bond or undertaking in an action
    instituted in any competent court to ascertain and fix said
    damages. The owner under such limited patent shall have the right
    to mine coal for personal use upon the land for domestic purposes
    at any time prior to the disposal by the United States of the coal
    deposits. Nothing herein contained shall be held to deny or abridge
    the right to present and have prompt consideration of applications
    made under the applicable land laws of the United States for any
    such surplus lands which have been or may be classified as coal
    lands with a view of disproving such classification and securing a

-STATUTE-
      Upon satisfactory proof of full compliance with the provisions of
    the laws under which the location, selection, entry, or purchase is
    made, the locator, selector, entryman, or purchaser shall be
    entitled to a patent to the land located, selected, entered, or
    purchased, which patent shall contain a reservation to the United
    States of the deposits on account of which the lands so patented
    were withdrawn or classified or reported as valuable, together with
    the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same, such deposits
    to be subject to disposal by the United States only as shall be
    hereafter expressly directed by law: Provided, however, That all
    mineral deposits heretofore or hereafter reserved to the United
    States under sections 121 to 123 of this title which are subject,
    at the time of application for patent, to valid and subsisting
    rights acquired by discovery and location under the mining laws of
    the United States made prior to the date of the Mineral Leasing Act
    of February 25, 1920 [30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.], shall hereafter be
    subject to disposal to the holders of those valid and subsisting
    rights by patent under the mining laws of the United States in
    force at the time of such disposal. Any person qualified to acquire
    the reserved deposits may enter upon said lands with a view of
    prospecting for the same upon the approval by the Secretary of the
    Interior of a bond or undertaking to be filed with him as security
    for the payment of all damages to the crops and improvements on
    such lands by reason of such prospecting, the measure of any such
    damage to be fixed by agreement of parties or by a court of
    competent jurisdiction. Any person who has acquired from the United
    States the title to or the right to mine and remove the reserved
    deposits, should the United States dispose of the mineral deposits
    in lands, may reenter and occupy so much of the surface thereof as
    may be required for all purposes reasonably incident to the mining
    and removal of the minerals therefrom, and mine and remove such
    minerals, upon payment of damages caused thereby to the owner of
    the land, or upon giving a good and sufficient bond or undertaking
    therefor in an action instituted in any competent court to
    ascertain and fix said damages. Nothing herein contained shall be
    held to deny or abridge the right to present and have prompt
    consideration of applications to locate, select, enter, or
    purchase, under the land laws of the United States, lands which
    have been withdrawn or classified as phosphate, nitrate, potash,
    oil, gas, or asphaltic mineral lands, with a view of disproving
    such classification and securing patent without reservation, nor
    shall persons who have located, selected, entered, or purchased
    lands subsequently withdrawn, or classified as valuable for said
    mineral deposits, be debarred from the privilege of showing, at any
    time before final entry, purchase, or approval of selection or
    location, that the lands entered, selected, or located are in fact
    nonmineral in character.

    the United States, or of any State or Territory thereof, or in the
    case of coal, oil, oil shale, or gas, to municipalities. Citizens
    of another country, the laws, customs, or regulations of which deny
    similar or like privileges to citizens or corporations of this
    country, shall not by stock ownership, stock holding, or stock
    control, own any interest in any lease acquired under the
    provisions of this chapter.
      The term "oil" shall embrace all nongaseous hydrocarbon
    substances other than those substances leasable as coal, oil shale,
    or gilsonite (including all vein-type solid hydrocarbons).
      The term "combined hydrocarbon lease" shall refer to a lease
    issued in a special tar sand area pursuant to section 226 of this

      The United States reserves the ownership of and the right to
    extract helium from all gas produced from lands leased or otherwise
    granted under the provisions of this chapter, under such rules and
    regulations as shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the
    Interior: Provided further, That in the extraction of helium from
    gas produced from such lands it shall be so extracted as to cause
    no substantial delay in the delivery of gas produced from the well
    to the purchaser thereof.

    aggregate of more than 75,000 acres in any one State and in no case
    greater than an aggregate of 150,000 acres in the United States:
    Provided, That any person, association, or corporation currently
    holding, owning, or controlling more than an aggregate of 150,000
    acres in the United States on the date of enactment of this section
    shall not be required on account of this section to relinquish said
    leases or permits: Provided, further, That in no case shall such
    person, association, or corporation be permitted to take, hold,
    own, or control any further Federal coal leases or permits until
    such time as their holdings, ownership, or control of Federal
    leases or permits has been reduced below an aggregate of 150,000
    acres within the United States.
    (b) Sodium leases or permits, acreage
      (1) No person, association, or corporation, except as otherwise
    provided in this subsection, shall take, hold, own, or control at
    one time, whether acquired directly from the Secretary under this
    chapter, or otherwise, sodium leases or permits on an aggregate of
    more than five thousand one hundred and twenty acres in any one
    State.
      (2) The Secretary may, in his discretion, where the same is
    necessary in order to secure the economic mining of sodium
    compounds leasable under this chapter, permit a person,
    association, or corporation to take or hold sodium leases or
    permits on up to 30,720 acres in any one State.
    (c) Phosphate leases, acreage
      No person, association, or corporation shall take, hold, own, or
    control at one time, whether acquired directly from the Secretary
    under this chapter, or otherwise, phosphate leases or permits on an
    aggregate of more than twenty thousand four hundred and eighty
    acres in the United States.
    (d) Oil or gas leases, acreage, Alaska; options, semi-annual
      statements
      (1) No person, association, or corporation, except as otherwise
    provided in this chapter, shall take, hold, own or control at one
    time, whether acquired directly from the Secretary under this
    chapter, or otherwise, oil or gas leases (including options for
    such leases or interests therein) on land held under the provisions
    of this chapter exceeding in the aggregate two hundred forty-six
    thousand and eighty acres in any one State other than Alaska (!1)
    Provided, however, That acreage held in special tar sand areas, and
    acreage under any lease any portion of which has been committed to
    a federally approved unit or cooperative plan or communitization
    agreement or for which royalty (including compensatory royalty or
    royalty in-kind) was paid in the preceding calendar year, shall not
    be chargeable against such State limitations. In the case of the
    State of Alaska, the limit shall be three hundred thousand acres in
    the northern leasing district and three hundred thousand acres in
    the southern leasing district, and the boundary between said two
    districts shall be the left limit of the Tanana River from the
    border between the United States and Canada to the confluence of
    the Tanana and Yukon Rivers, and the left limit of the Yukon River
    from said confluence to its principal southern mouth.

      (2) No person, association, or corporation shall take, hold, own,
    or control at one time options to acquire interests in oil or gas
    leases under the provisions of this chapter which involve, in the
    aggregate, more than two hundred thousand acres of land in any one
    State other than Alaska, or, in the case of Alaska, more than two
    hundred thousand acres in each of its two leasing districts, as
    hereinbefore described. No option to acquire any interest in such
    an oil or gas lease shall be enforcible if entered into for a
    period of more than three years (which three years shall be
    inclusive of any renewal period if a right to renew is reserved by
    any party to the option) without the prior approval of the
    Secretary. In any case in which an option to acquire the optionor's
    entire interest in the whole or a part of the acreage under a lease
    is entered into, the acreage to which the option is applicable
    shall be charged both to the optionor and to the optionee, but the
    charge to the optionor shall cease when the option is exercised. In
    any case in which an option to acquire a part of the optionor's
    interest in the whole or a part of the acreage under a lease is
    entered into, the acreage to which the option is applicable shall
    be fully charged to the optionor and a share thereof shall also be
    charged to the optionee, as his interest may appear, but after the
    option is exercised said acreage shall be charged to the parties
    pro rata as their interests may appear. In any case in which an
    assignment is made of a part of a lessee's interest in the whole or
    part of the acreage under a lease or an application for a lease,
    the acreage shall be charged to the parties pro rata as their
    interests may appear. No option or renewal thereof shall be
    enforcible until notice thereof has been filed with the Secretary
    or an officer or employee of the Department of the Interior
    designated by him to receive the same. Each such notice shall
    include, in addition to any other matters prescribed by the
    Secretary, the names and addresses of the parties thereto, the
    serial number of the lease or application for a lease to which the
    option is applicable, and a statement of the number of acres
    covered thereby and of the interests and obligations of the parties
    thereto and shall be subscribed by all parties to the option or
    their duly authorized agents. An option which has not been
    exercised shall remain charged as hereinbefore provided until
    notice of its relinquishment or surrender has been filed, by either
    party, with the Secretary or any officer or employee of the
    Department of the Interior designated by him to receive the same.
    In addition, each holder of any such option shall file with the
    Secretary or an officer or employee of the Department of the
    Interior as aforesaid within ninety days after the 30th day of June
    and the 31st day of December in each year a statement showing, in
    addition to any other matters prescribed by the Secretary, his
    name, the name and address of each grantor of an option held by
    him, the serial number of every lease or application for a lease to
    which such an option is applicable, the number of acres covered by
    each such option, the total acreage in each State to which such
    options are applicable, and his interest and obligation under each
    such option. The failure of the holder of an option so to file
    shall render the option unenforcible (!2) by him. The
    unenforcibility (!3) of any option under the provisions of this
    paragraph shall not diminish the number of acres deemed to be held
    under option by any person, association, or corporation in
    computing the amount chargeable under the first sentence of this
    paragraph and shall not relieve any party thereto of any liability
    to cancellation, forfeiture, forced disposition, or other sanction
    provided by law. The Secretary may prescribe forms on which the
    notice and statements required by this paragraph shall be made.


    (e) Association or stockholder interests, conditions; combined
      interests
      (1) No person, association, or corporation shall take, hold, own
    or control at one time any interest as a member of an association
    or as a stockholder in a corporation holding a lease, option, or
    permit under the provisions of this chapter which, together with
    the area embraced in any direct holding, ownership or control by
    him of such a lease, option, or permit or any other interest which
    he may have as a member of other associations or as a stockholder
    in other corporations holding, owning or controlling such leases,
    options, or permits for any kind of minerals, exceeds in the
    aggregate an amount equivalent to the maximum number of acres of
    the respective kinds of minerals allowed to any one lessee,
    optionee, or permittee under this chapter, except that no person
    shall be charged with his pro rata share of any acreage holdings of
    any association or corporation unless he is the beneficial owner of
    more than 10 per centum of the stock or other instruments of
    ownership or control of such association or corporation, and except
    that within three years after September 2, 1960 no valid option in
    existence prior to September 2, 1960 held by a corporation or
    association on September 2, 1960 shall be chargeable to any
    stockholder of such corporation or to a member of such association
    so long as said option shall be so held by such corporation or
    association under the provisions of this chapter.
      (2) No contract for development and operation of any lands leased
    under this chapter, whether or not coupled with an interest in such
    lease, and no lease held, owned, or controlled in common by two or
    more persons, associations, or corporations shall be deemed to
    create a separate association under the preceding paragraph of this
    subsection between or among the contracting parties or those who
    hold, own or control the lease in common, but the proportionate
    interest of each such party shall be charged against the total
    acreage permitted to be held, owned or controlled by such party
    under this chapter. The total acreage so held, owned, or controlled
    in common by two or more parties shall not exceed, in the
    aggregate, an amount equivalent to the maximum number of acres of
    the respective kinds of minerals allowed to any one lessee,
    optionee, or permittee under this chapter.
    (f) Limitations on other sections; combined interests permitted for
      certain purposes
      Nothing contained in subsection (e) of this section shall be
    construed (i) to limit sections 227, 228, 251 of this title or
    (ii), subject to the approval of the Secretary, to prevent any
    number of lessees under this chapter from combining their several
    interests so far as may be necessary for the purpose of
    constructing and carrying on the business of a refinery or of
    establishing and constructing, as a common carrier, a pipeline or
    railroad to be operated and used by them jointly in the
    transportation of oil from their several wells or from the wells of
    other lessees under this chapter or in the transportation of coal
    or (iii) to increase the acreage which may be taken, held, owned,
    or controlled under this section.
    (g) Forbidden interests acquired by descent, will, judgment, or
      decree; permissible holding period
      Any ownership or interest otherwise forbidden in this chapter
    which may be acquired by descent, will, judgment, or decree may be
    held for two years after its acquisition and no longer.
    (h) Cancellation, forfeiture, or disposal of interests for
      violation; bona fide purchasers and other valid interests; sale
      by Secretary; record of proceedings
      (1) If any interest in any lease is owned, or controlled,
    directly or indirectly, by means of stock or otherwise, in
    violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, the lease may
    be canceled, or the interest so owned may be forfeited, or the
    person so owning or controlling the interest may be compelled to
    dispose of the interest, in any appropriate proceeding instituted
    by the Attorney General. Such a proceeding shall be instituted in
    the United States district court for the district in which the
    leased property or some part thereof is located or in which the
    defendant may be found.
      (2) The right to cancel or forfeit for violation of any of the
    provisions of this chapter shall not apply so as to affect
    adversely the title or interest of a bona fide purchaser of any
    lease, interest in a lease, option to acquire a lease or an
    interest therein, or permit which lease, interest, option, or
    permit was acquired and is held by a qualified person, association,
    or corporation in conformity with those provisions, even though the
    holdings of the person, association, or corporation from which the
    lease, interest, option, or permit was acquired, or of his
    predecessor in title (including the original lessee of the United
    States) may have been canceled or forfeited or may be or may have
    been subject to cancellation or forfeiture for any such violation.
    If, in any such proceeding, an underlying lease, interest, option,
    or permit is canceled or forfeited to the Government and there are
    valid interests therein or valid options to acquire the lease or an
    interest therein which are not subject to cancellation, forfeiture,
    or compulsory disposition, the underlying lease, interest, option,
    or permit shall be sold by the Secretary to the highest responsible
    qualified bidder by competitive bidding under general regulations
    subject to all outstanding valid interests therein and valid
    options pertaining thereto. Likewise if, in any such proceeding,
    less than the whole interest in a lease, interest, option, or
    permit is canceled or forfeited to the Government, the partial
    interests so canceled or forfeited shall be sold by the Secretary
    to the highest responsible qualified bidder by competitive bidding
    under general regulations. If competitive bidding fails to produce
    a satisfactory offer the Secretary may, in either of these cases,
    sell the interest in question by such other method as he deems
    appropriate on terms not less favorable to the Government than
    those of the best competitive bid received.
      (3) The commencement and conclusion of every proceeding under
    this subsection shall be promptly noted on the appropriate public
    records of the Bureau of Land Management.
    (i) Bona fide purchasers, conditions for obtaining dismissals
      Effective September 21, 1959, any person, association, or
    corporation who is a party to any proceeding with respect to a
    violation of any provision of this chapter, whether initiated prior
    to said date or thereafter, shall have the right to be dismissed
    promptly as such a party upon showing that he holds and acquired as
    a bona fide purchaser the interest involving him as such a party
    without violating any provisions of this chapter. No hearing upon
    any such showing shall be required unless the Secretary presents
    prima facie evidence indicating a possible violation of this
    chapter on the part of the alleged bona fide purchaser.
    (j) Waiver or suspension of rights
      If during any such proceeding, a party thereto files with the
    Secretary a waiver of his rights under his lease (including
    particularly, where applicable, rights to drill and to assign) or
    if such rights are suspended by the Secretary pending a decision in
    the proceeding, whether initiated prior to enactment of this
    chapter or thereafter, payment of rentals and running of time
    against the term of the lease or leases involved shall be suspended
    as of the first day of the month following the filing of the waiver
    or suspension of the rights until the first day of the month
    following the final decision in the proceeding or the revocation of
    the waiver or suspension.
    (k) Unlawful trusts; forfeiture
      Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, if any lands or
    deposits subject to the provisions of this chapter shall be
    subleased, trusteed, possessed, or controlled by any device
    permanently, temporarily, directly, indirectly, tacitly, or in any
    manner whatsoever, so that they form a part of or are in any wise
    controlled by any combination in the form of an unlawful trust,
    with the consent of the lessee, optionee, or permittee, or form the
    subject of any contract or conspiracy in restraint of trade in the
    mining or selling of coal, phosphate, oil, oil shale, gilsonite
    (including all vein-type solid hydrocarbons), gas, or sodium
    entered into by the lessee, optionee, or permittee or any agreement
    or understanding, written, verbal, or otherwise, to which such
    lessee, optionee, or permittee shall be a party, of which his or
    its output is to be or become the subject, to control the price or
    prices thereof or of any holding of such lands by any individual,
    partnership, association, corporation, or control in excess of the
    amounts of lands provided in this chapter, the lease, option, or
    permit shall be forfeited by appropriate court proceedings.
    (l) Rules and regulations; notice to and consultation with Attorney
      General; application of antitrust laws; definitions
      (1) At each stage in the formulation and promulgation of rules
    and regulations concerning coal leasing pursuant to this chapter,
    and at each stage in the issuance, renewal, and readjustment of
    coal leases under this chapter, the Secretary of the Interior shall
    consult with and give due consideration to the views and advice of
    the Attorney General of the United States.
      (2) No coal lease may be issued, renewed, or readjusted under
    this chapter until at least thirty days after the Secretary of the
    Interior notifies the Attorney General of the proposed issuance,
    renewal, or readjustment. Such notification shall contain such
    information as the Attorney General may require in order to advise
    the Secretary of the Interior as to whether such lease would create
    or maintain a situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws. If
    the Attorney General advises the Secretary of the Interior that a
    lease would create or maintain such a situation, the Secretary of
    the Interior may not issue such lease, nor may he renew or readjust
    such lease for a period not to exceed one year, as the case may be,
    unless he thereafter conducts a public hearing on the record in
    accordance with subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5 and finds
    therein that such issuance, renewal, or readjustment is necessary
    to effectuate the purposes of this chapter, that it is consistent
    with the public interest, and that there are no reasonable
    alternatives consistent with this chapter, the antitrust laws, and
    the public interest.
      (3) Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to convey to any
    person, association, corporation, or other business organization
    immunity from civil or criminal liability, or to create defenses to
    actions, under any antitrust law.
      (4) As used in this subsection, the term "antitrust law" means - 
        (A) the Act entitled "An Act to protect trade and commerce
      against unlawful restraints and monopolies", approved July 2,
      1890 (15 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), as amended;
        (B) the Act entitled "An Act to supplement existing laws
      against unlawful restraints and monopolies, and for other
      purposes", approved October 15, 1914 (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.), as
      amended;
        (C) the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.), as

      taxation, to provide revenue for the Government, and for other
      purposes", approved August 27, 1894 (15 U.S.C. 8 and 9), as
      amended; or
        (E) the Act of June 19, 1936, chapter 592 (15 U.S.C. 13, 13a,
      13b, and 21a).

    purchasers in such situations have the right to be dismissed as
    parties from proceedings; and that if a party to proceedings files
    waiver of rights to drill or assigns his interests, or if such
    rights are suspended pending decision, he shall, if he is not in
    violation of provisions, have the right to have his interest

-MISC2-
                                 FINDINGS                             
      Pub. L. 106-463, Sec. 2, Nov. 7, 2000, 114 Stat. 2010, provided
    that: "Congress finds that - 
        "(1) Federal land contains commercial deposits of coal, the
      Nation's largest deposits of coal being located on Federal land
      in Utah, Colorado, Montana, and the Powder River Basin of
      Wyoming;
        "(2) coal is mined on Federal land through Federal coal leases
      under the Act of February 25, 1920 (commonly known as the
      'Mineral Leasing Act') (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.);
        "(3) the sub-bituminous coal from these mines is low in sulfur,
      making it the cleanest burning coal for energy production;
        "(4) the Mineral Leasing Act sets for each leasable mineral a
      limitation on the amount of acreage of Federal leases any 1
      producer may hold in any 1 State or nationally;
        "(5)(A) the present acreage limitation for Federal coal leases
      has been in place since 1976;
        "(B) currently the coal lease acreage limit of 46,080 acres per
      State is less than the per-State Federal lease acreage limit for
      potash (96,000 acres) and oil and gas (246,080 acres);
        "(6) coal producers in Wyoming and Utah are operating mines on
      Federal leaseholds that contain total acreage close to the coal
      lease acreage ceiling;
        "(7) the same reasons that Congress cited in enacting increases
      for State lease acreage caps applicable in the case of other
      minerals - the advent of modern mine technology, changes in
      industry economics, greater global competition, and the need to
      conserve Federal resources - apply to coal;
        "(8) existing coal mines require additional lease acreage to
      avoid premature closure, but those mines cannot relinquish mined-
      out areas to lease new acreage because those areas are subject
      to 10-year reclamation plans, and the reclaimed acreage is
      counted against the State and national acreage limits;
        "(9) to enable them to make long-term business decisions
      affecting the type and amount of additional infrastructure
      investments, coal producers need certainty that sufficient
      acreage of leasable coal will be available for mining in the
      future; and
        "(10) to maintain the vitality of the domestic coal industry
      and ensure the continued flow of valuable revenues to the Federal
      and State governments and of energy to the American public from
      coal production on Federal land, the Mineral Leasing Act should
      be amended to increase the acreage limitation for Federal coal
      leases."
      Pub. L. 106-191, Sec. 1, Apr. 28, 2000, 114 Stat. 231, provided
    that: "The Congress finds and declares that - 
        "(1) The Federal lands contain commercial deposits of trona,
      with the world's largest body of this mineral located on such
      lands in southwestern Wyoming.
        "(2) Trona is mined on Federal lands through Federal sodium
      leases issued under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 [30 U.S.C.
      181 et seq.].
        "(3) The primary product of trona mining is soda ash (sodium
      carbonate), a basic industrial chemical that is used for glass
      making and a variety of consumer products, including baking soda,
      detergents, and pharmaceuticals.
        "(4) The Mineral Leasing Act [30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.] sets for
      each leasable mineral limitations on the amount of acreage of
      Federal leases any one producer may hold in any one State or
      nationally.
        "(5) The present acreage limitation for Federal sodium (trona)
      leases has been in place for over five decades, since 1948, and
      is the oldest acreage limitation in the Mineral Leasing Act. Over
      this time frame Congress and/or the BLM has revised acreage
      limits for other minerals to meet the needs of the respective
      industries. Currently, the sodium lease acreage limitation of
      15,360 acres per State is approximately one-third of the per
      State Federal lease acreage cap for coal (46,080 acres) and
      potassium (51,200 acres) and one-sixteenth that of oil and gas
      (246,080 acres).
        "(6) Three of the four trona producers in Wyoming are operating
      mines on Federal leaseholds that contain total acreage close to
      the sodium lease acreage ceiling.
        "(7) The same reasons that Congress cited in enacting increases
      in other minerals' per State lease acreage caps apply to trona:
      the advent of modern mine technology, changes in industry
      economics, greater global competition, and need to conserve the
      Federal resource.
        "(8) Existing trona mines require additional lease acreage to
      avoid premature closure, and are unable to relinquish mined-out
      areas to lease new acreage because those areas continue to be
      used for mine access, ventilation, and tailings disposal and may
      provide future opportunities for secondary recovery by solution
      mining.
        "(9) Existing trona producers are having to make long term
      business decisions affecting the type and amount of additional
      infrastructure investments based on the certainty that sufficient
      acreage of leaseable [sic] trona will be available for mining in
      the future.
        "(10) To maintain the vitality of the domestic trona industry
      and ensure the continued flow of valuable revenues to the Federal
      and State governments and products to the American public from
      trona production on Federal lands, the Mineral Leasing Act should
      be amended to increase the acreage limitation for Federal sodium
      leases."

    interests, or any part thereof, under agreements approved by the
    Secretary of the Interior made jointly or severally with lessees or
    permittees of lands or mineral deposits of the United States or
    others, for the purpose of more properly conserving the oil and gas
    resources within such State. Such agreements may provide for the
    cooperative or unit operation or development of part or all of any
    oil or gas pool, field, or area; for the allocation of production
    and the sharing of proceeds from the whole or any specified part
    thereof regardless of the particular tract from which production is

    SUBCHAPTER I - GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 185. Rights-of-way for pipelines through Federal lands

-STATUTE-
    (a) Grant of authority
      Rights-of-way through any Federal lands may be granted by the
    Secretary of the Interior or appropriate agency head for pipeline
    purposes for the transportation of oil, natural gas, synthetic
    liquid or gaseous fuels, or any refined product produced therefrom
    to any applicant possessing the qualifications provided in section
    181 of this title in accordance with the provisions of this
    section.
    (b) Definitions
      (1) For the purposes of this section "Federal lands" means all
    lands owned by the United States except lands in the National Park
    System, lands held in trust for an Indian or Indian tribe, and
    lands on the Outer Continental Shelf. A right-of-way through a
    Federal reservation shall not be granted if the Secretary or agency
    head determines that it would be inconsistent with the purposes of
    the reservation.
      (2) "Secretary" means the Secretary of the Interior.
      (3) "Agency head" means the head of any Federal department or
    independent Federal office or agency, other than the Secretary of
    the Interior, which has jurisdiction over Federal lands.
    (c) Inter-agency coordination
      (1) Where the surface of all of the Federal lands involved in a
    proposed right-of-way or permit is under the jurisdiction of one
    Federal agency, the agency head, rather than the Secretary, is
    authorized to grant or renew the right-of-way or permit for the
    purposes set forth in this section.
      (2) Where the surface of the Federal lands involved is
    administered by the Secretary or by two or more Federal agencies,
    the Secretary is authorized, after consultation with the agencies
    involved, to grant or renew rights-of-way or permits through the
    Federal lands involved. The Secretary may enter into interagency
    agreements with all other Federal agencies having jurisdiction over
    Federal lands for the purpose of avoiding duplication, assigning
    responsibility, expediting review of rights-of-way or permit
    applications, issuing joint regulations, and assuring a decision
    based upon a comprehensive review of all factors involved in any
    right-of-way or permit application. Each agency head shall
    administer and enforce the provisions of this section, appropriate
    regulations, and the terms and conditions of rights-of-way or
    permits insofar as they involve Federal lands under the agency
    head's jurisdiction.
    (d) Width limitations
      The width of a right-of-way shall not exceed fifty feet plus the
    ground occupied by the pipeline (that is, the pipe and its related
    facilities) unless the Secretary or agency head finds, and records
    the reasons for his finding, that in his judgment a wider right-of-
    way is necessary for operation and maintenance after construction,
    or to protect the environment or public safety. Related facilities
    include but are not limited to valves, pump stations, supporting
    structures, bridges, monitoring and communication devices, surge
    and storage tanks, terminals, roads, airstrips and campsites and
    they need not necessarily be connected or contiguous to the pipe
    and may be the subjects of separate rights-of-way.
    (e) Temporary permits
      A right-of-way may be supplemented by such temporary permits for
    the use of Federal lands in the vicinity of the pipeline as the
    Secretary or agency head finds are necessary in connection with
    construction, operation, maintenance, or termination of the
    pipeline, or to protect the natural environment or public safety.
    (f) Regulatory authority
      Rights-of-way or permits granted or renewed pursuant to this
    section shall be subject to regulations promulgated in accord with
    the provisions of this section and shall be subject to such terms
    and conditions as the Secretary or agency head may prescribe
    regarding extent, duration, survey, location, construction,
    operation, maintenance, use, and termination.
    (g) Pipeline safety
      The Secretary or agency head shall impose requirements for the
    operation of the pipeline and related facilities in a manner that
    will protect the safety of workers and protect the public from
    sudden ruptures and slow degradation of the pipeline.
    (h) Environmental protection
      (1) Nothing in this section shall be construed to amend, repeal,
    modify, or change in any way the requirements of section 102(2)(C)
    [42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)] or any other provision of the National
    Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.].
      (2) The Secretary or agency head, prior to granting a right-of-
    way or permit pursuant to this section for a new project which may
    have a significant impact on the environment, shall require the
    applicant to submit a plan of construction, operation, and
    rehabilitation for such right-of-way or permit which shall comply
    with this section. The Secretary or agency head shall issue
    regulations or impose stipulations which shall include, but shall
    not be limited to: (A) requirements for restoration, revegetation,
    and curtailment of erosion of the surface of the land; (B)
    requirements to insure that activities in connection with the right-
    of-way or permit will not violate applicable air and water quality
    standards nor related facility siting standards established by or
    pursuant to law; (C) requirements designed to control or prevent
    (i) damage to the environment (including damage to fish and
    wildlife habitat), (ii) damage to public or private property, and
    (iii) hazards to public health and safety; and (D) requirements to
    protect the interests of individuals living in the general area of
    the right-of-way or permit who rely on the fish, wildlife, and
    biotic resources of the area for subsistence purposes. Such
    regulations shall be applicable to every right-of-way or permit
    granted pursuant to this section, and may be made applicable by the
    Secretary or agency head to existing rights-of-way or permits, or
    rights-of-way or permits to be renewed pursuant to this section.
    (i) Disclosure
      If the applicant is a partnership, corporation, association, or
    other business entity, the Secretary or agency head shall require
    the applicant to disclose the identity of the participants in the
    entity. Such disclosure shall include where applicable (1) the name
    and address of each partner, (2) the name and address of each
    shareholder owning 3 per centum or more of the shares, together
    with the number and percentage of any class of voting shares of the
    entity which such shareholder is authorized to vote, and (3) the
    name and address of each affiliate of the entity together with, in
    the case of an affiliate controlled by the entity, the number of
    shares and the percentage of any class of voting stock of that
    affiliate owned, directly or indirectly, by that entity, and, in
    the case of an affiliate which controls that entity, the number of
    shares and the percentage of any class of voting stock of that
    entity owned, directly or indirectly, by the affiliate.
    (j) Technical and financial capability
      The Secretary or agency head shall grant or renew a right-of-way
    or permit under this section only when he is satisfied that the
    applicant has the technical and financial capability to construct,
    operate, maintain, and terminate the project for which the right-of-
    way or permit is requested in accordance with the requirements of
    this section.
    (k) Public hearings
      The Secretary or agency head by regulation shall establish
    procedures, including public hearings where appropriate, to give
    Federal, State, and local government agencies and the public
    adequate notice and an opportunity to comment upon right-of-way
    applications filed after the date of enactment of this subsection.
    (l) Reimbursement of costs
      The applicant for a right-of-way or permit shall reimburse the
    United States for administrative and other costs incurred in
    processing the application, and the holder of a right-of-way or
    permit shall reimburse the United States for the costs incurred in
    monitoring the construction, operation, maintenance, and
    termination of any pipeline and related facilities on such right-of-
    way or permit area and shall pay annually in advance the fair
    market rental value of the right-of-way or permit, as determined by
    the Secretary or agency head.
    (m) Bonding
      Where he deems it appropriate the Secretary or agency head may
    require a holder of a right-of-way or permit to furnish a bond, or
    other security, satisfactory to the Secretary or agency head to
    secure all or any of the obligations imposed by the terms and
    conditions of the right-of-way or permit or by any rule or
    regulation of the Secretary or agency head.
    (n) Duration of grant
      Each right-of-way or permit granted or renewed pursuant to this
    section shall be limited to a reasonable term in light of all
    circumstances concerning the project, but in no event more than
    thirty years. In determining the duration of a right-of-way the
    Secretary or agency head shall, among other things, take into
    consideration the cost of the facility, its useful life, and any
    public purpose it serves. The Secretary or agency head shall renew
    any right-of-way, in accordance with the provisions of this
    section, so long as the project is in commercial operation and is
    operated and maintained in accordance with all of the provisions of
    this section.
    (o) Suspension or termination of right-of-way
      (1) Abandonment of a right-of-way or noncompliance with any
    provision of this section may be grounds for suspension or
    termination of the right-of-way if (A) after due notice to the
    holder of the right-of-way, (B) a reasonable opportunity to comply
    with this section, and (C) an appropriate administrative proceeding
    pursuant to section 554 of title 5, the Secretary or agency head
    determines that any such ground exists and that suspension or
    termination is justified. No administrative proceeding shall be
    required where the right-of-way by its terms provides that it
    terminates on the occurrence of a fixed or agreed upon condition,
    event, or time.
      (2) If the Secretary or agency head determines that an immediate
    temporary suspension of activities within a right-of-way or permit
    area is necessary to protect public health or safety or the
    environment, he may abate such activities prior to an
    administrative proceeding.
      (3) Deliberate failure of the holder to use the right-of-way for
    the purpose for which it was granted or renewed for any continuous
    two-year period shall constitute a rebuttable presumption of
    abandonment of the right-of-way: Provided, That where the failure
    to use the right-of-way is due to circumstances not within the
    holder's control the Secretary or agency head is not required to
    commence proceedings to suspend or terminate the right-of-way.
    (p) Joint use of rights-of-way
      In order to minimize adverse environmental impacts and the
    proliferation of separate rights-of-way across Federal lands, the
    utilization of rights-of-way in common shall be required to the
    extent practical, and each right-of-way or permit shall reserve to
    the Secretary or agency head the right to grant additional rights-
    of-way or permits for compatible uses on or adjacent to rights-of-
    way or permit area granted pursuant to this section.
    (q) Statutes
      No rights-of-way for the purposes provided for in this section
    shall be granted or renewed across Federal lands except under and
    subject to the provisions, limitations, and conditions of this
    section. Any application for a right-of-way filed under any other
    law prior to the effective date of this provision may, at the
    applicant's option, be considered as an application under this
    section. The Secretary or agency head may require the applicant to
    submit any additional information he deems necessary to comply with
    the requirements of this section.
    (r) Common carriers
      (1) Pipelines and related facilities authorized under this
    section shall be constructed, operated, and maintained as common
    carriers.
      (2)(A) The owners or operators of pipelines subject to this
    section shall accept, convey, transport, or purchase without
    discrimination all oil or gas delivered to the pipeline without
    regard to whether such oil or gas was produced on Federal or non-
    Federal lands.
      (B) In the case of oil or gas produced from Federal lands or from
    the resources on the Federal lands in the vicinity of the pipeline,
    the Secretary may, after a full hearing with due notice thereof to
    the interested parties and a proper finding of facts, determine the
    proportionate amounts to be accepted, conveyed, transported or
    purchased.
      (3)(A) The common carrier provisions of this section shall not
    apply to any natural gas pipeline operated by any person subject to
    regulation under the Natural Gas Act [15 U.S.C. 717 et seq.] or by
    any public utility subject to regulation by a State or municipal
    regulatory agency having jurisdiction to regulate the rates and
    charges for the sale of natural gas to consumers within the State
    or municipality.
      (B) Where natural gas not subject to State regulatory or
    conservation laws governing its purchase by pipelines is offered
    for sale, each such pipeline shall purchase, without
    discrimination, any such natural gas produced in the vicinity of
    the pipeline.
      (4) The Government shall in express terms reserve and shall
    provide in every lease of oil lands under this chapter that the
    lessee, assignee, or beneficiary, if owner or operator of a
    controlling interest in any pipeline or of any company operating
    the pipeline which may be operated accessible to the oil derived
    from lands under such lease, shall at reasonable rates and without
    discrimination accept and convey the oil of the Government or of
    any citizen or company not the owner of any pipeline operating a
    lease or purchasing gas or oil under the provisions of this
    chapter.
      (5) Whenever the Secretary has reason to believe that any owner
    or operator subject to this section is not operating any oil or gas
    pipeline in complete accord with its obligations as a common
    carrier hereunder, he may request the Attorney General to prosecute
    an appropriate proceeding before the Secretary of Energy or Federal
    Energy Regulatory Commission or any appropriate State agency or the
    United States district court for the district in which the pipeline
    or any part thereof is located, to enforce such obligation or to
    impose any penalty provided therefor, or the Secretary may, by
    proceeding as provided in this section, suspend or terminate the
    said grant of right-of-way for noncompliance with the provisions of
    this section.
      (6) The Secretary or agency head shall require, prior to granting
    or renewing a right-of-way, that the applicant submit and disclose
    all plans, contracts, agreements, or other information or material
    which he deems necessary to determine whether a right-of-way shall
    be granted or renewed and the terms and conditions which should be
    included in the right-of-way. Such information may include, but is
    not limited to: (A) conditions for, and agreements among owners or
    operators, regarding the addition of pumping facilities, looping,
    or otherwise increasing the pipeline or terminal's throughput
    capacity in response to actual or anticipated increases in demand;
    (B) conditions for adding or abandoning intake, offtake, or storage
    points or facilities; and (C) minimum shipment or purchase tenders.
    (s) Exports of Alaskan North Slope oil
      (1) Subject to paragraphs (2) through (6) of this subsection and
    notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or any other
    provision of law (including any regulation) applicable to the
    export of oil transported by pipeline over right-of-way granted
    pursuant to section 1652 of title 43, such oil may be exported
    unless the President finds that exportation of this oil is not in
    the national interest. The President shall make his national
    interest determination within five months of November 28, 1995. In
    evaluating whether exports of this oil are in the national
    interest, the President shall at a minimum consider - 
        (A) whether exports of this oil would diminish the total
      quantity or quality of petroleum available to the United States;
        (B) the results of an appropriate environmental review,
      including consideration of appropriate measures to mitigate any
      potential adverse effects of exports of this oil on the
      environment, which shall be completed within four months of
      November 28, 1995; and
        (C) whether exports of this oil are likely to cause sustained
      material oil supply shortages or sustained oil prices
      significantly above world market levels that would cause
      sustained material adverse employment effects in the United
      States or that would cause substantial harm to consumers,
      including noncontiguous States and Pacific territories.

    If the President determines that exports of this oil are in the
    national interest, he may impose such terms and conditions (other
    than a volume limitation) as are necessary or appropriate to ensure
    that such exports are consistent with the national interest.
      (2) Except in the case of oil exported to a country with which
    the United States entered into a bilateral international oil supply
    agreement before November 26, 1979, or to a country pursuant to the
    International Emergency Oil Sharing Plan of the International
    Energy Agency, any oil transported by pipeline over right-of-way
    granted pursuant to section 1652 of title 43 shall, when exported,
    be transported by a vessel documented under the laws of the United
    States and owned by a citizen of the United States (as determined
    in accordance with section 50501 of title 46).
      (3) Nothing in this subsection shall restrict the authority of
    the President under the Constitution, the International Emergency
    Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National
    Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), or Part B of title II of
    the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6271-76) to
    prohibit exports.
      (4) The Secretary of Commerce shall issue any rules necessary for
    implementation of the President's national interest determination,
    including any licensing requirements and conditions, within 30 days
    of the date of such determination by the President. The Secretary
    of Commerce shall consult with the Secretary of Energy in
    administering the provisions of this subsection.
      (5) If the Secretary of Commerce finds that exporting oil under
    authority of this subsection has caused sustained material oil
    supply shortages or sustained oil prices significantly above world
    market levels and further finds that these supply shortages or
    price increases have caused or are likely to cause sustained
    material adverse employment effects in the United States, the
    Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of
    Energy, shall recommend, and the President may take, appropriate
    action concerning exports of this oil, which may include modifying
    or revoking authority to export such oil.
      (6) Administrative action under this subsection is not subject to
    sections 551 and 553 through 559 of title 5.
    (t) Existing rights-of-way
      The Secretary or agency head may ratify and confirm any right-of-
    way or permit for an oil or gas pipeline or related facility that
    was granted under any provision of law before the effective date of
    this subsection, if it is modified by mutual agreement to comply to
    the extent practical with the provisions of this section. Any
    action taken by the Secretary or agency head pursuant to this
    subsection shall not be considered a major Federal action requiring
    a detailed statement pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National
    Environmental Policy Act of 1970 (Public Law 90-190; 42 U.S.C.
    4321).(!1)

    (u) Limitations on export
      Any domestically produced crude oil transported by pipeline over
    rights-of-way granted pursuant to this section, except such crude
    oil which is either exchanged in similar quantity for convenience
    or increased efficiency of transportation with persons or the
    government of an adjacent foreign state, or which is temporarily
    exported for convenience or increased efficiency of transportation
    across parts of an adjacent foreign state and reenters the United
    States, shall be subject to all of the limitations and licensing
    requirements of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C.
    App. 2401 and following) and, in addition, before any crude oil
    subject to this section may be exported under the limitations and
    licensing requirements and penalty and enforcement provisions of
    the Export Administration Act of 1979 the President must make and
    publish an express finding that such exports will not diminish the
    total quantity or quality of petroleum available to the United
    States, and are in the national interest and are in accord with the
    provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979: Provided, That
    the President shall submit reports to the Congress containing
    findings made under this section, and after the date of receipt of
    such report Congress shall have a period of sixty calendar days,
    thirty days of which Congress must have been in session, to
    consider whether exports under the terms of this section are in the
    national interest. If the Congress within this time period passes a
    concurrent resolution of disapproval stating disagreement with the
    President's finding concerning the national interest, further
    exports made pursuant to the aforementioned Presidential findings
    shall cease.
    (v) State standards
      The Secretary or agency head shall take into consideration and to
    the extent practical comply with State standards for right-of-way
    construction, operation, and maintenance.
    (w) Reports
      (1) The Secretary and other appropriate agency heads shall report
    to the Committee on Natural Resources of the United States House of
    Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources
    of the United States Senate annually on the administration of this
    section and on the safety and environmental requirements imposed
    pursuant thereto.
      (2) The Secretary or agency head shall promptly notify the
    Committee on Natural Resources of the United States House of
    Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources
    of the United States Senate upon receipt of an application for a
    right-of-way for a pipeline twenty-four inches or more in diameter,
    and no right-of-way for such a pipeline shall be granted until a
    notice of intention to grant the right-of-way, together with the
    Secretary's or agency head's detailed findings as to the terms and
    conditions he proposes to impose, has been submitted to such
    committees.
      (3) Periodically, but at least once a year, the Secretary of the
    Department of Transportation shall cause the examination of all
    pipelines and associated facilities on Federal lands and shall
    cause the prompt reporting of any potential leaks or safety
    problems.
    (x) Liability
      (1) The Secretary or agency head shall promulgate regulations and
    may impose stipulations specifying the extent to which holders of
    rights-of-way and permits under this chapter shall be liable to the
    United States for damage or injury incurred by the United States in
    connection with the right-of-way or permit. Where the right-of-way
    or permit involves lands which are under the exclusive jurisdiction
    of the Federal Government, the Secretary or agency head shall
    promulgate regulations specifying the extent to which holders shall
    be liable to third parties for injuries incurred in connection with
    the right-of-way or permit.
      (2) The Secretary or agency head may, by regulation or
    stipulation, impose a standard of strict liability to govern
    activities taking place on a right-of-way or permit area which the
    Secretary or agency head determines, in his discretion, to present
    a foreseeable hazard or risk of danger to the United States.
      (3) Regulations and stipulations pursuant to this subsection
    shall not impose strict liability for damage or injury resulting
    from (A) an act of war, or (B) negligence of the United States.
      (4) Any regulation or stipulation imposing liability without
    fault shall include a maximum limitation on damages commensurate
    with the foreseeable risks or hazards presented. Any liability for
    damage or injury in excess of this amount shall be determined by
    ordinary rules of negligence.
      (5) The regulations and stipulations shall also specify the
    extent to which such holders shall indemnify or hold harmless the
    United States for liability, damage, or claims arising in
    connection with the right-of-way or permit.
      (6) Any regulation or stipulation promulgated or imposed pursuant
    to this section shall provide that all owners of any interest in,
    and all affiliates or subsidiaries of any holder of, a right-of-way
    or permit shall be liable to the United States in the event that a
    claim for damage or injury cannot be collected from the holder.
      (7) In any case where liability without fault is imposed pursuant
    to this subsection and the damages involved were caused by the
    negligence of a third party, the rules of subrogation shall apply
    in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction where the damage
    occurred.
    (y) Antitrust laws
      The grant of a right-of-way or permit pursuant to this section
    shall grant no immunity from the operation of the Federal antitrust
    laws.

    action taken to prevent such explosion or spillage."
      1994 - Subsec. (w)(1), (2). Pub. L. 103-437 substituted "Natural

    be granted until sixty days (not counting days on which the House
    of Representatives or the Senate has adjourned for more than three
    days) after a notice of intention to grant the right-of-way,
    together with the Secretary's or agency head's detailed findings as

    25 feet on each side of the pipeline could be granted and under
    which the pipeline was to be operated as a common carrier.
      1953 - Act Aug. 12, 1953, permitted companies subject to Federal
    regulation, or public utilities subject to State regulations, to
    pass through the public domain without incurring the obligation to

    or natural gas produced from Government lands in the vicinity of
    the pipe line in such proportionate amounts as the Secretary of the

-EXEC-
              EXPORTS OF ALASKAN NORTH SLOPE (ANS) CRUDE OIL          
      Memorandum of President of the United States, Apr. 28, 1996, 61
    F.R. 19507, provided:
      Memorandum for the Secretary of Commerce [and] the Secretary of
    Energy
      Pursuant to section 28(s) of the Mineral Leasing Act, as amended,
    30 U.S.C. 185, I hereby determine that exports of crude oil
    transported over right-of-way granted pursuant to section 203 of
    the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act [43 U.S.C. 1652] are in
    the national interest. In making this determination, I have taken
    into account the conclusions of an interagency working group, which
    found that such oil exports:
       - will not diminish the total quantity or quality of petroleum
    available to the United States; and
       - are not likely to cause sustained material oil supply
    shortages or sustained oil price increases significantly above
    world market levels that would cause sustained material adverse
    employment effects in the United States or that would cause
    substantial harm to consumers, including those located in
    noncontiguous States and Pacific Territories.
      I have also considered the interagency group's conclusions
    regarding potential environmental impacts of lifting the ban. Based
    on their findings and recommendations, I have concluded that
    exports of such crude oil will not pose significant risks to the
    environment if certain terms and conditions are met.
      Therefore, pursuant to section 28(s) of the Mineral Leasing Act I
    direct the Secretary of Commerce to promulgate immediately a
    general license, or a license exception, authorizing exports of
    such crude oil, subject to appropriate documentation requirements,
    and consistent with the following conditions:
       - tankers exporting ANS exports must use the same route that
    they do for shipments to Hawaii until they reach a point 300 miles
    due south of Cape Hinchinbrook Light and then turn toward Asian
    destinations. After reaching that point, tankers in the ANS oil
    trade must remain outside of the 200 nautical-miles Exclusive
    Economic Zone of the United States as defined in the Fisheries
    Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1811) [probably means
    the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act]. This
    condition also applies to tankers returning from foreign ports to
    Valdez, Alaska. Exceptions can be made at the discretion of the
    vessel master only to ensure the safety of the vessel;
       - that export tankers be equipped with satellite-based
    communications systems that will enable the Coast Guard
    independently to determine their location. The Coast Guard will
    conduct appropriate monitoring of the tankers, a measure that will
    ensure compliance with the 200-mile condition, and help the Coast
    Guard respond quickly to any emergencies;
       - the owner or operator of an Alaskan North Slope crude oil
    export tankship shall maintain a Critical Area Inspection Plan for
    each tankship in the trade in accordance with the U.S. Coast
    Guard's Navigation and Inspection Circular No. 15-91 as amended,
    which shall include an annual internal survey of the vessel's cargo
    block tanks; and
       - the owner or operator of an Alaskan North Slope crude oil
    export tankship shall adopt a mandatory program of deep water
    ballast exchange (i.e., in 2,000 meters water depth). Exceptions
    can be made at the discretion of the captain only in order to
    ensure the safety of the vessel. Recordkeeping subject to Coast
    Guard audit will be required as part of this regime.
      The Secretary of Commerce is authorized and directed to inform
    the appropriate committees of the Congress of this determination
    and to publish it in the Federal Register.
                                                     William J. Clinton.

-STATUTE-
      No lease issued under the authority of this chapter shall be
    assigned or sublet, except with the consent of the Secretary of the
    Interior. The lessee may, in the discretion of the Secretary of the

    Sec. 187a. Oil or gas leases; partial assignments

-STATUTE-
      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 187 of this
    title, any oil or gas lease issued under the authority of this
    chapter may be assigned or subleased, as to all or part of the
    acreage included therein, subject to final approval by the
    Secretary and as to either a divided or undivided interest therein,
    to any person or persons qualified to own a lease under this
    chapter, and any assignment or sublease shall take effect as of the
    first day of the lease month following the date of filing in the
    proper land office of three original executed counterparts thereof,
    together with any required bond and proof of the qualification
    under this chapter of the assignee or sublessee to take or hold
    such lease or interest therein. Until such approval, however, the
    assignor or sublessor and his surety shall continue to be
    responsible for the performance of any and all obligations as if no
    assignment or sublease had been executed. The Secretary shall
    disapprove the assignment or sublease only for lack of
    qualification of the assignee or sublessee or for lack of
    sufficient bond: Provided, however, That the Secretary may, in his
    discretion, disapprove an assignment of any of the following,
    unless the assignment constitutes the entire lease or is
    demonstrated to further the development of oil and gas:
        (1) A separate zone or deposit under any lease.
        (2) A part of a legal subdivision.
        (3) Less than 640 acres outside Alaska or of less than 2,560
      acres within Alaska.

    Requests for approval of assignment or sublease shall be processed
    promptly by the Secretary. Except where the assignment or sublease
    is not in accordance with applicable law, the approval shall be
    given within 60 days of the date of receipt by the Secretary of a
    request for such approval. Upon approval of any assignment or
    sublease, the assignee or sublessee shall be bound by the terms of
    the lease to the same extent as if such assignee or sublessee were
    the original lessee, any conditions in the assignment or sublease
    to the contrary notwithstanding. Any partial assignment of any
    lease shall segregate the assigned and retained portions thereof,
    and as above provided, release and discharge the assignor from all
    obligations thereafter accruing with respect to the assigned lands;
    and such segregated leases shall continue in full force and effect
    for the primary term of the original lease, but for not less than
    two years after the date of discovery of oil or gas in paying
    quantities upon any other segregated portion of the lands
    originally subject to such lease. Assignments under this section
    may also be made of parts of leases which are in their extended
    term because of any provision of this chapter. Upon the segregation
    by an assignment of a lease issued after September 2, 1960 and held
    beyond its primary term by production, actual or suspended, or the
    payment of compensatory royalty, the segregated lease of an
    undeveloped, assigned, or retained part shall continue for two
    years, and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying
    quantities.

    and to place all wells on the lands to be relinquished in condition

    covered by such lease is situated, or in the event that there is no
    district land office for such district, then in the post office
    nearest such land. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section,
    however, upon failure of a lessee to pay rental on or before the
    anniversary date of the lease, for any lease on which there is no
    well capable of producing oil or gas in paying quantities, the
    lease shall automatically terminate by operation of law: Provided,
    however, That when the time for payment falls upon any day in which
    the proper office for payment is not open, payment may be received
    the next official working day and shall be considered as timely
    made: Provided, That if the rental payment due under a lease is
    paid on or before the anniversary date but either (1) the amount of
    the payment has been or is hereafter deficient and the deficiency
    is nominal, as determined by the Secretary by regulation, or (2)
    the payment was calculated in accordance with the acreage figure
    stated in the lease, or in any decision affecting the lease, or
    made in accordance with a bill or decision which has been rendered
    by him and such figure, bill, or decision is found to be in error
    resulting in a deficiency, such lease shall not automatically
    terminate unless (1) a new lease had been issued prior to May 12,
    1970, or (2) the lessee fails to pay the deficiency within the
    period prescribed in a notice of deficiency sent to him by the
    Secretary.
    (c) Reinstatement
      Where any lease has been or is hereafter terminated automatically
    by operation of law under this section for failure to pay on or
    before the anniversary date the full amount of rental due, but such
    rental was paid on or tendered within twenty days thereafter, and
    it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Interior
    that such failure was either justifiable or not due to a lack of
    reasonable diligence on the part of the lessee, the Secretary may
    reinstate the lease if - 
        (1) a petition for reinstatement, together with the required
      rental, including back rental accruing from the date of
      termination of the lease, is filed with the Secretary; and
        (2) no valid lease has been issued affecting any of the lands
      covered by the terminated lease prior to the filing of said
      petition. The Secretary shall not issue any new lease affecting
      any of the lands covered by such terminated lease for a
      reasonable period, as determined in accordance with regulations
      issued by him. In any case where a reinstatement of a terminated
      lease is granted under this subsection and the Secretary finds
      that the reinstatement of such lease will not afford the lessee a
      reasonable opportunity to continue operations under the lease,
      the Secretary may, at his discretion, extend the term of such
      lease for such period as he deems reasonable: Provided, That (A)
      such extension shall not exceed a period equivalent to the time
      beginning when the lessee knew or should have known of the
      termination and ending on the date the Secretary grants such
      petition; (B) such extension shall not exceed a period equal to
      the unexpired portion of the lease or any extension thereof
      remaining at the date of termination; and (C) when the
      reinstatement occurs after the expiration of the term or
      extension thereof the lease may be extended from the date the
      Secretary grants the petition.
    (d) Additional grounds for reinstatement
      (1) Where any oil and gas lease issued pursuant to section 226(b)
    or (c) of this title or the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands
    (30 U.S.C. 351 et seq.) has been, or is hereafter, terminated
    automatically by operation of law under this section for failure to
    pay on or before the anniversary date the full amount of the rental
    due, and such rental is not paid or tendered within twenty days
    thereafter, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary of
    the Interior that such failure was justifiable or not due to lack
    of reasonable diligence on the part of the lessee, or, no matter
    when the rental is paid after termination, it is shown to the
    satisfaction of the Secretary that such failure was inadvertent,
    the Secretary may reinstate the lease as of the date of termination
    for the unexpired portion of the primary term of the original lease
    or any extension thereof remaining at the date of termination, and
    so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities.
    In any case where a lease is reinstated under this subsection and
    the Secretary finds that the reinstatement of such lease (A) occurs
    after the expiration of the primary term or any extension thereof,
    or (B) will not afford the lessee a reasonable opportunity to
    continue operations under the lease, the Secretary may, at his
    discretion, extend the term of such lease for such period as he
    deems reasonable, but in no event for more than two years from the
    date the Secretary authorizes the reinstatement and so long
    thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities.
      (2) No lease shall be reinstated under paragraph (1) of this
    subsection unless - 
        (A) with respect to any lease that terminated under subsection
      (b) of this section on or before August 8, 2005, a petition for
      reinstatement (together with the required back rental and royalty
      accruing after the date of termination) is filed on or before the
      earlier of - 
          (i) 60 days after the lessee receives from the Secretary
        notice of termination, whether by return of check or by any
        other form of actual notice; or
          (ii) 15 months after the termination of the lease; or

        (B) with respect to any lease that terminates under subsection
      (b) of this section after August 8, 2005, a petition for
      reinstatement (together with the required back rental and royalty
      accruing after the date of termination) is filed on or before the
      earlier of - 
          (i) 60 days after receipt of the notice of termination sent
        by the Secretary by certified mail to all lessees of record; or
          (ii) 24 months after the termination of the lease.
    (e) Conditions for reinstatement
      Any reinstatement under subsection (d) of this section shall be
    made only if these conditions are met:
        (1) no valid lease, whether still in existence or not, shall
      have been issued affecting any of the lands covered by the
      terminated lease prior to the filing of such petition: Provided,
      however, That after receipt of a petition for reinstatement, the
      Secretary shall not issue any new lease affecting any of the
      lands covered by such terminated lease for a reasonable period,
      as determined in accordance with regulations issued by him;
        (2) payment of back rentals and either the inclusion in a
      reinstated lease issued pursuant to the provisions of section
      226(b) of this title of a requirement for future rentals at a
      rate of not less than $10 per acre per year, or the inclusion in
      a reinstated lease issued pursuant to the provisions of section
      226(c) of this title of a requirement that future rentals shall
      be at a rate not less than $5 per acre per year, all as
      determined by the Secretary;
        (3)(A) payment of back royalties and the inclusion in a
      reinstated lease issued pursuant to the provisions of section
      226(b) of this title of a requirement for future royalties at a
      rate of not less than 16(!2/3) percent computed on a sliding
      scale based upon the average production per well per day, at a
      rate which shall be not less than 4 percentage points greater
      than the competitive royality (!1) schedule then in force and
      used for royalty determination for competitive leases issued
      pursuant to such section as determined by the Secretary:
      Provided, That royalty on such reinstated lease shall be paid on
      all production removed or sold from such lease subsequent to the
      termination of the original lease;

        (B) payment of back royalties and inclusion in a reinstated
      lease issued pursuant to the provisions of section 226(c) of this
      title of a requirement for future royalties at a rate not less
      than 16 2/3  percent: Provided, That royalty on such reinstated
      lease shall be paid on all production removed or sold from such
      lease subsequent to the cancellation or termination of the
      original lease; and
        (4) notice of the proposed reinstatement of a terminated lease,
      including the terms and conditions of reinstatement, shall be
      published in the Federal Register at least thirty days in advance
      of the reinstatement.

    A copy of said notice, together with information concerning rental,
    royalty, volume of production, if any, and any other matter which
    the Secretary deemed significant in making this determination to
    reinstate, shall be furnished to the Committee on Natural Resources
    of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and
    Natural Resources of the Senate at least thirty days in advance of
    the reinstatement. The lessee of a reinstated lease shall reimburse
    the Secretary for the administrative costs of reinstating the
    lease, but not to exceed $500. In addition the lessee shall
    reimburse the Secretary for the cost of publication in the Federal
    Register of the notice of proposed reinstatement.
    (f) Issuance of noncompetitive oil and gas lease; conditions
      Where an unpatented oil placer mining claim validly located prior
    to February 24, 1920, which has been or is currently producing or
    is capable of producing oil or gas, has been or is hereafter deemed
    conclusively abandoned for failure to file timely the required
    instruments or copies of instruments required by section 1744 of
    title 43, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary that
    such failure was inadvertent, justifiable, or not due to lack of
    reasonable diligence on the part of the owner, the Secretary may
    issue, for the lands covered by the abandoned unpatented oil placer
    mining claim, a noncompetitive oil and gas lease, consistent with
    the provisions of section 226(e) of this title, to be effective
    from the statutory date the claim was deemed conclusively
    abandoned. Issuance of such a lease shall be conditioned upon:
        (1) a petition for issuance of a noncompetitive oil and gas
      lease, together with the required rental and royalty, including
      back rental and royalty accruing from the statutory date of
      abandonment of the oil placer mining claim, being filed with the
      Secretary - 
          (A) with respect to any claim deemed conclusively abandoned
        on or before January 12, 1983, on or before the one hundred and
        twentieth day after January 12, 1983, or
          (B) with respect to any claim deemed conclusively abandoned
        after January 12, 1983, on or before the one hundred and
        twentieth day after final notification by the Secretary or a
        court of competent jurisdiction of the determination of the
        abandonment of the oil placer mining claim;

        (2) a valid lease not having been issued affecting any of the
      lands covered by the abandoned oil placer mining claim prior to
      the filing of such petition: Provided, however, That after the
      filing of a petition for issuance of a lease under this
      subsection, the Secretary shall not issue any new lease affecting
      any of the lands covered by such abandoned oil placer mining
      claim for a reasonable period, as determined in accordance with
      regulations issued by him;
        (3) a requirement in the lease for payment of rental, including
      back rentals accruing from the statutory date of abandonment of
      the oil placer mining claim, of not less than $5 per acre per
      year;
        (4) a requirement in the lease for payment of royalty on
      production removed or sold from the oil placer mining claim,
      including all royalty on production made subsequent to the
      statutory date the claim was deemed conclusively abandoned, of
      not less than 12 1/2  percent; and
        (5) compliance with the notice and reimbursement of costs
      provisions of paragraph (4) of subsection (e) of this section but
      addressed to the petition covering the conversion of an abandoned
      unpatented oil placer mining claim to a noncompetitive oil and
      gas lease.
    (g) Treatment of leases
      (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a reinstated
    lease shall be treated as a competitive or a noncompetitive oil and
    gas lease in the same manner as the original lease issued pursuant
    to section 226(b) or (c) of this title.
      (2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the issuance of
    a lease in lieu of an abandoned patented oil placer mining claim
    shall be treated as a noncompetitive oil and gas lease issued
    pursuant to section 226(c) of this title.
      (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any lease issued
    pursuant to section 223 of this title shall be eligible for
    reinstatement under the terms and conditions set forth in
    subsections (c), (d), and (e) of this section, applicable to leases
    issued under section 226(c) of this title except, that, upon
    reinstatement, such lease shall continue for twenty years and so
    long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities.
      (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any lease issued
    pursuant to section 223 of this title shall, upon renewal on or
    after November 15, 1990, continue for twenty years and so long
    thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities.
    (h) Statutory provisions applicable to leases
      The minimum royalty provisions of section 226(m) of this title
    and the provisions of section 209 of this title shall be applicable
    to leases issued pursuant to subsections (d) and (f) of this
    section.
    (i) Royalty reductions
      (1) In acting on a petition to issue a noncompetitive oil and gas
    lease, under subsection (f) of this section or in response to a
    request filed after issuance of such a lease, or both, the
    Secretary is authorized to reduce the royalty on such lease if in
    his judgment it is equitable to do so or the circumstances warrant
    such relief due to uneconomic or other circumstances which could
    cause undue hardship or premature termination of production.
      (2) In acting on a petition for reinstatement pursuant to
    subsection (d) of this section or in response to a request filed
    after reinstatement, or both, the Secretary is authorized to reduce
    the royalty in that reinstated lease on the entire leasehold or any
    tract or portion thereof segregated for royalty purposes if, in his
    judgment, there are uneconomic or other circumstances which could
    cause undue hardship or premature termination of production; or
    because of any written action of the United States, its agents or
    employees, which preceded, and was a major consideration in, the
    lessee's expenditure of funds to develop the property under the
    lease after the rent had become due and had not been paid; or if in
    the judgment of the Secretary it is equitable to do so for any
    reason.
    (j) Discretion of Secretary
      Where, in the judgment of the Secretary of the Interior, drilling
    operations were being diligently conducted on the last day of the
    primary term of the lease, and, except for nonpayment of rental,
    the lessee would have been entitled to extension of his lease,
    pursuant to section 226-1(d) of this title, the Secretary of the
    Interior may reinstate such lease notwithstanding the failure of
    the lessee to have made payment of the next year's rental, provided
    the conditions of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (c) of
    this section are satisfied.

    Sec. 188a. Surrender of leases

-STATUTE-
      The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to accept the
    surrender of any lease issued pursuant to any of the provisions of
    this chapter, or any amendment thereof, where the surrender is
    filed in the Bureau of Land Management subsequent to the accrual
    but prior to the payment of the yearly rental due under the lease,
    upon payment of the accrued rental on a pro rata monthly basis for
    the portion of the lease year prior to the filing of the surrender.
    The authority granted to the Secretary of the Interior by this
    section shall extend only to cases in which he finds that the

    Sec. 191. Disposition of moneys received

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      All money received from sales, bonuses, royalties including
    interest charges collected under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty
    Management Act of 1982 [30 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.], and rentals of the
    public lands under the provisions of this chapter and the
    Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 [30 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.], shall be
    paid into the Treasury of the United States; and, subject to the
    provisions of subsection (b) of this section, 50 per centum thereof
    shall be paid by the Secretary of the Treasury to the State other
    than Alaska within the boundaries of which the leased lands or
    deposits are or were located; said moneys paid to any of such
    States on or after January 1, 1976, to be used by such State and
    its subdivisions, as the legislature of the State may direct giving
    priority to those subdivisions of the State socially or
    economically impacted by development of minerals leased under this
    chapter, for (i) planning, (ii) construction and maintenance of
    public facilities, and (iii) provision of public service; and
    excepting those from Alaska, 40 per centum thereof shall be paid
    into, reserved, appropriated, as part of the reclamation fund
    created by the Act of Congress known as the Reclamation Act,
    approved June 17, 1902, and of those from Alaska, 90 per centum
    thereof shall be paid to the State of Alaska for disposition by the
    legislature thereof: Provided, That all moneys which may accrue to
    the United States under the provisions of this chapter and the
    Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 from lands within the naval petroleum
    reserves shall be deposited in the Treasury as "miscellaneous
    receipts", as provided by section 7433(b) of title 10. All moneys
    received under the provisions of this chapter and the Geothermal
    Steam Act of 1970 not otherwise disposed of by this section shall
    be credited to miscellaneous receipts. Payments to States under
    this section with respect to any moneys received by the United
    States, shall be made not later than the last business day of the
    month in which such moneys are warranted by the United States
    Treasury to the Secretary as having been received, except for any
    portion of such moneys which is under challenge and placed in a
    suspense account pending resolution of a dispute. Such warrants
    shall be issued by the United States Treasury not later than 10
    days after receipt of such moneys by the Treasury. Moneys placed in
    a suspense account which are determined to be payable to a State
    shall be made not later than the last business day of the month in
    which such dispute is resolved. Any such amount placed in a
    suspense account pending resolution shall bear interest until the
    dispute is resolved.
    (b) Administrative costs
      In determining the amount of payments to the States under this
    section, the amount of such payments shall not be reduced by any
    administrative or other costs incurred by the United States.
    (c) Rentals received on or after August 8, 2005
      (1) Notwithstanding the first sentence of subsection (a) of this
    section, any rentals received from leases in any State (other than
    the State of Alaska) on or after August 8, 2005, shall be deposited
    in the Treasury, to be allocated in accordance with paragraph (2).
      (2) Of the amounts deposited in the Treasury under paragraph (1) -
     
        (A) 50 percent shall be paid by the Secretary of the Treasury
      to the State within the boundaries of which the leased land is
      located or the deposits were derived; and
        (B) 50 percent shall be deposited in a special fund in the
      Treasury, to be known as the "BLM Permit Processing Improvement
      Fund" (referred to in this subsection as the "Fund").

      (3) For each of fiscal years 2006 through 2015, the Fund shall be
    available to the Secretary of the Interior for expenditure, without
    further appropriation and without fiscal year limitation, for the
    coordination and processing of oil and gas use authorizations on
    onshore Federal land under the jurisdiction of the Pilot Project
    offices identified in section 15924(d) of title 42.

                                 FINDINGS                             
      Pub. L. 106-393, title V, Sec. 502, Oct. 30, 2000, 114 Stat.
    1624, provided that: "The Congress finds the following:
        "(1) Section 10201 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
      1993 (Public Law 103-66; 107 Stat. 407) amended section 35 of the
      Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 191) to change the sharing of
      onshore mineral revenues and revenues from geothermal steam from
      a 50:50 split between the Federal Government and the States to a
      complicated formula that entailed deducting from the State share
      of leasing revenues '50 percent of the portion of the enacted
      appropriations of the Department of the Interior and any other
      agency during the preceding fiscal year allocable to the
      administration of all laws providing for the leasing of any
      onshore lands or interest in land owned by the United States for
      the production of the same types of minerals leasable under this
      Act or of geothermal steam, and to enforcement of such laws * *
      *'.
        "(2) There is no legislative record to suggest a sound public
      policy rationale for deducting prior-year administrative expenses
      from the sharing of current-year receipts, indicating that this
      change was made primarily for budget scoring reasons.
        "(3) The system put in place by this change in law has proved
      difficult to administer and has given rise to disputes between
      the Federal Government and the States as to the nature of
      allocable expenses. Federal accounting systems have proven to be
      poorly suited to breaking down administrative costs in the manner
      required by the law. Different Federal agencies implementing this
      law have used varying methodologies to identify allocable costs,
      resulting in an inequitable distribution of costs during fiscal
      years 1994 through 1996. In November 1997, the Inspector General
      of the Department of the Interior found that 'the congressionally
      approved method for cost sharing deductions effective in fiscal
      year 1997 may not accurately compute the deductions'.
        "(4) Given the lack of a substantive rationale for the 1993
      change in law and the complexity and administrative burden
      involved, a return to the sharing formula prior to the enactment
      of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 [Aug. 10, 1993]
      is justified."

    FUNDS HELD BY COLORADO AND UTAH FROM INTERIOR DEPARTMENT OIL SHALE
                                TEST LEASES
      Section 317(b) of Pub. L. 94-579 provided that: "Funds now held
    pursuant to said section 35 [this section] by the States of
    Colorado and Utah separately from the Department of the Interior
    oil shale test leases known as C-A; C-B; U-A and U-B shall be used
    by such States and subdivisions as the legislature of each State
    may direct giving priority to those subdivisions socially or
    economically impacted by the development of minerals leased under
    this Act for (1) planning, (2) construction and maintenance of
    public facilities, and (3) provision of public services."

                       ADMISSION OF ALASKA AS STATE

    Sec. 192. Payment of royalties in oil or gas; sale of such oil or
      gas

-STATUTE-
      All royalty accruing to the United States under any oil or gas
    lease or permit under this chapter on demand of the Secretary of
    the Interior shall be paid in oil or gas.
      Upon granting any oil or gas lease under this chapter, and from
    time to time thereafter during said lease, the Secretary of the
    Interior shall, except whenever in his judgment it is desirable to
    retain the same for the use of the United States, offer for sale
    for such period as he may determine, upon notice and advertisement
    on sealed bids or at public auction, all royalty oil and gas
    accruing or reserved to the United States under such lease. Such
    advertisement and sale shall reserve to the Secretary of the
    Interior the right to reject all bids whenever within his judgment
    the interest of the United States demands; and in cases where no
    satisfactory bid is received or where the accepted bidder fails to
    complete the purchase, or where the Secretary of the Interior shall
    determine that it is unwise in the public interest to accept the
    offer of the highest bidder, the Secretary of the Interior, within
    his discretion, may readvertise such royalty for sale, or sell at
    private sale at not less than the market price for such period, or
    accept the value thereof from the lessee: Provided, That inasmuch
    as the public interest will be served by the sale of royalty oil to
    refineries not having their own source of supply for crude oil, the
    Secretary of the Interior, when he determines that sufficient
    supplies of crude oil are not available in the open market to such
    refineries, is authorized and directed to grant preference to such
    refineries in the sale of oil under the provisions of this section,
    for processing or use in such refineries and not for resale in
    kind, and in so doing may sell to such refineries at private sale
    at not less than the market price any royalty oil accruing or
    reserved to the United States under leases issued pursuant to this
    chapter: Provided further, That in selling such royalty oil the
    Secretary of the Interior may at his discretion prorate such oil
    among such refineries in the area in which the oil is produced:
    Provided, however, That pending the making of a permanent contract
    for the sale of any royalty, oil or gas as herein provided, the
    Secretary of the Interior may sell the current product at private
    sale, at not less than the market price: And provided further, That
    any royalty, oil, or gas may be sold at not less than the market
    price at private sale to any department or agency of the United
    States.

          (A) the value of any lease or portion thereof issued or to be
        issued under this chapter;
          (B) the availability of any land for leasing under this
        chapter;
          (C) the ability of any person to obtain leases under this
        chapter; or
          (D) the provisions of this chapter and its implementing
        regulations.
    (b) Penalty
      Any person who knowingly violates the provisions of subsection
    (a) of this section shall be punished by a fine of not more than
    $500,000, imprisonment for not more than five years, or both.
    (c) Civil actions
      Whenever it shall appear that any person is engaged, or is about
    to engage, in any act which constitutes or will constitute a
    violation of subsection (a) of this section, the Attorney General
    may institute a civil action in the district court of the United
    States for the judicial district in which the defendant resides or
    in which the violation occurred or in which the lease or land
    involved is located, for a temporary restraining order, injunction,
    civil penalty of not more than $100,000 for each violation, or
    other appropriate remedy, including but not limited to, a
    prohibition from participation in exploration, leasing, or
    development of any Federal mineral, or any combination of the
    foregoing.
    (d) Corporations
      (1) Whenever a corporation or other entity is subject to civil or
    criminal action under this section, any officer, employee, or agent
    of such corporation or entity who knowingly authorized, ordered, or
    carried out the proscribed activity shall be subject to the same
    action.
      (2) Whenever any officer, employee, or agent of a corporation or
    other entity is subject to civil or criminal action under this
    section for activity conducted on behalf of the corporation or
    other entity, the corporation or other entity shall be subject to
    the same action, unless it is shown that the officer, employee, or
    agent was acting without the knowledge or consent of the
    corporation or other entity.
    (e) Remedies, fines, and imprisonment
      The remedies, penalties, fines, and imprisonment prescribed in
    this section shall be concurrent and cumulative and the exercise of
    one shall not preclude the exercise of the others. Further, the
    remedies, penalties, fines, and imprisonment prescribed in this
    section shall be in addition to any other remedies, penalties,
    fines, and imprisonment afforded by any other law or regulation.
    (f) State civil actions
      (1) A State may commence a civil action under subsection (c) of
    this section against any person conducting activity within the
    State in violation of this section. Civil actions brought by a
    State shall only be brought in the United States district court for
    the judicial district in which the defendant resides or in which
    the violation occurred or in which the lease or land involved is
    located. The district court shall have jurisdiction, without regard
    to the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to
    order appropriate remedies and penalties as described in subsection
    (c) of this section.
      (2) A State shall notify the Attorney General of the United
    States of any civil action filed by the State under this subsection

    activity conducted within that State filed by the Attorney General
    under this subsection within 30 days of filing of the action.
      (3) Any civil penalties recovered by a State under this
    subsection shall be retained by the State and may be expended in
    such manner and for such purposes as the State deems appropriate.
    If a civil action is jointly brought by the Attorney General and a
    State, by more than one State or by the Attorney General and more
    than one State, any civil penalties recovered as a result of the
    joint action shall be shared by the parties bringing the action in
    the manner determined by the court rendering judgment in such
    action.
      (4) If a State has commenced a civil action against a person
    conducting activity within the State in violation of this section,
    the Attorney General may join in such action but may not institute
    a separate action arising from the same activity under this
    section. If the Attorney General has commenced a civil action
    against a person conducting activity within a State in violation of
    this section, that State may join in such action but may not
    institute a separate action arising from the same activity under
    this section.
      (5) Nothing in this section shall deprive a State of jurisdiction
    to enforce its own civil and criminal laws against any person who
    may also be subject to civil and criminal action under this
    section.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 201. Leases and exploration

-STATUTE-
    (a) Leases
      (1) The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to divide any
    lands subject to this chapter which have been classified for coal
    leasing into leasing tracts of such size as he finds appropriate
    and in the public interest and which will permit the mining of all
    coal which can be economically extracted in such tract and
    thereafter he shall, in his discretion, upon the request of any
    qualified applicant or on his own motion, from time to time, offer
    such lands for leasing and shall award leases thereon by
    competitive bidding: Provided, That notwithstanding the competitive
    bidding requirement of this section, the Secretary may, subject to
    such conditions which he deems appropriate, negotiate the sale at
    fair market value of coal the removal of which is necessary and
    incidental to the exercise of a right-of-way permit issued pursuant
    to title V of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976
    [43 U.S.C. 1761 et seq.]. No less than 50 per centum of the total
    acreage offered for lease by the Secretary in any one year shall be
    leased under a system of deferred bonus payment. Upon default or
    cancellation of any coal lease for which bonus payments are due,
    any unpaid remainder of the bid shall be immediately payable to the
    United States. A reasonable number of leasing tracts shall be
    reserved and offered for lease in accordance with this section to
    public bodies, including Federal agencies, rural electric
    cooperatives, or nonprofit corporations controlled by any of such
    entities: Provided, That the coal so offered for lease shall be for
    use by such entity or entities in implementing a definite plan to
    produce energy for their own use or for sale to their members or
    customers (except for short-term sales to others). No bid shall be
    accepted which is less than the fair market value, as determined by
    the Secretary, of the coal subject to the lease. Prior to his
    determination of the fair market value of the coal subject to the
    lease, the Secretary shall give opportunity for and consideration
    to public comments on the fair market value. Nothing in this
    section shall be construed to require the Secretary to make public
    his judgment as to the fair market value of the coal to be leased,
    or the comments he receives thereon prior to the issuance of the
    lease. He is authorized, in awarding leases for coal lands improved
    and occupied or claimed in good faith, prior to February 25, 1920,
    to consider and recognize equitable rights of such occupants or
    claimants.
      (2)(A) The Secretary shall not issue a lease or leases under the
    terms of this chapter to any person, association, corporation, or
    any subsidiary, affiliate, or persons controlled by or under common
    control with such person, association, or corporation, where any
    such entity holds a lease or leases issued by the United States to
    coal deposits and has held such lease or leases for a period of ten
    years when such entity is not, except as provided for in section
    207(b) of this title, producing coal from the lease deposits in
    commercial quantities. In computing the ten-year period referred to
    in the preceding sentence, periods of time prior to August 4, 1976,
    shall not be counted.
      (B) Any lease proposal which permits surface coal mining within
    the boundaries of a National Forest which the Secretary proposes to
    issue under this chapter shall be submitted to the Governor of each
    State within which the coal deposits subject to such lease are
    located. No such lease may be issued under this chapter before the
    expiration of the sixty-day period beginning on the date of such
    submission. If any Governor to whom a proposed lease was submitted
    under this subparagraph objects to the issuance of such lease, such
    lease shall not be issued before the expiration of the six-month
    period beginning on the date the Secretary is notified by the
    Governor of such objection. During such six-month period, the
    Governor may submit to the Secretary a statement of reasons why
    such lease should not be issued and the Secretary shall, on the
    basis of such statement, reconsider the issuance of such lease.
      (3)(A)(i) No lease sale shall be held unless the lands containing
    the coal deposits have been included in a comprehensive land-use
    plan and such sale is compatible with such plan. The Secretary of
    the Interior shall prepare such land-use plans on lands under his
    responsibility where such plans have not been previously prepared.
    The Secretary of the Interior shall inform the Secretary of
    Agriculture of substantial development interest in coal leasing on
    lands within the National Forest System. Upon receipt of such
    notification from the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of
    Agriculture shall prepare a comprehensive land-use plan for such
    areas where such plans have not been previously prepared. The plan
    of the Secretary of Agriculture shall take into consideration the
    proposed coal development in these lands: Provided, That where the
    Secretary of the Interior finds that because of non-Federal
    interest in the surface or because the coal resources are
    insufficient to justify the preparation costs of a Federal
    comprehensive land-use plan, the lease sale can be held if the
    lands containing the coal deposits have been included in either a
    comprehensive land-use plan prepared by the State within which the
    lands are located or a land use analysis prepared by the Secretary
    of the Interior.
      (ii) In preparing such land-use plans, the Secretary of the
    Interior or, in the case of lands within the National Forest
    System, the Secretary of Agriculture, or in the case of a finding
    by the Secretary of the Interior that because of non-Federal
    interests in the surface or insufficient Federal coal, no Federal
    comprehensive land-use plans can be appropriately prepared, the
    responsible State entity shall consult with appropriate State
    agencies and local governments and the general public and shall
    provide an opportunity for public hearing on proposed plans prior
    to their adoption, if requested by any person having an interest
    which is, or may be, adversely affected by the adoption of such
    plans.
      (iii) Leases covering lands the surface of which is under the
    jurisdiction of any Federal agency other than the Department of the
    Interior may be issued only upon consent of the other Federal
    agency and upon such conditions as it may prescribe with respect to
    the use and protection of the nonmineral interests in those lands.
      (B) Each land-use plan prepared by the Secretary (or in the case
    of lands within the National Forest System, the Secretary of
    Agriculture pursuant to subparagraph (A)(i)) shall include an
    assessment of the amount of coal deposits in such land, identifying
    the amount of such coal which is recoverable by deep mining
    operations and the amount of such coal which is recoverable by
    surface mining operations.
      (C) Prior to issuance of any coal lease, the Secretary shall
    consider effects which mining of the proposed lease might have on
    an impacted community or area, including, but not limited to,
    impacts on the environment, on agricultural and other economic
    activities, and on public services. Prior to issuance of a lease,
    the Secretary shall evaluate and compare the effects of recovering
    coal by deep mining, by surface mining, and by any other method to
    determine which method or methods or sequence of methods achieves
    the maximum economic recovery of the coal within the proposed
    leasing tract. This evaluation and comparison by the Secretary
    shall be in writing but shall not prohibit the issuance of a lease;
    however, no mining operating plan shall be approved which is not
    found to achieve the maximum economic recovery of the coal within
    the tract. Public hearings in the area shall be held by the
    Secretary prior to the lease sale.
      (D) No lease sale shall be held until after the notice of the
    proposed offering for lease has been given once a week for three
    consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the
    county in which the lands are situated in accordance with
    regulations prescribed by the Secretary.
      (E) Each coal lease shall contain provisions requiring compliance
    with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1151-1175)
    [33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.] and the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7401 et
    seq.].
      (4)(A) The Secretary shall not require a surety bond or any other
    financial assurance to guarantee payment of deferred bonus bid
    installments with respect to any coal lease issued on a cash bonus
    bid to a lessee or successor in interest having a history of a
    timely payment of noncontested coal royalties and advanced coal
    royalties in lieu of production (where applicable) and bonus bid
    installment payments.
      (B) The Secretary may waive any requirement that a lessee provide
    a surety bond or other financial assurance to guarantee payment of
    deferred bonus bid installment with respect to any coal lease
    issued before August 8, 2005, only if the Secretary determines that
    the lessee has a history of making timely payments referred to in
    subparagraph (A).
      (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the lessee
    under a coal lease fails to pay any installment of a deferred cash
    bonus bid within 10 days after the Secretary provides written
    notice that payment of the installment is past due - 
        (A) the lease shall automatically terminate; and
        (B) any bonus payments already made to the United States with
      respect to the lease shall not be returned to the lessee or
      credited in any future lease sale.
    (b) Exploration
      (1) The Secretary may, under such regulations as he may
    prescribe, issue to any person an exploration license. No person
    may conduct coal exploration for commercial purposes for any coal
    on lands subject to this chapter without such an exploration
    license. Each exploration license shall be for a term of not more
    than two years and shall be subject to a reasonable fee. An
    exploration license shall confer no right to a lease under this
    chapter. The issuance of exploration licenses shall not preclude
    the Secretary from issuing coal leases at such times and locations
    and to such persons as he deems appropriate. No exploration license
    will be issued for any land on which a coal lease has been issued.
    A separate exploration license will be required for exploration in
    each State. An application for an exploration license shall
    identify general areas and probable methods of exploration. Each
    exploration license shall contain such reasonable conditions as the
    Secretary may require, including conditions to insure the
    protection of the environment, and shall be subject to all
    applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations. Upon
    violation of any such conditions or laws the Secretary may revoke
    the exploration license.
      (2) A licensee may not cause substantial disturbance to the
    natural land surface. He may not remove any coal for sale but may
    remove a reasonable amount of coal from the lands subject to this
    chapter included under his license for analysis and study. A
    licensee must comply with all applicable rules and regulations of
    the Federal agency having jurisdiction over the surface of the
    lands subject to this chapter. Exploration licenses covering lands
    the surface of which is under the jurisdiction of any Federal
    agency other than the Department of the Interior may be issued only
    upon such conditions as it may prescribe with respect to the use
    and protection of the nonmineral interests in those lands.
      (3) The licensee shall furnish to the Secretary copies of all
    data (including, but not limited to, geological, geophyscal,(!1)
    and core drilling analyses) obtained during such exploration. The
    Secretary shall maintain the confidentiality of all data so
    obtained until after the areas involved have been leased or until
    such time as he determines that making the data available to the
    public would not damage the competitive position of the licensee,
    whichever comes first.

      (4) Any person who willfully conducts coal exploration for
    commercial purposes on lands subject to this chapter without an
    exploration license issued hereunder shall be subject to a fine of
    not more than $1,000 for each day of violation. All data collected
    by said person on any Federal lands as a result of such violation
    shall be made immediately available to the Secretary, who shall
    make the data available to the public as soon as it is practicable.
    No penalty under this subsection shall be assessed unless such
    person is given notice and opportunity for a hearing with respect
    to such violation.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 202a. Consolidation of coal leases into logical mining unit

-STATUTE-
    (1) Approval by Secretary; public hearing; definition
      The Secretary, upon determining that maximum economic recovery of
    the coal deposit or deposits is served thereby, may approve the
    consolidation of coal leases into a logical mining unit. Such
    consolidation may only take place after a public hearing, if
    requested by any person whose interest is or may be adversely
    affected. A logical mining unit is an area of land in which the
    coal resources can be developed in an efficient, economical, and
    orderly manner as a unit with due regard to conservation of coal
    reserves and other resources. A logical mining unit may consist of
    one or more Federal leaseholds, and may include intervening or
    adjacent lands in which the United States does not own the coal
    resources, but all the lands in a logical mining unit must be under
    the effective control of a single operator, be able to be developed
    and operated as a single operation and be contiguous.
    (2) Mining plan; requirements
      (A) After the Secretary has approved the establishment of a
    logical mining unit, any mining plan approved for that unit must
    require such diligent development, operation, and production that
    the reserves of the entire unit will be mined within a period
    established by the Secretary which shall not be more than forty
    years.
      (B) The Secretary may establish a period of more than 40 years if
    the Secretary determines that the longer period - 
        (i) will ensure the maximum economic recovery of a coal
      deposit; or
        (ii) the longer period is in the interest of the orderly,
      efficient, or economic development of a coal resource.
    (3) Conditions for approval
      In approving a logical mining unit, the Secretary may provide,
    among other things, that (i) diligent development, continuous
    operation, and production on any Federal lease or non-Federal land
    in the logical mining unit shall be construed as occurring on all
    Federal leases in that logical mining unit, and (ii) the rentals
    and royalties for all Federal leases in a logical mining unit may
    be combined, and advanced royalties paid for any lease within a
    logical mining unit may be credited against such combined
    royalties.
    (4) Amendment to lease
      The Secretary may amend the provisions of any lease included in a
    logical mining unit so that mining under that lease will be
    consistent with the requirements imposed on that logical mining
    unit.
    (5) Leases issued before date of enactment of this Act
      Leases issued before the date of enactment of this Act may be
    included with the consent of all lessees in such logical mining
    unit, and, if so included, shall be subject to the provisions of
    this section.
    (6) Lessee required to form unit
      By regulation the Secretary may require a lessee under this
    chapter to form a logical mining unit, and may provide for
    determination of participating acreage within a unit.
    (7) Required acreage
      No logical mining unit shall be approved by the Secretary if the
    total acreage (both Federal and non-Federal) of the unit would
    exceed twenty-five thousand acres.
    (8) Acreage limitations for coal leases not waived
      Nothing in this section shall be construed to waive the acreage
    limitations for coal leases contained in section 184(a) of this
    title.

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      (1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), on a finding by the
    Secretary under paragraph (2), any person, association, or
    corporation holding a lease of coal lands or coal deposits under
    the provisions of this chapter may with the approval of the
    Secretary of the Interior,(!1) secure modifications of the original
    coal lease by including additional coal lands or coal deposits
    contiguous or cornering to those embraced in the lease.

      (2) A finding referred to in paragraph (1) is a finding by the
    Secretary that the modifications - 
        (A) would be in the interest of the United States;
        (B) would not displace a competitive interest in the lands; and
        (C) would not include lands or deposits that can be developed
      as part of another potential or existing operation.

      (3) In no case shall the total area added by modifications to an
    existing coal lease under paragraph (1) - 
        (A) exceed 960 acres; or
        (B) add acreage larger than that in the original lease.
    (b) Terms and conditions
      The Secretary shall prescribe terms and conditions which shall be
    consistent with this chapter and applicable to all of the acreage
    in such modified lease except that nothing in this section shall
    require the Secretary to apply the production or mining plan
    requirements of sections 202a(2) and 207(c) of this title.
    (c) Royalties
      The minimum royalty provisions of section 207(a) of this title

    Sec. 207. Conditions of lease

-STATUTE-
    (a) Term of lease; annual rentals; royalties; readjustment of
      conditions
      A coal lease shall be for a term of twenty years and for so long
    thereafter as coal is produced annually in commercial quantities
    from that lease. Any lease which is not producing in commercial
    quantities at the end of ten years shall be terminated. The
    Secretary shall by regulation prescribe annual rentals on leases. A
    lease shall require payment of a royalty in such amount as the
    Secretary shall determine of not less than 12 1/2  per centum of
    the value of coal as defined by regulation, except the Secretary
    may determine a lesser amount in the case of coal recovered by
    underground mining operations. The lease shall include such other
    terms and conditions as the Secretary shall determine. Such rentals
    and royalties and other terms and conditions of the lease will be
    subject to readjustment at the end of its primary term of twenty
    years and at the end of each ten-year period thereafter if the
    lease is extended.
    (b) Diligent development and continued operation; suspension of
      condition on payment of advance royalties
      (1) Each lease shall be subject to the conditions of diligent
    development and continued operation of the mine or mines, except
    where operations under the lease are interrupted by strikes, the
    elements, or casualties not attributable to the lessee.
      (2) The Secretary of the Interior, upon determining that the
    public interest will be served thereby, may suspend the condition
    of continued operation upon the payment of advance royalties.
      (3) Advance royalties described in paragraph (2) shall be no less
    than the production royalty which would otherwise be paid and shall
    be computed on a fixed reserve to production ratio (determined by
    the Secretary).
      (4) Advance royalties described in paragraph (2) shall be
    computed - 
        (A) based on - 
          (i) the average price in the spot market for sales of
        comparable coal from the same region during the last month of
        each applicable continued operation year; or
          (ii) in the absence of a spot market for comparable coal from
        the same region, by using a comparable method established by
        the Secretary of the Interior to capture the commercial value
        of coal; and

        (B) based on commercial quantities, as defined by regulation by
      the Secretary of the Interior.

      (5) The aggregate number of years during the period of any lease
    for which advance royalties may be accepted in lieu of the
    condition of continued operation shall not exceed 20 years.
      (6) (!1) The amount of any production royalty paid for any year
    shall be reduced (but not below 0) by the amount of any advance
    royalties paid under a lease described in paragraph (5) to the
    extent that the advance royalties have not been used to reduce
    production royalties for a prior year.

      (6) (!1) The Secretary may, upon six months' notification to the
    lessee cease to accept advance royalties in lieu of the requirement
    of continued operation.
      (7) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect the
    requirement contained in the second sentence of subsection (a) of
    this section relating to commencement of production at the end of
    ten years.
    (c) Operation and reclamation plan
      Prior to taking any action on a leasehold which might cause a
    significant disturbance of the environment, the lessee shall submit
    for the Secretary's approval an operation and reclamation plan. The
    Secretary shall approve or disapprove the plan or require that it
    be modified. Where the land involved is under the surface
    jurisdiction of another Federal agency, that other agency must
    consent to the terms of such approval.

-STATUTE-
      In order to provide for the supply of strictly local domestic
    needs for fuel, the Secretary of the Interior may, under such rules
    and regulations as he may prescribe in advance, issue limited
    licenses or permits to individuals or associations of individuals
    to prospect for, mine, and take for their use but not for sale,
    coal from the public lands without payment of royalty for the coal
    mined or the land occupied, on such conditions not inconsistent
    with this chapter as in his opinion will safeguard the public
    interests. This privilege shall not extend to any corporations. In
    the case of municipal corporations the Secretary of the Interior
    may issue such limited license or permit, for not to exceed three
    hundred and twenty acres for a municipality of less than one
    hundred thousand population, and not to exceed one thousand two
    hundred and eighty acres for a municipality of not less than one
    hundred thousand and not more than one hundred and fifty thousand
    population; and not to exceed two thousand five hundred and sixty
    acres for a municipality of one hundred and fifty thousand
    population or more, the land to be selected within the State
    wherein the municipal applicant may be located, upon condition that
    such municipal corporations will mine the coal therein under proper
    conditions and dispose of the same without profit to residents of
    such municipality for household use: Provided, That the acquisition
    or holding of a lease under sections 181, 201, and 202 to 207 of
    this title shall be no bar to the holding of such tract or
    operation of such mine under said limited license.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authorization; purpose
      The Secretary is authorized and directed to conduct a
    comprehensive exploratory program designed to obtain sufficient
    data and information to evaluate the extent, location, and
    potential for developing the known recoverable coal resources
    within the coal lands subject to this chapter. This program shall
    be designed to obtain the resource information necessary for
    determining whether commercial quantities of coal are present and
    the geographical extent of the coal fields and for estimating the
    amount of such coal which is recoverable by deep mining operations
    and the amount of such coal which is recoverable by surface mining
    operations in order to provide a basis for - 
        (1) developing a comprehensive land use plan pursuant to
      section 2;
        (2) improving the information regarding the value of public
      resources and revenues which should be expected from leasing;
        (3) increasing competition among producers of coal, or products
      derived from the conversion of coal, by providing data and
      information to all potential bidders equally and equitably;
        (4) providing the public with information on the nature of the
      coal deposits and the associated stratum and the value of the
      public resources being offered for sale; and
        (5) providing the basis for the assessment of the amount of
      coal deposits in those lands subject to this chapter under
      subparagraph (B) of section 201(a)(3) of this title.
    (b) Seismic, geophysical, geochemical or stratigraphic drilling
      The Secretary, through the United States Geological Survey, is

    means all data, information, maps, interpretations, and surveys
    which are obtained directly by the Department of the Interior or
    under a service contract pursuant to subsection (b) of this
    section. The Secretary shall maintain a confidentiality of all
    proprietary data or information purchased from commercial sources
    while not under contract with the United States Government until
    after the areas involved have been leased.
    (e) Information or data from Federal departments or agencies;
      confidentiality of proprietary information or data; utilization
      of Federal departments and agencies by agreement
      All Federal departments or agencies are authorized and directed
    to provide the Secretary with any information or data that may be
    deemed necessary to assist the Secretary in implementing the
    exploratory program pursuant to this section. Proprietary
    information or data provided to the Secretary under the provisions
    of this subsection shall remain confidential for such period of
    time as agreed to by the head of the department or agency from whom
    the information is requested. In addition, the Secretary is
    authorized and directed to utilize the existing capabilities and
    resources of other Federal departments and agencies by appropriate
    agreement.
    (f) Publication of geological and geophysical maps and reports of
      lands offered for lease
      The Secretary is directed to prepare, publish, and keep current a
    series of detailed geological, and geophysical maps of, and reports
    concerning, all coal lands to be offered for leasing under this
    chapter, based on data and information compiled pursuant to this
    section. Such maps and reports shall be prepared and revised at
    reasonable intervals beginning eighteen months after the date of
    enactment of this Act. Such maps and reports shall be made
    available on a continuing basis to any person on request.
    (g) Implementation plan for coal lands exploration program;
      development and transmittal to Congress; contents
      Within six months after the date of enactment of this Act, the
    Secretary shall develop and transmit to Congress an implementation
    plan for the coal lands exploration program authorized by this
    section, including procedures for making the data and information
    available to the public pursuant to subsection (d) of this section,
    and maps and reports pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.
    The implementation plan shall include a projected schedule of
    exploratory activities and identification of the regions and areas
    which will be explored under the coal lands exploration program
    during the first five years following the enactment of this
    section. In addition, the implementation plan shall include
    estimates of the appropriations and staffing required to implement
    the coal lands exploration program.
    (h) Stratigraphic drilling; scope; statement of results
      The stratigraphic drilling authorized in subsection (b) of this
    section shall be carried out in such a manner as to obtain
    information pertaining to all recoverable reserves. For the purpose
    of complying with subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary
    shall require all those authorized to conduct stratigraphic
    drilling pursuant to subsection (b) of this section to supply a
    statement of the results of test boring of core sampling including

    Sec. 209. Suspension, waiver, or reduction of rents or royalties to
      promote development or operation; extension of lease on
      suspension of operations and production

-STATUTE-
      The Secretary of the Interior, for the purpose of encouraging the
    greatest ultimate recovery of coal, oil, gas, oil shale, gilsonite
    (including all vein-type solid hydrocarbons), phosphate, sodium,
    potassium and sulfur, and in the interest of conservation of
    natural resources, is authorized to waive, suspend, or reduce the
    rental, or minimum royalty, or reduce the royalty on an entire
    leasehold, or on any tract or portion thereof segregated for
    royalty purposes, whenever in his judgment it is necessary to do so
    in order to promote development, or whenever in his judgment the
    leases cannot be successfully operated under the terms provided
    therein.(!1) Provided, however, That in order to promote
    development and the maximum production of tar sand, at the request
    of the lessee, the Secretary shall review, prior to commencement of
    commercial operations, the royalty rates established in each
    combined hydrocarbon lease issued in special tar sand areas. For
    purposes of this section, the term "tar sand" means any
    consolidated or unconsolidated rock (other than coal, oil shale, or
    gilsonite) that either: (1) contains a hydrocarbonaceous material
    with a gas-free viscosity, at original reservoir temperature,
    greater than 10,000 centipoise, or (2) contains a hydrocarbonaceous
    material and is produced by mining or quarrying. In the event the
    Secretary of the Interior, in the interest of conservation, shall
    direct or shall assent to the suspension of operations and
    production under any lease granted under the terms of this chapter,
    any payment of acreage rental or of minimum royalty prescribed by
    such lease likewise shall be suspended during such period of
    suspension of operations and production; and the term of such lease
    shall be extended by adding any such suspension period thereto. The
    provisions of this section shall apply to all oil and gas leases
    issued under this chapter, including those within an approved or
    prescribed plan for unit or cooperative development and operation.
    Nothing in this section shall be construed as granting to the
    Secretary the authority to waive, suspend, or reduce advance
    royalties.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authorization to lease land; terms and conditions; acreage
      The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to lease to any
    applicant qualified under this chapter, through advertisement,
    competitive bidding, or such other methods as he may by general
    regulations adopt, any phosphate deposits of the United States, and
    lands containing such deposits, including associated and related
    minerals, when in his judgment the public interest will be best
    served thereby. The lands shall be leased under such terms and
    conditions as are herein specified, in units reasonably compact in
    form of not to exceed two thousand five hundred and sixty acres.
    (b) Prospecting permits; issuance; term; acreage; entitlement to
      lease
      Where prospecting or exploratory work is necessary to determine
    the existence or workability of phosphate deposits in any
    unclaimed, undeveloped area, the Secretary of the Interior is
    authorized to issue, to any applicant qualified under this chapter,
    a prospecting permit which shall give the exclusive right to
    prospect for phosphate deposits, including associated minerals, for
    a period of two years, for not more than two thousand five hundred
    and sixty acres; and if prior to the expiration of the permit the
    permittee shows to the Secretary that valuable deposits of
    phosphate have been discovered within the area covered by his
    permit, the permittee shall be entitled to a lease for any or all
    of the land embraced in the prospecting permit.
    (c) Extension of term of permit
      Any phosphate permit issued under this section may be extended by
    the Secretary for such an additional period, not in excess of four
    years, as he deems advisable, if he finds that the permittee has
    been unable, with reasonable diligence, to determine the existence
    or workability of phosphate deposits in the area covered by the
    permit and desires to prosecute further prospecting or exploration,
    or for other reasons warranting such an extension in the opinion of
    the Secretary.

-STATUTE-
      Each lease shall describe the leased lands by the legal
    subdivisions of the public-land surveys. All leases shall be
    conditioned upon the payment to the United States of such royalties
    as may be specified in the lease, which shall be fixed by the
    Secretary of the Interior in advance of offering the same, at not
    less than 5 per centum of the gross value of the output of
    phosphates or phosphate rock and associated or related minerals.
    Royalties shall be due and payable as specified in the lease either
    monthly or quarterly on the last day of the month next following
    the month or quarter in which the minerals are sold or removed from
    the leased land. Each lease shall provide for the payment of a
    rental payable at the date of the lease and annually thereafter
    which shall be not less than 25 cents per acre for the first year,
    50 cents per acre for the second and third years, respectively, and
    $1 per acre for each year thereafter, during the continuance of the
    lease. The rental paid for any year shall be credited against the
    royalties for that year. Leases shall be for a term of twenty years
    and so long thereafter as the lessee complies with the terms and
    conditions of the lease and upon the further condition that at the
    end of each twenty-year period succeeding the date of the lease
    such reasonable readjustment of the terms and conditions thereof
    may be made therein as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the
    Interior unless otherwise provided by law at the expiration of such
    periods. Leases shall be conditioned upon a minimum annual
    production or the payment of a minimum royalty in lieu thereof,
    except when production is interrupted by strikes, the elements, or
    casualties not attributable to the lessee. The Secretary of the
    Interior may permit suspension of operations under any such leases
    when marketing conditions are such that the leases cannot be
    operated except at a loss.

      Upon establishing to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the
    Interior that valuable deposits of oil or gas have been discovered
    within the limits of the land embraced in any permit, the permittee
    shall be entitled to a lease for one-fourth of the land embraced in
    the prospecting permit: Provided, That the permittee shall be
    granted a lease for as much as one hundred and sixty acres of said
    lands, if there be that number of acres within the permit. The area
    to be selected by the permittee, shall be in reasonably compact
    form and, if surveyed, to be described by the legal subdivisions of
    the public-land surveys; if unsurveyed, to be surveyed by the
    Government at the expense of the applicant for lease in accordance
    with rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of the
    Interior, and the lands leased shall be conformed to and taken in
    accordance with the legal subdivisions of such surveys; deposits
    made to cover expense of surveys shall be deemed appropriated for
    that purpose, and any excess deposits may be repaid to the person
    or persons making such deposit or their legal representatives. Such
    leases shall be for a term of twenty years upon a royalty of 5 per
    centum in amount or value of the production and the annual payment
    in advance of a rental of $1 per acre, the rental paid for any one
    year to be credited against the royalties as they accrue for that

    a lease for the remainder of the land in his prospecting permit at
    a royalty of not less than 12 1/2  per centum in amount or value of
    the production nor more than the royalty rate prescribed by
    regulation in force on January 1, 1935, for secondary leases issued
    under this section, and under such other conditions as are fixed
    for oil or gas leases issued under section 226 of this title the
    royalty to be determined by competitive bidding or fixed by such
    other method as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe:
    Provided further, That the Secretary shall have the right to reject
    any or all bids.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 226. Lease of oil and gas lands

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authority of Secretary
      All lands subject to disposition under this chapter which are
    known or believed to contain oil or gas deposits may be leased by
    the Secretary.
    (b) Lands within known geologic structure of a producing oil or gas
      field; lands within special tar sand areas; competitive bidding;
      royalties
      (1)(A) All lands to be leased which are not subject to leasing
    under paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection shall be leased as
    provided in this paragraph to the highest responsible qualified
    bidder by competitive bidding under general regulations in units of
    not more than 2,560 acres, except in Alaska, where units shall be
    not more than 5,760 acres. Such units shall be as nearly compact as
    possible. Lease sales shall be conducted by oral bidding. Lease
    sales shall be held for each State where eligible lands are
    available at least quarterly and more frequently if the Secretary
    of the Interior determines such sales are necessary. A lease shall
    be conditioned upon the payment of a royalty at a rate of not less
    than 12.5 percent in amount or value of the production removed or
    sold from the lease. The Secretary shall accept the highest bid
    from a responsible qualified bidder which is equal to or greater
    than the national minimum acceptable bid, without evaluation of the
    value of the lands proposed for lease. Leases shall be issued
    within 60 days following payment by the successful bidder of the
    remainder of the bonus bid, if any, and the annual rental for the
    first lease year. All bids for less than the national minimum
    acceptable bid shall be rejected. Lands for which no bids are
    received or for which the highest bid is less than the national
    minimum acceptable bid shall be offered promptly within 30 days for
    leasing under subsection (c) of this section and shall remain
    available for leasing for a period of 2 years after the competitive
    lease sale.
      (B) The national minimum acceptable bid shall be $2 per acre for
    a period of 2 years from December 22, 1987. Thereafter, the
    Secretary, subject to paragraph (2)(B), may establish by regulation
    a higher national minimum acceptable bid for all leases based upon
    a finding that such action is necessary: (i) to enhance financial
    returns to the United States; and (ii) to promote more efficient
    management of oil and gas resources on Federal lands. Ninety days
    before the Secretary makes any change in the national minimum
    acceptable bid, the Secretary shall notify the Committee on Natural
    Resources of the United States House of Representatives and the
    Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States
    Senate. The proposal or promulgation of any regulation to establish
    a national minimum acceptable bid shall not be considered a major
    Federal action subject to the requirements of section 4332(2)(C) of
    title 42.
      (2)(A)(i) If the lands to be leased are within a special tar sand
    area, they shall be leased to the highest responsible qualified
    bidder by competitive bidding under general regulations in units of
    not more than 5,760 acres, which shall be as nearly compact as
    possible, upon the payment by the lessee of such bonus as may be
    accepted by the Secretary.
      (ii) Royalty shall be 12(!1/2) per centum in amount or value of
    production removed or sold from the lease, subject to subsection
    (k)(1)(c) (!1) of this section.

      (iii) The Secretary may lease such additional lands in special
    tar sand areas as may be required in support of any operations
    necessary for the recovery of tar sands.
      (iv) No lease issued under this paragraph shall be included in
    any chargeability limitation associated with oil and gas leases.
      (B) For any area that contains any combination of tar sand and
    oil or gas (or both), the Secretary may issue under this chapter,
    separately - 
        (i) a lease for exploration for and extraction of tar sand; and
        (ii) a lease for exploration for and development of oil and
      gas.

      (C) A lease issued for tar sand shall be issued using the same
    bidding process, annual rental, and posting period as a lease
    issued for oil and gas, except that the minimum acceptable bid
    required for a lease issued for tar sand shall be $2 per acre.
      (D) The Secretary may waive, suspend, or alter any requirement
    under section 183 of this title that a permittee under a permit
    authorizing prospecting for tar sand must exercise due diligence,
    to promote any resource covered by a combined hydrocarbon lease.
      (3)(A) If the United States held a vested future interest in a
    mineral estate that, immediately prior to becoming a vested present
    interest, was subject to a lease under which oil or gas was being
    produced, or had a well capable of producing, in paying quantities
    at an annual average production volume per well per day of either
    not more than 15 barrels per day of oil or condensate, or not more
    than 60,000 cubic feet of gas, the holder of the lease may elect to
    continue the lease as a noncompetitive lease under subsection
    (c)(1) of this section.
      (B) An election under this paragraph is effective - 
        (i) in the case of an interest which vested after January 1,
      1990, and on or before October 24, 1992, if the election is made
      before the date that is 1 year after October 24, 1992;
        (ii) in the case of an interest which vests within 1 year after
      October 24, 1992, if the election is made before the date that is
      2 years after October 24, 1992; and
        (iii) in any case other than those described in clause (i) or
      (ii), if the election is made prior to the interest becoming a
      vested present interest.

      (C) Notwithstanding the consent requirement referenced in section
    352 of this title, the Secretary shall issue a noncompetitive lease
    under subsection (c)(1) of this section to a holder who makes an
    election under subparagraph (A) and who is qualified to hold a
    lease under this chapter. Such lease shall be subject to all terms
    and conditions under this chapter that are applicable to leases
    issued under subsection (c)(1) of this section.
      (D) A lease issued pursuant to this paragraph shall continue so
    long as oil or gas continues to be produced in paying quantities.
      (E) This paragraph shall apply only to those lands under the
    administration of the Secretary of Agriculture where the United
    States acquired an interest in such lands pursuant to the Act of
    March 1, 1911 (36 Stat. 961 and following).
    (c) Lands subject to leasing under subsection (b); first qualified
      applicant
      (1) If the lands to be leased are not leased under subsection
    (b)(1) of this section or are not subject to competitive leasing
    under subsection (b)(2) of this section, the person first making
    application for the lease who is qualified to hold a lease under
    this chapter shall be entitled to a lease of such lands without
    competitive bidding, upon payment of a non-refundable application
    fee of at least $75. A lease under this subsection shall be
    conditioned upon the payment of a royalty at a rate of 12.5 percent
    in amount or value of the production removed or sold from the
    lease. Leases shall be issued within 60 days of the date on which
    the Secretary identifies the first responsible qualified applicant.
      (2)(A) Lands (i) which were posted for sale under subsection
    (b)(1) of this section but for which no bids were received or for
    which the highest bid was less than the national minimum acceptable
    bid and (ii) for which, at the end of the period referred to in
    subsection (b)(1) of this section no lease has been issued and no
    lease application is pending under paragraph (1) of this
    subsection, shall again be available for leasing only in accordance
    with subsection (b)(1) of this section.
      (B) The land in any lease which is issued under paragraph (1) of
    this subsection or under subsection (b)(1) of this section which
    lease terminates, expires, is cancelled or is relinquished shall
    again be available for leasing only in accordance with subsection
    (b)(1) of this section.
    (d) Annual rentals
      All leases issued under this section, as amended by the Federal
    Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing Reform Act of 1987, shall be
    conditioned upon payment by the lessee of a rental of not less than
    $1.50 per acre per year for the first through fifth years of the
    lease and not less than $2 per acre per year for each year
    thereafter. A minimum royalty in lieu of rental of not less than
    the rental which otherwise would be required for that lease year
    shall be payable at the expiration of each lease year beginning on
    or after a discovery of oil or gas in paying quantities on the
    lands leased.
    (e) Primary terms
      Competitive and noncompetitive leases issued under this section
    shall be for a primary term of 10 years: Provided, however, That
    competitive leases issued in special tar sand areas shall also be
    for a primary term of ten years. Each such lease shall continue so
    long after its primary term as oil or gas is produced in paying
    quantities. Any lease issued under this section for land on which,
    or for which under an approved cooperative or unit plan of
    development or operation, actual drilling operations were commenced
    prior to the end of its primary term and are being diligently
    prosecuted at that time shall be extended for two years and so long
    thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities.
    (f) Notice of proposed action; posting of notice; terms and maps
      At least 45 days before offering lands for lease under this
    section, and at least 30 days before approving applications for
    permits to drill under the provisions of a lease or substantially
    modifying the terms of any lease issued under this section, the
    Secretary shall provide notice of the proposed action. Such notice
    shall be posted in the appropriate local office of the leasing and
    land management agencies. Such notice shall include the terms or
    modified lease terms and maps or a narrative description of the
    affected lands. Where the inclusion of maps in such notice is not
    practicable, maps of the affected lands shall be made available to
    the public for review. Such maps shall show the location of all
    tracts to be leased, and of all leases already issued in the
    general area. The requirements of this subsection are in addition
    to any public notice required by other law.
    (g) Regulation of surface-disturbing activities; approval of plan
      of operations; bond or surety; failure to comply with reclamation
      requirements as barring lease; opportunity to comply with
      requirements
      The Secretary of the Interior, or for National Forest lands, the
    Secretary of Agriculture, shall regulate all surface-disturbing
    activities conducted pursuant to any lease issued under this
    chapter, and shall determine reclamation and other actions as
    required in the interest of conservation of surface resources. No
    permit to drill on an oil and gas lease issued under this chapter
    may be granted without the analysis and approval by the Secretary
    concerned of a plan of operations covering proposed surface-
    disturbing activities within the lease area. The Secretary
    concerned shall, by rule or regulation, establish such standards as
    may be necessary to ensure that an adequate bond, surety, or other
    financial arrangement will be established prior to the commencement
    of surface-disturbing activities on any lease, to ensure the
    complete and timely reclamation of the lease tract, and the
    restoration of any lands or surface waters adversely affected by
    lease operations after the abandonment or cessation of oil and gas
    operations on the lease. The Secretary shall not issue a lease or
    leases or approve the assignment of any lease or leases under the
    terms of this section to any person, association, corporation, or
    any subsidiary, affiliate, or person controlled by or under common
    control with such person, association, or corporation, during any
    period in which, as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or
    Secretary of Agriculture, such entity has failed or refused to
    comply in any material respect with the reclamation requirements
    and other standards established under this section for any prior
    lease to which such requirements and standards applied. Prior to
    making such determination with respect to any such entity the
    concerned Secretary shall provide such entity with adequate
    notification and an opportunity to comply with such reclamation
    requirements and other standards and shall consider whether any
    administrative or judicial appeal is pending. Once the entity has
    complied with the reclamation requirement or other standard
    concerned an oil or gas lease may be issued to such entity under
    this chapter.
    (h) National Forest System Lands
      The Secretary of the Interior may not issue any lease on National
    Forest System Lands reserved from the public domain over the
    objection of the Secretary of Agriculture.
    (i) Termination
      No lease issued under this section which is subject to
    termination because of cessation of production shall be terminated
    for this cause so long as reworking or drilling operations which
    were commenced on the land prior to or within sixty days after
    cessation of production are conducted thereon with reasonable
    diligence, or so long as oil or gas is produced in paying
    quantities as a result of such operations. No lease issued under
    this section shall expire because operations or production is
    suspended under any order, or with the consent, of the Secretary.
    No lease issued under this section covering lands on which there is
    a well capable of producing oil or gas in paying quantities shall
    expire because the lessee fails to produce the same unless the
    lessee is allowed a reasonable time, which shall be not less than
    sixty days after notice by registered or certified mail, within
    which to place such well in producing status or unless, after such
    status is established, production is discontinued on the leased
    premises without permission granted by the Secretary under the
    provisions of this chapter.
    (j) Drainage agreements; primary term of lease, extension
      Whenever it appears to the Secretary that lands owned by the
    United States are being drained of oil or gas by wells drilled on
    adjacent lands, he may negotiate agreements whereby the United
    States, or the United States and its lessees, shall be compensated
    for such drainage. Such agreements shall be made with the consent
    of the lessees, if any, affected thereby. If such agreement is
    entered into, the primary term of any lease for which compensatory
    royalty is being paid, or any extension of such primary term, shall
    be extended for the period during which such compensatory royalty
    is paid and for a period of one year from discontinuance of such
    payment and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying
    quantities.
    (k) Mining claims; suspension of running time of lease
      If, during the primary term or any extended term of any lease
    issued under this section, a verified statement is filed by any
    mining claimant pursuant to subsection (c) of section 527 of this
    title, whether such filing occur prior to September 2, 1960 or
    thereafter, asserting the existence of a conflicting unpatented
    mining claim or claims upon which diligent work is being prosecuted
    as to any lands covered by the lease, the running of time under
    such lease shall be suspended as to the lands involved from the
    first day of the month following the filing of such verified
    statement until a final decision is rendered in the matter.
    (l) Exchange of leases; conditions
      The Secretary of the Interior shall, upon timely application
    therefor, issue a new lease in exchange for any lease issued for a
    term of twenty years, or any renewal thereof, or any lease issued
    prior to August 8, 1946, in exchange for a twenty-year lease, such
    new lease to be for a primary term of five years and so long
    thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities and at a
    royalty rate of not less than 12 1/2  per centum in amount or value
    of the production removed or sold from such leases, except that the
    royalty rate shall be 12 1/2  per centum in amount or value of the
    production removed or sold from said leases as to (1) such leases,
    or such parts of the lands subject thereto and the deposits
    underlying the same, as are not believed to be within the
    productive limits of any producing oil or gas deposit, as such
    productive limits are found by the Secretary to have existed on
    August 8, 1946; and (2) any production on a lease from an oil or
    gas deposit which was discovered after May 27, 1941, by a well or
    wells drilled within the boundaries of the lease, and which is
    determined by the Secretary to be a new deposit; and (3) any
    production on or allocated to a lease pursuant to an approved
    cooperative or unit plan of development or operation from an oil or
    gas deposit which was discovered after May 27, 1941, on land
    committed to such plan, and which is determined by the Secretary to
    be a new deposit, where such lease, or a lease for which it is
    exchanged, was included in such plan at the time of discovery or
    was included in a duly executed and filed application for the
    approval of such plan at the time of discovery.
    (m) Cooperative or unit plan; authority of Secretary of the
      Interior to alter or modify; communitization or drilling
      agreements; term of lease, conditions; Secretary to approve
      operating, drilling or development contracts, and subsurface
      storage
      For the purpose of more properly conserving the natural resources
    of any oil or gas pool, field, or like area, or any part thereof
    (whether or not any part of said oil or gas pool, field, or like
    area, is then subject to any cooperative or unit plan of
    development or operation), lessees thereof and their
    representatives may unite with each other, or jointly or separately
    with others, in collectively adopting and operating under a
    cooperative or unit plan of development or operation of such pool,
    field, or like area, or any part thereof, whenever determined and
    certified by the Secretary of the Interior to be necessary or
    advisable in the public interest. The Secretary is thereunto
    authorized, in his discretion, with the consent of the holders of
    leases involved, to establish, alter, change, or revoke drilling,
    producing, rental, minimum royalty, and royalty requirements of
    such leases and to make such regulations with reference to such
    leases, with like consent on the part of the lessees, in connection
    with the institution and operation of any such cooperative or unit
    plan as he may deem necessary or proper to secure the proper
    protection of the public interest. The Secretary may provide that
    oil and gas leases hereafter issued under this chapter shall
    contain a provision requiring the lessee to operate under such a
    reasonable cooperative or unit plan, and he may prescribe such a
    plan under which such lessee shall operate, which shall adequately
    protect the rights of all parties in interest, including the United
    States.
      Any plan authorized by the preceding paragraph which includes
    lands owned by the United States may, in the discretion of the
    Secretary, contain a provision whereby authority is vested in the
    Secretary of the Interior, or any such person, committee, or State
    or Federal officer or agency as may be designated in the plan, to
    alter or modify from time to time the rate of prospecting and
    development and the quantity and rate of production under such
    plan. All leases operated under any such plan approved or
    prescribed by the Secretary shall be excepted in determining
    holdings or control under the provisions of any section of this
    chapter.
      When separate tracts cannot be independently developed and
    operated in conformity with an established well-spacing or
    development program, any lease, or a portion thereof, may be pooled
    with other lands, whether or not owned by the United States, under
    a communitization or drilling agreement providing for an
    apportionment of production or royalties among the separate tracts
    of land comprising the drilling or spacing unit when determined by
    the Secretary of the Interior to be in the public interest, and
    operations or production pursuant to such an agreement shall be
    deemed to be operations or production as to each such lease
    committed thereto.
      Any lease issued for a term of twenty years, or any renewal
    thereof, or any portion of such lease that has become the subject
    of a cooperative or unit plan of development or operation of a
    pool, field, or like area, which plan has the approval of the
    Secretary of the Interior, shall continue in force until the
    termination of such plan. Any other lease issued under any section
    of this chapter which has heretofore or may hereafter be committed
    to any such plan that contains a general provision for allocation
    of oil or gas shall continue in force and effect as to the land
    committed so long as the lease remains subject to the plan:
    Provided, That production is had in paying quantities under the
    plan prior to the expiration date of the term of such lease. Any
    lease heretofore or hereafter committed to any such plan embracing
    lands that are in part within and in part outside of the area
    covered by any such plan shall be segregated into separate leases
    as to the lands committed and the lands not committed as of the
    effective date of unitization: Provided, however, That any such
    lease as to the nonunitized portion shall continue in force and
    effect for the term thereof but for not less than two years from
    the date of such segregation and so long thereafter as oil or gas
    is produced in paying quantities. The minimum royalty or discovery
    rental under any lease that has become subject to any cooperative
    or unit plan of development or operation, or other plan that
    contains a general provision for allocation of oil or gas, shall be
    payable only with respect to the lands subject to such lease to
    which oil or gas shall be allocated under such plan. Any lease
    which shall be eliminated from any such approved or prescribed
    plan, or from any communitization or drilling agreement authorized
    by this section, and any lease which shall be in effect at the
    termination of any such approved or prescribed plan, or at the
    termination of any such communitization or drilling agreement,
    unless relinquished, shall continue in effect for the original term
    thereof, but for not less than two years, and so long thereafter as
    oil or gas is produced in paying quantities.
      The Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized, on such
    conditions as he may prescribe, to approve operating, drilling, or
    development contracts made by one or more lessees of oil or gas
    leases, with one or more persons, associations, or corporations
    whenever, in his discretion, the conservation of natural products
    or the public convenience or necessity may require it or the
    interests of the United States may be best subserved thereby. All
    leases operated under such approved operating, drilling, or
    development contracts, and interests thereunder, shall be excepted
    in determining holdings or control under the provisions of this
    chapter.
      The Secretary of the Interior, to avoid waste or to promote
    conservation of natural resources, may authorize the subsurface
    storage of oil or gas, whether or not produced from federally owned
    lands, in lands leased or subject to lease under this chapter. Such
    authorization may provide for the payment of a storage fee or
    rental on such stored oil or gas or, in lieu of such fee or rental,
    for a royalty other than that prescribed in the lease when such
    stored oil or gas is produced in conjunction with oil or gas not
    previously produced. Any lease on which storage is so authorized
    shall be extended at least for the period of storage and so long
    thereafter as oil or gas not previously produced is produced in
    paying quantities.
    (n) Conversion of oil and gas leases and claims on hydrocarbon
      resources to combined hydrocarbon leases for primary term of 10
      years; application
      (1)(A) The owner of (1) an oil and gas lease issued prior to
    November 16, 1981, or (2) a valid claim to any hydrocarbon
    resources leasable under this section based on a mineral location
    made prior to January 21, 1926, and located within a special tar
    sand area shall be entitled to convert such lease or claim to a
    combined hydrocarbon lease for a primary term of ten years upon the
    filing of an application within two years from November 16, 1981,
    containing an acceptable plan of operations which assures
    reasonable protection of the environment and diligent development
    of those resources requiring enhanced recovery methods of
    development or mining. For purposes of conversion, no claim shall
    be deemed invalid solely because it was located as a placer
    location rather than a lode location or vice versa, notwithstanding
    any previous adjudication on that issue.
      (B) The Secretary shall issue final regulations to implement this
    section within six months of November 16, 1981. If any oil and gas
    lease eligible for conversion under this section would otherwise
    expire after November 16, 1981, and before six months following the
    issuance of implementing regulations, the lessee may preserve his
    conversion right under such lease for a period ending six months
    after the issuance of implementing regulations by filing with the
    Secretary, before the expiration of the lease, a notice of intent
    to file an application for conversion. Upon submission of a
    complete plan of operations in substantial compliance with the
    regulations promulgated by the Secretary for the filing of such
    plans, the Secretary shall suspend the running of the term of any
    oil and gas lease proposed for conversion until the plan is finally
    approved or disapproved. The Secretary shall act upon a proposed
    plan of operations within fifteen months of its submittal.
      (C) When an existing oil and gas lease is converted to a combined
    hydrocarbon lease, the royalty shall be that provided for in the
    original oil and gas lease and for a converted mining claim, 12 1/2
     per centum in amount or value of production removed or sold from
    the lease.
      (2) Except as provided in this section, nothing in the Combined
    Hydrocarbon Leasing Act of 1981 shall be construed to diminish or
    increase the rights of any lessee under any oil and gas lease
    issued prior to November 16, 1981.
    (o) Certain outstanding oil and gas deposits
      (1) Prior to the commencement of surface-disturbing activities
    relating to the development of oil and gas deposits on lands
    described under paragraph (5), the Secretary of Agriculture shall
    require, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Secretary, that
    such activities be subject to terms and conditions as provided
    under paragraph (2).
      (2) The terms and conditions referred to in paragraph (1) shall
    require that reasonable advance notice be furnished to the
    Secretary of Agriculture at least 60 days prior to the commencement
    of surface disturbing activities.
      (3) Advance notice under paragraph (2) shall include each of the
    following items of information:
        (A) A designated field representative.
        (B) A map showing the location and dimensions of all
      improvements, including but not limited to, well sites and road
      and pipeline accesses.
        (C) A plan of operations, of an interim character if necessary,
      setting forth a schedule for construction and drilling.
        (D) A plan of erosion and sedimentation control.
        (E) Proof of ownership of mineral title.

    Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect any
    authority of the State in which the lands concerned are located to
    impose any requirements with respect to such oil and gas
    operations.
      (4) The person proposing to develop oil and gas deposits on lands
    described under paragraph (5) shall either - 
        (A) permit the Secretary to market merchantable timber owned by
      the United States on lands subject to such activities; or
        (B) arrange to purchase merchantable timber on lands subject to
      such surface disturbing activities from the Secretary of
      Agriculture, or otherwise arrange for the disposition of such
      merchantable timber, upon such terms and upon such advance notice
      of the items referred to in subparagraphs (A) through (E) of
      paragraph (3) as the Secretary may accept.

      (5)(A) The lands referred to in this subsection are those lands
    referenced in subparagraph (B) which are under the administration
    of the Secretary of Agriculture where the United States acquired an
    interest in such lands pursuant to the Act of March 1, 1911 (36
    Stat. 961 and following), but does not have an interest in oil and
    gas deposits that may be present under such lands. This subsection
    does not apply to any such lands where, under the provisions of its
    acquisition of an interest in the lands, the United States is to
    acquire any oil and gas deposits that may be present under such
    lands in the future but such interest has not yet vested with the
    United States.
      (B) This subsection shall only apply in the Allegheny National
    Forest.
    (p) Deadlines for consideration of applications for permits
      (1) In general
        Not later than 10 days after the date on which the Secretary
      receives an application for any permit to drill, the Secretary
      shall - 
          (A) notify the applicant that the application is complete; or
          (B) notify the applicant that information is missing and
        specify any information that is required to be submitted for
        the application to be complete.
      (2) Issuance or deferral
        Not later than 30 days after the applicant for a permit has
      submitted a complete application, the Secretary shall - 
          (A) issue the permit, if the requirements under the National
        Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.] and
        other applicable law have been completed within such timeframe;
        or
          (B) defer the decision on the permit and provide to the
        applicant a notice - 
            (i) that specifies any steps that the applicant could take
          for the permit to be issued; and
            (ii) a list of actions that need to be taken by the agency
          to complete compliance with applicable law together with
          timelines and deadlines for completing such actions.
      (3) Requirements for deferred applications
        (A) In general
          If the Secretary provides notice under paragraph (2)(B), the
        applicant shall have a period of 2 years from the date of
        receipt of the notice in which to complete all requirements
        specified by the Secretary, including providing information
        needed for compliance with the National Environmental Policy
        Act of 1969.
        (B) Issuance of decision on permit
          If the applicant completes the requirements within the period
        specified in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall issue a
        decision on the permit not later than 10 days after the date of
        completion of the requirements described in subparagraph (A),
        unless compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of
        1969 and other applicable law has not been completed within
        such timeframe.
        (C) Denial of permit
          If the applicant does not complete the requirements within
        the period specified in subparagraph (A) or if the applicant
        does not comply with applicable law, the Secretary shall deny
        the permit.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Lands not withdrawn from leasing
      Upon the expiration of the initial five-year term of any
    noncompetitive oil or gas lease which was issued prior to September
    2, 1960, and which has been maintained in accordance with
    applicable statutory requirements and regulations, the record
    titleholder thereof shall be entitled to a single extension of the
    lease, unless then otherwise provided by law, for such lands
    covered by it as are not, on the expiration date of the lease,
    withdrawn from leasing. A withdrawal, however, shall not affect the
    right to an extension if actual drilling operations on such lands
    were commenced prior to the effective date of the withdrawal and
    were being diligently prosecuted on the expiration date of the
    lease. No withdrawal shall be effective within the meaning of this
    section until ninety days after notice thereof has been sent by
    registered or certified mail to each lessee to be affected by such
    withdrawal.
    (b) Known and unknown geologic structures of producing fields
      As to lands not within the known geologic structure of a
    producing oil or gas field, a noncompetitive oil or gas lease to
    which this section is applicable shall be extended for a period of
    five years and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in
    paying quantities. As to lands within the known geologic structure
    of a producing oil or gas field, a noncompetitive lease to which
    this section is applicable shall be extended for a period of two
    years and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying
    quantities.
    (c) Application requirement
      Any noncompetitive oil or gas lease extended under this section
    shall be subject to the rules and regulations in force at the
    expiration of the initial five-year term of the lease. No extension
    shall be granted, however, unless within a period of ninety days
    prior to the expiration date of the lease an application therefor
    is filed by the record titleholder or an assignee whose assignment
    has been filed for approval or an operator whose operating
    agreement has been filed for approval.
    (d) Commencement of actual drilling operations
      Any lease issued prior to September 2, 1960, which has been
    maintained in accordance with applicable statutory requirements and
    regulations and which pertains to land on which, or for which under
    an approved cooperative or unit plan of development or operation,
    actual drilling operations were commenced prior to the end of its
    primary term and are being diligently prosecuted at that time shall
    be extended for two years and so long thereafter as oil or gas is
    produced in paying quantities.

        (4) Lands within areas allocated for wilderness or further
      planning in Executive Communication 1504, Ninety-Sixth Congress
      (House Document numbered 96-119), unless such lands are allocated

      plan or have been released to uses other than wilderness by an
      act of Congress.
    (b) Exploration
      In the case of any area of National Forest or public lands
    subject to this section, nothing in this section shall affect any

    Lands reserved from the public domain, the Secretary of
    Agriculture) to issue permits for exploration for oil and gas,
    coal, oil shale, phosphate, potassium, sulphur, gilsonite or
    geothermal resources by means not requiring construction of roads
    or improvement of existing roads if such activity is conducted in a
    manner compatible with the preservation of the wilderness

-STATUTE-
      Any person who on October 1, 1919, was a bona fide occupant or
    claimant of oil or gas lands under a claim initiated while such
    lands were not withdrawn from oil or gas location and entry, and
    who had previously performed all acts under then existing laws
    necessary to valid locations thereof except to make discovery, and
    upon which discovery had not been made prior to February 25, 1920,
    and who has performed work or expended on or for the benefit of
    such locations an amount equal in the aggregate of $250 for each
    location if application therefor shall be made within six months
    from February 25, 1920, shall be entitled to prospecting permits
    thereon upon the same terms and conditions, and limitations as to
    acreage, as other permits provided for in this chapter, or where
    any such person has made such discovery, prior to said February 25,
    1920, he shall be entitled to a lease thereon under such terms as
    the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe unless otherwise
    provided for in section 227 (!1) of this title: Provided, That
    where such prospecting permit is granted upon land within any known
    geologic structure of a producing oil or gas field, the royalty to
    be fixed in any lease thereafter granted thereon or any portion
    thereof shall be not less than 12 1/2  per-centum of all the oil or
    gas produced except oil or gas used for production purposes on the
    claim, or unavoidably lost: Provided, however, That the provisions
    of this section shall not apply to lands reserved for the use of
    the Navy. No claimant for a permit or lease who has been guilty of
    any fraud or who had knowledge or reasonable grounds to know of any
    fraud, or who has not acted honestly and in good faith shall be
    entitled to any of the benefits of this section.

      All permits or leases hereunder shall inure to the benefit of the
    claimant and all persons claiming through or under him by lease,
    contract, or otherwise, as their interests may appear.

      In the case of lands bona fide entered as agricultural, and not
    withdrawn or classified as mineral at the time of entry, but not
    including lands claimed under any railroad grant, the entryman or
    patentee, or assigns, where assignment was made prior to January 1,

    reserved, shall be entitled to a preference right to a permit and
    to a lease, as herein provided, in case of discovery; and within an
    area not greater than a township such entryman and patentees, or
    assigns holding restricted patents may combine their holdings, not
    to exceed two thousand five hundred and sixty acres for the purpose
    of making joint application. Leases executed under this section and
    embracing only lands so entered shall provide for the payment of a
    royalty of not less than 12 1/2  per centum as to such areas within
    the permit as may not be included within the discovery lease to
    which the permittee is entitled under section 223 of this title.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Acquisition; condition in lease
      All prospecting permits and leases for oil or gas made or issued
    under the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to the
    condition that in case the permittee or lessee strikes water while
    drilling instead of oil or gas, the Secretary of the Interior may,
    when such water is of such quality and quantity as to be valuable
    and usable at a reasonable cost for agricultural, domestic, or
    other purposes, purchase the casing in the well at the reasonable
    value thereof to be fixed under rules and regulations to be
    prescribed by the Secretary.
    (b) Prior leases
      In cases where water wells producing such water have heretofore
    been or may hereafter be drilled upon lands embraced in any
    prospecting permit or lease heretofore issued under this chapter,
    the Secretary may in like manner purchase the casing in such wells.
    (c) Disposition
      The Secretary may make such purchase and may lease or operate
    such wells for the purpose of producing water and of using the same
    on the public lands or of disposing of such water for beneficial
    use on other lands, and where such wells have heretofore been
    plugged or abandoned or where such wells have been drilled prior to
    the issuance of any permit or lease by persons not in privity with
    the permittee or lessee, the Secretary may develop the same for the
    purposes of this section: Provided, That owners or occupants of
    lands adjacent to those upon which such water wells may be
    developed shall have a preference right to make beneficial use of
    such water.
    (d) Revolving fund
      The Secretary may use so much of any funds available for the
    plugging of wells as he may find necessary to start the program
    provided for by this section, and thereafter he may use the
    proceeds from the sale or other disposition of such water as a
    revolving fund for the continuation of such program, and such
    proceeds are hereby appropriated for such purpose.
    (e) Operations under lease not restricted
      Nothing in this section shall be construed to restrict operations
    under any oil or gas lease or permit under any other provision of
    this chapter.

    Sec. 241. Leases of lands

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      (1) The Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized to lease
    to any person or corporation qualified under this chapter any
    deposits of oil shale, and gilsonite (including all vein-type solid
    hydrocarbons) belonging to the United States and the surface of so
    much of the public lands containing such deposits, or land adjacent
    thereto, as may be required for the extraction and reduction of the
    leased minerals, under such rules and regulations, not inconsistent
    with this chapter, as he may prescribe.
      (2) No lease hereunder shall exceed 5,760 acres of land, to be
    described by the legal subdivisions of the public-land surveys, or
    if unsurveyed, to be surveyed by the United States, at the expense
    of the applicant, in accordance with regulations to be prescribed
    by the Secretary of the Interior.
      (3) Leases may be for indeterminate periods, upon such conditions
    as may be imposed by the Secretary of the Interior, including
    covenants relative to methods of mining, prevention of waste, and
    productive development.
      (4) For the privilege of mining, extracting, and disposing of the
    oil or other minerals covered by a lease under this section the
    lessee shall pay to the United States such royalties as shall be
    specified in the lease and an annual rental, payable at the
    beginning of each year, at the rate of $2.00 per acre per annum,
    for the lands included in the lease, the rental paid for any one
    year to be credited against the royalties accruing for that year;
    such royalties to be subject to readjustment at the end of each
    twenty-year period by the Secretary of the Interior. For the
    purpose of encouraging the production of petroleum products from
    shales the Secretary may, in his discretion, waive the payment of
    any royalty and rental during the first five years of any lease.
    Any person having a valid claim to such minerals under existing
    laws on January 1, 1919, shall, upon the relinquishment of such
    claim, be entitled to a lease under the provisions of this section
    for such area of the land relinquished as shall not exceed the
    maximum area authorized by this section to be leased to an
    individual or corporation. No claimant for a lease who has been
    guilty of any fraud or who had knowledge or reasonable grounds to
    know of any fraud, or who has not acted honestly and in good faith,
    shall be entitled to any of the benefits of this section. No one
    person, association, or corporation shall acquire or hold more than
    50,000 acres of oil shale leases in any one State. For gilsonite
    (including all vein-type solid hydrocarbons) no person,
    association, or corporation shall acquire or hold more than seven
    thousand six hundred eighty acres in any one State without respect
    to the number of leases.
      (5) No lease issued under this section shall be included in any
    chargeability limitation associated with oil and gas leases.
    (b) Offer for lease; deposits other than oil shale; questioned
      validity because of location; preference rights
      If an offer for a lease under the provisions of this section for
    deposits other than oil shale is based upon a mineral location, the
    validity of which might be questioned because the claim was based
    on a placer location rather than on a lode location, or vice versa,
    the offeror shall have a preference right to a lease if the offer
    is filed not more than one year after September 2, 1960.
    (c) (!1) Multiple use principal leases; gilsonite including all
      vein-type solid hydrocarbons

      With respect to gilsonite (including all vein-type solid
    hydrocarbons) a lease under the multiple use principle may issue
    notwithstanding the existence of an outstanding lease issued under
    any other provision of this chapter.
    (c) (!1) Offsite leases
      (1) The Secretary may within the State of Colorado lease to the
    holder of the Federal oil shale lease known as Federal Prototype
    Tract C-a additional lands necessary for the disposal of oil shale
    wastes and the materials removed from mined lands, and for the
    building of plants, reduction works, and other facilities connected
    with oil shale operations (which lease shall be referred to
    hereinafter as an "offsite lease"). The Secretary may only issue
    one offsite lease not to exceed six thousand four hundred acres. An
    offsite lease may not serve more than one Federal oil shale lease
    and may not be transferred except in conjunction with the transfer
    of the Federal oil shale lease that it serves.
      (2) The Secretary may issue one offsite lease of not more than
    three hundred and twenty acres to any person, association or
    corporation which has the right to develop oil shale on non-Federal
    lands. An offsite lease serving non-Federal oil shale land may not
    serve more than one oil shale operation and may not be transferred
    except in conjunction with the transfer of the non-Federal oil
    shale land that it serves. Not more than two offsite leases may be
    issued under this paragraph.
      (3) An offsite lease shall include no rights to any mineral
    deposits.
      (4) The Secretary may issue offsite leases after consideration of
    the need for such lands, impacts on the environment and other
    resource values, and upon a determination that the public interest
    will be served thereby.
      (5) An offsite lease for lands the surface of which is under the
    jurisdiction of a Federal agency other than the Department of the
    Interior shall be issued only with the consent of that other
    Federal agency and shall be subject to such terms and conditions as
    it may prescribe.
      (6) An offsite lease shall be for such periods of time and shall
    include such lands, subject to the acreage limitations contained in
    this subsection, as the Secretary determines to be necessary to
    achieve the purposes for which the lease is issued, and shall
    contain such provisions as he determines are needed for protection
    of environmental and other resource values.
      (7) An offsite lease shall provide for the payment of an annual
    rental which shall reflect the fair market value of the rights
    granted and which shall be subject to such revisions as the
    Secretary, in his discretion, determines may be needed from time to
    time to continue to reflect the fair market value.
      (8) An offsite lease may, at the option of the lessee, include
    provisions for payments in any year which payments shall be
    credited against any portion of the annual rental for a subsequent
    year to the extent that such payment is payable by the Secretary of
    the Treasury under section 191 of this title to the State within
    the boundaries of which the leased lands are located. Such funds
    shall be paid by the Secretary of the Treasury to the appropriate
    State in accordance with section 191 of this title, and such funds
    shall be distributed by the State only to those counties,
    municipalities, or jurisdictional subdivisions impacted by oil
    shale development and/or where the lease is sited.
      (9) An offsite lease shall remain subject to leasing under the
    other provisions of this chapter where such leasing would not be
    incompatible with the offsite lease.
    (d) Considerations governing issuance of offsite lease
      In recognition of the unique character of oil shale development:
      (1) In determining whether to offer or issue an offsite lease
    under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall consult
    with the Governor and appropriate State, local, and tribal
    officials of the State where the lands to be leased are located,
    and of any additional State likely to be affected significantly by
    the social, economic, or environmental effects of development under
    such lease, in order to coordinate Federal and State planning
    processes, minimize duplication of permits, avoid delays, and
    anticipate and mitigate likely impacts of development.
      (2) The Secretary may issue an offsite lease under subsection (d)
    (!2) after consideration of (A) the need for leasing, (B) impacts
    on the environment and other resource values, (C) socioeconomic
    factors, and (D) information from consultations with the Governors
    of the affected States.

      (3) Before determining whether to offer an offsite lease under
    subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall seek the
    recommendation of the Governor of the State in which the lands to
    be leased are located as to whether or not to lease such lands,
    what alternative actions are available, and what special conditions
    could be added to the proposed lease to mitigate impacts. The
    Secretary shall accept the recommendations of the Governor if he
    determines that they provide for a reasonable balance between the
    national interest and the State's interests. The Secretary shall
    communicate to the Governor, in writing, and publish in the Federal
    Register the reasons for his determination to accept or reject such
    Governor's recommendations.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Notice
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, within 60 days from
    October 24, 1992, the Secretary of the Interior shall provide

    the requirements of this Act. Such notice shall be made by
    registered mail and by publication in a newspaper of general
    circulation in the areas in which such claims are located.
    (b) Full patent
      The holder of a valid oil shale mining claim who has filed a
    patent application and received first half final certificate for
    patent by October 24, 1992, may obtain a patent pursuant to the
    general mining laws of the United States.
    (c) Patent
      (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the holder of a

    which has been accepted for processing by the Department of the
    Interior by October 24, 1992, but has not received first half final
    certificate for patent by October 24, 1992, may receive only a
    patent limited to the oil shale and associated minerals, upon
    payment of $2.50 per acre. Title to the surface and to all other
    minerals, including, but not limited to, oil, gas, and coal, shall
    remain in the United States. Patents issued pursuant to this
    subsection shall provide for surface use to the same extent as is
    provided under applicable law prior to October 24, 1992, with
    respect to oil shale mining claims, subject to the requirements of
    subsection (f) of this section.
      (2) Maintenance of claims referred to in this subsection prior to
    patent issuance shall be in accordance with the requirements of
    applicable law prior to October 24, 1992.
      (3) Any holder of a valid oil shale mining claim referred to in
    this subsection may maintain such claim in accordance with the
    requirements set forth in subsection (e)(2) of this section in lieu
    of receiving a patent under this section.
      (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person

    United States as a result of the application of this section being
    declared to be a taking of property within the meaning of the Fifth
    Amendment to the United States Constitution, may obtain a full
    patent upon tender to the Secretary of the amount of such
    compensation, not including interest, and upon the receipt of such
    amount, the Secretary shall convey to such person a patent in the
    form and manner provided under the general mining laws of the
    United States. Such tender may only be made within 3 years of
    obtaining such compensation.
    (d) Election
      (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, within 180 days
    from the date of which the Secretary provided notice under
    subsection (a) of this section, a holder of a valid oil shale
    mining claim for which a patent application was not filed and
    accepted for processing by the Department of the Interior prior to
    October 24, 1992, shall file with the Secretary a notice of
    election to - 
        (A) proceed to limited patent as provided in subsection (e)(1)
      of this section; or
        (B) maintain the unpatented claim as provided for in subsection
      (e)(2) of this section.

      (2) Failure to file the notice of election as required by

    abandonment of the claim by operation of law.
      (3) Any claim holder who elects to proceed under paragraph (1)(A)
    must apply for a patent within 2 years from the date of election or
    notify the Secretary in writing prior to expiration of the 2-year
    period of a decision to maintain such claim as provided in
    paragraph (1)(B) or such claim shall be deemed conclusively to have
    been abandoned by operation of law.
      (4) The provisions of this subsection shall be in addition to the
    requirements of section 1744 of title 43.
    (e) Effect of election
      (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, a claim holder
    subject to the election requirements of subsection (d) of this
    section who elects to receive a limited patent shall receive title
    only to the oil shale associated minerals, upon payment of fair
    market value for the oil shale and associated minerals. Title to
    the surface and to all other minerals, including, but not limited
    to oil, gas, and coal, shall remain in the United States. Patents
    issued pursuant to this subsection shall provide for surface use to
    the same extent as is provided under applicable law prior to
    October 24, 1992, with respect to oil shale mining claims, subject
    to the requirements of subsection (f) of this section.
      (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a claim holder
    referred to in subsection (c) of this section or a claim holder
    subject to the election requirements of subsection (d) of this
    section who maintains or elects to maintain an unpatented claim
    shall maintain such claim by complying with the general mining laws
    of the United States, and with the provisions of this section,
    except that the claim holder shall no longer be required to perform
    annual labor, and instead shall pay to the Secretary $550 per claim
    per year for deposit as miscellaneous receipts in the general fund
    of the Treasury, commencing with calendar year 1993. Such fee shall
    accompany the filing made by the claim holder with the Bureau of
    Land Management pursuant to section 1744(a)(2) of title 43.
    (f) Reclamation
      In addition to other applicable requirements, any person who
    holds a limited patent or maintains a claim pursuant to this
    section shall be required to carry out reclamation as prescribed by
    the Secretary and to furnish a bond or other appropriate financial
    guarantee in an amount sufficient to ensure adequate reclamation of
    the lands to be disturbed by any aspect of the proposed mining
    activities.
    (g) Reaffirmation of requirements
      Without comment on the adequacy of current or former standards
    for determining validity of oil shale claims, Congress reaffirms
    the requirements of law that a patent may issue only to persons who
    hold valid claims and the need for careful review of any
    applications.
    (h) Issuance of patents
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, with respect to any
    oil shale mining claim located under the general mining laws of the
    United States, no patent for such claim shall be issued except as
    provided by this section.

      claimants

-STATUTE-
      Any bona fide occupant or claimant of oil or gas bearing lands in
    the Territory of Alaska, who, or whose predecessors in interest,
    prior to withdrawal had complied otherwise with the requirements of
    the mining laws, but had made no discovery of oil or gas in wells
    and who prior to withdrawal had made substantial improvements for
    the discovery of oil or gas on or for each location or had prior to
    February 25, 1920 expended not less than $250 in improvements on or
    for each location shall be entitled, upon relinquishment or
    surrender to the United States within one year from February 25,
    1920, or within six months after final denial or withdrawal of
    application for patent, to a lease or leases, under this chapter
    covering such lands, not exceeding five leases in number and not
    exceeding an aggregate of one thousand two hundred and eighty acres
    in each: Provided, That the annual lease rentals for lands in the
    Territory of Alaska not within any known geological structure of a
    producing oil or gas field and the royalty payments from production
    of oil or gas sold or removed from such lands shall be identical
    with those prescribed for such leases covering similar lands in the
    States of the United States, except that leases which may issue
    pursuant to applications or offers to lease such lands, which
    applications or offers were filed prior to and were pending on May
    3, 1958, shall require the payment of 25 cents per acre as lease
    rental for the first year of such leases; but the aforesaid
    exception shall not apply in any way to royalties to be required
    under leases which may issue pursuant to offers or applications
    filed prior to May 3, 1958.
      The Secretary of the Interior shall neither prescribe nor approve
    any cooperative or unit plan of development or operation nor any
    operating, drilling, or development contract establishing different
    royalty or rental rates for Alaska lands than for similar lands
    within the States of the United States.
      No claimant for a lease who has been guilty of any fraud or who
    had knowledge or reasonable grounds to know of any fraud, or who
    has not acted honestly and in good faith, shall be entitled to any
    of the benefits of this section.

-STATUTE-
      Upon showing to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Interior
    that valuable deposits of one of the substances enumerated in
    section 261 of this title have been discovered by the permittee
    within the area covered by his permit and that such land is chiefly
    valuable therefor, the permittee shall be entitled to a lease for
    any or all of the land embraced in the prospecting permit at a
    royalty of not less than 2 per centum of the quantity or gross
    value of the output of sodium compounds and other related products
    at the point of shipment to market; the lands in such lease to be
    taken in compact form by legal subdivisions of the public land
    surveys or, if the land be not surveyed, by survey executed at the
    cost of the permittee in accordance with regulations prescribed by
    the Secretary of the Interior. Lands known to contain valuable
    deposits of one of the substances enumerated in section 261 of this
    title and not covered by permits or leases shall be subject to
    lease by the Secretary of the Interior through advertisement,
    competitive bidding, or such other methods as he may by general
    regulations adopt and in such areas as he shall fix, not exceeding
    two thousand five hundred and sixty acres. All leases under this
    section shall be conditioned upon the payment by the lessee of such
    royalty as may be fixed in the lease, not less than 2 per centum of
    the quantity or gross value of the output of sodium compounds and
    other related products at the point of shipment to market, and the
    payment in advance of a rental of 25 cents per acre for the first
    calendar year or fraction thereof, 50 cents per acre for the
    second, third, fourth, and fifth calendar years respectively; and
    $1 per acre per annum thereafter during the continuance of the
    lease, such rental for any one year to be credited against
    royalties accruing for that year. Leases under this section shall
    be for a period of twenty years, with preferential right in the
    lessee to renew for successive periods of ten years upon such
    reasonable terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the
    Secretary of the Interior unless otherwise provided by law at the
    expiration of such period: Provided, That nothing in this chapter
    shall prohibit the mining and sale of sodium compounds under
    potassium leases issued pursuant to subchapter VII [Sec. 141 et
    seq.] of chapter 3 of this title and subchapter IX of this chapter,
    nor the mining and sale of potassium compounds as a byproduct from
    sodium leases taken under this section: Provided further, That on
    application by any lessee the Secretary of the Interior is
    authorized to modify the rental and royalty provisions stipulated
    in any existing sodium lease to conform to the provisions of this

    Sec. 283. Lands containing valuable deposits not covered by permits
      or leases; authority to lease; acreage; conditions; renewals;
      exemptions from rentals and royalties; suspension of operations

-STATUTE-
      Lands known to contain valuable deposits enumerated in this
    subchapter and not covered by permits or leases shall be held
    subject to lease by the Secretary of the Interior through
    advertisement, competitive bidding, or such other methods as he may
    by general regulations adopt, and in such areas as he shall fix,
    not exceeding two thousand five hundred and sixty acres; all leases
    to be conditioned upon the payment by the lessee of such royalty as
    may be fixed in the lease, not less than 2 per centum of the
    quantity or gross value of the output of potassium compounds and
    other related products, except sodium, at the point of shipment to
    market, and the payment in advance of a rental of 25 cents per acre
    for the first calendar year or fraction thereof; 50 cents per acre
    for the second, third, fourth, and fifth years, respectively; and
    $1 per acre per annum thereafter during the continuance of the
    lease, such rental for any year being credited against royalties
    accruing for that year. Any lease issued under this subchapter
    shall be for a term of twenty years and so long thereafter as the
    lessee complies with the terms and conditions of the lease and upon
    the further condition that at the end of each twenty-year period
    succeeding the date of the lease such reasonable adjustment of the
    terms and conditions thereof may be made therein as may be
    prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior unless otherwise
    provided by law at the expiration of such periods. Leases shall be
    conditioned upon a minimum annual production or the payment of a
    minimum royalty in lieu thereof, except when production is
    interrupted by strikes, the elements, or casualties not
    attributable to the lessee. The Secretary of the Interior may
    permit suspension of operations under any such leases when
    marketing conditions are such that the leases cannot be operated
    except at a loss. The Secretary upon application by the lessee
    prior to the expiration of any existing lease in good standing
    shall amend such lease to provide for the same tenure and to
    contain the same conditions, including adjustment at the end of
    each twenty-year period succeeding the date of said lease, as
    provided for in this subchapter. In the discretion of the Secretary
    of the Interior the area involved in any lease resulting from a
    prospecting permit may be exempt from any rental in excess of 25
    cents per acre for twenty years succeeding its issue, and the
    production of potassium compounds under such a lease may be exempt
    from any royalty in excess of the minimum prescribed in this
    subchapter for the same period.

      Prior to the award of any lease under section 301 of this title,
    the Secretary of the Interior shall notify the owner or lessee of
    adjoining lands and allow him a reasonable time, to be fixed in the
    notice given, within which to submit an offer or bid of the amount
    or percentage of compensatory royalty that such owner will agree to
    pay for the extraction through wells on his or its adjoining land,
    of the oil or gas under and from such adjoining right of way, and
    at the same time afford the holder of the railroad or other right
    of way a like opportunity within the same time to submit its bid or
    offer as to the amount or percentage of royalty it will agree to
    pay, if a lease for the extraction of the oil and gas deposits
    under the right of way be awarded to the holder of such right of
    way. In case of competing offers by the said parties in interest,
    the Secretary shall award the right to extract the oil and gas to
    the bidder, duly qualified, making the offer in his opinion most
    advantageous to the United States. In case but one bid or offer is
    received after notice duly given, he may, in his discretion, award
    the right to extract the oil and gas to such bidder.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Subject to the provisions of section 35(b) of the Mineral
    Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 191(b)), all receipts derived from leases
    issued under the authority of this chapter shall be paid into the
    same funds or accounts in the Treasury and shall be distributed in
    the same manner as prescribed for other receipts from the lands
    affected by the lease, the intention of this provision being that
    this chapter shall not affect the distribution of receipts pursuant
    to legislation applicable to such lands: Provided, however, That
    receipts from leases or permits for minerals in lands set apart for
    Indian use, including lands the jurisdiction of which has been
    transferred to the Department of the Interior by the Executive
    order for Indian use, shall be deposited in a special fund in the
    Treasury until final disposition thereof by the Congress.
    Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, all
    receipts derived from leases on lands acquired for military or
    naval purposes, except the naval petroleum reserves and national
    oil shale reserves, shall be paid into the Treasury of the United
    States and disposed of in the same manner as provided under section
    35 of the Act of February 25, 1920 (41 Stat. 450; 30 U.S.C. 191),
    in the case of receipts from sales, bonuses, royalties, and rentals
    of the public lands under that Act [30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.].
      (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any payment to a
    State under this section shall be made by the Secretary of the
    Interior and shall be made not later than the last business day of
    the month following the month in which such moneys or associated
    reports are received by the Secretary of the Interior, whichever is
    later. The preceding sentence shall also apply to any payment to a
    State derived from a lease for mineral resources issued by the
    Secretary of the Interior under section 520 of title 16. The
    Secretary shall pay interest to a State on any amount not paid to
    the State within that time at the rate prescribed under section
    1721 (!1) of this title from the date payment was required to be
    made under this subsection until the date payment is made.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Force and effect
      Subject to the provisions of this chapter and to any valid
    intervening rights acquired under laws of the United States, any
    mining claim located under the mining laws of the United States
    subsequent to July 31, 1939, and prior to January 1, 1953, on lands
    of the United States which were, at the time of such location - 
        (1) included in a permit or lease issued under the mineral
      leasing laws; or
        (2) covered by an application or offer for a permit or lease
      which had been filed under the mineral leasing laws; or
        (3) known to be valuable for minerals subject to disposition
      under the mineral leasing laws;

    shall be effective to the same extent as if such mining claim had
    been located on lands which were at the time of such location
    subject to location under the mining laws of the United States:
    Provided, however, That in order to obtain the benefits of this
    chapter, the owner of any such mining claim shall, not later than
    one hundred and twenty days after August 12, 1953, post on such
    claim in the manner required for posting notice of location of
    mining claims and file for record in the office where the notice or
    certificate of location of such claim is of record an amended
    notice of location of such claim, stating that such notice is filed
    pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and for the purpose of
    obtaining the benefits thereof.
    (b) Labor and improvement
      Labor performed or improvements made upon or for the benefit of
    such mining claims after the original location thereof shall be
    recognized as applicable thereto for all purposes to the same
    extent as labor performed and improvements made upon or for the
    benefit of mining claims which are not affected by this chapter.
    (c) Withdrawal or reservation
      Any withdrawal or reservation made after the original location of
    such mining claim affecting land covered by such mining claim is
    modified and amended so that the effect thereof upon such mining
    claim shall be the same as if such mining claim had been located
    upon lands of the United States, which, subsequent to July 31,
    1939, and prior to the date of such withdrawal, were subject to
    location under the mining laws of the United States.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Preference categories
      Subject to the conditions and provisions of this chapter and to
    any valid intervening rights acquired under the laws of the United
    States, any mining claim located under the mining laws of the
    United States subsequent to July 31, 1939, and prior to February
    10, 1954, on lands of the United States, which at the time of
    location were - 
        (1) included in a permit or lease issued under the mineral
      leasing laws; or
        (2) covered by an application or offer for a permit or lease
      which had been filed under the mineral leasing laws; or
        (3) known to be valuable for minerals subject to disposition
      under the mineral leasing laws,

    shall be effective to the same extent in all respects as if such
    lands at the time of location, and at all times thereafter, had not
    been so included or covered or known: Provided, however, That, in
    order to be entitled to the benefits of this chapter, the owner of
    any such mining claim located prior to January 1, 1953, must have
    posted and filed for record, within the time allowed by the
    provisions of chapter 11 of this title, an amended notice of
    location as to such mining claim, stating that such notice was
    filed pursuant to the provisions of said chapter 11 and for the
    purpose of obtaining the benefits thereof: And provided further,
    That in order to obtain the benefits of this chapter, the owner of
    any such mining claim located subsequent to December 31, 1952, and
    prior to February 10, 1954, not later than one hundred and twenty
    days after August 13, 1954, must post on such claim in the manner
    required for posting notice of location of mining claims and file
    for record in the office where the notice or certificate of
    location of such claim is of record an amended notice of location
    for such claim, stating that such notice is filed pursuant to the
    provisions of this chapter and for the purpose of obtaining the
    benefits thereof and, within said one hundred and twenty day
    period, if such owner shall have filed a uranium lease application
    as to the tract covered by such mining claim, must file with the
    Atomic Energy Commission a withdrawal of such uranium lease
    application or, if a uranium lease shall have issued pursuant
    thereto, a release of such lease, and must record a notice of the
    filing of such withdrawal or release in the county office wherein
    such notice or certificate of location shall have been filed for
    record.
    (b) Labor and improvements
      Labor performed or improvements made after the original location
    of and upon or for the benefit of any mining claim which shall be
    entitled to the benefits of this chapter under the provisions of
    subsection (a) of this section, shall be recognized as applicable
    to such mining claim for all purposes to the same extent as if the
    validity of such mining claim were in no respect dependent upon the
    provisions of this chapter.
    (c) Withdrawal or reservation of lands
      As to any land covered by any mining claim which is entitled to
    the benefits of this chapter under the provisions of subsection (a)
    of this section, any withdrawal or reservation of lands made after
    the original location of such mining claim is hereby modified and
    amended so that the effect thereof upon such mining claim shall be
    the same as if such mining claim had been located upon lands of the
    United States which, subsequent to July 31, 1939, and prior to the
    date of such withdrawal or reservation, were subject to location
    under the mining laws of the United States.

      (b) If any mining claim hereafter located shall cover any lands
    embraced within any mining claim which shall have been located
    prior to February 10, 1954, and which shall be entitled to the
    benefits of this chapter, then as to such area of conflict said

-STATUTE-
    (a) Right to locate mining claims
      Subject to the conditions and provisions of this chapter and to
    any valid prior rights acquired under the laws of the United
    States, the owner of any pending uranium lease application or of
    any uranium lease shall have, for a period of one hundred and
    twenty days after August 13, 1954, as limited in subsection (b) of
    this section, the right to locate mining claims upon the lands
    covered by said application or lease.
    (b) Priorities and conflicting rights; termination of rights
      Any rights under any such mining claim so hereafter located
    pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall
    be subject to any rights of the owner of any mining claim which was
    located prior to February 10, 1954, and which was valid on August
    13, 1954 or which may acquire validity under the provisions of this
    chapter. As to any lands covered by a uranium lease and also by a
    pending uranium lease application, the right of mining location
    under this section, as between the owner of said lease and the
    owner of said application, shall be deemed as to such conflict area
    to be vested in the owner of said lease. As to any lands embraced
    in more than one such pending uranium lease application, such right
    of mining location, as between the owners of such conflicting
    applications, shall be deemed to be vested in the owner of the
    prior application. Priority of such an application shall be
    determined by the time of posting on a tract then available for
    such leasing of a notice of lease application in accordance with
    paragraph (c) of the Atomic Energy Commission's Domestic Uranium
    Program Circular 7 (10 C.F.R. 60.7 (c)) provided there shall have
    been timely compliance with the other provisions of said paragraph
    (c) or, if there shall not have been such timely compliance, then
    by the time of the filing of the uranium lease application with the
    Atomic Energy Commission. Any rights under any mining claim located
    under the provisions of this section shall terminate at the
    expiration of thirty days after the filing for record of the notice
    or certificate of location of such mining claim unless, within said
    thirty-day period, the owner of the uranium lease application or
    uranium lease upon which the location of such mining claim was
    predicated shall have filed with the Atomic Energy Commission a
    withdrawal of said application or a release of said lease and shall
    have recorded a notice of the filing of such withdrawal or release
    in the county office wherein such notice or certificate of location
    shall be of record.
    (c) Future claims on lands covered by application or lease
      Except as otherwise provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this
    section, no mining claim hereafter located shall be valid as to any
    lands which at the time of such location were covered by a uranium
    lease application or a uranium lease. Any tract upon which a notice
    of lease application has been posted in accordance with said
    paragraph (c) of said Circular 7 shall be deemed to have been
    included in a uranium lease application from and after the time of
    the posting of such notice of lease application: Provided, That
    there shall have been timely compliance with the other provisions
    of said paragraph (c) or, if there shall not have been such timely
    compliance, then from and after the time of the filing of a uranium
    lease application with the Atomic Energy Commission.

    Sec. 526. Mining and Leasing Act operations

-STATUTE-
    (a) Multiple use
      Where the same lands are being utilized for mining operations and
    Leasing Act operations, each of such operations shall be conducted,
    so far as reasonably practicable, in a manner compatible with such
    multiple use.
    (b) Mining operations to avoid damage to mineral deposits and
      interference with mineral operations
      Any mining operations pursuant to rights under any unpatented or
    patented mining claim or millsite which shall be subject to a
    reservation to the United States of Leasing Act minerals as
    provided in this chapter, shall be conducted, so far as reasonably
    practicable, in a manner which will avoid damage to any known
    deposit of any Leasing Act mineral. Subject to the provisions of
    subsection (d) of this section, mining operations shall be so
    conducted as not to endanger or materially interfere with any
    existing surface or underground improvements, workings, or
    facilities which may have been made for the purpose of Leasing Act
    operations, or with the utilization of such improvements, workings,
    or facilities.
    (c) Leasing Act operations to avoid damage to mineral deposits and
      interference with mining operations
      Any Leasing Act operations on lands covered by an unpatented or
    patented mining claim or millsite which shall be subject to a
    reservation to the United States of Leasing Act minerals as
    provided in this chapter shall be conducted, so far as reasonably
    practicable, in a manner which will avoid damage to any known
    deposit of any mineral not so reserved from such mining claim or
    millsite. Subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this
    section, Leasing Act operations shall be so conducted as not to
    endanger or materially interfere with any existing surface or
    underground improvements, workings, or facilities which may have
    been made for the purpose of mining operations, or with the
    utilization of such improvements, workings, or facilities.
    (d) Damage or interference permitted by court
      If, upon petition of either the mining operator or the Leasing
    Act operator, any court of competent jurisdiction shall find that a
    particular use in connection with one of such operations cannot be
    reasonably and properly conducted without endangering or materially
    interfering with the then existing improvements, workings, or
    facilities of the other of such operations or with the utilization
    thereof, and shall find that under the conditions and
    circumstances, as they then appear, the injury or damage which
    would result from denial of such particular use would outweigh the
    injury or damage which would result to such then existing
    improvements, workings, or facilities or from interference with the
    utilization thereof if that particular use were allowed, then and
    in such event such court may permit such use upon payment (or upon
    furnishing of security determined by the court to be adequate to
    secure payment) to the party or parties who would be thus injured
    or damaged, of an amount to be fixed by the court as constituting
    fair compensation for the then reasonably contemplated injury or
    damage which would result to such then existing improvements,
    workings, or facilities or from interference with the utilization
    thereof by reason of the allowance of such particular use.
    (e) Information regarding operations to be furnished on request
      Where the same lands are being utilized for mining operations and
    Leasing Act operations, then upon request of the party conducting
    either of said operations, the party conducting the other of said
    operations shall furnish to and at the expense of such requesting
    party copies of any information which said other party may have, as
    to the situs of any improvements, workings, or facilities
    theretofore made upon such lands, and upon like request, shall
    permit such requesting party, at the risk of such requesting party,
    to have access at reasonable times to any such improvements,
    workings, or facilities for the purpose of surveying and checking
    or determining the situs thereof. If damage to or material
    interference with a party's improvements, workings, facilities, or
    with the utilization thereof shall result from such party's
    failure, after request, to so furnish to the requesting party such
    information or from denial of such access, such failure or denial
    shall relieve the requesting party of any liability for the damage
    or interference resulting by reason of such failure or denial.
    Failure of a party to furnish requested information or access shall
    not impose upon such party any liability to the requesting party
    other than for such costs of court and attorney's fees as may be
    allowed to the requesting party in enforcing by court action the
    obligations of this section as to the furnishing of information and
    access. The obligation hereunder of any party to furnish requested
    information shall be limited to map and survey information then
    available to such party with respect to the situs of improvements,
    workings, and facilities and the furnishing thereof shall not be
    deemed to constitute any representation as to the accuracy of such
    information.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Filing of notice
      Any applicant, offeror, permittee, or lessee under the mineral
    leasing laws may file in the office of the Secretary of the
    Interior, or in such office as the Secretary may designate, a
    request for publication of notice of such application, offer,
    permit, or lease, provided expressly, that not less than ninety
    days prior to the filing of such request for publication there
    shall have been filed for record in the county office of record for
    the county in which the lands covered thereby are situate a notice
    of the filing of such application or offer or of the issuance of
    such permit or lease which notice shall set forth the date of such
    filing or issuance, the name and address of the applicant, offeror,
    permittee or lessee and the description of the lands covered by
    such application, offer, permit or lease, showing the section or
    sections of the public land surveys which embrace the lands covered
    by such application, offer, permit, or lease, or if such lands are
    unsurveyed, either the section or sections which would probably
    embrace such lands when the public lands surveys are extended to
    such lands or a tie by courses and distances to an approved United
    States mineral monument.
      The filing of such request for publication shall be accompanied
    by a certified copy of such recorded notice and an affidavit or
    affidavits of a person or persons over twenty-one years of age
    setting forth that the affiant or affiants have examined the lands
    involved in a reasonable effort to ascertain whether any person or
    persons were in actual possession of or engaged in the working of
    such lands or any part thereof, and, if no person or persons were
    found to be in actual possession of or engaged in the working of
    said lands or any part thereof on the date of such examination,
    setting forth such fact, or, if any person or persons were so found
    to be in actual possession or engaged in such working on the date
    of such examination, setting forth the name and address of each
    such person, unless affiant shall have been unable through
    reasonable inquiry to obtain information as to the name and address
    of any such person, in which event the affidavit shall set forth
    fully the nature and results of such inquiry.
      The filing of such request for publication shall also be
    accompanied by the certificate of a title or abstract company, or
    of a title abstractor, or of an attorney, based upon such
    company's, abstractor's, or attorney's examination of the
    instruments affecting the lands involved, of record in the public
    records of the county in which said lands are situate as shown by
    the indices of the public records in the county office of record
    for said county, setting forth the name of any person disclosed by
    said instruments to have an interest in said lands under any
    unpatented mining claim heretofore located, together with the
    address of such person if disclosed by such instruments of record.
      Thereupon the Secretary of the Interior, or his designated
    representative, at the expense of the requesting person (who, prior
    to the commencement of publication, must furnish the agreement of
    the publisher to hold such requesting person alone responsible for
    charges of publication), shall cause notice of such application,
    offer, permit, or lease to be published in a newspaper having
    general circulation in the county in which the lands involved are
    situate.
      Such notice shall describe the lands covered by such application,
    offer, permit, or lease, as provided heretofore in the notice to be
    filed in the office of record of the county in which the lands
    covered are situate, and shall notify whomever it may concern that
    if any person claiming or asserting under, or by virtue of, any
    unpatented mining claim heretofore located, any right or interest
    in Leasing Act minerals as to such lands or any part thereof, shall
    fail to file in the office where such request for publication was
    filed (which office shall be specified in such notice) and within
    one hundred fifty days from the date of the first publication of
    such notice (which date shall be specified in such notice), a
    verified statement which shall set forth, as to such unpatented
    mining claim:
        (1) The date of location;
        (2) The book and page of recordation of the notice or
      certificate of location;
        (3) The section or sections of the public land surveys which
      embrace such mining claim; or if such lands are unsurveyed,
      either the section or sections which would probably embrace such
      mining claim when the public land surveys are extended to such
      lands or a tie by courses and distances to an approved United
      States mineral monument;
        (4) Whether such claimant is a locator or purchaser under such
      location; and
        (5) The name and address of such claimant and names and
      addresses so far as known to the claimant of any other person or
      persons claiming any interest or interests in or under such
      unpatented mining claim;

    such failure shall be conclusively deemed (i) to constitute a
    waiver and relinquishment by such mining claimant of any and all
    right, title, and interest under such mining claim as to, but only
    as to, Leasing Act minerals, and (ii) to constitute a consent by
    such mining claimant that such mining claim and any patent issued
    therefor, shall be subject to the reservation specified in section
    524 of this title, and (iii) to preclude thereafter any assertion
    by such mining claimant of any right or title to or interest in any
    Leasing Act mineral by reason of such mining claim.
      If such notice is published in a daily paper, it shall be
    published in the Wednesday issue for nine consecutive weeks, or, if
    in a weekly paper, in nine consecutive issues, or, if in a
    semiweekly or triweekly paper, in the issue of the same day of each
    week for nine consecutive weeks.
      Within fifteen days after the date of first publication of such
    notice, the person requesting such publication (1) shall cause a
    copy of such notice to be personally delivered to or to be mailed
    by registered mail or by certified mail addressed to each person in
    possession or engaged in the working of the land whose name and
    address is shown by an affidavit filed as aforesaid, and to each
    person who may have filed, as to any lands described in said
    notice, a request for notices, as provided in subsection (d) of
    this section, and shall cause a copy of such notice to be mailed by
    registered mail or by certified mail to each person whose name and
    address is set forth in the title or abstract company's or title
    abstractor's or attorney's certificate filed as aforesaid, as
    having an interest in the lands described in said notice under any
    unpatented mining claim heretofore located, such notice to be
    directed to such person's address as set forth in such certificate;
    and (2) shall file in the office where said request for publication
    was filed an affidavit showing that copies have been so delivered
    or mailed.
    (b) Failure to file verified statement
      If any claimant under any unpatented mining claim heretofore
    located which embraces any of the lands described in any notice
    published in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of
    this section shall fail to file a verified statement, as above
    provided, within one hundred and fifty days from the date of the
    first publication of such notice, such failure shall be
    conclusively deemed, except as otherwise provided in subsection (e)
    of this section, (i) to constitute a waiver and relinquishment by
    such mining claimant of any and all right, title, and interest
    under such mining claim as to, but only as to, Leasing Act
    minerals, and (ii) to constitute a consent by such mining claimant
    that such mining claim and any patent issued therefor, shall be
    subject to the reservation specified in section 524 of this title,
    and (iii) to preclude thereafter any assertion by such mining
    claimant of any right or title to or interest in any Leasing Act
    mineral by reason of such mining claim.
    (c) Hearings
      If any verified statement shall be filed by a mining claimant as
    provided in subsection (a) of this section, then the Secretary of
    the Interior or his designated representative shall fix a time and
    place for a hearing to determine the validity and effectiveness of
    the mining claimant's asserted right or interest in Leasing Act
    minerals, which place of hearing shall be in the county where the
    lands in question or parts thereof are located, unless the mining
    claimant agrees otherwise. The procedures with respect to notice of
    such a hearing and the conduct thereof, and in respect to appeals
    shall follow the then established general procedures and rules of
    practice of the Department of the Interior in respect to contests
    or protests affecting public lands of the United States. If,
    pursuant to such a hearing the final decision rendered in the
    matter shall affirm the validity and effectiveness of any mining
    claimant's right or interest under the mining claim as to Leasing
    Act minerals, then no subsequent proceedings under this section
    shall have any force or effect upon the so-affirmed right or
    interest of such mining claimant under such mining claim. If at any
    time prior to a hearing the person requesting publication of notice
    and any person filing a verified statement pursuant to such notice
    shall so stipulate, then to the extent so stipulated, but only to
    such extent, no hearing shall be held with respect to rights
    asserted under that verified statement, and to the extent defined
    by the stipulation the rights asserted under that verified
    statement shall be deemed to be unaffected by that particular
    published notice.
    (d) Request for copy of notice
      Any person claiming any right in Leasing Act minerals under or by
    virtue of any unpatented mining claim heretofore located and
    desiring to receive a copy of any notice of any application, offer,
    permit, or lease which may be published as above provided in
    subsection (a) of this section, and which may affect lands embraced
    in such mining claim, may cause to be filed for record in the
    county office of record where the notice or certificate of location
    of such mining claim shall have been recorded, a duly acknowledged
    request for a copy of any such notice. Such request for copies
    shall set forth the name and address of the person requesting
    copies and shall also set forth, as to each mining claim under
    which such person asserts rights in Leasing Act minerals:
        (1) the date of location;
        (2) the book and page of the recordation of the notice or

    mining claim referred to in such request.
    (e) Failure to deliver or mail copy of notice
      If any applicant, offeror, permittee, or lessee shall fail to
    comply with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section as
    to the personal delivery or mailing of a copy of notice to any
    person, the publication of such notice shall be deemed wholly
    ineffectual as to that person or as to the rights asserted by that
    person and the failure of that person to file a verified statement,
    as provided in such notice, shall in no manner affect, diminish,
    prejudice or bar any rights of that person.

-STATUTE-
      Lands withdrawn from the public domain which are within (a)
    Helium Reserve Numbered 1, pursuant to Executive orders of March
    21, 1924, and January 28, 1926, and (b) Helium Reserve Numbered 2
    pursuant to Executive Order 6184 of June 26, 1933, shall be subject
    to entry and location under the mining laws of the United States,
    and to permit and lease under the mineral leasing laws, upon
    determination by the Secretary of the Interior, based upon
    available geologic and other information, that there is no
    reasonable probability that operations pursuant to entry or
    location of the particular lands under the mining laws, or pursuant
    to a permit or lease of the particular lands under the Mineral
    Leasing Act [30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.], will result in the extraction
    or cause loss or waste of the helium-bearing gas in the lands of
    such reserves: Provided, That the lands shall not become subject to
    entry, location, permit or lease until such time as the Secretary
    designates in an order published in the Federal Register: And
    provided further, That the Secretary may at any time as a condition
    to continued mineral operations require the entryman, locator,
    permittee or lessee to take such measures either above or below the
    surface of the lands as the Secretary deems necessary to prevent
    loss or waste of the helium-bearing gas.

      Subject to the conditions and provisions of this chapter and to
    any valid intervening rights acquired under the laws of the United
    States, public lands of the United States classified as or known to
    be valuable for coal subject to disposition under the mineral
    leasing laws and which are open to location and entry subject to
    the conditions and provisions of chapter 12 of this title, unless
    embraced within a coal prospecting permit or lease, shall also be
    open to location and entry under the mining laws of the United
    States upon the discovery of a valuable source material occurring
    within any seam, bed, or deposit of lignite in such lands:
    Provided, That a copy of the notice of any mining location made for
    source material occurring in any such bed, seam, or deposit, shall
    be filed for record in the land office of the Bureau of Land
    Management for the State in which the claim is situated within
    ninety days after the date of its location: Provided further, That
    the claimant to any such mining location shall report annually to
    the Mining Supervisor of the Geological Survey the amount of
    lignite mined or stripped in the recovery of such valuable source
    material during each calendar year and tender payment to him of 10
    cents per ton thereon. Any mineral patents issued hereunder shall
    be made subject to the recording and payment requirements of this
    section and shall contain a reservation to the United States of all
    Leasing Act minerals owned by the United States other than lignite
    containing valuable source material and lignite necessary to be
    stripped or mined in the recovery of such material. Mining claims
    located and mineral patents issued under the provisions of this
    chapter shall not include rights to lignite not containing valuable
    source material except to the extent it may be necessary to mine or
    strip such lignite in order to mine the source material and, with
    respect to lode claims, shall not include extralateral rights. For
    all purposes of this chapter "source material" and "lignite" shall

      It is recognized that outcrop and underground fires in coal
    formations involve serious wastage of the fuel resources of the
    Nation, and constitute a menace to the health and safety of the
    public and to surface property. It is therefore declared to be the
    policy of the Congress to provide for the control and
    extinguishment of outcrop and underground coal fires and thereby to
    prevent injuries and loss of life, protect public health, conserve
    natural resources, and to preserve public and private surface
    property.

-STATUTE-
      It is hereby recognized that the presence of large volumes of

    fuel resources of the Nation, and constitutes a menace to health
    and safety and national security. It is therefore declared to be
    the policy of the Congress to provide for the control and drainage
    of water in the anthracite coal formations and thereby conserve
    natural resources, promote national security, prevent injuries and
    loss of life, and preserve public and private property, and to seal
    abandoned coal mines and to fill voids in abandoned coal mines, in
    those instances where such work is in the interest of the public
    health or safety.

-STATUTE-
      The Secretary of the Interior is authorized, in order to carry
    out the purposes mentioned in section 571 of this title, to make
    financial contributions on the basis of programs or projects
    approved by the Secretary to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
    (hereinafter designated as the "Commonwealth") to seal abandoned
    coal mines and to fill voids in abandoned coal mines, in those
    instances where such work is in the interest of the public health
    or safety, and for control and drainage of water which, if not so
    controlled or drained, will cause the flooding of anthracite coal
    formations, said contributions to be applied to the cost of
    drainage works, pumping plants, and related facilities but subject,
    however, to the following conditions and limitations:
    (a) Contributions to be matched by Commonwealth
      The amounts authorized to be contributed by the Secretary of the
    Interior to the Commonwealth shall be equally matched by the
    Commonwealth;
    (b) Amount of contributions authorized
      The total amount of contributions by the Secretary of the
    Interior under the authority of this chapter shall not exceed
    $8,500,000, of which $1,500,000 of the unexpended balance remaining
    as of July 31, 1962, shall be reserved for the control and drainage
    of water;
    (c) Limitation on use of contribution
      The amounts contributed by the Secretary of the Interior under
    the authority of this chapter and the equally matched amounts
    contributed by the Commonwealth shall not be used for operating and
    maintaining projects constructed pursuant to this chapter or for
    the purchase of culm, rock, or spoil banks;
    (d) Commonwealth responsible for installation and operation of
      projects
      The Commonwealth shall have full responsibility for installing,
    operating, and maintaining projects constructed pursuant to this
    chapter, and shall give evidence, satisfactory to the Secretary of
    the Interior, that it will enforce effective installation,
    operation, and maintenance safeguards;
    (e) Location and operation of projects
      Projects constructed pursuant to this chapter shall be so
    located, operated, and maintained as to provide the maximum
    conservation of anthracite coal resources or, in those instances
    where such work would be in the interest of the public health or
    safety, to seal abandoned coal mines and to fill voids in abandoned
    coal mines, and, where possible, to avoid creating inequities among
    those mines which may be affected by the waters to be controlled
    thereby; and
    (f) Economic justification for abandoned coal mine projects
      Projects for the sealing of abandoned coal mines or the filling
    of voids in abandoned coal mines shall be determined by the
    Secretary of the Interior to be economically justified. The
    Secretary shall not find any project to be economically justified
    unless the potential benefits are estimated by him to exceed the
    estimated cost of the project.

    Sec. 601. Rules and regulations governing disposal of materials;
      payment; removal without charge; lands excluded

-STATUTE-
      The Secretary, under such rules and regulations as he may
    prescribe, may dispose of mineral materials (including but not
    limited to common varieties of the following: sand, stone, gravel,
    pumice, pumicite, cinders, and clay) and vegetative materials
    (including but not limited to yucca, manzanita, mesquite, cactus,
    and timber or other forest products) on public lands of the United
    States, including, for the purposes of this subchapter, land
    described in subchapter V of chapter 28 of title 43, if the
    disposal of such mineral or vegetative materials (1) is not
    otherwise expressly authorized by law, including, but not limited
    to, subchapter I of chapter 8A of title 43, and the United States
    mining laws, and (2) is not expressly prohibited by laws of the
    United States, and (3) would not be detrimental to the public
    interest. Such materials may be disposed of only in accordance with
    the provisions of this subchapter and upon the payment of adequate
    compensation therefor, to be determined by the Secretary: Provided,
    however, That, to the extent not otherwise authorized by law, the
    Secretary is authorized in his discretion to permit any Federal,
    State, or Territorial agency, unit or subdivision, including
    municipalities, or any association or corporation not organized for
    profit, to take and remove, without charge, materials and resources
    subject to this subchapter, for use other than for commercial or
    industrial purposes or resale. Where the lands have been withdrawn
    in aid of a function of a Federal department or agency other than
    the department headed by the Secretary or of a State, Territory,
    county, municipality, water district or other local governmental
    subdivision or agency, the Secretary may make disposals under this
    subchapter only with the consent of such other Federal department
    or agency or of such State, Territory, or local governmental unit.
    Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to apply to lands in
    any national park, or national monument or to any Indian lands, or
    lands set aside or held for the use or benefit of Indians,
    including lands over which jurisdiction has been transferred to the
    Department of the Interior by Executive order for the use of
    Indians. As used in this subchapter, the word "Secretary" means the
    Secretary of the Interior except that it means the Secretary of
    Agriculture where the lands involved are administered by him for
    national forest purposes or for the purposes of title III of the
    Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act [7 U.S.C. 1010 et seq.] or where
    withdrawn for the purpose of any other function of the Department
    of Agriculture.

    Sec. 612. Unpatented mining claims

-STATUTE-
    (a) Prospecting, mining or processing operations
      Any mining claim hereafter located under the mining laws of the
    United States shall not be used, prior to issuance of patent
    therefor, for any purposes other than prospecting, mining or
    processing operations and uses reasonably incident thereto.
    (b) Reservations in the United States to use of the surface and
      surface resources
      Rights under any mining claim hereafter located under the mining
    laws of the United States shall be subject, prior to issuance of
    patent therefor, to the right of the United States to manage and
    dispose of the vegetative surface resources thereof and to manage
    other surface resources thereof (except mineral deposits subject to
    location under the mining laws of the United States). Any such
    mining claim shall also be subject, prior to issuance of patent
    therefor, to the right of the United States, its permittees, and
    licensees, to use so much of the surface thereof as may be
    necessary for such purposes or for access to adjacent land:
    Provided, however, That any use of the surface of any such mining
    claim by the United States, its permittees or licensees, shall be
    such as not to endanger or materially interfere with prospecting,
    mining or processing operations or uses reasonably incident
    thereto: Provided further, That if at any time the locator requires
    more timber for his mining operations than is available to him from
    the claim after disposition of timber therefrom by the United
    States, subsequent to the location of the claim, he shall be
    entitled, free of charge, to be supplied with timber for such
    requirements from the nearest timber administered by the disposing
    agency which is ready for harvesting under the rules and
    regulations of that agency and which is substantially equivalent in
    kind and quantity to the timber estimated by the disposing agency
    to have been disposed of from the claim: Provided further, That
    nothing in this subchapter and sections 601 and 603 of this title
    shall be construed as affecting or intended to affect or in any way
    interfere with or modify the laws of the States which lie wholly or
    in part westward of the ninety-eighth meridian relating to the
    ownership, control, appropriation, use, and distribution of ground
    or surface waters within any unpatented mining claim.
    (c) Severance or removal of timber
      Except to the extent required for the mining claimant's
    prospecting, mining or processing operations and uses reasonably
    incident thereto, or for the construction of buildings or
    structures in connection therewith, or to provide clearance for
    such operations or uses, or to the extent authorized by the United
    States, no claimant of any mining claim hereafter located under the
    mining laws of the United States shall, prior to issuance of patent
    therefor, sever, remove, or use any vegetative or other surface
    resources thereof which are subject to management or disposition by
    the United States under subsection (b) of this section. Any
    severance or removal of timber which is permitted under the
    exceptions of the preceding sentence, other than severance or
    removal to provide clearance, shall be in accordance with sound
    principles of forest management.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 613. Procedure for determining title uncertainties

-STATUTE-
    (a) Notice to mining claimants; request; publication; service
      The head of a Federal department or agency which has the
    responsibility for administering surface resources of any lands
    belonging to the United States may file as to such lands in the
    office of the Secretary of the Interior, or in such office as the
    Secretary of the Interior may designate, a request for publication
    of notice to mining claimants, for determination of surface rights,
    which request shall contain a description of the lands covered
    thereby, showing the section or sections of the public land surveys
    which embrace the lands covered by such request, or if such lands
    are unsurveyed, either the section or sections which would probably
    embrace such lands when the public land surveys are extended to
    such lands or a tie by courses and distances to an approved United
    States mineral monument.
      The filing of such request for publication shall be accompanied
    by an affidavit or affidavits of a person or persons over twenty-
    one years of age setting forth that the affiant or affiants have
    examined the lands involved in a reasonable effort to ascertain
    whether any person or persons were in actual possession of or
    engaged in the working of such lands or any part thereof, and, if
    no person or persons were found to be in actual possession of or
    engaged in the working of said lands or any part thereof on the
    date of such examination, setting forth such fact, or, if any
    person or persons were so found to be in actual possession or
    engaged in such working on the date of such examination, setting
    forth the name and address of each such person, unless affiant
    shall have been unable through reasonable inquiry to obtain
    information as to the name and address of any such person, in which
    event the affidavit shall set forth fully the nature and results of
    such inquiry.
      The filing of such request for publication shall also be
    accompanied by the certificate of a title or abstract company, or
    of a title abstractor, or of an attorney, based upon such company's
    abstractor's, or attorney's examination of those instruments which
    are shown by the tract indexes in the county office of record as
    affecting the lands described in said request, setting forth the
    name of any person disclosed by said instruments to have an
    interest in said lands under any unpatented mining claim heretofore
    located, together with the address of such person if such address
    is disclosed by such instruments of record. "Tract indexes" as used
    herein shall mean those indexes, if any, as to surveyed lands
    identifying instruments as affecting a particular legal subdivision
    of the public land surveys, and as to unsurveyed lands identifying
    instruments as affecting a particular probable legal subdivision
    according to a projected extension of the public land surveys.
      Thereupon the Secretary of the Interior, at the expense of the
    requesting department or agency, shall cause notice to mining
    claimants to be published in a newspaper having general circulation
    in the county in which the lands involved are situate.
      Such notice shall describe the lands covered by such request, as
    provided heretofore, and shall notify whomever it may concern that
    if any person claiming or asserting under, or by virtue of, any
    unpatented mining claim heretofore located, rights as to such lands
    or any part thereof, shall fail to file in the office where such
    request for publication was filed (which office shall be specified
    in such notice) and within one hundred and fifty days from the date
    of the first publication of such notice (which date shall be
    specified in such notice), a verified statement which shall set
    forth, as to such unpatented mining claim - 
        (1) the date of location;
        (2) the book and page of recordation of the notice or
      certificate of location;
        (3) the section or sections of the public land surveys which
      embrace such mining claims; or if such lands are unsurveyed,
      either the section or sections which would probably embrace such
      mining claim when the public land surveys are extended to such
      lands or a tie by courses and distances to an approved United
      States mineral monument;
        (4) whether such claimant is a locator or purchaser under such
      location; and
        (5) the name and address of such claimant and names and
      addresses so far as known to the claimant of any other person or
      persons claiming any interest or interests in or under such
      unpatented mining claim;

    such failure shall be conclusively deemed (i) to constitute a
    waiver and relinquishment by such mining claimant of any right,
    title, or interest under such mining claim contrary to or in
    conflict with the limitations or restrictions specified in section
    612 of this title as to hereafter located unpatented mining claims,
    and (ii) to constitute a consent by such mining claimant that such
    mining claim, prior to issuance of patent therefor, shall be
    subject to the limitations and restrictions specified in section
    612 of this title as to hereafter located unpatented mining claims,
    and (iii) to preclude thereafter, prior to issuance of patent, any
    assertion by such mining claimant of any right or title to or
    interest in or under such mining claim contrary to or in conflict
    with the limitations or restrictions specified in section 612 of
    this title as to hereafter located unpatented mining claims.
      If such notice is published in a daily paper, it shall be
    published in the Wednesday issue for nine consecutive weeks, or, if
    in a weekly paper, in nine consecutive issues, or if in a
    semiweekly or triweekly paper, in the issue of the same day of each
    week for nine consecutive weeks.
      Within fifteen days after the date of first publication of such
    notice, the department or agency requesting such publication (1)
    shall cause a copy of such notice to be personally delivered to or
    to be mailed by registered mail or by certified mail addressed to
    each person in possession or engaged in the working of the land
    whose name and address is shown by an affidavit filed as aforesaid,
    and to each person who may have filed, as to any lands described in
    said notice, a request for notices, as provided in subsection (d)
    of this section, and shall cause a copy of such notice to be mailed
    by registered mail or by certified mail to each person whose name
    and address is set forth in the title or abstract company's or
    title abstractor's or attorney's certificate filed as aforesaid, as
    having an interest in the lands described in said notice under any
    unpatented mining claim heretofore located, such notice to be
    directed to such person's address as set forth in such certificate;
    and (2) shall file in the office where said request for publication
    was filed an affidavit showing that copies have been so delivered
    or mailed.
    (b) Failure to file verified statement
      If any claimant under any unpatented mining claim heretofore
    located which embraces any of the lands described in any notice
    published in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of
    this section, shall fail to file a verified statement, as provided
    in such subsection (a), within one hundred and fifty days from the
    date of the first publication of such notice, such failure shall be
    conclusively deemed, except as otherwise provided in subsection (e)
    of this section, (i) to constitute a waiver and relinquishment by
    such mining claimant of any right, title, or interest under such
    mining claim contrary to or in conflict with the limitations or
    restrictions specified in section 612 of this title as to hereafter
    located unpatented mining claims, and (ii) to constitute a consent
    by such mining claimant that such mining claim, prior to issuance
    of patent therefor, shall be subject to the limitations and
    restrictions specified in section 612 of this title as to hereafter
    located unpatented mining claims, and (iii) to preclude thereafter,
    prior to issuance of patent, any assertion by such mining claimant
    of any right or title to or interest in or under such mining claim
    contrary to or in conflict with the limitations or restrictions
    specified in section 612 of this title as to hereafter located
    unpatented mining claims.
    (c) Hearings
      If any verified statement shall be filed by a mining claimant as
    provided in subsection (a) of this section, then the Secretary of
    Interior shall fix a time and place for a hearing to determine the
    validity and effectiveness of any right or title to, or interest in
    or under such mining claim, which the mining claimant may assert
    contrary to or in conflict with the limitations and restrictions
    specified in section 612 of this title as to hereafter located
    unpatented mining claims, which place of hearing shall be in the
    county where the lands in question or parts thereof are located,
    unless the mining claimant agrees otherwise. Where verified
    statements are filed asserting rights to an aggregate of more than
    twenty mining claims, any single hearing shall be limited to a
    maximum of twenty mining claims unless the parties affected shall
    otherwise stipulate and as many separate hearing (!1) shall be set
    as shall be necessary to comply with this provision. The procedures
    with respect to notice of such a hearing and the conduct thereof,
    and in respect to appeals shall follow the then established general
    procedures and rules of practice of the Department of the Interior
    in respect to contests or protests affecting public lands of the
    United States. If, pursuant to such a hearing the final decision
    rendered in the matter shall affirm the validity and effectiveness
    of any mining claimant's so asserted right or interest under the
    mining claim, then no subsequent proceedings under this section
    shall have any force or effect upon the so-affirmed right or
    interest of such mining claimant under such mining claim. If at any
    time prior to a hearing the department or agency requesting
    publication of notice and any person filing a verified statement
    pursuant to such notice shall so stipulate, then to the extent so
    stipulated, but only to such extent, no hearing shall be held with
    respect to rights asserted under that verified statement, and to
    the extent defined by the stipulation the rights asserted under
    that verified statement shall be deemed to be unaffected by that
    particular published notice.

    (d) Request for copy of notice
      Any person claiming any right under or by virtue of any
    unpatented mining claim heretofore located and desiring to receive
    a copy of any notice to mining claimants which may be published as
    provided in subsection (a) of this section, and which may affect
    lands embraced in such mining claim, may cause to be filed for
    record in the county office of record where the notice or
    certificate of location of such mining claim shall have been
    recorded, a duly acknowledged request for a copy of any such
    notice. Such request for copies shall set forth the name and
    address of the person requesting copies and shall also set forth,
    as to each heretofore located unpatented mining claim under which
    such person asserts rights - 
        (1) the date of location;
        (2) the book and page of the recordation of the notice or
      certificate of location; and
        (3) the section or sections of the public land surveys which
      embrace such mining claim; or if such lands are unsurveyed,
      either the section or sections which would probably embrace such
      mining claim when the public land surveys are extended to such
      lands or a tie by courses and distances to an approved United
      States mineral monument.

    Other than in respect to the requirements of subsection (a) of this
    section as to personal delivery or mailing of copies of notices and
    in respect to the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, no
    such request for copies of published notices and no statement or
    allegation in such request and no recordation thereof shall affect
    title to any mining claim or to any land or be deemed to constitute
    constructive notice to any person that the person requesting copies
    has, or claims, any right, title, or interest in or under any
    mining claim referred to in such request.
    (e) Failure to deliver or mail copy of notice
      If any department or agency requesting publication shall fail to
    comply with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section as
    to the personal delivery or mailing of a copy of notice to any
    person, the publication of such notice shall be deemed wholly
    ineffectual as to that person or as to the rights asserted by that
    person and the failure of that person to file a verified statement,
    as provided in such notice, shall in no manner affect, diminish,
    prejudice or bar any rights of that person.

-STATUTE-

    contrary to or in conflict with the limitations or restrictions
    specified in section 612 of this title as to hereafter located
    unpatented mining claims. The execution and acknowledgment of such
    a waiver and relinquishment by such owner or owners and the
    recordation thereof in the office where the notice or certificate
    of location of such mining claim is of record shall render such
    mining claim thereafter and prior to issuance of patent subject to
    the limitations and restrictions in section 612 of this title in
    all respects as if said mining claim had been located after July
    23, 1955, but no such waiver or relinquishment shall be deemed in
    any manner to constitute any concession as to the date of priority
    of rights under said mining claim or as to the validity thereof.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 621. Entry to lands reserved for power development

-STATUTE-
    (a) Conditions of entry
      All public lands belonging to the United States heretofore, now
    or hereafter withdrawn or reserved for power development or power
    sites shall be open to entry for location and patent of mining
    claims and for mining, development, beneficiation, removal, and
    utilization of the mineral resources of such lands under applicable
    Federal statutes: Provided, That all power rights to such lands
    shall be retained by the United States: Provided further, That
    locations made under this chapter within the revested Oregon and
    California Railroad and reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon grant lands shall
    also be subject to the provisions of the Act of April 8, 1948,
    Public Law 477 (Eightieth Congress, second session): And provided
    further, That nothing contained herein shall be construed to open
    for the purposes described in this section any lands (1) which are
    included in any project operating or being constructed under a
    license or permit issued under the Federal Power Act [16 U.S.C.
    791a et seq.] or other Act of Congress, or (2) which are under
    examination and survey by a prospective licensee of the Federal
    Energy Regulatory Commission, if such prospective licensee holds an
    uncanceled preliminary permit issued under the Federal Power Act
    authorizing him to conduct such examination and survey with respect
    to such lands and such permit has not been renewed in the case of
    such prospective licensee more than once.
    (b) Placer claims; notice; hearing; order; rules and regulations
      The locator of a placer claim under this chapter, however, shall
    conduct no mining operations for a period of sixty days after the
    filing of a notice of location pursuant to section 623 of this
    title. If the Secretary of the Interior, within sixty days from the
    filing of the notice of location, notifies the locator by
    registered mail or certified mail of the Secretary's intention to
    hold a public hearing to determine whether placer mining operations
    would substantially interfere with other uses of the land included
    within the placer claim, mining operations on that claim shall be
    further suspended until the Secretary has held the hearing and has
    issued an appropriate order. The order issued by the Secretary of
    the Interior shall provide for one of the following: (1) a complete
    prohibition of placer mining; (2) a permission to engage in placer
    mining upon the condition that the locator shall, following placer
    operations, restore the surface of the claim to the condition in
    which it was immediately prior to those operations; or (3) a
    general permission to engage in placer mining. No order by the
    Secretary with respect to such operations shall be valid unless a
    certified copy is filed in the same State or county office in which
    the locator's notice of location has been filed in compliance with

      The Secretary shall establish such rules and regulations as he
    deems desirable concerning bonds and deposits with respect to the
    restoration of lands to their condition prior to placer mining
    operations. Moneys received from any bond or deposit shall be used
    for the restoration of the surface of the claim involved, and any
    money received in excess of the amount needed for the restoration
    of the surface of that claim shall be refunded.
    (c) Validity of withdrawals unaffected
      Nothing in this chapter shall affect the validity of withdrawals
    or reservations for purposes other than power development.

    Sec. 642. Exploration contracts

-STATUTE-
    (a) Terms and conditions; interest rates
      In order to carry out the purposes of this chapter, and subject
    to the provisions of this section, the Secretary is authorized to
    enter into exploration contracts with individuals, partnerships,
    corporations, or other legal entities which shall provide for such
    Federal financial participation as he deems in the national
    interest. Such contracts shall contain terms and conditions as the
    Secretary deems necessary and appropriate, including terms and
    conditions for the repayment of the Federal funds made available
    under any contract together with interest thereon, as a royalty on
    the value of the production from the area described in the
    contract. Interest shall be calculated from the date of the loan.
    Such interest shall be at rates which (1) are not less than the
    rates of interest which the Secretary of the Treasury shall
    determine the Department of the Interior would have to pay if it
    borrowed such funds from the Treasury of the United States, taking
    into consideration current average yields on outstanding marketable
    obligations of the United States with maturities comparable to the
    terms of the particular contracts involved and (2) plus 2 per
    centum per annum in lieu of recovering the cost of administering
    the particular contracts.
    (b) Deposit of royalty payments
      Royalty payments received under subsection (a) of this section
    shall be covered into the miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury.
    (c) Certification of exploration projects; payment of royalties;
      time limitation on payment; royalty agreements
      When in the opinion of the Secretary an analysis and evaluation
    of the results of the exploration project disclose that mineral
    production from the area covered by the contract may be possible he
    shall so certify within the time specified in the contract. Upon
    certification, payment of royalties shall be a charge against
    production for the full period specified in the contract or until
    the obligation has been discharged, but in no event shall such
    royalty payments continue for a period of more than twenty-five
    years from the date of contract. When the Secretary determines not
    to certify he shall promptly notify the contractor. When the
    Secretary deems it necessary and in the public interest, he may
    enter into royalty agreements to provide for royalty payments in
    the same manner as though the project had been certified.
    (d) Production
      No provision of this chapter, nor any rule or regulation which
    may be issued by the Secretary shall be construed to require any
    production from the area described in the contract.
    (e) Rules and regulations; adjustment of contracts
      The Secretary shall establish and promulgate such rules and
    regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this
    chapter: Provided, however, That he may modify and adjust the terms
    and conditions of any contract to reduce the amount and term of any
    royalty payment when he shall determine that such action is
    necessary and in the public interest: Provided further, That no
    such single contract shall authorize Government participation in
    excess of $250,000.
    (f) Availability of funds
      No funds shall be made available under this chapter unless the
    applicant shall furnish evidence that funds from commercial sources
    are unavailable on reasonable terms.

      The Secretary of the Interior may convey to any occupant of an
    unpatented mining claim which is determined by the Secretary to be
    invalid an interest, up to and including a fee simple, in and to an
    area within the claim of not more than (a) five acres or (b) the
    acreage actually occupied by him, whichever is less. The Secretary
    may make a like conveyance to any occupant of an unpatented mining
    claim who, after notice from a qualified officer of the United
    States that the claim is believed to be invalid, relinquishes to
    the United States all rights in and to such claim which he may have
    under the mining laws. Any conveyance authorized by this section,
    however, shall be made only to a qualified applicant, as that term
    is defined in section 702 of this title, who applies therefor
    within the period ending June 30, 1971, and upon payment of an
    amount established in accordance with section 705 of this title.
      As used in this section, the term "qualified officer of the
    United States" means the Secretary of the Interior or an employee
    of the Department of the Interior so designated by him: Provided,
    That the Secretary may delegate his authority to designate
    qualified officers to the head of any other department or agency of
    the United States with respect to lands within the administrative
    jurisdiction of that department or agency.

-STATUTE-
      (a) If the Secretary of the Interior determines that conveyance
    of an interest under section 701 of this title is otherwise
    justified but the consent required by section 703 of this title is
    not given, he may, in accordance with such procedural rules and
    regulations as he may prescribe, grant the applicant a right to
    purchase, for residential use, an interest in another tract of
    land, five acres or less in area, from tracts made available by him
    for sale under this chapter (1) from the unappropriated and
    unreserved lands of the United States, or (2) from lands subject to
    classification under section 315f of title 43. Said right shall not
    be granted until arrangements satisfactory to the Secretary have
    been made for termination of the applicant's occupancy of his
    unpatented mining claim and for settlement of any liability for the
    unauthorized use thereof which may have been incurred and shall
    expire five years from the date on which it was granted unless
    sooner exercised. The amount to be paid for the interest shall be
    determined in accordance with section 705 of this title.
      (b) Any conveyance of less than a fee made under this chapter
    shall include provision for removal from the tract of any
    improvements or other property of the applicant at the close of the
    period for which the conveyance is made, or if it be an interest
    terminating on the death of the applicant, within one year
    thereafter.

    be conveyed, exclusive of the value of any improvements placed on
    the lands involved by the applicant or his predecessors in

    applicant for the interest, the Secretary shall take into
    consideration any equities of the applicant and his predecessors in
    interest, including conditions of prior use and occupancy. In any
    event the purchase price for any interest conveyed shall not exceed
    its fair market value nor be less than $5 per acre. The Secretary

-STATUTE-
      (a) The execution of a conveyance as authorized by section 701 of
    this title shall not relieve any occupant of the land conveyed of
    any liability, existing on the date of said conveyance, to the
    United States for unauthorized use of the land in and to which an
    interest is conveyed.
      (b) Except where a mining claim embracing land applied for under
    this chapter by a qualified applicant was located at a time when
    the land included therein was withdrawn or otherwise not subject to
    such location, no trespass charges shall be sought or collected by
    the United States from any qualified applicant who has filed an
    application for land in the mining claim pursuant to this chapter,
    based upon occupancy of such claim, whether residential or
    otherwise, for any period preceding the final administrative
    determination of the invalidity of the mining claim by the
    Secretary of the Interior or the voluntary relinquishment of the
    mining claim, whichever occurs earlier. Nothing contained in this
    chapter shall be construed as creating any liability for trespass
    to the United States which would not exist in the absence of this
    chapter. Relief under this section shall be limited to persons who
    file applications for conveyances pursuant to section 701 of this
    title within the period ending June 30, 1971.

    TITLE 30 - MINERAL LANDS AND MINING
    CHAPTER 22 - MINE SAFETY AND HEALTH

-HEAD-
    Sec. 801. Congressional findings and declaration of purpose

-STATUTE-
      Congress declares that - 
        (a) the first priority and concern of all in the coal or other
      mining industry must be the health and safety of its most
      precious resource - the miner;
        (b) deaths and serious injuries from unsafe and unhealthful
      conditions and practices in the coal or other mines cause grief
      and suffering to the miners and to their families;
        (c) there is an urgent need to provide more effective means and
      measures for improving the working conditions and practices in
      the Nation's coal or other mines in order to prevent death and
      serious physical harm, and in order to prevent occupational
      diseases originating in such mines;
        (d) the existence of unsafe and unhealthful conditions and
      practices in the Nation's coal or other mines is a serious
      impediment to the future growth of the coal or other mining
      industry and cannot be tolerated;
        (e) the operators of such mines with the assistance of the
      miners have the primary responsibility to prevent the existence
      of such conditions and practices in such mines;
        (f) the disruption of production and the loss of income to
      operators and miners as a result of coal or other mine accidents
      or occupationally caused diseases unduly impedes and burdens
      commerce; and
        (g) it is the purpose of this chapter (1) to establish interim
      mandatory health and safety standards and to direct the Secretary
      of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Labor to
      develop and promulgate improved mandatory health or safety
      standards to protect the health and safety of the Nation's coal
      or other miners; (2) to require that each operator of a coal or
      other mine and every miner in such mine comply with such
      standards; (3) to cooperate with, and provide assistance to, the
      States in the development and enforcement of effective State coal
      or other mine health and safety programs; and (4) to improve and
      expand, in cooperation with the States and the coal or other
      mining industry, research and development and training programs
      aimed at preventing coal or other mine accidents and
      occupationally caused diseases in the industry.

    SUBCHAPTER I - GENERAL

-HEAD-
    Sec. 811. Mandatory safety and health standards

-STATUTE-
    (a) Development, promulgation, and revision
      The Secretary shall by rule in accordance with procedures set
    forth in this section and in accordance with section 553 of title 5
    (without regard to any reference in such section to sections 556
    and 557 of such title), develop, promulgate, and revise as may be
    appropriate, improved mandatory health or safety standards for the
    protection of life and prevention of injuries in coal or other
    mines.
      (1) Whenever the Secretary, upon the basis of information
    submitted to him in writing by an interested person, a
    representative of any organization of employers or employees, a
    nationally recognized standards-producing organization, the
    Secretary of Health and Human Services, the National Institute for
    Occupational Safety and Health, or a State or political
    subdivision, or on the basis of information developed by the
    Secretary or otherwise available to him, determines that a rule
    should be promulgated in order to serve the objectives of this
    chapter, the Secretary may request the recommendation of an
    advisory committee appointed under section 812(c) of this title.
    The Secretary shall provide such an advisory committee with any
    proposals of his own or of the Secretary of Health and Human
    Services, together with all pertinent factual information developed
    by the Secretary or the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or
    otherwise available, including the results of research,
    demonstrations, and experiments. An advisory committee shall submit
    to the Secretary its recommendations regarding the rule to be
    promulgated within 60 days from the date of its appointment or
    within such longer or shorter period as may be prescribed by the
    Secretary, but in no event for a period which is longer than 180
    days. When the Secretary receives a recommendation, accompanied by
    appropriate criteria, from the National Institute for Occupational
    Safety and Health that a rule be promulgated, modified, or revoked,
    the Secretary must, within 60 days after receipt thereof, refer
    such recommendation to an advisory committee pursuant to this
    paragraph, or publish such as a proposed rule pursuant to paragraph
    (2), or publish in the Federal Register his determination not to do
    so, and his reasons therefor. The Secretary shall be required to
    request the recommendations of an advisory committee appointed
    under section 812(c) of this title if the rule to be promulgated
    is, in the discretion of the Secretary which shall be final, new in
    effect or application and has significant economic impact.
      (2) The Secretary shall publish a proposed rule promulgating,
    modifying, or revoking a mandatory health or safety standard in the
    Federal Register. If the Secretary determines that a rule should be
    proposed and in connection therewith has appointed an advisory
    committee as provided by paragraph (1), the Secretary shall publish
    a proposed rule, or the reasons for his determination not to
    publish such rule, within 60 days following the submission of the
    advisory committee's recommendation or the expiration of the period
    of time prescribed by the Secretary in such submission. In either
    event, the Secretary shall afford interested persons a period of 30
    days after any such publication to submit written data or comments
    on the proposed rule. Such comment period may be extended by the
    Secretary upon a finding of good cause, which the Secretary shall
    publish in the Federal Register. Publication shall include the text
    of such rules proposed in their entirety, a comparative text of the
    proposed changes in existing rules, and shall include a
    comprehensive index to the rules, cross-referenced by subject
    matter.
      (3) On or before the last day of the period provided for the
    submission of written data or comments under paragraph (2), any
    interested person may file with the Secretary written objections to
    the proposed mandatory health or safety standard, stating the
    grounds therefor and requesting a public hearing on such
    objections. Within 60 days after the last day for filing such
    objections, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a
    notice specifying the mandatory health or safety standard to which
    objections have been filed and a hearing requested, and specifying
    a time and place for such hearing. Any hearing under this
    subsection for the purpose of hearing relevant information shall
    commence within 60 days after the date of publication of the notice
    of hearing. Hearings required by this subsection shall be conducted
    by the Secretary, who may prescribe rules and make rulings
    concerning procedures in such hearings to avoid unnecessary cost or
    delay. Subject to the need to avoid undue delay, the Secretary
    shall provide for procedures that will afford interested parties
    the right to participate in the hearing, including the right to
    present oral statements and to offer written comments and data. The
    Secretary may require by subpoena the attendance of witnesses and
    the production of evidence in connection with any proceeding
    initiated under this section. If a person refuses to obey a
    subpoena under this subsection, a United States district court
    within the jurisdiction of which a proceeding under this subsection
    is conducted may, upon petition by the Secretary, issue an order
    requiring compliance with such subpoena. A transcript shall be
    taken of any such hearing and shall be available to the public.
      (4)(A) Within 90 days after certification of the record of the
    hearing held pursuant to paragraph (3), the Secretary shall by rule
    promulgate, modify, or revoke such mandatory health or safety
    standards, and publish his reasons therefor.
      (B) In the case of a proposed mandatory health or safety standard
    to which objections requesting a public hearing have not been
    filed, the Secretary, within 90 days after the period for filing
    such objections has expired, shall by rule promulgate, modify, or
    revoke such mandatory standards, and publish his reasons therefor.
      (C) In the event the Secretary determines that a proposed
    mandatory health or safety standard should not be promulgated he
    shall, within the times specified in subparagraphs (A) and (B)
    publish his reasons for his determination.
      (5) Any mandatory health or safety standard promulgated as a
    final rule under this section shall be effective upon publication
    in the Federal Register unless the Secretary specifies a later
    date.
      (6)(A) The Secretary, in promulgating mandatory standards dealing
    with toxic materials or harmful physical agents under this
    subsection, shall set standards which most adequately assure on the
    basis of the best available evidence that no miner will suffer
    material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such
    miner has regular exposure to the hazards dealt with by such
    standard for the period of his working life. Development of
    mandatory standards under this subsection shall be based upon
    research, demonstrations, experiments, and such other information
    as may be appropriate. In addition to the attainment of the highest
    degree of health and safety protection for the miner, other
    considerations shall be the latest available scientific data in the
    field, the feasibility of the standards, and experience gained
    under this and other health and safety laws. Whenever practicable,
    the mandatory health or safety standard promulgated shall be
    expressed in terms of objective criteria and of the performance
    desired.
      (B) The Secretary of Health and Human Services, as soon as
    possible after November 9, 1977, but in no event later than 18
    months after such date and on a continuing basis thereafter, shall,
    for each toxic material or harmful physical agent which is used or
    found in a mine, determine whether such material or agent is
    potentially toxic at the concentrations in which it is used or
    found in a mine. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall
    submit such determinations with respect to such toxic substances or
    harmful physical agents to the Secretary. Thereafter, the Secretary
    of Health and Human Services shall submit to the Secretary all
    pertinent criteria regarding any such substances determined to be
    toxic or any such harmful agents as such criteria are developed.
    Within 60 days after receiving any criteria in accordance with the
    preceding sentence relating to a toxic material or harmful physical
    agent which is not adequately covered by a mandatory health or
    safety standard promulgated under this section, the Secretary shall
    either appoint an advisory committee to make recommendations with
    respect to a mandatory health or safety standard covering such
    material or agent in accordance with paragraph (1), or publish a
    proposed rule promulgating such a mandatory health or safety
    standard in accordance with paragraph (2), or shall publish his
    determination not to do so.
      (7) Any mandatory health or safety standard promulgated under
    this subsection shall prescribe the use of labels or other
    appropriate forms of warning as are necessary to insure that miners
    are apprised of all hazards to which they are exposed, relevant
    symptoms and appropriate emergency treatment, and proper conditions
    and precautions of safe use or exposure. Where appropriate, such
    mandatory standard shall also prescribe suitable protective
    equipment and control or technological procedures to be used in
    connection with such hazards and shall provide for monitoring or
    measuring miner exposure at such locations and intervals, and in
    such manner so as to assure the maximum protection of miners. In
    addition, where appropriate, any such mandatory standard shall
    prescribe the type and frequency of medical examinations or other
    tests which shall be made available, by the operator at his cost,
    to miners exposed to such hazards in order to most effectively
    determine whether the health of such miners is adversely affected
    by such exposure. Where appropriate, the mandatory standard shall
    provide that where a determination is made that a miner may suffer
    material impairment of health or functional capacity by reason of
    exposure to the hazard covered by such mandatory standard, that
    miner shall be removed from such exposure and reassigned. Any miner
    transferred as a result of such exposure shall continue to receive
    compensation for such work at no less than the regular rate of pay
    for miners in the classification such miner held immediately prior
    to his transfer. In the event of the transfer of a miner pursuant
    to the preceding sentence, increases in wages of the transferred
    miner shall be based upon the new work classification. In the event
    such medical examinations are in the nature of research, as
    determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, such
    examinations may be furnished at the expense of the Secretary of
    Health and Human Services. The results of examinations or tests
    made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be furnished only to
    the Secretary or the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and,
    at the request of the miner, to his designated physician.
      (8) The Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, promulgate
    separate mandatory health or safety standards applicable to mine
    construction activity on the surface.
      (9) No mandatory health or safety standard promulgated under this
    subchapter shall reduce the protection afforded miners by an
    existing mandatory health or safety standard.
    (b) Emergency temporary mandatory standards
      (1) The Secretary shall provide, without regard to the
    requirements of chapter 5 of title 5 for an emergency temporary
    mandatory health or safety standard to take immediate effect upon
    publication in the Federal Register if he determines (A) that
    miners are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or
    agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful, or to other
    hazards, and (B) that such emergency standard is necessary to
    protect miners from such danger.
      (2) A temporary mandatory health or safety standard shall be
    effective until superseded by a mandatory standard promulgated in
    accordance with the procedures prescribed in paragraph (3) of this
    subsection.
      (3) Upon publication of such standard in the Federal Register,
    the Secretary shall commence a proceeding in accordance with
    subsection (a) of this section, and the standards as published
    shall also serve as a proposed rule for the proceeding. The
    Secretary shall promulgate a mandatory health or safety standard
    under this paragraph no later than nine months after publication of
    the emergency temporary standard as provided in paragraph (2).
    (c) Modification of standards
      Upon petition by the operator or the representative of miners,
    the Secretary may modify the application of any mandatory safety
    standard to a coal or other mine if the Secretary determines that
    an alternative method of achieving the result of such standard
    exists which will at all times guarantee no less than the same
    measure of protection afforded the miners of such mine by such
    standard, or that the application of such standard to such mine
    will result in a diminution of safety to the miners in such mine.
    Upon receipt of such petition the Secretary shall publish notice
    thereof and give notice to the operator or the representative of
    miners in the affected mine, as appropriate, and shall cause such
    investigation to be made as he deems appropriate. Such
    investigation shall provide an opportunity for a public hearing at
    the request of such operator or representative or other interested
    party, to enable the operator or the representative of miners in
    such mine or other interested party to present information relating
    to the modification of such standard. Before granting any exception
    to a mandatory safety standard, the findings of the Secretary or
    his authorized representative shall be made public and shall be
    available to the representative of the miners at the affected mine.
    The Secretary shall issue a decision incorporating his findings of
    fact therein, and send a copy thereof to the operator or the
    representative of the miners, as appropriate. Any such hearing
    shall be of record and shall be subject to section 554 of title 5.
    (d) Judicial review
      Any person who may be adversely affected by a mandatory health or
    safety standard promulgated under this section may, at any time
    prior to the sixtieth day after such standard is promulgated, file
    a petition challenging the validity of such mandatory standard with
    the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
    Circuit or the circuit wherein such person resides or has his
    principal place of business, for a judicial review of such
    standard. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by
    the clerk of the court to the Secretary. The filing of such
    petition shall not, unless otherwise ordered by the court, operate
    as a stay of the standard. No objection that has not been urged
    before the Secretary shall be considered by the court, unless the
    failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused for good
    cause shown. The validity of any mandatory health or safety
    standard shall not be subject to challenge on the grounds that any
    of the time limitations in this section have been exceeded. The
    procedures of this subsection shall be the exclusive means of
    challenging the validity of a mandatory health or safety standard.
    (e) Distribution of copies of proposed standards or regulations
      The Secretary shall send a copy of every proposed mandatory
    health or safety standard or regulation at the time of publication
    in the Federal Register to the operator of each coal or other mine
    and the representative of the miners at such mine and such copy
    shall be immediately posted on the bulletin board of the mine by
    the operator or his agent, but failure to receive such notice shall
    not relieve anyone of the obligation to comply with such standard
    or regulation.

    Sec. 813. Inspections, investigations, and recordkeeping

-STATUTE-
    (a) Purposes; advance notice; frequency; guidelines; right of
      access
      Authorized representatives of the Secretary or the Secretary of
    Health and Human Services shall make frequent inspections and
    investigations in coal or other mines each year for the purpose of
    (1) obtaining, utilizing, and disseminating information relating to
    health and safety conditions, the causes of accidents, and the
    causes of diseases and physical impairments originating in such
    mines, (2) gathering information with respect to mandatory health
    or safety standards, (3) determining whether an imminent danger
    exists, and (4) determining whether there is compliance with the
    mandatory health or safety standards or with any citation, order,
    or decision issued under this subchapter or other requirements of
    this chapter. In carrying out the requirements of this subsection,
    no advance notice of an inspection shall be provided to any person,
    except that in carrying out the requirements of clauses (1) and (2)
    of this subsection, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may
    give advance notice of inspections. In carrying out the
    requirements of clauses (3) and (4) of this subsection, the
    Secretary shall make inspections of each underground coal or other
    mine in its entirety at least four times a year, and of each
    surface coal or other mine in its entirety at least two times a
    year. The Secretary shall develop guidelines for additional
    inspections of mines based on criteria including, but not limited
    to, the hazards found in mines subject to this chapter, and his
    experience under this chapter and other health and safety laws. For
    the purpose of making any inspection or investigation under this
    chapter, the Secretary, or the Secretary of Health and Human
    Services, with respect to fulfilling his responsibilities under
    this chapter, or any authorized representative of the Secretary or
    the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall have a right of
    entry to, upon, or through any coal or other mine.
    (b) Notice and hearing; subpoenas; witnesses; contempt
      For the purpose of making any investigation of any accident or
    other occurrence relating to health or safety in a coal or other
    mine, the Secretary may, after notice, hold public hearings, and
    may sign and issue subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of
    witnesses and the production of relevant papers, books, and
    documents, and administer oaths. Witnesses summoned shall be paid
    the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of
    the United States. In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a
    subpoena served upon any person under this section, the district
    court of the United States for any district in which such person is
    found or resides or transacts business, upon application by the
    United States and after notice to such person, shall have
    jurisdiction to issue an order requiring such person to appear and
    give testimony before the Secretary or to appear and produce
    documents before the Secretary, or both, and any failure to obey
    such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt
    thereof.
    (c) Records of employee exposure to toxic materials or harmful
      physical agents; undue exposure
      The Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of Health and
    Human Services, shall issue regulations requiring operators to
    maintain accurate records of employee exposures to potentially
    toxic materials or harmful physical agents which are required to be
    monitored or measured under any applicable mandatory health or
    safety standard promulgated under this chapter. Such regulations
    shall provide miners or their representatives with an opportunity
    to observe such monitoring or measuring, and to have access to the
    records thereof. Such regulations shall also make appropriate
    provisions for each miner or former miner to have access to such
    records as will indicate his own exposure to toxic materials or
    harmful physical agents. Each operator shall promptly notify any
    miner who has been or is being exposed to toxic materials or
    harmful physical agents in concentrations or at levels which exceed
    those prescribed by an applicable mandatory health or safety
    standard promulgated under section 811 of this title, or mandated
    under subchapter II of this chapter, and shall inform any miner who
    is being thus exposed of the corrective action being taken.
    (d) Accident investigations; records
      All accidents, including unintentional roof falls (except in any
    abandoned panels or in areas which are inaccessible or unsafe for
    inspections), shall be investigated by the operator or his agent to
    determine the cause and the means of preventing a recurrence.
    Records of such accidents and investigations shall be kept and the
    information shall be made available to the Secretary or his
    authorized representative and the appropriate State agency. Such
    records shall be open for inspection by interested persons. Such
    records shall include man-hours worked and shall be reported at a
    frequency determined by the Secretary, but at least annually.
    (e) Collecting information without unreasonable burden on operators
      Any information obtained by the Secretary or by the Secretary of
    Health and Human Services under this chapter shall be obtained in
    such a manner as not to impose an unreasonable burden upon
    operators, especially those operating small businesses, consistent
    with the underlying purposes of this chapter. Unnecessary
    duplication of effort in obtaining information shall be reduced to
    the maximum extent feasible.
    (f) Participation of representatives of operators and miners in
      inspections
      Subject to regulations issued by the Secretary, a representative
    of the operator and a representative authorized by his miners shall
    be given an opportunity to accompany the Secretary or his
    authorized representative during the physical inspection of any
    coal or other mine made pursuant to the provisions of subsection
    (a) of this section, for the purpose of aiding such inspection and
    to participate in pre- or post-inspection conferences held at the
    mine. Where there is no authorized miner representative, the
    Secretary or his authorized representative shall consult with a
    reasonable number of miners concerning matters of health and safety
    in such mine. Such representative of miners who is also an employee
    of the operator shall suffer no loss of pay during the period of
    his participation in the inspection made under this subsection. To
    the extent that the Secretary or authorized representative of the
    Secretary determines that more than one representative from each
    party would further aid the inspection, he can permit each party to
    have an equal number of such additional representatives. However,
    only one such representative of miners who is an employee of the
    operator shall be entitled to suffer no loss of pay during the
    period of such participation under the provisions of this
    subsection. Compliance with this subsection shall not be a
    jurisdictional prerequisite to the enforcement of any provision of
    this chapter.
    (g) Immediate inspection; notice of violation or danger;
      determination
      (1) Whenever a repersentative (!1) of the miners or a miner in
    the case of a coal or other mine where there is no such
    representative has reasonable grounds to believe that a violation
    of this chapter or a mandatory health or safety standard exists, or
    an imminent danger exists, such miner or representative shall have
    a right to obtain an immediate inspection by giving notice to the
    Secretary or his authorized representative of such violation or
    danger. Any such notice shall be reduced to writing, signed by the
    representative of the miners or by the miner, and a copy shall be
    provided the operator or his agent no later than at the time of
    inspection, except that the operator or his agent shall be notified
    forthwith if the complaint indicates that an imminent danger
    exists. The name of the person giving such notice and the names of
    individual miners referred to therein shall not appear in such copy
    or notification. Upon receipt of such notification, a special
    inspection shall be made as soon as possible to determine if such
    violation or danger exists in accordance with the provisions of
    this subchapter. If the Secretary determines that a violation or
    danger does not exist, he shall notify the miner or representative
    of the miners in writing of such determination.

      (2) Prior to or during any inspection of a coal or other mine,
    any representative of miners or a miner in the case of a coal or
    other mine where there is no such representative, may notify the
    Secretary or any representative of the Secretary responsible for
    conducting the inspection, in writing, of any violation of this
    chapter or of any imminent danger which he has reason to believe
    exists in such mine. The Secretary shall, by regulation, establish
    procedures for informal review of any refusal by a representative
    of the Secretary to issue a citation with respect to any such
    alleged violation or order with respect to such danger and shall
    furnish the representative of miners or miner requesting such
    review a written statement of the reasons for the Secretary's final
    disposition of the case.
    (h) Records and reports; compilation and publication; availability
      In addition to such records as are specifically required by this
    chapter, every operator of a coal or other mine shall establish and
    maintain such records, make such reports, and provide such
    information, as the Secretary or the Secretary of Health and Human
    Services may reasonably require from time to time to enable him to
    perform his functions under this chapter. The Secretary or the
    Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to compile,
    analyze, and publish, either in summary or detailed form, such
    reports or information so obtained. Except to the extent otherwise
    specifically provided by this chapter, all records, information,
    reports, findings, citations, notices, orders, or decisions
    required or issued pursuant to or under this chapter may be
    published from time to time, may be released to any interested
    person, and shall be made available for public inspection.
    (i) Spot inspections
      Whenever the Secretary finds that a coal or other mine liberates
    excessive quantities of methane or other explosive gases during its
    operations, or that a methane or other gas ignition or explosion
    has occurred in such mine which resulted in death or serious injury
    at any time during the previous five years, or that there exists in
    such mine some other especially hazardous condition, he shall
    provide a minimum of one spot inspection by his authorized
    representative of all or part of such mine during every five
    working days at irregular intervals. For purposes of this
    subsection, "liberation of excessive quantities of methane or other
    explosive gases" shall mean liberation of more than one million
    cubic feet of methane or other explosive gases during a 24-hour
    period. When the Secretary finds that a coal or other mine
    liberates more than five hundred thousand cubic feet of methane or
    other explosive gases during a 24-hour period, he shall provide a
    minimum of one spot inspection by his authorized representative of
    all or part of such mine every 10 working days at irregular
    intervals. When the Secretary finds that a coal or other mine
    liberates more than two hundred thousand cubic feet of methane or
    other explosive gases during a 24-hour period, he shall provide a
    minimum of one spot inspection by his authorized representative of
    all or part of such mine every 15 working days at irregular
    intervals.
    (j) Accident notification; rescue and recovery activities
      In the event of any accident occurring in any coal or other mine,
    the operator shall notify the Secretary thereof and shall take
    appropriate measures to prevent the destruction of any evidence
    which would assist in investigating the cause or causes thereof.
    For purposes of the preceding sentence, the notification required
    shall be provided by the operator within 15 minutes of the time at
    which the operator realizes that the death of an individual at the
    mine, or an injury or entrapment of an individual at the mine which
    has a reasonable potential to cause death, has occurred. In the
    event of any accident occurring in a coal or other mine, where
    rescue and recovery work is necessary, the Secretary or an
    authorized representative of the Secretary shall take whatever
    action he deems appropriate to protect the life of any person, and
    he may, if he deems it appropriate, supervise and direct the rescue
    and recovery activities in such mine.
    (k) Safety orders; recovery plans
      In the event of any accident occurring in a coal or other mine,
    an authorized representative of the Secretary, when present, may
    issue such orders as he deems appropriate to insure the safety of
    any person in the coal or other mine, and the operator of such mine
    shall obtain the approval of such representative, in consultation
    with appropriate State representatives, when feasible, of any plan
    to recover any person in such mine or to recover the coal or other
    mine or return affected areas of such mine to normal.

    CHAPTER 22 - MINE SAFETY AND HEALTH
    SUBCHAPTER I - GENERAL

-HEAD-
    Sec. 814. Citations and orders

-STATUTE-
    (a) Issuance and form of citations; prompt issuance
      If, upon inspection or investigation, the Secretary or his
    authorized representative believes that an operator of a coal or
    other mine subject to this chapter has violated this chapter, or
    any mandatory health or safety standard, rule, order, or regulation
    promulgated pursuant to this chapter, he shall, with reasonable
    promptness, issue a citation to the operator. Each citation shall
    be in writing and shall describe with particularity the nature of
    the violation, including a reference to the provision of the
    chapter, standard, rule, regulation, or order alleged to have been
    violated. In addition, the citation shall fix a reasonable time for
    the abatement of the violation. The requirement for the issuance of
    a citation with reasonable promptness shall not be a jurisdictional
    prerequisite to the enforcement of any provision of this chapter.
    (b) Follow-up inspections; findings
      If, upon any follow-up inspection of a coal or other mine, an
    authorized representative of the Secretary finds (1) that a
    violation described in a citation issued pursuant to subsection (a)
    of this section has not been totally abated within the period of
    time as originally fixed therein or as subsequently extended, and
    (2) that the period of time for the abatement should not be further
    extended, he shall determine the extent of the area affected by the
    violation and shall promptly issue an order requiring the operator
    of such mine or his agent to immediately cause all persons, except
    those persons referred to in subsection (c) of this section, to be
    withdrawn from, and to be prohibited from entering, such area until
    an authorized representative of the Secretary determines that such
    violation has been abated.
    (c) Exempt persons
      The following persons shall not be required to be withdrawn from,
    or prohibited from entering, any area of the coal or other mine
    subject to an order issued under this section:
        (1) any person whose presence in such area is necessary, in the
      judgment of the operator or an authorized representative of the
      Secretary, to eliminate the condition described in the order;
        (2) any public official whose official duties require him to
      enter such area;
        (3) any representative of the miners in such mine who is, in
      the judgment of the operator or an authorized representative of
      the Secretary, qualified to make such mine examinations or who is
      accompanied by such a person and whose presence in such area is
      necessary for the investigation of the conditions described in
      the order; and
        (4) any consultant to any of the foregoing.
    (d) Findings of violations; withdrawal order
      (1) If, upon any inspection of a coal or other mine, an
    authorized representative of the Secretary finds that there has
    been a violation of any mandatory health or safety standard, and if
    he also finds that, while the conditions created by such violation
    do not cause imminent danger, such violation is of such nature as
    could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and
    effect of a coal or other mine safety or health hazard, and if he
    finds such violation to be caused by an unwarrantable failure of
    such operator to comply with such mandatory health or safety
    standards, he shall include such finding in any citation given to
    the operator under this chapter. If, during the same inspection or
    any subsequent inspection of such mine within 90 days after the
    issuance of such citation, an authorized representative of the
    Secretary finds another violation of any mandatory health or safety
    standard and finds such violation to be also caused by an
    unwarrantable failure of such operator to so comply, he shall
    forthwith issue an order requiring the operator to cause all
    persons in the area affected by such violation, except those
    persons referred to in subsection (c) of this section to be
    withdrawn from, and to be prohibited from entering, such area until
    an authorized representative of the Secretary determines that such
    violation has been abated.
      (2) If a withdrawal order with respect to any area in a coal or
    other mine has been issued pursuant to paragraph (1), a withdrawal
    order shall promptly be issued by an authorized representative of
    the Secretary who finds upon any subsequent inspection the
    existence in such mine of violations similar to those that resulted
    in the issuance of the withdrawal order under paragraph (1) until
    such time as an inspection of such mine discloses no similar
    violations. Following an inspection of such mine which discloses no
    similar violations, the provisions of paragraph (1) shall again be
    applicable to that mine.
    (e) Pattern of violations; abatement; termination of pattern
      (1) If an operator has a pattern of violations of mandatory
    health or safety standards in the coal or other mine which are of
    such nature as could have significantly and substantially
    contributed to the cause and effect of coal or other mine health or
    safety hazards, he shall be given written notice that such pattern
    exists. If, upon any inspection within 90 days after the issuance
    of such notice, an authorized representative of the Secretary finds
    any violation of a mandatory health or safety standard which could
    significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect
    of a coal or other mine safety or health hazard, the authorized
    representative shall issue an order requiring the operator to cause
    all persons in the area affected by such violation, except those
    persons referred to in subsection (c) of this section, to be
    withdrawn from, and to be prohibited from entering, such area until
    an authorized representative of the Secretary determines that such
    violation has been abated.
      (2) If a withdrawal order with respect to any area in a coal or
    other mine has been issued pursuant to paragraph (1), a withdrawal
    order shall be issued by an authorized representative of the
    Secretary who finds upon any subsequent inspection the existence in
    such mine of any violation of a mandatory health or safety standard
    which could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause
    and effect of a coal or other mine health or safety hazard. The
    withdrawal order shall remain in effect until an authorized
    representative of the Secretary determines that such violation has
    been abated.
      (3) If, upon an inspection of the entire coal or other mine, an
    authorized representative of the Secretary finds no violations of
    mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and
    substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a coal or other
    mine health and safety hazard, the pattern of violations that
    resulted in the issuance of a notice under paragraph (1) shall be
    deemed to be terminated and the provisions of paragraphs (1) and
    (2) shall no longer apply. However, if as a result of subsequent
    violations, the operator reestablishes a pattern of violations,
    paragraphs (1) and (2) shall again be applicable to such operator.
      (4) The Secretary shall make such rules as he deems necessary to
    establish criteria for determining when a pattern of violations of
    mandatory health or safety standards exists.
    (f) Respirable dust concentrations; dust control person or team
      If, based upon samples taken, analyzed, and recorded pursuant to
    section 842(a) of this title, or samples taken during an inspection
    by an authorized representative of the Secretary, the applicable
    limit on the concentration of respirable dust required to be
    maintained under this chapter is exceeded and thereby violated, the
    Secretary or his authorized representative shall issue a citation
    fixing a reasonable time for the abatement of the violation. During
    such time, the operator of the mine shall cause samples described
    in section 842(a) of this title to be taken of the affected area
    during each production shift. If, upon the expiration of the period
    of time as originally fixed or subsequently extended, the Secretary
    or his authorized representative finds that the period of time
    should not be further extended, he shall determine the extent of
    the area affected by the violation and shall promptly issue an
    order requiring the operator of such mine or his agent to cause
    immediately all persons, except those referred to in subsection (c)
    of this section, to be withdrawn from, and to be prohibited from
    entering, such area until the Secretary or his authorized
    representative has reason to believe, based on actions taken by the
    operator, that such limit will be complied with upon the resumption
    of production in such mine. As soon as possible after an order is
    issued, the Secretary, upon request of the operator, shall dispatch
    to the mine involved a person, or team of persons, to the extent
    such persons are available, who are knowledgeable in the methods
    and means of controlling and reducing respirable dust. Such person
    or team of persons shall remain at the mine involved for such time
    as they shall deem appropriate to assist the operator in reducing
    respirable dust concentrations. While at the mine, such persons may
    require the operator to take such actions as they deem appropriate
    to insure the health of any person in the coal or other mine.
    (g) Untrained miners
      (1) If, upon any inspection or investigation pursuant to section
    813 of this title, the Secretary or an authorized representative
    shall find employed at a coal or other mine a miner who has not
    received the requisite safety training as determined under section
    825 of this title, the Secretary or an authorized representative
    shall issue an order under this section which declares such miner
    to be a hazard to himself and to others, and requiring that such
    miner be immediately withdrawn from the coal or other mine, and be
    prohibited from entering such mine until an authorized
    representative of the Secretary determines that such miner has
    received the training required by section 825 of this title.
      (2) No miner who is ordered withdrawn from a coal or other mine
    under paragraph (1) shall be discharged or otherwise discriminated
    against because of such order; and no miner who is ordered
    withdrawn from a coal or other mine under paragraph (1) shall
    suffer a loss of compensation during the period necessary for such
    miner to receive such training and for an authorized representative
    of the Secretary to determine that such miner has received the
    requisite training.
    (h) Duration of citations and orders
      Any citation or order issued under this section shall remain in
    effect until modified, terminated or vacated by the Secretary or
    his authorized representative, or modified, terminated or vacated
    by the Commission or the courts pursuant to section 815 or 816 of
    this title.

    Sec. 815. Procedure for enforcement

-STATUTE-
    (a) Notification of civil penalty; contest
      If, after an inspection or investigation, the Secretary issues a
    citation or order under section 814 of this title, he shall, within
    a reasonable time after the termination of such inspection or
    investigation, notify the operator by certified mail of the civil
    penalty proposed to be assessed under section 820(a) of this title
    for the violation cited and that the operator has 30 days within
    which to notify the Secretary that he wishes to contest the
    citation or proposed assessment of penalty. A copy of such
    notification shall be sent by mail to the representative of miners
    in such mine. If, within 30 days from the receipt of the
    notification issued by the Secretary, the operator fails to notify
    the Secretary that he intends to contest the citation or the
    proposed assessment of penalty, and no notice is filed by any miner
    or representative of miners under subsection (d) of this section
    within such time, the citation and the proposed assessment of
    penalty shall be deemed a final order of the Commission and not
    subject to review by any court or agency. Refusal by the operator
    or his agent to accept certified mail containing a citation and
    proposed assessment of penalty under this subsection shall
    constitute receipt thereof within the meaning of this subsection.
    (b) Failure of operator to correct violation; notification;
      contest; temporary relief
      (1)(A) If the Secretary has reason to believe that an operator
    has failed to correct a violation for which a citation has been
    issued within the period permitted for its correction, the
    Secretary shall notify the operator by certified mail of such
    failure and of the penalty proposed to be assessed under section
    820(b) of this title by reason of such failure and that the
    operator has 30 days within which to notify the Secretary that he
    wishes to contest the Secretary's notification of the proposed
    assessment of penalty. A copy of such notification of the proposed
    assessment of penalty shall at the same time be sent by mail to the
    representative of the mine employees. If, within 30 days from the
    receipt of notification of proposed assessment of penalty issued by
    the Secretary, the operator fails to notify the Secretary that he
    intends to contest the notification of proposed assessment of
    penalty, such notification shall be deemed a final order of the
    Commission and not subject to review by any court or agency.
    Refusal by the operator or his agent to accept certified mail
    containing a notification of proposed assessment of penalty issued
    under this subsection shall constitute receipt thereof within the
    meaning of this subsection.
      (B) In determining whether to propose a penalty to be assessed
    under section 820(b) of this title, the Secretary shall consider
    the operator's history of previous violations, the appropriateness
    of such penalty to the size of the business of the operator
    charged, whether the operator was negligent, the effect on the
    operator's ability to continue in business, the gravity of the
    violation, and the demonstrated good faith of the operator charged
    in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notification of a
    violation.
      (2) An applicant may file with the Commission a written request
    that the Commission grant temporary relief from any modification or
    termination of any order or from any order issued under section 814
    of this title together with a detailed statement giving the reasons
    for granting such relief. The Commission may grant such relief
    under such conditions as it may prescribe, if - 
        (A) a hearing has been held in which all parties were given an
      opportunity to be heard;
        (B) the applicant shows that there is substantial likelihood
      that the findings of the Commission will be favorable to the
      applicant; and
        (C) such relief will not adversely affect the health and safety
      of miners.

    No temporary relief shall be granted in the case of a citation
    issued under subsection (a) or (f) of section 814 of this title.
    The Commission shall provide a procedure for expedited
    consideration of applications for temporary relief under this
    paragraph.
    (c) Discrimination or interference prohibited; complaint;
      investigation; determination; hearing
      (1) No person shall discharge or in any manner discriminate
    against or cause to be discharged or cause discrimination against
    or otherwise interfere with the exercise of the statutory rights of
    any miner, representative of miners or applicant for employment in
    any coal or other mine subject to this chapter because such miner,
    representative of miners or applicant for employment has filed or
    made a complaint under or related to this chapter, including a
    complaint notifying the operator or the operator's agent, or the
    representative of the miners at the coal or other mine of an
    alleged danger or safety or health violation in a coal or other
    mine, or because such miner, representative of miners or applicant
    for employment is the subject of medical evaluations and potential
    transfer under a standard published pursuant to section 811 of this
    title or because such miner, representative of miners or applicant
    for employment has instituted or caused to be instituted any
    proceeding under or related to this chapter or has testified or is
    about to testify in any such proceeding, or because of the exercise
    by such miner, representative of miners or applicant for employment
    on behalf of himself or others of any statutory right afforded by
    this chapter.
      (2) Any miner or applicant for employment or representative of
    miners who believes that he has been discharged, interfered with,
    or otherwise discriminated against by any person in violation of
    this subsection may, within 60 days after such violation occurs,
    file a complaint with the Secretary alleging such discrimination.
    Upon receipt of such complaint, the Secretary shall forward a copy
    of the complaint to the respondent and shall cause such
    investigation to be made as he deems appropriate. Such
    investigation shall commence within 15 days of the Secretary's
    receipt of the complaint, and if the Secretary finds that such
    complaint was not frivolously brought, the Commission, on an
    expedited basis upon application of the Secretary, shall order the
    immediate reinstatement of the miner pending final order on the
    complaint. If upon such investigation, the Secretary determines
    that the provisions of this subsection have been violated, he shall
    immediately file a complaint with the Commission, with service upon
    the alleged violator and the miner, applicant for employment, or
    representative of miners alleging such discrimination or
    interference and propose an order granting appropriate relief. The
    Commission shall afford an opportunity for a hearing (in accordance
    with section 554 of title 5 but without regard to subsection (a)(3)
    of such section) and thereafter shall issue an order, based upon
    findings of fact, affirming, modifying, or vacating the Secretary's
    proposed order, or directing other appropriate relief. Such order
    shall become final 30 days after its issuance. The Commission shall
    have authority in such proceedings to require a person committing a
    violation of this subsection to take such affirmative action to
    abate the violation as the Commission deems appropriate, including,
    but not limited to, the rehiring or reinstatement of the miner to
    his former position with back pay and interest. The complaining
    miner, applicant, or representative of miners may present
    additional evidence on his own behalf during any hearing held
    pursuant to his (!1) paragraph.

      (3) Within 90 days of the receipt of a complaint filed under
    paragraph (2), the Secretary shall notify, in writing, the miner,
    applicant for employment, or representative of miners of his
    determination whether a violation has occurred. If the Secretary,
    upon investigation, determines that the provisions of this
    subsection have not been violated, the complainant shall have the
    right, within 30 days of notice of the Secretary's determination,
    to file an action in his own behalf before the Commission, charging
    discrimination or interference in violation of paragraph (1). The
    Commission shall afford an opportunity for a hearing (in accordance
    with section 554 of title 5 but without regard to subsection (a)(3)
    of such section), and thereafter shall issue an order, based upon
    findings of fact, dismissing or sustaining the complainant's
    charges and, if the charges are sustained, granting such relief as
    it deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, an order
    requiring the rehiring or reinstatement of the miner to his former
    position with back pay and interest or such remedy as may be
    appropriate. Such order shall become final 30 days after its
    issuance. Whenever an order is issued sustaining the complainant's
    charges under this subsection, a sum equal to the aggregate amount
    of all costs and expenses (including attorney's fees) as determined
    by the Commission to have been reasonably incurred by the miner,
    applicant for employment or representative of miners for, or in
    connection with, the institution and prosecution of such
    proceedings shall be assessed against the person committing such
    violation. Proceedings under this section shall be expedited by the
    Secretary and the Commission. Any order issued by the Commission
    under this paragraph shall be subject to judicial review in
    accordance with section 816 of this title. Violations by any person
    of paragraph (1) shall be subject to the provisions of sections 818
    and 820(a) of this title.
    (d) Contest proceedings; hearing; findings of fact; affirmance,
      modification, or vacatur of citation, order, or proposed penalty;
      procedure before Commission
      If, within 30 days of receipt thereof, an operator of a coal or
    other mine notifies the Secretary that he intends to contest the
    issuance or modification of an order issued under section 814 of
    this title, or citation or a notification of proposed assessment of
    a penalty issued under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, or
    the reasonableness of the length of abatement time fixed in a
    citation or modification thereof issued under section 814 of this
    title, or any miner or representative of miners notifies the
    Secretary of an intention to contest the issuance, modification, or
    termination of any order issued under section 814 of this title, or
    the reasonableness of the length of time set for abatement by a
    citation or modification thereof issued under section 814 of this
    title, the Secretary shall immediately advise the Commission of
    such notification, and the Commission shall afford an opportunity
    for a hearing (in accordance with section 554 of title 5, but
    without regard to subsection (a)(3) of such section), and
    thereafter shall issue an order, based on findings of fact,
    affirming, modifying, or vacating the Secretary's citation, order,
    or proposed penalty, or directing other appropriate relief. Such
    order shall become final 30 days after its issuance. The rules of
    procedure prescribed by the Commission shall provide affected
    miners or representatives of affected miners an opportunity to
    participate as parties to hearings under this section. The
    Commission shall take whatever action is necessary to expedite
    proceedings for hearing appeals of orders issued under section 814
    of this title.

    Sec. 816. Judicial review of Commission orders

-STATUTE-
    (a) Petition by person adversely affected or aggrieved; temporary
      relief
      (1) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order of the
    Commission issued under this chapter may obtain a review of such
    order in any United States court of appeals for the circuit in
    which the violation is alleged to have occurred or in the United
    States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, by
    filing in such court within 30 days following the issuance of such
    order a written petition praying that the order be modified or set
    aside. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by
    the clerk of the court to the Commission and to the other parties,
    and thereupon the Commission shall file in the court the record in
    the proceeding as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon such
    filing, the court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of the
    proceeding and of the questions determined therein, and shall have
    the power to make and enter upon the pleadings, testimony, and
    proceedings set forth in such record a decree affirming, modifying,
    or setting aside, in whole or in part, the order of the Commission
    and enforcing the same to the extent that such order is affirmed or
    modified. No objection that has not been urged before the
    Commission shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or
    neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of
    extraordinary circumstances. The findings of the Commission with
    respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence
    on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive. If any
    party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional
    evidence and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such
    additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable
    grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the hearing
    before the Commission, the court may order such additional evidence
    to be taken before the Commission and to be made a part of the
    record. The Commission may modify its findings as to the facts, or
    make new findings, by reason of additional evidence so taken and
    filed, and it shall file such modified or new findings, which
    findings with respect to questions of fact, if supported by
    substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be
    conclusive. The Commission may modify or set aside its original
    order by reason of such modified or new findings of fact. Upon the
    filing of the record after such remand proceedings, the
    jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and its judgment and
    degree shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to
    review by the Supreme Court of the United States, as provided in
    section 1254 of title 28.
      (2) In the case of a proceeding to review any order or decision
    issued by the Commission under this chapter, except an order or
    decision pertaining to an order issued under section 817(a) of this
    title or an order or decision pertaining to a citation issued under
    section 814(a) or (f) of this title, the court may, under such
    conditions as it may prescribe, grant such temporary relief as it
    deems appropriate pending final determination of the proceeding, if
    - 
        (A) all parties to the proceeding have been notified and given
      an opportunity to be heard on a request for temporary relief;
        (B) the person requesting such relief shows that there is a
      substantial likelihood that he will prevail on the merits of the
      final determination of the proceeding; and
        (C) such relief will not adversely affect the health and safety
      of miners in the coal or other mine.

      (3) In the case of a proceeding to review any order or decision
    issued by the Panel under this chapter, the court may, under such
    conditions as it may prescribe, grant such temporary relief as it
    deems appropriate pending final determination of the proceeding, if
    - 
        (A) all parties to the proceeding have been notified and given
      an opportunity to be heard on a request for temporary relief; and
        (B) the person requesting such relief shows that there is a
      substantial likelihood that he will prevail on the merits of the
      final determination of the proceeding.
    (b) Petition by Secretary for review or enforcement of final
      Commission orders
      The Secretary may also obtain review or enforcement of any final
    order of the Commission by filing a petition for such relief in the
    United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the alleged
    violation occurred or in the Court of Appeals for the District of
    Columbia Circuit, and the provisions of subsection (a) shall govern
    such proceedings to the extent applicable. If no petition for
    review, as provided in subsection (a) of this section, is filed
    within 30 days after issuance of the Commission's order, the
    Commission's findings of fact and order shall be conclusive in
    connection with any petition for enforcement which is filed by the
    Secretary after the expiration of such 30-day period. In any such
    case, as well as in the case of a noncontested citation or
    notification by the Secretary which has become a final order of the
    Commission under subsection (a) or (b) of section 815 of this
    title, the clerk of the court, unless otherwise ordered by the
    court, shall forthwith enter a decree enforcing the order and shall
    transmit a copy of such decree to the Secretary and the operator
    named in the petition. In any contempt proceeding brought to
    enforce a decree of a court of appeals entered pursuant to this
    subsection or subsection (a) of this section, the court of appeals
    may assess the penalties provided in section 820 of this title, in
    addition to invoking any other available remedies.
    (c) Stay of order or decision of Commission or Panel
      The commencement of a proceeding under this section shall not,
    unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the
    order or decision of the Commission or the Panel.

    Sec. 817. Procedures to counteract dangerous conditions

-STATUTE-
    (a) Withdrawal orders
      If, upon any inspection or investigation of a coal or other mine
    which is subject to this chapter, an authorized representative of
    the Secretary finds that an imminent danger exists, such
    representative shall determine the extent of the area of such mine
    throughout which the danger exists, and issue an order requiring
    the operator of such mine to cause all persons, except those
    referred to in section 814(c) of this title, to be withdrawn from,
    and to be prohibited from entering, such area until an authorized
    representative of the Secretary determines that such imminent
    danger and the conditions or practices which caused such imminent
    danger no longer exist. The issuance of an order under this
    subsection shall not preclude the issuance of a citation under
    section 814 of this title or the proposing of a penalty under
    section 820 of this title.
    (b) Notice to mine operators; further investigation; findings and
      decision by Secretary
      (1) If, upon any inspection of a coal or other mine, an
    authorized representative of the Secretary finds (A) that
    conditions exist therein which have not yet resulted in an imminent
    danger, (B) that such conditions cannot be effectively abated
    through the use of existing technology, and (C) that reasonable
    assurance cannot be provided that the continuance of mining
    operations under such conditions will not result in an imminent
    danger, he shall determine the area throughout which such
    conditions exist, and thereupon issue a notice to the operator of
    the mine or his agent of such conditions, and shall file a copy
    thereof, incorporating his findings therein, with the Secretary and
    with the representative of the miners of such mine. Upon receipt of
    such copy, the Secretary shall cause such further investigation to
    be made as he deems appropriate, including an opportunity for the
    operator or a representative of the miners to present information
    relating to such notice.
      (2) Upon the conclusion of an investigation pursuant to paragraph
    (1), and an opportunity for a public hearing upon request by any
    interested party, the Secretary shall make findings of fact, and
    shall by decision incorporating such findings therein, either
    cancel the notice issued under this subsection or issue an order
    requiring the operator of such mine to cause all persons in the
    area affected, except those persons referred to in subsection (c)
    of section 814 of this title to be withdrawn from, and be
    prohibited from entering, such area until the Secretary, after a
    public hearing affording all interested persons an opportunity to
    present their views, determines that such conditions have been
    abated. Any hearing under this paragraph shall be of record and
    shall be subject to section 554 of title 5.
    (c) Form and content of orders
      Orders issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall
    contain a detailed description of the conditions or practices which
    cause and constitute an imminent danger and a description of the
    area of the coal or other mine from which persons must be withdrawn
    and prohibited from entering.
    (d) Findings; duration of orders
      Each finding made and order issued under this section shall be
    given promptly to the operator of the coal or other mine to which
    it pertains by the person making such finding or order, and all of
    such findings and orders shall be in writing, and shall be signed
    by the person making them. Any order issued pursuant to subsection
    (a) of this section may be modified or terminated by an authorized
    representative of the Secretary. Any order issued under subsection
    (a) or (b) of this section shall remain in effect until vacated,
    modified, or terminated by the Secretary, or modified or vacated by
    the Commission pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, or by
    the courts pursuant to section 816(a) of this title.
    (e) Reinstatement, modification, and vacatur of orders
      (1) Any operator notified of an order under this section or any
    representative of miners notified of the issuance, modification, or
    termination of such an order may apply to the Commission within 30
    days of such notification for reinstatement, modification or
    vacation of such order. The Commission shall forthwith afford an
    opportunity for a hearing (in accordance with section 554 of title
    5 but without regard to subsection (a)(3) of such section) and
    thereafter shall issue an order, based upon findings of fact,
    vacating, affirming, modifying, or terminating the Secretary's
    order. The Commission and the courts may not grant temporary relief
    from the issuance of any order under subsection (a) of this
    section.
      (2) The Commission shall take whatever action is necessary to
    expedite proceedings under this subsection.

    Sec. 818. Injunctions

-STATUTE-
    (a) Civil action by Secretary
      (1) The Secretary may institute a civil action for relief,
    including a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order,
    or any other appropriate order in the district court of the United
    States for the district in which a coal or other mine is located or
    in which the operator of such mine has his principal office,
    whenever such operator or his agent - 
        (A) violates or fails or refuses to comply with any order or
      decision issued under this chapter, or fails or refuses to comply
      with any order or decision, including a civil penalty assessment
      order, that is issued under this chapter,
        (B) interferes with, hinders, or delays the Secretary or his
      authorized representative, or the Secretary of Health and Human
      Services or his authorized representative, in carrying out the
      provisions of this chapter,
        (C) refuses to admit such representatives to the coal or other
      mine,
        (D) refuses to permit the inspection of the coal or other mine,
      or the investigation of an accident or occupational disease
      occurring in, or connected with, such mine,
        (E) refuses to furnish any information or report requested by
      the Secretary or the Secretary of Health and Human Services in
      furtherance of the provisions of this chapter, or
        (F) refuses to permit access to, and copying of, such records
      as the Secretary or the Secretary of Health and Human Services
      determines necessary in carrying out the provisions of this
      chapter.

      (2) The Secretary may institute a civil action for relief,
    including permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or
    any other appropriate order in the district court of the United
    States for the district in which the coal or other mine is located
    or in which the operator of such mine has his principal office
    whenever the Secretary believes that the operator of a coal or
    other mine is engaged in a pattern of violation of the mandatory
    health or safety standards of this chapter, which in the judgment
    of the Secretary constitutes a continuing hazard to the health or
    safety of miners.
    (b) Jurisdiction; relief; findings of Commission or Secretary
      In any action brought under subsection (a) of this section, the
    court shall have jurisdiction to provide such relief as may be
    appropriate. In the case of an action under subsection (a)(2) of
    this section, the court shall in its order require such assurance
    or affirmative steps as it deems necessary to assure itself that
    the protection afforded to miners under this chapter shall be
    provided by the operator. Temporary restraining orders shall be
    issued in accordance with rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil
    Procedure, as amended, except that the time limit in such orders,
    when issued without notice, shall be seven days from the date of
    entry. Except as otherwise provided herein, any relief granted by
    the court to enforce any order under paragraph (1) of subsection
    (a) of this section shall continue in effect until the completion
    or final termination of all proceedings for review of such order
    under this subchapter, unless prior thereto, the district court
    granting such relief sets it aside or modifies it. In any action
    instituted under this section to enforce an order or decision
    issued by the Commission or the Secretary after a public hearing in
    accordance with section 554 of title 5, the findings of the
    Commission or the Secretary, as the case may be, if supported by
    substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be
    conclusive.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Mine office; bulletin board
      At each coal or other mine there shall be maintained an office
    with a conspicuous sign designating it as the office of such mine.
    There shall be a bulletin board at such office or located at a
    conspicuous place near an entrance of such mine, in such manner
    that orders, citations, notices and decisions required by law or
    regulation to be posted, may be posted thereon, and be easily
    visible to all persons desiring to read them, and be protected
    against damage by weather and against unauthorized removal. A copy
    of any order, citation, notice or decision required by this chapter
    to be given to an operator shall be delivered to the office of the
    affected mine, and a copy shall be immediately posted on the
    bulletin board of such mine by the operator or his agent.
    (b) Distribution of orders, citations, notices, and decisions
      The Secretary shall (1) cause a copy of any order, citation,
    notice, or decision required by this chapter to be given to an
    operator to be mailed immediately to a representative of the miners
    in the affected coal or other mine, and (2) cause a copy thereof to
    be mailed to the public official or agency of the State charged
    with administering State laws, if any, relating to health or safety
    in such mine. Such notice, order, citation, or decision shall be
    available for public inspection.
    (c) Compliance
      In order to insure prompt compliance with any notice, order,
    citation, or decision issued under this chapter, the authorized
    representative of the Secretary may deliver such notice, order,
    citation, or decision to an agent of the operator, and such agent
    shall immediately take appropriate measures to insure compliance
    with such notice, order, citation, or decision.
    (d) Filing; designation of health and safety officers
      Each operator of a coal or other mine subject to this chapter
    shall file with the Secretary the name and address of such mine and
    the name and address of the person who controls or operates the
    mine. Any revisions in such names or addresses shall be promptly
    filed with the Secretary. Each operator of a coal or other mine
    subject to this chapter shall designate a responsible official at
    such mine as the principal officer in charge of health and safety
    at such mine, and such official shall receive a copy of any notice,
    order, citation, or decision issued under this chapter affecting
    such mine. In any case where the mine is subject to the control of
    any person not directly involved in the daily operations of the
    coal or other mine, there shall be filed with the Secretary the
    name and address of such person and the name and address of a
    principal official of such person who shall have overall
    responsibility for the conduct of an effective health and safety
    program at any coal or other mine subject to the control of such
    person, and such official shall receive a copy of any notice,
    order, citation, or decision issued affecting any such mine. The
    mere designation of a health and safety official under this
    subsection shall not be construed as making such official subject
    to any penalty under this chapter.

    Sec. 820. Penalties

-STATUTE-
    (a) Civil penalty for violation of mandatory health or safety
      standards
       (1) The operator of a coal or other mine in which a violation
    occurs of a mandatory health or safety standard or who violates any
    other provision of this chapter, shall be assessed a civil penalty
    by the Secretary which penalty shall not be more than $50,000 for
    each such violation. Each occurrence of a violation of a mandatory
    health or safety standard may constitute a separate offense.
      (2) The operator of a coal or other mine who fails to provide
    timely notification to the Secretary as required under section
    813(j) of this title (relating to the 15 minute requirement) shall
    be assessed a civil penalty by the Secretary of not less than
    $5,000 and not more than $60,000.
      (3)(A) The minimum penalty for any citation or order issued under
    section 814(d)(1) of this title shall be $2,000.
      (B) The minimum penalty for any order issued under section
    814(d)(2) of this title shall be $4,000.
      (4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent an
    operator from obtaining a review, in accordance with section 816 of
    this title, of an order imposing a penalty described in this
    subsection. If a court, in making such review, sustains the order,
    the court shall apply at least the minimum penalties required under
    this subsection.
    (b) Civil penalty for failure to correct violation for which
      citation has been issued
      (1) Any operator who fails to correct a violation for which a
    citation has been issued under section 814(a) of this title within
    the period permitted for its correction may be assessed a civil
    penalty of not more than $$5,000 (!1) for each day during which
    such failure or violation continues.

      (2) Violations under this section that are deemed to be flagrant
    may be assessed a civil penalty of not more than $220,000. For
    purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "flagrant" with
    respect to a violation means a reckless or repeated failure to make
    reasonable efforts to eliminate a known violation of a mandatory
    health or safety standard that substantially and proximately
    caused, or reasonably could have been expected to cause, death or
    serious bodily injury.
    (c) Liability of corporate directors, officers, and agents
      Whenever a corporate operator violates a mandatory health or
    safety standard or knowingly violates or fails or refuses to comply
    with any order issued under this chapter or any order incorporated
    in a final decision issued under this chapter, except an order
    incorporated in a decision issued under subsection (a) of this
    section or section 815(c) of this title, any director, officer, or
    agent of such corporation who knowingly authorized, ordered, or
    carried out such violation, failure, or refusal shall be subject to
    the same civil penalties, fines, and imprisonment that may be
    imposed upon a person under subsections (a) and (d) of this
    section.
    (d) Criminal penalties
       Any operator who willfully violates a mandatory health or safety
    standard, or knowingly violates or fails or refuses to comply with
    any order issued under section 814 of this title and section 817 of
    this title, or any order incorporated in a final decision issued
    under this subchapter, except an order incorporated in a decision
    under subsection (a)(1) or section 815(c) of this title, shall,
    upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $250,000,
    or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or by both, except
    that if the conviction is for a violation committed after the first
    conviction of such operator under this chapter, punishment shall be
    by a fine of not more than $500,000, or by imprisonment for not
    more than five years, or both.
    (e) Unauthorized advance notice of inspections
      Unless otherwise authorized by this chapter, any person who gives
    advance notice of any inspection to be conducted under this chapter
    shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than
    $1,000 or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or both.
    (f) False statements, representations, or certifications
      Whoever knowingly makes any false statement, representation, or
    certification in any application, record, report, plan, or other
    document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this
    chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more
    than $10,000, or by imprisonment for not more than five years, or
    both.
    (g) Violation by miners of safety standards relating to smoking
      Any miner who willfully violates the mandatory safety standards
    relating to smoking or the carrying of smoking materials, matches,
    or lighters shall be subject to a civil penalty assessed by the
    Commission, which penalty shall not be more than $250 for each
    occurrence of such violation.
    (h) Equipment falsely represented as complying with statute,
      specification, or regulations
      Whoever knowingly distributes, sells, offers for sale,
    introduces, or delivers in commerce any equipment for use in a coal
    or other mine, including, but not limited to, components and
    accessories of such equipment, which is represented as complying
    with the provisions of this chapter, or with any specification or
    regulation of the Secretary applicable to such equipment, and which
    does not so comply, shall, upon conviction, be subject to the same
    fine and imprisonment that may be imposed upon a person under
    subsection (f) of this section.
    (i) Authority to assess civil penalties
      The Commission shall have authority to assess all civil penalties
    provided in this chapter. In assessing civil monetary penalties,
    the Commission shall consider the operator's history of previous
    violations, the appropriateness of such penalty to the size of the
    business of the operator charged, whether the operator was
    negligent, the effect on the operator's ability to continue in
    business, the gravity of the violation, and the demonstrated good
    faith of the person charged in attempting to achieve rapid
    compliance after notification of a violation. In proposing civil
    penalties under this chapter, the Secretary may rely upon a summary
    review of the information available to him and shall not be
    required to make findings of fact concerning the above factors.
    (j) Payment of penalties; interest
      Civil penalties owed under this chapter shall be paid to the
    Secretary for deposit into the Treasury of the United States and
    shall accrue to the United States and may be recovered in a civil
    action in the name of the United States brought in the United
    States district court for the district where the violation occurred
    or where the operator has its principal office. Interest at the
    rate of 8 percent per annum shall be charged against a person on
    any final order of the Commission, or the court. Interest shall
    begin to accrue 30 days after the issuance of such order.
    (k) Compromise, mitigation, and settlement of penalty
      No proposed penalty which has been contested before the
    Commission under section 815(a) of this title shall be compromised,
    mitigated, or settled except with the approval of the Commission.
    No penalty assessment which has become a final order of the
    Commission shall be compromised, mitigated, or settled except with
    the approval of the court.
    (l) Inapplicability to black lung benefit provisions
      The provisions of this section shall not be applicable with
    respect to subchapter IV of this chapter.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 821. Entitlement of miners to full compensation

-STATUTE-
      If a coal or other mine or area of such mine is closed by an
    order issued under section 813 of this title, section 814 of this
    title, or section 817 of this title, all miners working during the
    shift when such order was issued who are idled by such order shall
    be entitled, regardless of the result of any review of such order,
    to full compensation by the operator at their regular rates of pay
    for the period they are idled, but for not more than the balance of
    such shift. If such order is not terminated prior to the next
    working shift, all miners on that shift who are idled by such order
    shall be entitled to full compensation by the operator at their
    regular rates of pay for the period they are idled, but for not
    more than four hours of such shift. If a coal or other mine or area
    of such mine is closed by an order issued under section 814 of this
    title or section 817 of this title for a failure of the operator to
    comply with any mandatory health or safety standards, all miners
    who are idled due to such order shall be fully compensated after
    all interested parties are given an opportunity for a public
    hearing, which shall be expedited in such cases, and after such
    order is final, by the operator for lost time at their regular
    rates of pay for such time as the miners are idled by such closing,
    or for one week, whichever is the lesser. Whenever an operator
    violates or fails or refuses to comply with any order issued under
    section 813 of this title, section 814 of this title, or section
    817 of this title, all miners employed at the affected mine who
    would have been withdrawn from, or prevented from entering, such
    mine or area thereof as a result of such order shall be entitled to
    full compensation by the operator at their regular rates of pay, in
    addition to pay received for work performed after such order was
    issued, for the period beginning when such order was issued and
    ending when such order is complied with, vacated, or terminated.
    The Commission shall have authority to order compensation due under
    this section upon the filing of a complaint by a miner or his
    representative and after opportunity for hearing subject to section
    554 of title 5.

    Sec. 823. Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission

-STATUTE-
    (a) Establishment; membership; chairman
      The Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission is hereby
    established. The Commission shall consist of five members,
    appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of
    the Senate, from among persons who by reason of training,
    education, or experience are qualified to carry out the functions
    of the Commission under this chapter. The President shall designate
    one of the members of the Commission to serve as Chairman.
    (b) Terms; personnel; administrative law judges
      (1) The terms of the members of the Commission shall be six
    years, except that - 
        (A) members of the Commission first taking office after
      November 9, 1977, shall serve, as designated by the President at
      the time of appointment, one for a term of two years, two for a
      term of four years and two for a term of six years; and
        (B) a vacancy caused by the death, resignation, or removal of
      any member prior to the expiration of the term for which he was
      appointed shall be filled only for the remainder of such
      unexpired term.

    Any member of the Commission may be removed by the President for
    inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.
      (2) The Chairman shall be responsible on behalf of the Commission
    for the administrative operations of the Commission. The Commission
    shall appoint such employees as it deems necessary to assist in the
    performance of the Commission's functions and to fix their
    compensation in accordance with the provisions of chapter 51 and
    subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5, relating to classification
    and general pay rates. Upon the effective date of the Federal Mine
    Safety and Health Amendments Act of 1977, the administrative law
    judges assigned to the Arlington, Virginia, facility of the Office
    of Hearings and Appeals, United States Department of the Interior,
    shall be automatically transferred in grade and position to the
    Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission. Notwithstanding
    the provisions of section 559 of title 5, the incumbent Chief
    Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearings and Appeals of
    the Department of the Interior assigned to the Arlington, Virginia
    facility shall have the option, on the effective date of the
    Federal Mine Safety and Health Amendments Act of 1977, of
    transferring to the Commission as an administrative law judge, in
    the same grade and position as the other administrative law judges.
    The administrative law judges (except those presiding over Indian
    Probate Matters) assigned to the Western facilities of the Office
    of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of the Interior shall
    remain with that Department at their present grade and position or
    they shall have the right to transfer on an equivalent basis to
    that extended in this paragraph to the Arlington, Virginia
    administrative law judges in accordance with procedures established
    by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management. The
    Commission shall appoint such additional administrative law judges
    as it deems necessary to carry out the functions of the Commission.
    Assignment, removal, and compensation of administrative law judges
    shall be in accordance with sections 3105, 3344, 5362 and 7521 of
    title 5.
    (c) Delegation of powers
      The Commission is authorized to delegate to any group of three or
    more members any or all of the powers of the Commission, except
    that two members shall constitute a quorum of any group designated
    pursuant to this paragraph.
    (d) Proceedings before administrative law judge; administrative
      review
      (1) An administrative law judge appointed by the Commission to
    hear matters under this chapter shall hear, and make a
    determination upon, any proceeding instituted before the Commission
    and any motion in connection therewith, assigned to such
    administrative law judge by the chief administrative law judge of
    the Commission or by the Commission, and shall make a decision
    which constitutes his final disposition of the proceedings. The
    decision of the administrative law judge of the Commission shall
    become the final decision of the Commission 40 days after its
    issuance unless within such period the Commission has directed that
    such decision shall be reviewed by the Commission in accordance
    with paragraph (2). An administrative law judge shall not be
    assigned to prepare a recommended decision under this chapter.
      (2) The Commission shall prescribe rules of procedure for its
    review of the decisions of administrative law judges in cases under
    this chapter which shall meet the following standards for review:
      (A)(i) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by a decision
    of an administrative law judge, may file and serve a petition for
    discretionary review by the Commission of such decision within 30
    days after the issuance of such decision. Review by the Commission
    shall not be a matter of right but of the sound discretion of the
    Commission.
      (ii) Petitions for discretionary review shall be filed only upon
    one or more of the following grounds:
        (I) A finding or conclusion of material fact is not supported
      by substantial evidence.
        (II) A necessary legal conclusion is erroneous.
        (III) The decision is contrary to law or to the duly
      promulgated rules or decisions of the Commission.
        (IV) A substantial question of law, policy or discretion is
      involved.
        (V) A prejudicial error of procedure was committed.

      (iii) Each issue shall be separately numbered and plainly and
    concisely stated, and shall be supported by detailed citations to
    the record when assignments of error are based on the record, and
    by statutes, regulations, or principal authorities relied upon.
    Except for good cause shown, no assignment of error by any party
    shall rely on any question of fact or law upon which the
    administrative law judge had not been afforded an opportunity to
    pass. Review by the Commission shall be granted only by affirmative
    vote of two of the Commissioners present and voting. If granted,
    review shall be limited to the questions raised by the petition.
      (B) At any time within 30 days after the issuance of a decision
    of an administrative law judge, the Commission may in its
    discretion (by affirmative vote of two of the Commissioners present
    and voting) order the case before it for review but only upon the
    ground that the decision may be contrary to law or Commission
    policy, or that a novel question of policy has been presented. The
    Commission shall state in such order the specific issue of law,
    Commission policy, or novel question of policy involved. If a
    party's petition for discretionary review has been granted, the
    Commission shall not raise or consider additional issues in such
    review proceedings except in compliance with the requirements of
    this paragraph.
      (C) For the purpose of review by the Commission under paragraph
    (A) or (B) of this subsection, the record shall include: (i) all
    matters constituting the record upon which the decision of the
    administrative law judge was based; (ii) the rulings upon proposed
    findings and conclusions; (iii) the decision of the administrative
    law judge; (iv) the petition or petitions for discretionary review,
    responses thereto, and the Commission's order for review; and (v)
    briefs filed on review. No other material shall be considered by
    the Commission upon review. The Commission either may remand the
    case to the administrative law judge for further proceedings as it
    may direct or it may affirm, set aside, or modify the decision or
    order of the administrative law judge in conformity with the
    record. If the Commission determines that further evidence is
    necessary on an issue of fact it shall remand the case for further
    proceedings before the administrative law judge.
      (The provisions of section 557(b) of title 5 with regard to the
    review authority of the Commission are expressly superseded to the
    extent that they are inconsistent with the provisions of
    subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph.)
    (e) Witnesses and evidence; subpoenas; contempt
      In connection with hearings before the Commission or its
    administrative law judges under this chapter, the Commission and
    its administrative law judges may compel the attendance and
    testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, or
    documents, or objects, and order testimony to be taken by
    deposition at any stage of the proceedings before them. Any person
    may be compelled to appear and depose and produce similar
    documentary or physical evidence, in the same manner as witnesses
    may be compelled to appear and produce evidence before the
    Commission and its administrative law judges. Witnesses shall be
    paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the
    courts of the United States and at depositions ordered by such
    courts. In case of contumacy, failure, or refusal of any person to
    obey a subpoena or order of the Commission or an administrative law
    judge, respectively, to appear, to testify, or to produce
    documentary or physical evidence, any district court of the United
    States or the United States courts of any territory or possession,
    within the jurisdiction of which such person is found, or resides,
    or transacts business, shall, upon the application of the
    Commission, or the administrative law judge, respectively, have
    jurisdiction to issue to such person an order requiring such person
    to appear, to testify, or to produce evidence as ordered by the
    Commission or the administrative law judge, respectively, and any
    failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by the
    court as a contempt thereof.

    CHAPTER 22 - MINE SAFETY AND HEALTH
    SUBCHAPTER I - GENERAL

-HEAD-
    Sec. 825. Mandatory health and safety training

-STATUTE-
    (a) Approved program; regulations
      Each operator of a coal or other mine shall have a health and
    safety training program which shall be approved by the Secretary.
    The Secretary shall promulgate regulations with respect to such
    health and safety training programs not more than 180 days after
    the effective date of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Amendments
    Act of 1977. Each training program approved by the Secretary shall
    provide as a minimum that - 
        (1) new miners having no underground mining experience shall
      receive no less than 40 hours of training if they are to work
      underground. Such training shall include instruction in the
      statutory rights of miners and their representatives under this
      chapter, use of the self-rescue device and use of respiratory
      devices, hazard recognition, escapeways, walk around training,
      emergency procedures, basic ventilation, basic roof control,
      electrical hazards, first aid, and the health and safety aspects
      of the task to which he will be assigned;
        (2) new miners having no surface mining experience shall
      receive no less than 24 hours of training if they are to work on
      the surface. Such training shall include instruction in the
      statutory rights of miners and their representatives under this
      chapter, use of the self-rescue device where appropriate and use
      of respiratory devices where appropriate, hazard recognition,
      emergency procedures, electrical hazards, first aid, walk around
      training and the health and safety aspects of the task to which
      he will be assigned;
        (3) all miners shall receive no less than eight hours of
      refresher training no less frequently than once each 12 months,
      except that miners already employed on the effective date of the
      Federal Mine Safety and Health Amendments Act of 1977 shall
      receive this refresher training no more than 90 days after the
      date of approval of the training plan required by this section;
        (4) any miner who is reassigned to a new task in which he has
      had no previous work experience shall receive training in
      accordance with a training plan approved by the Secretary under
      this subsection in the safety and health aspects specific to that
      task prior to performing that task;
        (5) any training required by paragraphs (1), (2) or (4) shall
      include a period of training as closely related as is practicable
      to the work in which the miner is to be engaged.
    (b) Training compensation
      Any health and safety training provided under subsection (a) of
    this section shall be provided during normal working hours. Miners
    shall be paid at their normal rate of compensation while they take
    such training, and new miners shall be paid at their starting wage
    rate when they take the new miner training. If such training shall
    be given at a location other than the normal place of work, miners
    shall also be compensated for the additional costs they may incur
    in attending such training sessions.
    (c) Certificate
      Upon completion of each training program, each operator shall
    certify, on a form approved by the Secretary, that the miner has
    received the specified training in each subject area of the
    approved health and safety training plan. A certificate for each
    miner shall be maintained by the operator, and shall be available
    for inspection at the mine site, and a copy thereof shall be given
    to each miner at the completion of such training. When a miner
    leaves the operator's employ, he shall be entitled to a copy of his
    health and safety training certificates. False certification by an
    operator that training was given shall be punishable under section
    820(a) and (f) of this title; and each health and safety training
    certificate shall indicate on its face, in bold letters, printed in
    a conspicuous manner the fact that such false certification is so
    punishable.
    (d) Standards
      The Secretary shall promulgate appropriate standards for safety
    and health training for coal or other mine construction workers.
    (e) Proposed regulations
      (1) Within 180 days after the effective date of the Federal Mine
    Safety and Health Amendments Act of 1977, the Secretary shall
    publish proposed regulations which shall provide that mine rescue
    teams shall be available for rescue and recovery work to each
    underground coal or other mine in the event of an emergency. The
    costs of making advance arrangements for such teams shall be borne
    by the operator of each such mine.
      (2)(A) The Secretary shall issue regulations with regard to mine
    rescue teams which shall be finalized and in effect not later than
    18 months after June 15, 2006.

      (a) The provisions of sections 842 through 846 of this title and
    the applicable provisions of section 878 of this title shall be
    interim mandatory health standards applicable to all underground
    coal mines until superseded in whole or in part by improved
    mandatory health standards promulgated by the Secretary under the
    provisions of section 811 of this title, and shall be enforced in
    the same manner and to the same extent as any mandatory health
    standard promulgated under the provisions of section 811 of this
    title. Any orders issued in the enforcement of the interim
    standards set forth in this subchapter shall be subject to review
    as provided in subchapter I of this chapter.
      (b) Among other things, it is the purpose of this subchapter to
    provide, to the greatest extent possible, that the working
    conditions in each underground coal mine are sufficiently free of
    respirable dust concentrations in the mine atmosphere to permit
    each miner the opportunity to work underground during the period of
    his entire adult working life without incurring any disability from
    pneumoconiosis or any other occupation-related disease during or at
    the end of such period.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Samples; procedures; transmittal; notice of excess
      concentration; periodic reports to Secretary; contents
      Each operator of a coal mine shall take accurate samples of the
    amount of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere to which each
    miner in the active workings of such mine is exposed. Such samples
    shall be taken by any device approved by the Secretary and the
    Secretary of Health and Human Services and in accordance with such
    methods, at such locations, at such intervals, and in such manner
    as the Secretaries shall prescribe in the Federal Register within
    sixty days from December 30, 1969 and from time to time thereafter.
    Such samples shall be transmitted to the Secretary in a manner
    established by him, and analyzed and recorded by him in a manner
    that will assure application of the provisions of section 814(i) of
    this title when the applicable limit on the concentration of
    respirable dust required to be maintained under this section is
    exceeded. The results of such samples shall also be made available
    to the operator. Each operator shall report and certify to the
    Secretary at such intervals as the Secretary may require as to the
    conditions in the active workings of the coal mine, including, but
    not limited to, the average number of working hours worked during
    each shift, the quantity and velocity of air regularly reaching the
    working faces, the method of mining, the amount and pressure of the
    water, if any, reaching the working faces, and the number,
    location, and type of sprays, if any, used.
    (b) Standards; noncompliance permit; renewal; procedures;
      limitations; extension period
      Except as otherwise provided in this subsection - 
        (1) Effective on the operative date of this subchapter, each
      operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of
      respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which
      each miner in the active workings of such mine is exposed at or
      below 3.0 milligrams of respirable dust per cubic meter of air.
        (2) Effective three years after December 30, 1969, each
      operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of
      respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which
      each miner in the active workings of such mine is exposed at or
      below 2.0 milligrams of respirable dust per cubic meter of air.
        (3) Any operator who determines that he will be unable, using
      available technology, to comply with the provisions of paragraph
      (1) of this subsection, or the provisions of paragraph (2) of
      this subsection, as appropriate, may file with the Panel, no
      later than sixty days prior to the effective date of the
      applicable respirable dust standard established by such
      paragraphs, an application for a permit for noncompliance. If, in
      the case of an application for a permit for noncompliance with
      the 3.0 milligram standard established by paragraph (1) of this
      subsection, the application satisfies the requirements of
      subsection (c) of this section, the Panel shall issue a permit
      for noncompliance to the operator. If, in the case of an
      application for a permit for noncompliance with the 2.0 milligram
      standard established by paragraph (2) of this subsection, the
      application satisfies the requirements of subsection (c) of this
      section and the Panel determines that the applicant will be
      unable to comply with such standard, the Panel shall issue to the
      operator a permit for noncompliance.
        (4) In any case in which an operator, who has been issued a
      permit (including a renewal permit) for noncompliance under this
      section, determines, not more than ninety days prior to the
      expiration date of such permit, that he still is unable to comply
      with the standard established by paragraph (1) of this subsection
      or the standard established by paragraph (2) of this subsection,
      as appropriate, he may file with the Panel an application for
      renewal of the permit. Upon receipt of such application, the
      Panel, if it determines, after all interested persons have been
      notified and given an opportunity for a public hearing under
      section 804 of this title, that the application is in compliance
      with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, and that
      the applicant will be unable to comply with such standard, may
      renew the permit.
        (5) Any such permit or renewal thereof so issued shall be in
      effect for a period not to exceed one year and shall entitle the
      permittee during such period to maintain continuously the average
      concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during
      each shift in the working places of such mine to which the permit
      applies at a level specified by the Panel, which shall be at the
      lowest level which the application shows the conditions,
      technology applicable to such mine, and other available and
      effective control techniques and methods will permit, but in no
      event shall such level exceed 4.5 milligrams of dust per cubic
      meter of air during the period when the 3.0 milligram standard is
      in effect, or 3.0 milligrams of dust per cubic meter of air
      during the period when the 2.0 milligram standard is in effect.
        (6) No permit or renewal thereof for noncompliance shall
      entitle any operator to an extension of time beyond eighteen
      months from December 30, 1969 to comply with the 3.0 milligram
      standard established by paragraph (1) of this subsection, or
      beyond seventy-two months from December 30, 1969 to comply with
      the 2.0 milligram standard established by paragraph (2) of this
      subsection.
    (c) Applications for noncompliance; contents
      Any application for an initial or renewal permit made pursuant to
    this section shall contain - 
        (1) a representation by the applicant and the engineer
      conducting the survey referred to in paragraph (2) of this
      subsection that the applicant is unable to comply with the
      standard applicable under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this
      section at specified working places because the technology for
      reducing the concentration of respirable dust at such places is
      not available, or because of the lack of other effective control
      techniques or methods, or because of any combination of such
      reasons;
        (2) an identification of the working places in such mine for
      which the permit is requested; the results of an engineering
      survey by a certified engineer of the respirable dust conditions
      of each working place of the mine with respect to which such
      application is filed and the ability to reduce such dust to the
      level required to be maintained in such place under this section;
      a description of the ventilation system of the mine and its
      capacity; the quantity and velocity of air regularly reaching the
      working faces; the method of mining; the amount and pressure of
      the water, if any, reaching the working faces; the number,
      location, and type of sprays, if any; action taken to reduce such
      dust; and such other information as the Panel may require; and
        (3) statements by the applicant and the engineer conducting
      such survey, of the means and methods to be employed to achieve
      compliance with the applicable standard, the progress made toward
      achieving compliance, and an estimate of when compliance can be
      achieved.
    (d) Promulgation of new standards; procedures
      Beginning six months after the operative date of this subchapter
    and from time to time thereafter, the Secretary of Health and Human
    Services shall establish, in accordance with the provisions of
    section 811 of this title, a schedule reducing the average
    concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during each
    shift to which each miner in the active workings is exposed below
    the levels established in this section to a level of personal
    exposure which will prevent new incidences of respiratory disease
    and the further development of such disease in any person. Such
    schedule shall specify the minimum time necessary to achieve such
    levels taking into consideration present and future advancements in
    technology to reach these levels.
    (e) Concentration of respirable dust
      References to concentrations of respirable dust in this
    subchapter mean the average concentration of respirable dust
    measured with a device approved by the Secretary and the Secretary
    of Health and Human Services.
    (f) Average concentration
      For the purpose of this subchapter, the term "average
    concentration" means a determination which accurately represents
    the atmospheric conditions with regard to respirable dust to which
    each miner in the active workings of a mine is exposed (1) as
    measured, during the 18 month period following December 30, 1969,
    over a number of continuous production shifts to be determined by
    the Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and
    (2) as measured thereafter, over a single shift only, unless the
    Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services find, in
    accordance with the provisions of section 811 of this title, that
    such single shift measurement will not, after applying valid
    statistical techniques to such measurement, accurately represent
    such atmospheric conditions during such shift.
    (g) Compliance inspections
      The Secretary shall cause to be made such frequent spot
    inspections as he deems appropriate of the active workings of coal
    mines for the purpose of obtaining compliance with the provisions
    of this subchapter.
    (h) Maintenance of respiratory equipment; substitutes for
      environmental controls
      Respiratory equipment approved by the Secretary and the Secretary
    of Health and Human Services shall be made available to all persons
    whenever exposed to concentrations of respirable dust in excess of
    the levels required to be maintained under this chapter. Use of
    respirators shall not be substituted for environmental control
    measures in the active workings. Each operator shall maintain a
    supply of respiratory equipment adequate to deal with occurrences
    of concentrations of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere in
    excess of the levels required to be maintained under this chapter.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Chest roentgenogram; availability; periodic intervals; other
      tests; transmittal of results; advice of rights
      The operator of a coal mine shall cooperate with the Secretary of
    Health and Human Services in making available to each miner working
    in a coal mine the opportunity to have a chest roentgenogram within
    eighteen months after December 30, 1969, a second chest
    roentgenogram within three years thereafter, and subsequent chest
    roentgenograms at such intervals thereafter of not to exceed five
    years as the Secretary of Health and Human Services prescribes.
    Each worker who begins work in a coal mine for the first time shall
    be given, as soon as possible after commencement of his employment,
    and again three years later if he is still engaged in coal mining,
    a chest roentgenogram; and in the event the second such chest
    roentgenogram shows evidence of the development of pneumoconiosis
    the worker shall be given, two years later if he is still engaged
    in coal mining, an additional chest roentgenogram. All chest
    roentgenograms shall be given in accordance with specifications
    prescribed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and shall
    be supplemented by such other tests as the Secretary of Health and
    Human Services deems necessary. The films shall be read and
    classified in a manner to be prescribed by the Secretary of Health
    and Human Services, and the results of each reading on each such
    person and of such tests shall be submitted to the Secretary and to
    the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and, at the request of
    the miner, to his physician. The Secretary shall also submit such
    results to such miner and advise him of his rights under this
    chapter related thereto. Such specifications, readings,
    classifications, and tests shall, to the greatest degree possible,
    be uniform for all coal mines and miners in such mines.
    (b) Evidence of pneumoconiosis; option to transfer; wages
      (1) On and after the operative date of this subchapter, any miner
    who, in the judgment of the Secretary of Health and Human Services
    based upon such reading or other medical examinations, shows
    evidence of the development of pneumoconiosis shall be afforded the
    option of transferring from his position to another position in any
    area of the mine, for such period or periods as may be necessary to
    prevent further development of such disease, where the
    concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere is not more
    than 2.0 milligrams of dust per cubic meter of air.
      (2) Effective three years after December 30, 1969, any miner who,
    in the judgment of the Secretary of Health and Human Services based
    upon such reading or other medical examinations, shows evidence of
    the development of pneumoconiosis shall be afforded the option of
    transferring from his position to another position in any area of
    the mine, for such period or periods as may be necessary to prevent
    further development of such disease, where the concentration of
    respirable dust in the mine atmosphere is not more than 1.0
    millograms (!1) of dust per cubic meter of air, or if such level is
    not attainable in such mine, to a position in such mine where the
    concentration of respirable dust is the lowest attainable below 2.0
    milligrams per cubic meter of air.

      (3) Any miner so transferred shall receive compensation for such
    work at not less than the regular rate of pay received by him
    immediately prior to his transfer.
    (c) Costs of examinations and tests
      No payment may be required of any miner in connection with any
    examination or test given him pursuant to this subchapter. Where
    such examinations or tests cannot be given, due to the lack of
    adequate medical or other necessary facilities or personnel, in the
    locality where the miner resides, arrangements shall be made to
    have them conducted, in accordance with the provisions of this
    subchapter, in such locality by the Secretary of Health and Human
    Services, or by an appropriate person, agency, or institution,
    public or private, under an agreement or arrangement between the
    Secretary of Health and Human Services and such person, agency, or
    institution. The operator of the mine shall reimburse the Secretary
    of Health and Human Services, or such person, agency, or
    institution, as the case may be, for the cost of conducting each
    examination or test made, in accordance with this subchapter, and
    shall pay whatever other costs are necessary to enable the miner to
    take such examinations or tests.
    (d) Autopsies
      If the death of any active miner occurs in any coal mine, or if
    the death of any active or inactive miner occurs in any other
    place, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to
    provide for an autopsy to be performed on such miner, with the
    consent of his surviving widow or, if he has no such widow, then
    with the consent of his surviving next of kin. The results of such
    autopsy shall be submitted to the Secretary of Health and Human
    Services and, with the consent of such survivor, to the miner's
    physician or other interested person. Such autopsy shall be paid
    for by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

      On and after the operative date of this subchapter, the standards
    on noise prescribed under the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act, as
    amended [41 U.S.C. 35 et seq.], in effect October 1, 1969, shall be
    applicable to each coal mine and each operator of such mine shall
    comply with them. Within six months after December 30, 1969, the
    Secretary of Health and Human Services shall establish, and the
    Secretary shall publish, as provided in section 811 of this title,
    proposed mandatory health standards establishing maximum noise
    exposure levels for all underground coal mines. Beginning six
    months after the operative date of this subchapter, and at
    intervals of at least every six months thereafter, the operator of
    each coal mine shall conduct, in a manner prescribed by the
    Secretary of Health and Human Services, tests by a qualified person
    of the noise level at the mine and report and certify the results
    to the Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. In
    meeting such standard under this section, the operator shall not
    require the use of any protective device or system, including
    personal devices, which the Secretary or his authorized
    representative finds to be hazardous or cause a hazard to the
    miners in such mine.

    Sec. 861. Mandatory safety standards for underground mines

-STATUTE-
    (a) Coverage; enforcement; review
      The provisions of sections 862 through 878 of this title shall be
    interim mandatory safety standards applicable to all underground
    coal mines until superseded in whole or in part by improved
    mandatory safety standards promulgated by the Secretary under the
    provisions of section 811 of this title, and shall be enforced in
    the same manner and to the same extent as any mandatory safety
    standard promulgated under section 811 of this title. Any orders
    issued in the enforcement of the interim standards set forth in
    this subchapter shall be subject to review as provided in
    subchapter I of this chapter.
    (b) Purpose; initiation of studies and research
      The purpose of this subchapter is to provide for the immediate
    application of mandatory safety standards developed on the basis of
    experience and advances in technology and to prevent newly created
    hazards resulting from new technology in coal mining. The Secretary
    of the Interior in coordination with the Secretary shall
    immediately initiate studies, investigations, and research to
    further upgrade such standards and to develop and promulgate new
    and improved standards promptly that will provide increased
    protection to the miners, particularly in connection with hazards
    from trolley wires, trolley feeder wires, and signal wires, the
    splicing and use of trailing cables, and in connection with
    improvements in vulcanizing of electric conductors, improvement in
    roof control measures, methane drainage in advance of mining,
    improved methods of measuring methane and other explosive gases and
    oxygen concentrations, and the use of improved underground
    equipment and other sources of power for such equipment.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 862. Roof support

-STATUTE-
    (a) Roof control plan; contents; review; availability
      Each operator shall undertake to carry out on a continuing basis
    a program to improve the roof control system of each coal mine and
    the means and measures to accomplish such system. The roof and ribs
    of all active underground roadways, travelways, and working places
    shall be supported or otherwise controlled adequately to protect
    persons from falls of the roof or ribs. A roof control plan and
    revisions thereof suitable to the roof conditions and mining system
    of each coal mine and approved by the Secretary shall be adopted
    and set out in printed form within sixty days after the operative
    date of this subchapter. The plan shall show the type of support
    and spacing approved by the Secretary. Such plan shall be reviewed
    periodically, at least every six months by the Secretary, taking
    into consideration any falls of roof or ribs or inadequacy of
    support of roof or ribs. No person shall proceed beyond the last
    permanent support unless adequate temporary support is provided or
    unless such temporary support is not required under the approved
    roof control plan and the absence of such support will not pose a
    hazard to the miners. A copy of the plan shall be furnished the
    Secretary or his authorized representative and shall be available
    to the miners and their representatives.
    (b) Creation of dangers by roof falls
      The method of mining followed in any coal mine shall not expose
    the miner to unusual dangers from roof falls caused by excessive
    widths of rooms and entries or faulty pillar recovery methods.
    (c) Location and supply of roof support material; safety devices
      for roof work
      The operator, in accordance with the approved plan, shall provide
    at or near each working face and at such other locations in the
    coal mine as the Secretary may prescribe an ample supply of
    suitable materials of proper size with which to secure the roof of
    all working places in a safe manner. Safety posts, jacks, or other
    approved devices shall be used to protect the workmen when roof
    material is being taken down, crossbars are being installed, roof
    bolt- holes are being drilled, roof bolts are being installed, and
    in such other circumstances as may be appropriate. Loose roof and
    overhanging or loose faces and ribs shall be taken down or
    supported. Except in the case of recovery work, supports knocked
    out shall be replaced promptly.
    (d) Roof bolts
      When installation of roof bolts is permitted, such roof bolts
    shall be tested in accordance with the approved roof control plan.
    (e) Recovery of roof bolts
      Roof bolts shall not be recovered where complete extractions of
    pillars are attempted, where adjacent to clay veins, or at the
    locations of other irregularities, whether natural or otherwise,
    that induce abnormal hazards. Where roof bolt recovery is
    permitted, it shall be conducted only in accordance with methods
    prescribed in the approved roof control plan, and shall be
    conducted by experienced miners and only where adequate temporary
    support is provided.
    (f) Safety inspections; correction of dangerous conditions
      Where miners are exposed to danger from falls of roof, face, and
    ribs the operator shall examine and test the roof, face, and ribs
    before any work or machine is started, and as frequently thereafter
    as may be necessary to insure safety. When dangerous conditions are
    found, they shall be corrected immediately.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 863. Ventilation

-STATUTE-
    (a) Equipment; approval; daily examinations
      All coal mines shall be ventilated by mechanical ventilation
    equipment installed and operated in a manner approved by an
    authorized representative of the Secretary and such equipment shall
    be examined daily and a record shall be kept of such examination.
    (b) Standards for air in work areas
      All active workings shall be ventilated by a current of air
    containing not less than 19.5 volume per centum of oxygen, not more
    than 0.5 volume per centum of carbon dioxide, and no harmful
    quantities of other noxious or poisonous gases; and the volume and
    velocity of the current of air shall be sufficient to dilute,
    render harmless, and to carry away, flammable, explosive, noxious,
    and harmful gases, and dust, and smoke and explosive fumes. The
    minimum quantity of air reaching the last open crosscut in any pair
    or set of developing entries and the last open crosscut in any pair
    or set of rooms shall be nine thousand cubic feet a minute, and the
    minimum quantity of air reaching the intake end of a pillar line
    shall be nine thousand cubic feet a minute. The minimum quantity of
    air in any coal mine reaching each working face shall be three
    thousand cubic feet a minute. Within three months after the
    operative date of this subchapter, the Secretary shall prescribe
    the minimum velocity and quantity of air reaching each working face
    of each coal mine in order to render harmless and carry away
    methane and other explosive gases and to reduce the level of
    respirable dust to the lowest attainable level. The authorized
    representative of the Secretary may require in any coal mine a
    greater quantity and velocity of air when he finds it necessary to
    protect the health or safety of miners. Within one year after the
    operative date of this subchapter, the Secretary or his authorized
    representative shall prescribe the maximum respirable dust level in
    the intake aircourses in each coal mine in order to reduce such
    level to the lowest attainable level. In robbing areas of
    anthracite mines, where the air currents cannot be controlled and
    measurements of the air cannot be obtained, the air shall have
    perceptible movement.
    (c) Line brattice; functions; exceptions; repairs; flame resistant
      material
      (1) Properly installed and adequately maintained line brattice or
    other approved devices shall be continuously used from the last
    open crosscut of an entry or room of each working section to
    provide adequate ventilation to the working faces for the miners
    and to remove flammable, explosive, and noxious gases, dust, and
    explosive fumes, unless the Secretary or his authorized
    representative permits an exception to this requirement, where such
    exception will not pose a hazard to the miners. When damaged by
    falls or otherwise, such line brattice or other devices shall be
    repaired immediately.
      (2) The space between the line brattice or other approved device
    and the rib shall be large enough to permit the flow of a
    sufficient volume and velocity of air to keep the working face
    clear of flammable, explosive, and noxious gases, dust, and
    explosive fumes.
      (3) Brattice cloth used underground shall be of flame-resistant
    material.
    (d) Pre-shift examinations and tests; scope; violations of
      mandatory standards; notification; posting of "DANGER" signs;
      restriction of entry; records; re-entry
      (1) Within three hours immediately preceding the beginning of any
    shift, and before any miner in such shift enters the active
    workings of a coal mine, certified persons designated by the
    operator of the mine shall examine such workings and any other
    underground area of the mine designated by the Secretary or his
    authorized representative. Each such examiner shall examine every
    working section in such workings and shall make tests in each such
    working section for accumulations of methane with means approved by
    the Secretary for detecting methane and shall make tests for oxygen
    deficiency with a permissible flame safety lamp or other means
    approved by the Secretary; examine seals and doors to determine
    whether they are functioning properly; examine and test the roof,
    face, and rib conditions in such working section; examine active
    roadways, travelways, and belt conveyors on which men are carried,
    approaches to abandoned areas, and accessible falls in such section
    for hazards; test by means of an anemometer or other device
    approved by the Secretary to determine whether the air in each
    split is traveling in its proper course and in normal volume and
    velocity; and examine for such other hazards and violations of the
    mandatory health or safety standards, as an authorized
    representative of the Secretary may from time to time require. Belt
    conveyors on which coal is carried shall be examined after each
    coal-producing shift has begun. Such mine examiner shall place his
    initials and the date and time at all places he examines. If such
    mine examiner finds a condition which constitutes a violation of a
    mandatory health or safety standard or any condition which is
    hazardous to persons who may enter or be in such area, he shall
    indicate such hazardous place by posting a "DANGER" sign
    conspiciously (!1) at all points which persons entering such
    hazardous place would be required to pass, and shall notify the
    operator of the mine. No person, other than an authorized
    representative of the Secretary or a State mine inspector or
    persons authorized by the operator to enter such place for the
    purpose of eliminating the hazardous condition therein, shall enter
    such place while such sign is so posted. Upon completing his
    examination, such mine examiner shall report the results of his
    examination to a person, designated by the operator to receive such
    reports at a designated station on the surface of the mine, before
    other persons enter the underground areas of such mine to work in
    such shift. Each such mine examiner shall also record the results
    of his examination with ink or indelible pencil in a book approved
    by the Secretary kept for such purpose in an area on the surface of
    the mine chosen by the operator to minimize the danger of
    destruction by fire or other hazard, and the record shall be open
    for inspection by interested persons.

      (2) No person (other than certified persons designated under this
    subsection) shall enter any underground area, except during any
    shift, unless an examination of such area as prescribed in this
    subsection has been made within eight hours immediately preceding
    his entrance into such area.
    (e) Daily examinations and tests; scope; imminent danger;
      withdrawal of persons; abatement of danger
      At least once during each coal-producing shift, or more often if
    necessary for safety, each working section shall be examined for
    hazardous conditions by certified persons designated by the
    operator to do so. Any such condition shall be corrected
    immediately. If such condition creates an imminent danger, the
    operator shall withdraw all persons from the area affected by such
    condition to a safe area, except those persons referred to in
    section 814(d) of this title, until the danger is abated. Such
    examination shall include tests for methane with a means approved
    by the Secretary for detecting methane and for oxygen deficiency
    with a permissible flame safety lamp or other means approved by the
    Secretary.
    (f) Weekly examination for hazardous conditions; scope;
      notification; repairs; imminent danger; withdrawal of persons;
      abatement; records
      In addition to the pre-shift and daily examinations required by
    this section, examinations for hazardous conditions, including
    tests for methane, and for compliance with the mandatory health or
    safety standards, shall be made at least once each week by a
    certified person designated by the operator in the return of each
    split of air where it enters the main return, on pillar falls, at
    seals, in the main return, at least one entry of each intake and
    return aircourse in its entirety, idle workings, and, insofar as
    safety considerations permit, abandoned areas. Such weekly
    examination need not be made during any week in which the mine is
    idle for the entire week, except that such examination shall be
    made before any other miner returns to the mine. The person making
    such examinations and tests shall place his initials and the date
    and time at the places examined, and if any hazardous condition is
    found, such condition shall be reported to the operator promptly.
    Any hazardous condition shall be corrected immediately. If such
    condition creates an imminent danger, the operator shall withdraw
    all persons from the area affected by such condition to a safe
    area, except those persons referred to in section 814(d) of this
    title, until such danger is abated. A record of these examinations,
    tests, and actions taken shall be recorded in ink or indelible
    pencil in a book approved by the Secretary kept for such purpose in
    an area on the surface of the mine chosen by the mine operator to
    minimize the danger of destruction by fire or other hazard, and the
    record shall be open for inspection by interested persons.
    (g) Weekly ventilation examinations; scope; records
      At least once each week, a qualified person shall measure the
    volume of air entering the main intakes and leaving the main
    returns, the volume passing through the last open crosscut in any
    pair or set of developing entries and the last open crosscut in any
    pair or set of rooms, the volume and, when the Secretary so
    prescribes, the velocity reaching each working face, the volume
    being delivered to the intake end of each pillar line, and the
    volume at the intake and return of each split of air. A record of
    such measurements shall be recorded in ink or indelible pencil in a
    book approved by the Secretary kept for such purpose in an area on
    the surface of the coal mine chosen by the operator to minimize the
    danger of destruction by fire or other hazard, and the record shall
    be open for inspection by interested persons.
    (h) Methane examinations at working place; periodic intervals;
      standards; procedures for different air contents of methane
      (1) At the start of each shift, tests for methane shall be made
    at each working place immediately before electrically operated
    equipment is energized. Such tests shall be made by qualified
    persons. If 1.0 volume per centum or more of methane is detected,
    electrical equipment shall not be energized, taken into, or
    operated in, such working place until the air therein contains less
    than 1.0 volume per centum of methane. Examinations for methane
    shall be made during the operation of such equipment at intervals
    of not more than twenty minutes during each shift, unless more
    frequent examinations are required by an authorized representative
    of the Secretary. In conducting such tests, such person shall use
    means approved by the Secretary for detecting methane.
      (2) If at any time the air at any working place, when tested at a
    point not less than twelve inches from the roof, face, or rib,
    contains 1.0 volume per centum or more of methane, changes or
    adjustments shall be made at once in the ventilation in such mine
    so that such air shall contain less than 1.0 volume per centum of
    methane. While such changes or adjustments are underway and until
    they have been achieved, power to electric face equipment located
    in such place shall be cut off, no other work shall be permitted in
    such place, and due precautions shall be carried out under the
    direction of the operator or his agent so as not to endanger other
    areas of the mine. If at any time such air contains 1.5 volume per
    centum or more of methane, all persons, except those referred to in
    section 814(d) of this title, shall be withdrawn from the area of
    the mine endangered thereby to a safe area, and all electric power
    shall be cut off from the endangered area of the mine, until the
    air in such working place shall contain less than 1.0 volume per
    centum of methane.
    (i) Methane examination of air returning from working section;
      periodic intervals; standards; procedures for different air
      contents; virgin territory
      (1) If, when tested, a split of air returning from any working
    section contains 1.0 volume per centum or more of methane, changes
    or adjustments shall be made at once in the ventilation in the mine
    so that such returning air shall contain less than 1.0 volume per
    centum of methane. Tests under this paragraph and paragraph (2) of
    this subsection shall be made at four-hour intervals during each
    shift by a qualified person designated by the operator of the mine.
    In making such tests, such person shall use means approved by the
    Secretary for detecting methane.
      (2) If, when tested, a split of air returning from any working
    section contains 1.5 volume per centum or more of methane, all
    persons, except those persons referred to in section 814(d) of this
    title, shall be withdrawn from the area of the mine endangered
    thereby to a safe area and all electric power shall be cut off from
    the endangered area of the mine, until the air in such split shall
    contain less than 1.0 volume per centum of methane.
      (3) In virgin territory, if the quantity of air in a split
    ventilating the active workings in such territory equals or exceeds
    twice the minimum volume of air prescribed in subsection (b) of
    this section for the last open crosscut, if the air in the split
    returning from such workings does not pass over trolley wires or
    trolley feeder wires, and if a certified person designated by the
    operator is continually testing the methane content of the air in
    such split during mining operations in such workings, it shall be
    necessary to withdraw all persons, except those referred to in
    section 814(d) of this title, from the area of the mine endangered
    thereby to a safe area and all electric power shall be cut off from
    the endangered area only when the air returning from such workings
    contains 2.0 volume per centum or more of methane.
    (j) Abandoned area air; pre-shift examination
      Air which has passed by an opening of any abandoned area shall
    not be used to ventilate any working place in the coal mine if such
    air contains 0.25 volume per centum or more of methane.
    Examinations of such air shall be made during the pre-shift
    examination required by subsection (d) of this section. In making
    such tests, a certified person designated by the operator shall use
    means approved by the Secretary for detecting methane. For the
    purposes of this subsection, an area within a panel shall not be
    deemed to be abandoned until such panel is abandoned.
    (k) Abandoned area air; inaccessible or unsafe for inspection; air
      from where pillars have been removed
      Air that has passed through an abandoned area or an area which is
    inaccessible or unsafe for inspection shall not be used to
    ventilate any working place in any mine. No air which has been used
    to ventilate an area from which the pillars have been removed shall
    be used to ventilate any working place in a mine, except that such
    air, if it does not contain 0.25 volume per centum or more of
    methane, may be used to ventilate enough advancing working places
    immediately adjacent to the line of retreat to maintain an orderly
    sequence of pillar recovery on a set of entries.
    (l) Methane monitors; required equipment; maintenance; warnings;
      deenergizing of equipment
      The Secretary or his authorized representative shall require, as
    an additional device for detecting concentrations of methane, that
    a methane monitor, approved as reliable by the Secretary after the
    operative date of this subchapter, be installed, when available, on
    any electric face cutting equipment, continuous miner, longwall
    face equipment, and loading machine, except that no monitor shall
    be required to be installed on any such equipment prior to the date
    on which such equipment is required to be permissible under section
    865(a) of this title. When installed on any such equipment, such
    monitor shall be kept operative and properly maintained and
    frequently tested as prescribed by the Secretary. The sensing
    device of such monitor shall be installed as close to the working
    face as practicable. Such monitor shall be set to deenergize
    automatically such equipment when such monitor is not operating
    properly and to give a warning automatically when the concentration
    of methane reaches a maximum percentage determined by an authorized
    representative of the Secretary which shall not be more than 1.0
    volume per centum of methane. An authorized representative of the
    Secretary shall require such monitor to deenergize automatically
    equipment on which it is installed when the concentration of
    methane reaches a maximum percentage determined by such
    representative which shall not be more than 2.0 volume per centum
    of methane.
    (m) Idle area inspections; authorized inspectors
      Idle and abandoned areas shall be inspected for methane and for
    oxygen deficiency and other dangerous conditions by a certified
    person with means approved by the Secretary as soon as possible but
    not more than three hours before other persons are permitted to
    enter or work in such areas. Persons, such as pumpmen, who are
    required regularly to enter such areas in the performance of their
    duties, and who are trained and qualified in the use of means
    approved by the Secretary for detecting methane and in the use of a
    permissible flame safety lamp or other means approved by the
    Secretary for detecting oxygen deficiency are authorized to make
    such examinations for themselves, and each such person shall be
    properly equipped and shall make such examinations upon entering
    any such area.
    (n) Intentional roof falls; prior inspections; safeguards
      Immediately before an intentional roof fall is made, pillar
    workings shall be examined by a qualified person designated by the
    operator to ascertain whether methane is present. Such person shall
    use means approved by the Secretary for detecting methane. If in
    such examination methane is found in amounts of 1.0 volume per
    centum or more, such roof fall shall not be made until changes or
    adjustments are made in the ventilation so that the air shall
    contain less than 1.0 volume per centum of methane.
    (o) Methane and dust control plans; contents
      A ventilation system and methane and dust control plan and
    revisions thereof suitable to the conditions and the mining system
    of the coal mine and approved by the Secretary shall be adopted by
    the operator and set out in printed form within ninety days after
    the operative date of this subchapter. The plan shall show the type
    and location of mechanical ventilation equipment installed and
    operated in the mine, such additional or improved equipment as the
    Secretary may require, the quantity and velocity of air reaching
    each working face, and such other information as the Secretary may
    require. Such plan shall be reviewed by the operator and the
    Secretary at least every six months.
    (p) Devices for detection of methane and oxygen deficiency;
      maintenance
      Each operator shall provide for the proper maintenance and care
    of the permissible flame safety lamp or any other approved device
    for detecting methane and oxygen deficiency by a person trained in
    such maintenance, and, before each shift, care shall be taken to
    insure that such lamp or other device is in a permissible
    condition.
    (q) Pillar recovery; areas without bleeder systems
      Where areas are being pillared on the operative date of this
    subchapter without bleeder entries, or without bleeder systems or
    an equivalent means, pillar recovery may be completed in the area,
    to the extent approved by an authorized representative of the
    Secretary, if the edges of pillar lines adjacent to active workings
    are ventilated with sufficient air to keep the air in open areas
    along the pillar lines below 1.0 volume per centum of methane.
    (r) Overcast and undercast intake air split requirements; time
      extension
      Each mechanized mining section shall be ventilated with a
    separate split of intake air directed by overcasts, undercasts, or
    the equivalent, except an extension of time, not in excess of nine
    months, may be permitted by the Secretary, under such conditions as
    he may prescribe, whenever he determines that this subsection
    cannot be complied with on the operative date of this subchapter.
    (s) Blasting; prior and subsequent examinations for methane
      In all underground areas of a coal mine, immediately before
    firing each shot or group of multiple shots and after blasting is
    completed, examinations for methane shall be made by a qualified
    person with means approved by the Secretary for detecting methane.
    If methane is found in amounts of 1.0 volume per centum or more,
    changes or adjustments shall be made at once in the ventilation so
    that the air shall contain less than 1.0 volume per centum of
    methane. No shots shall be fired until the air contains less than
    1.0 volume per centum of methane.
    (t) Mine fan stop plans; requisites
      Each operator shall adopt a plan within sixty days after the
    operative date of this subchapter which shall provide that when any
    mine fan stops, immediate action shall be taken by the operator or
    his agent (1) to withdraw all persons from the working sections,
    (2) to cut off the power in the mine in a timely manner, (3) to
    provide for restoration of power and resumption of work if
    ventilation is restored within a reasonable period as set forth in
    the plan after the working places and other active workings where
    methane is likely to accumulate are reexamined by a certified
    person to determine if methane in amounts of 1.0 volume per centum
    or more exists therein, and (4) to provide for withdrawal of all
    persons from the mine if ventilation cannot be restored within such
    reasonable time. The plan and revisions thereof approved by the
    Secretary shall be set out in printed form and a copy shall be
    furnished to the Secretary or his authorized representative.
    (u) Modifications affecting main air current or any split;
      withdrawal of personnel; removal of power
      Changes in ventilation which materially affect the main air
    current or any split thereof and which may affect the safety of
    persons in the coal mine shall be made only when the mine is idle.
    Only those persons engaged in making such changes shall be
    permitted in the mine during the change. Power shall be removed
    from the areas affected by the change before work starts to make
    the change and shall not be restored until the effect of the change
    has been ascertained and the affected areas determined to be safe
    by a certified person.
    (v) Reading and countersigning of daily and weekly reports;
      foreman; superintendent
      The mine foreman shall read and countersign promptly the daily
    reports of the pre-shift examiner and assistant mine foremen, and
    he shall read and countersign promptly the weekly report covering
    the examinations for hazardous conditions. Where such reports
    disclose hazardous conditions, they shall be corrected promptly. If
    such conditions create an imminent danger, the operator shall
    withdraw all persons from, or prevent any person from entering, as
    the case may be, the area affected by such conditions, except those
    persons referred to in section 814(d) of this title, until such
    danger is abated. The mine superintendent or assistant
    superintendent of the mine shall also read and countersign the
    daily and weekly reports of such persons.
    (w) Daily mine condition reports; requisites; signatures
      Each day, the mine foreman and each of his assistants shall enter
    plainly and sign with ink or indelible pencil in a book approved by
    the Secretary provided for that purpose a report of the condition
    of the mine or portion thereof under his supervision, which report
    shall state clearly the location and nature of any hazardous
    condition observed by him or reported to him during the day and
    what action was taken to remedy such condition. Such book shall be
    kept in an area on the surface of the mine chosen by the operator
    to minimize the danger of destruction by fire or other hazard, and
    shall be open for inspection by interested persons.
    (x) Reopening of abandoned or declared inactive mine; notification;
      inspection
      Before a coal mine is reopened after having been abandoned or
    declared inactive by the operator, the Secretary shall be notified,
    and an inspection shall be made of the entire mine by an authorized
    representative of the Secretary before mining operations commence.
    (y) Separation of intake and return aircourses from belt haulage
      entries; standards
      (1) In any coal mine opened after the operative date of this
    subchapter, the entries used as intake and return aircourses shall
    be separated from belt haulage entries, and each operator of such
    mine shall limit the velocity of the air coursed through belt
    haulage entries to the amount necessary to provide an adequate
    supply of oxygen in such entries, and to insure that the air
    therein shall contain less than 1.0 volume per centum of methane,
    and such air shall not be used to ventilate active working places.
    Whenever an authorized representative of the Secretary finds, in
    the case of any coal mine opened on or prior to the operative date
    of this subchapter which has been developed with more than two
    entries, that the conditions in the entries, other than belt
    haulage entries, are such as to permit adequately the coursing of
    intake or return air through such entries, (1) the belt haulage
    entries shall not be used to ventilate, unless such entries are
    necessary to ventilate, active working places, and (2) when the
    belt haulage entries are not necessary to ventilate the active
    working places, the operator of such mine shall limit the velocity
    of the air coursed through the belt haulage entries to the amount
    necessary to provide an adequate supply of oxygen in such entries,
    and to insure that the air therein shall contain less than 1.0
    volume per centum of methane.
      (2) In any coal mine opened on or after the operative date of
    this subchapter, or, in the case of a coal mine opened prior to
    such date, in any new working section of such mine, where trolley
    haulage systems are maintained and where trolley wires or trolley
    feeder wires are installed, an authorized representative of the
    Secretary shall require a sufficient number of entries or rooms as
    intake aircourses in order to limit, as prescribed by the
    Secretary, the velocity of air currents on such haulageways for the
    purpose of minimizing the hazards associated with fires and dust
    explosions in such haulageways.
    (z) Pillar extractions; bleeder systems and sealing requirements;
      standards
      (1) While pillars are being extracted in any area of a coal mine,
    such area shall be ventilated in the manner prescribed by this
    section.
      (2) Within nine months after the operative date of this
    subchapter, all areas from which pillars have been wholly or
    partially extracted and abandoned areas, as determined by the
    Secretary or his authorized representative, shall be ventilated by
    bleeder entries or by bleeder systems or equivalent means, or be
    sealed, as determined by the Secretary or his authorized
    representative. When ventilation of such areas is required, such
    ventilation shall be maintained so as continuously to dilute,
    render harmless, and carry away methane and other explosive gases
    within such areas and to protect the active workings of the mine
    from the hazards of such methane and other explosive gases. Air
    coursed through underground areas from which pillars have been
    wholly or partially extracted which enters another split of air
    shall not contain more than 2.0 volume per centum of methane, when
    tested at the point it enters such other split. When sealing is
    required, such seals shall be made in an approved manner so as to
    isolate with explosion-proof bulkheads such areas from the active
    workings of the mine.
      (3) In the case of mines opened on or after the operative date of
    this subchapter, or in the case of working sections opened on or
    after such date in mines opened prior to such date, the mining
    system shall be designed in accordance with a plan and revisions
    thereof approved by the Secretary and adopted by such operator so
    that, as each working section of the mine is abandoned, it can be
    isolated from the active workings of the mine with explosion-proof
    seals or bulkheads.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 864. Combustible materials and rock dusting

-STATUTE-
    (a) Accumulations; maintenance
      Coal dust, including float coal dust deposited on rock-dusted
    surfaces, loose coal, and other combustible materials, shall be
    cleaned up and not be permitted to accumulate in active workings,
    or on electric equipment therein.
    (b) Abatement of hazards in active working areas
      Where underground mining operations in active workings create or
    raise excessive amounts of dust, water or water with a wetting
    agent added to it, or other no less effective methods approved by
    the Secretary or his authorized representative, shall be used to
    abate such dust. In working places, particularly in distances less
    than forty feet from the face, water, with or without a wetting
    agent, or other no less effective methods approved by the Secretary
    or his authorized representative, shall be applied to coal dust on
    the ribs, roof, and floor to reduce dispersibility and to minimize
    the explosion hazard.
    (c) Rock dusting of all areas of underground mines; exceptions
      All underground areas of a coal mine, except those areas in which
    the dust is too wet or too high in incombustible content to
    propagate an explosion, shall be rock dusted to within forty feet
    of all working faces, unless such areas are inaccessible or unsafe
    to enter or unless the Secretary or his authorized representative
    permits an exception upon his finding that such exception will not
    pose a hazard to the miners. All crosscuts that are less than forty
    feet from a working face shall also be rock dusted.
    (d) Distribution of rock dust; places, quantities
      Where rock dust is required to be applied, it shall be
    distributed upon the top, floor, and sides of all underground areas
    of a coal mine and maintained in such quantities that the
    incombustible content of the combined coal dust, rock dust, and
    other dust shall be not less than 65 per centum, but the
    incombustible content in the return aircourses shall be no less
    than 80 per centum. Where methane is present in any ventilating
    current, the per centum of incombustible content of such combined
    dusts shall be increased 1.0 and 0.4 per centum for each 0.1 per
    centum of methane where 65 and 80 per centum, respectively, of
    incombustibles are required.
    (e) Limitation of applicability
      Subsections (b) through (d) of this section shall not apply to
    underground anthracite mines.

    statement listing all electric face equipment by type and
    manufacturer being used by such operator in connection with mining
    operations in such mine as of the date of such filing, and stating
    whether such equipment is permissible and maintained in permissible
    condition or is nonpermissible on such date of filing, and, if
    nonpermissible, whether such nonpermissible equipment has ever been
    rated as permissible, and such other information as the Secretary
    may require.
      (5) The Secretary shall promptly conduct a survey as to the total
    availability of new or rebuilt permissible electric face equipment
    and replacement parts for such equipment and, within six months
    after the operative date of this subchapter, publish the results of
    such survey.

    provisions of paragraph (1)(D) of this subsection within one year
    after the operative date of this subchapter may file with the Panel
    an application for a permit for noncompliance. If the Panel
    determines that such application satisfies the provisions of
    paragraph (10) of this subsection, the Panel shall issue to such
    operator a permit for noncompliance. Such permit shall entitle the
    permittee to an extension of time to comply with such provisions of
    paragraph (1)(D) of not to exceed twelve months, as determined by
    the Panel, from the date that compliance with the provisions of
    paragraph (1)(D) of this subsection is required.
      (7) Any operator of a coal mine issued a permit under paragraph
    (6) of this subsection who, ninety days prior to the termination of
    such permit, or renewal thereof, determines that he will be unable
    to comply with the provisions of paragraph (1)(D) of this
    subsection upon the expiration of such permit may file with the
    Panel an application for renewal thereof. Upon receipt of such
    application, the Panel, if it determines, after notice to all
    interested persons and an opportunity for a public hearing under
    section 804 of this title, that such application satisfies the
    provisions of paragraph (10) of this subsection and that such
    operator, despite his diligent efforts, will be unable to comply
    with the provisions of paragraph (1)(D), may renew the permit for a

        subject to review and approval by the Secretary. In determining
        whether to approve a particular plan the Secretary shall take
        into consideration all comments submitted by miners or their
        representatives. Approved plans shall - 
            (i) afford miners a level of safety protection at least
          consistent with the existing standards, including standards
          mandated by law and regulation;
            (ii) reflect the most recent credible scientific research;
            (iii) be technologically feasible, make use of current
          commercially available technology, and account for the
          specific physical characteristics of the mine; and
            (iv) reflect the improvements in mine safety gained from
          experience under this chapter and other worker safety and
          health laws.
        (D) Plan review
          The accident response plan under subparagraph (A) shall be
        reviewed periodically, but at least every 6 months, by the
        Secretary. In such periodic reviews, the Secretary shall
        consider all comments submitted by miners or miners'
        representatives and intervening advancements in science and
        technology that could be implemented to enhance miners' ability
        to evacuate or otherwise survive in an emergency.
        (E) Plan content-general requirements
          To be approved under subparagraph (C), an accident response
        plan shall include the following:
          (i) Post-accident communications
            The plan shall provide for a redundant means of
          communication with the surface for persons underground, such
          as secondary telephone or equivalent two-way communication.
          (ii) Post-accident tracking
            Consistent with commercially available technology and with
          the physical constraints, if any, of the mine, the plan shall
          provide for above ground personnel to determine the current,
          or immediately pre-accident, location of all underground
          personnel. Any system so utilized shall be functional,
          reliable, and calculated to remain serviceable in a post-
          accident setting.
          (iii) Post-accident breathable air
            The plan shall provide for - 
              (I) emergency supplies of breathable air for individuals
            trapped underground sufficient to maintain such individuals
            for a sustained period of time;
              (II) in addition to the 2 hours of breathable air per
            miner required by law under the emergency temporary
            standard as of the day before June 15, 2006, caches of self-
            rescuers providing in the aggregate not less than 2 hours
            per miner to be kept in escapeways from the deepest work
            area to the surface at a distance of no further than an
            average miner could walk in 30 minutes;
              (III) a maintenance schedule for checking the reliability
            of self rescuers, retiring older self-rescuers first, and
            introducing new self-rescuer technology, such as units with
            interchangeable air or oxygen cylinders not requiring
            doffing to replenish airflow and units with supplies of
            greater than 60 minutes, as they are approved by the
            Administration and become available on the market; and
              (IV) training for each miner in proper procedures for
            donning self-rescuers, switching from one unit to another,
            and ensuring a proper fit.
          (iv) Post-accident lifelines
            The plan shall provide for the use of flame-resistant
          directional lifelines or equivalent systems in escapeways to
          enable evacuation. The flame-resistance requirement of this
          clause shall apply upon the replacement of existing
          lifelines, or, in the case of lifelines in working sections,
          upon the earlier of the replacement of such lifelines or 3
          years after June 15, 2006.
          (v) Training
            The plan shall provide a training program for emergency
          procedures described in the plan which will not diminish the
          requirements for mandatory health and safety training
          currently required under section 825 of this title.
          (vi) Local coordination
            The plan shall set out procedures for coordination and
          communication between the operator, mine rescue teams, and
          local emergency response personnel and make provisions for
          familiarizing local rescue personnel with surface functions
          that may be required in the course of mine rescue work.
        (F) Plan content-specific requirements
          (i) In general
            In addition to the content requirements contained in
          subparagraph (E), and subject to the considerations contained
          in subparagraph (C), the Secretary may make additional plan
          requirements with respect to any of the content matters.
          (ii) Post accident communications
            Not later than 3 years after June 15, 2006, a plan shall,
          to be approved, provide for post accident communication
          between underground and surface personnel via a wireless two-
          way medium, and provide for an electronic tracking system
          permitting surface personnel to determine the location of any
          persons trapped underground or set forth within the plan the
          reasons such provisions can not be adopted. Where such plan
          sets forth the reasons such provisions can not be adopted,
          the plan shall also set forth the operator's alternative
          means of compliance. Such alternative shall approximate, as
          closely as possible, the degree of functional utility and
          safety protection provided by the wireless two-way medium and
          tracking system referred to in this subpart.(!1)

        (G) Plan dispute resolution
          (i) In general
            Any dispute between the Secretary and an operator with
          respect to the content of the operator's plan or any refusal
          by the Secretary to approve such a plan shall be resolved on
          an expedited basis.
          (ii) Disputes
            In the event of a dispute or refusal described in clause
          (i), the Secretary shall issue a citation which shall be
          immediately referred to a Commission Administrative Law
          Judge. The Secretary and the operator shall submit all
          relevant material regarding the dispute to the Administrative
          Law Judge within 15 days of the date of the referral. The
          Administrative Law Judge shall render his or her decision
          with respect to the plan content dispute within 15 days of
          the receipt of the submission.
          (iii) Further appeals
            A party adversely affected by a decision under clause (ii)
          may pursue all further available appeal rights with respect
          to the citation involved, except that inclusion of the
          disputed provision in the plan will not be limited by such
          appeal unless such relief is requested by the operator and
          permitted by the Administrative Law Judge.
        (H) Maintaining protections for miners
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, nothing
        in this section, and no response and preparedness plan
        developed under this section, shall be approved if it reduces
        the protection afforded miners by an existing mandatory health
        or safety standard.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 877. General safety provisions

-STATUTE-
    (a) Location of oil and gas wells; establishment and maintenance of
      barriers; minimum requisites; exceptions
      Each operator of a coal mine shall take reasonable measures to
    locate oil and gas wells penetrating coalbeds or any underground
    area of a coal mine. When located, such operator shall establish
    and maintain barriers around such oil and gas wells in accordance
    with State laws and regulations, except that such barriers shall
    not be less than three hundred feet in diameter, unless the
    Secretary or his authorized representative permits a lesser barrier
    consistent with the applicable State laws and regulations where
    such lesser barrier will be adequate to protect against hazards
    from such wells to the miners in such mine, or unless the Secretary
    or his authorized representative requires a greater barrier where
    the depth of the mine, other geologic conditions, or other factors
    warrant such a greater barrier.
    (b) Boreholes in advance of work face; distance in advance of work
      face; distance between boreholes
      Whenever any working place approaches within fifty feet of
    abandoned areas in the mine as shown by surveys made and certified
    by a registered engineer or surveyor, or within two hundred feet of
    any other abandoned areas of the mine which cannot be inspected and
    which may contain dangerous accumulations of water or gas, or
    within two hundred feet of any workings of an adjacent mine, a
    borehole or boreholes shall be drilled to a distance of at least
    twenty feet in advance of the working face of such working place
    and shall be continually maintained to a distance of at least ten
    feet in advance of the advancing working face. When there is more
    than one borehole, they shall be drilled sufficiently close to each
    other to insure that the advancing working face will not
    accidentally hole through into abandoned areas or adjacent mines.
    Boreholes shall also be drilled not more than eight feet apart in
    the rib of such working place to a distance of at least twenty feet
    and at an angle of forty-five degrees. Such rib holes shall be
    drilled in one or both ribs of such working place as may be
    necessary for adequate protection of miners in such place.
    (c) Prohibition against smoking; implementation programs
      No person shall smoke, carry smoking materials, matches, or
    lighters underground, or smoke in or around oil houses, explosives
    magazines, or other surface areas where such practice may cause a
    fire or explosion. The operator shall institute a program, approved
    by the Secretary, to insure that any person entering the
    underground area of the mine does not carry smoking materials,
    matches, or lighters.
    (d) Portable electric lamps; exceptions
      Persons underground shall use only permissible electric lamps
    approved by the Secretary for portable illumination. No open flame
    shall be permitted in the underground area of any coal mine, except
    as permitted under section 871(d) of this title.
    (e) Promulgation of lighting standards
      Within nine months after the operative date of this subchapter,
    the Secretary shall propose the standards under which all working
    places in a mine shall be illuminated by permissible lighting,
    within eighteen months after the promulgation of such standards,
    while persons are working in such places.
    (f) Escapeways; ventilation; maintenance; tests of passageways;
      protection of entrance; connection between mine openings
      (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this
    subsection, at least two separate and distinct travelable
    passageways which are maintained to insure passage at all times of
    any person, including disabled persons, and which are to be
    designated as escapeways, at least one of which is ventilated with
    intake air, shall be provided from each working section continuous
    to the surface escape drift opening, or continuous to the escape
    shaft or slope facilities to the surface, as appropriate, and shall
    be maintained in safe condition and properly marked. Mine openings
    shall be adequately protected to prevent the entrance into the
    underground area of the mine of surface fires, fumes, smoke, and
    flood water. Escape facilities approved by the Secretary or his
    authorized representative, properly maintained and frequently
    tested, shall be present at or in each escape shaft or slope to
    allow all persons, including disabled persons, to escape quickly to
    the surface in the event of an emergency.
      (2) When new coal mines are opened, not more than twenty miners
    shall be allowed at any one time in any mine until a connection has
    been made between the two mine openings, and such connections shall
    be made as soon as possible.
      (3) When only one mine opening is available, owing to final
    mining of pillars, not more than twenty miners shall be allowed in
    such mine at any one time, and the distance between the mine
    opening and working face shall not exceed five hundred feet.
      (4) In the case of all coal mines opened on or after the
    operative date of this subchapter, and in the case of all new
    working sections opened on or after such date in mines opened prior
    to such date, the escapeway required by this section to be
    ventilated with intake air shall be separated from the belt and
    trolley haulage entries of the mine for the entire length of such
    entries to the beginning of each working section, except that the
    Secretary or his authorized representative may permit such
    separation to be extended for a greater or lesser distance so long
    as such extension does not pose a hazard to the miners.
    (g) Erection of fireproof structures; prior existing structures;
      fire doors; monthly tests; records; availability
      After the operative date of this subchapter, all structures
    erected on the surface within one hundred feet of any mine opening
    shall be of fireproof construction. Unless structures existing on
    or prior to such date which are located within one hundred feet of
    any mine opening are of such construction, fire doors shall be
    erected at effective points in mine openings to prevent smoke or
    fire from outside sources endangering miners underground. These
    doors shall be tested at least monthly to insure effective
    operation. A record of such tests shall be kept in an area on the
    surface of the mine chosen by the operator to minimize the danger
    of destruction by fire or other hazard and shall be available for
    inspection by interested persons.
    (h) Prevention of accumulations of coal dust and methane gas;
      surface coal-handling facilities; air-intake openings
      Adequate measures shall be taken to prevent methane and coal dust
    from accumulating in excessive concentrations in or on surface coal-
    handling facilities, but in no event shall methane be permitted to
    accumulate in concentrations in or on surface coal-handling
    facilities in excess of limits established for methane by the
    Secretary within one year after the operative date of this
    subchapter. Where coal is dumped at or near air-intake openings,
    provisions shall be made to avoid dust from entering the mine.
    (i) Training programs
      Every operator of a coal mine shall provide a program, approved
    by the Secretary, of training and retraining of both qualified and
    certified persons needed to carry out functions prescribed in this
    chapter.
    (j) Electric face equipment; installation of canopies
      An authorized representative of the Secretary may require in any
    coal mine where the height of the coalbed permits that electric
    face equipment, including shuttle cars, be provided with
    substantially constructed canopies or cabs to protect the miners
    operating such equipment from roof falls and from rib and face
    rolls.
    (k) Mine entrances; sealing; prevention of entry by unauthorized
      personnel
      On and after the operative date of this subchapter, the opening
    of any coal mine that is declared inactive by its operator or is
    permanently closed or abandoned for more than ninety days, shall be
    sealed by the operator in a manner prescribed by the Secretary.
    Openings of all other mines shall be adequately protected in a
    manner prescribed by the Secretary to prevent entrance by
    unauthorized persons.
    (l) Facilities for changing and storing clothes; toilet and bathing
      facilities
      The Secretary may require any operator to provide adequate
    facilities for the miners to change from the clothes worn
    underground, to provide for the storing of such clothes from shift
    to shift, and to provide sanitary and bathing facilities. Sanitary
    toilet facilities shall be provided in the active workings of the
    mine when such surface facilities are not readily accessible to the
    active workings.
    (m) Emergency medical assistance preparations; locations for
      medical equipment; filing of implementation plans
      Each operator shall make arrangements in advance for obtaining
    emergency medical assistance and transportation for injured
    persons. Emergency communications shall be provided to the nearest
    point of assistance. Selected agents of the operator shall be
    trained in first aid and first aid training shall be made available
    to all miners. Each coal mine shall have an adequate supply of
    first aid equipment located on the surface, at the bottom of shafts
    and slopes, and at other strategic locations near the working
    faces. In fulfilling each of the requirements of this subsection,
    the operator shall meet at least minimum requirements prescribed by
    the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Within two months after
    the operative date of this subchapter, each operator shall file
    with the Secretary a plan setting forth in such detail as the
    Secretary may require the manner in which such operator has
    fulfilled the requirements in this subsection.
    (n) Self-rescue device; training of personnel
      A self-rescue device approved by the Secretary shall be made
    available to each miner by the operator which shall be adequate to
    protect such miner for one hour or longer. Each operator shall
    train each miner in the use of such device.
    (o) Methods of eliminating oxygen deficiencies
      The Secretary shall prescribe improved methods of assuring that
    miners are not exposed to atmospheres that are deficient in oxygen.
    (p) Identification check system; records
      Each operator of a coal mine shall establish a check-in and check-
    out system which will provide positive identification of every
    person underground, and will provide an accurate record of the
    persons in the mine kept on the surface in a place chosen to
    minimize the danger of destruction by fire or other hazard. Such
    record shall bear a number identical to an identification check
    that is securely fastened to the lamp belt worn by the person
    underground. The identification check shall be made of a rust
    resistant metal of not less than sixteen gauge.
    (q) Installation of devices to prevent and suppress ignition on
      electric cutting face equipment
      The Secretary shall require, when technologically feasible, that
    devices to prevent and suppress ignitions be installed on electric
    face cutting equipment.
    (r) Tunnelling under water; permits; contents; necessity; safety
      zones; restrictions
      Whenever an operator mines coal from a coal mine opened after the
    operative date of this subchapter, or from any new working section
    of a mine opened prior to such date, in a manner that requires the
    construction, operation, and maintenance of tunnels under any
    river, stream, lake, or other body of water, that is, in the
    judgment of the Secretary, sufficiently large to constitute a
    hazard to miners, such operator shall obtain a permit from the
    Secretary which shall include such terms and conditions as he deems
    appropriate to protect the safety of miners working or passing
    through such tunnels from cave-ins and other hazards. Such permits
    shall require, in accordance with a plan to be approved by the
    Secretary, that a safety zone be established beneath and adjacent
    to such body of water. No plan shall be approved unless there is a
    minimum of cover to be determined by the Secretary, based on test
    holes drilled by the operator in a manner to be prescribed by the
    Secretary. No such permit shall be required in the case of any new
    working section of a mine which is located under any water resource
    reservoir being constructed by a Federal agency on December 30,
    1969, the operator of which is required by such agency to operate
    in a manner that adequately protects the safety of miners working
    in such section from cave-ins and other hazards.
    (s) Drinking water
      An adequate supply of potable water shall be provided for
    drinking purposes in the active workings of the mine, and such
    water shall be carried, stored, and otherwise protected in sanitary
    containers.
    (t) Standards for prevention of explosions from nonmethane gases
      and for testing for accumulations
      Within one year after the operative date of this subchapter, the
    Secretary shall propose standards for preventing explosions from
    explosive gases other than methane and for testing for
    accumulations of such gases.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Congress finds and declares that there are a significant
    number of coal miners living today who are totally disabled due to
    pneumoconiosis arising out of employment in one or more of the
    Nation's coal mines; that there are a number of survivors of coal
    miners whose deaths were due to this disease; and that few States
    provide benefits for death or disability due to this disease to
    coal miners or their surviving dependents. It is, therefore, the
    purpose of this subchapter to provide benefits, in cooperation with
    the States, to coal miners who are totally disabled due to
    pneumoconiosis and to the surviving dependents of miners whose
    death was due to such disease; and to ensure that in the future
    adequate benefits are provided to coal miners and their dependents
    in the event of their death or total disability due to
    pneumoconiosis.
      (b) This subchapter may be cited as the "Black Lung Benefits
    Act".

    Part A - General Provisions

-HEAD-
    Sec. 902. Definitions

-STATUTE-
      For purposes of this subchapter - 
      (a) The term "dependent" means - 
        (1) a child as defined in subsection (g) of this section
      without regard to subparagraph (2)(B)(ii) thereof; or
        (2) a wife who is a member of the same household as the miner,
      or is receiving regular contributions from the miner for her
      support, or whose husband is a miner who has been ordered by a
      court to contribute to her support, or who meets the requirements
      of section 416(b)(1) or (2) of title 42. The determination of an
      individual's status as the "wife" of a miner shall be made in
      accordance with section 416(h)(1) of title 42 as if such miner
      were the "insured individual" referred to therein. The term
      "wife" also includes a "divorced wife" as defined in section
      416(d)(1) of title 42 who is receiving at least one-half of her
      support, as determined in accordance with regulations prescribed
      by the Secretary, from the miner, or is receiving substantial
      contributions from the miner (pursuant to a written agreement),
      or there is in effect a court order for substantial contributions
      to her support from such miner.

      (b) The term "pneumoconiosis" means a chronic dust disease of the
    lung and its sequelae, including respiratory and pulmonary
    impairments, arising out of coal mine employment.

    provided, means the Secretary of Labor.
      (d) The term "miner" means any individual who works or has worked
    in or around a coal mine or coal preparation facility in the
    extraction or preparation of coal. Such term also includes an
    individual who works or has worked in coal mine construction or
    transportation in or around a coal mine, to the extent such
    individual was exposed to coal dust as a result of such employment.
      (e) The term "widow" includes the wife living with or dependent
    for support on the miner at the time of his death, or living apart
    for reasonable cause or because of his desertion, or who meets the

    the Secretary, from the miner, or was receiving substantial
    contributions from the miner (pursuant to a written agreement) or
    there was in effect a court order for substantial contributions to
    her support from the miner at the time of his death.

    under part C of this subchapter, subject to the relevant provisions
    of subsections (b) and (d) of section 923 of this title, except
    that - 
        (A) in the case of a living miner, such regulations shall
      provide that a miner shall be considered totally disabled when
      pneumoconiosis prevents him or her from engaging in gainful
      employment requiring the skills and abilities comparable to those
      of any employment in a mine or mines in which he or she
      previously engaged with some regularity and over a substantial
      period of time;
        (B) such regulations shall provide that (i) a deceased miner's
      employment in a mine at the time of death shall not be used as
      conclusive evidence that the miner was not totally disabled; and

      is not totally disabled;
        (C) such regulations shall not provide more restrictive
      criteria than those applicable under section 423(d) of title 42;
      and
        (D) the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Director
      of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health,
      shall establish criteria for all appropriate medical tests under
      this subsection which accurately reflect total disability in coal
      miners as defined in subparagraph (A).

      (2) Criteria applied by the Secretary of Labor in the case of - 
        (A) any claim arising under part B of this subchapter or
      subject to a determination by the Secretary of Labor under
      section 945(a) (!1) of this title;
        (B) any claim which is subject to review by the Secretary of
      Labor under section 945(b) (!1) of this title; and
        (C) any claim filed on or before the effective date of
      regulations promulgated under this subsection by the Secretary of
      Labor;

    shall not be more restrictive than the criteria applicable to a
    claim filed on June 30, 1973, whether or not the final disposition
    of any such claim occurs after the date of such promulgation of
    regulations by the Secretary of Labor.
      (g) The term "child" means a child or a step-child who is - 
        (1) unmarried; and
        (2)(A) under eighteen years of age, or

    the "child" of the miner or widow, as the case may be, shall be
    made in accordance with section 416(h)(2) or (3) of title 42 as if
    such miner or widow were the "insured individual" referred to
    therein.
      (h) The term "fund" means the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund
    established by section 9501 of title 26.
      (i) For the purposes of subsections (c) and (j) of section 932 of

    Sec. 921. Regulations and presumptions

-STATUTE-
    (a) Promulgation; payment of benefits
      The Secretary shall, in accordance with the provisions of this
    part, and the regulations promulgated by him under this part, make
    payments of benefits in respect of total disability of any miner
    due to pneumoconiosis, and in respect of the death of any miner
    whose death was due to pneumoconiosis or, except with respect to a
    claim filed under part C of this subchapter on or after the
    effective date of the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981, who
    at the time of his death was totally disabled by pneumoconiosis.
    (b) Promulgation of standards determining total disability
      The Secretary shall by regulation prescribe standards for
    determining for purposes of subsection (a) of this section whether
    a miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis and for
    determining whether the death of a miner was due to pneumoconiosis.
    Regulations required by this subsection shall be promulgated and
    published in the Federal Register at the earliest practicable date
    after December 30, 1969, and in no event later than the end of the
    third month following December 1969. Final regulations required for
    implementation of any amendments to this subchapter shall be
    promulgated and published in the Federal Register at the earliest
    practicable date after the date of enactment of such amendments,
    and in no event later than the end of the fourth month following
    the month in which such amendments are enacted. Such regulations
    may be modified or additional regulations promulgated from time to
    time thereafter.
    (c) Presumptions
      For purposes of this section - 
        (1) If a miner who is suffering or suffered from pneumoconiosis
      was employed for ten years or more in one or more coal mines
      there shall be a rebuttable presumption that his pneumoconiosis
      arose out of such employment.
        (2) If a deceased miner was employed for ten years or more in
      one or more coal mines and died from a respirable disease there
      shall be a rebuttable presumption that his death was due to
      pneumoconiosis. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply
      with respect to claims filed on or after the effective date of
      the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981.
        (3) If a miner is suffering or suffered from a chronic dust
      disease of the lung which (A) when diagnosed by chest
      roentgenogram, yields one or more large opacities (greater than
      one centimeter in diameter) and would be classified in category
      A, B, or C in the International Classification of Radiographs of
      the Pneumoconioses by the International Labor Organization, (B)
      when diagnosed by biopsy or autopsy, yields massive lesions in
      the lung, or (C) when diagnosis is made by other means, would be
      a condition which could reasonably be expected to yield results
      described in clause (A) or (B) if diagnosis had been made in the
      manner prescribed in clause (A) or (B), then there shall be an
      irrebuttable presumption that he is totally disabled due to
      pneumoconiosis or that his death was due to pneumoconiosis, or
      that at the time of his death he was totally disabled by
      pneumoconiosis.(!1) as the case may be.

        (4) if (!2) a miner was employed for fifteen years or more in
      one or more underground coal mines, and if there is a chest
      roentgenogram submitted in connection with such miner's, his
      widow's, his child's, his parent's, his brother's, his sister's,
      or his dependent's claim under this subchapter and it is
      interpreted as negative with respect to the requirements of
      paragraph (3) of this subsection, and if other evidence
      demonstrates the existence of a totally disabling respiratory or
      pulmonary impairment, then there shall be a rebuttable
      presumption that such miner is totally disabled due to
      pneumoconiosis, that his death was due to pneumoconiosis, or that
      at the time of his death he was totally disabled by
      pneumoconiosis. In the case of a living miner, a wife's affidavit
      may not be used by itself to establish the presumption. The
      Secretary shall not apply all or a portion of the requirement of
      this paragraph that the miner work in an underground mine where
      he determines that conditions of a miner's employment in a coal
      mine other than an underground mine were substantially similar to
      conditions in an underground mine. The Secretary may rebut such
      presumption only by establishing that (A) such miner does not, or
      did not, have pneumoconiosis, or that (B) his respiratory or
      pulmonary impairment did not arise out of, or in connection with,
      employment in a coal mine. The provisions of this paragraph shall
      not apply with respect to claims filed on or after the effective
      date of the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981.

        (5) In the case of a miner who dies on or before March 1, 1978,
      who was employed for 25 years or more in one or more coal mines
      before June 30, 1971, the eligible survivors of such miner shall
      be entitled to the payment of benefits, at the rate applicable
      under section 922(a)(2) of this title, unless it is established
      that at the time of his or her death such miner was not partially
      or totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis. Eligible survivors
      shall, upon request by the Secretary, furnish such evidence as is
      available with respect to the health of the miner at the time of
      his or her death. The provisions of this paragraph shall not
      apply with respect to claims filed on or after the day that is
      180 days after the effective date of the Black Lung Benefits
      Amendments of 1981.
    (d) Applicability of presumptions
      Nothing in subsection (c) of this section shall be deemed to
    affect the applicability of subsection (a) of this section in the
    case of a claim where the presumptions provided for therein are
    inapplicable.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 922. Payment of benefits

-STATUTE-
    (a) Schedules
      Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section,
    benefit payments shall be made by the Secretary under this part as
    follows:
      (1) In the case of total disability of a miner due to
    pneumoconiosis, the disabled miner shall be paid benefits during
    the disability at a rate equal to 37 1/2  per centum of the monthly
    pay rate for Federal employees in grade GS-2, step 1.
      (2) In the case of death of a miner due to pneumoconiosis or,
    except with respect to a claim filed under part C of this
    subchapter on or after the effective date of the Black Lung
    Benefits Amendments of 1981, of a miner receiving benefits under
    this part, benefits shall be paid to his widow (if any) at the rate
    the deceased miner would receive such benefits if he were totally
    disabled.
      (3) In the case of the child or children of a miner whose death
    is due to pneumoconiosis or, except with respect to a claim filed
    under part C of this subchapter on or after the effective date of
    the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981, of a miner who is
    receiving benefits under this part at the time of his death or who
    was totally disabled by pneumoconiosis at the time of his death, in
    the case of the child or children of a widow who is receiving
    benefits under this part at the time of her death, and in the case
    of any child or children entitled to the payment of benefits under
    paragraph (5) of section 921(c) of this title, benefits shall be
    paid to such child or children as follows: If there is one such
    child, he shall be paid benefits at the rate specified in paragraph
    (1). If there is more than one such child, the benefits paid shall
    be divided equally among them and shall be paid at a rate equal to
    the rate specified in paragraph (1), increased by 50 per centum of
    such rate if there are two such children, by 75 per centum of such
    rate if there are three such children, and by 100 per centum of
    such rate if there are more than three such children: Provided,
    That benefits shall only be paid to a child for so long as he meets
    the criteria for the term "child" contained in section 902(g) of
    this title: And provided further, That no entitlement to benefits
    as a child shall be established under this paragraph (3) for any
    month for which entitlement to benefits as a widow is established
    under paragraph (2).
      (4) In the case of an individual entitled to benefit payments
    under clause (1) or (2) of this subsection who has one or more
    dependents, the benefit payments shall be increased at the rate of
    50 per centum of such benefit payments, if such individual has one
    dependent, 75 per centum if such individual has two dependents, and
    100 per centum if such individual has three or more dependents.
      (5) In the case of the dependent parent or parents of a miner
    whose death is due to pneumoconiosis, or, except with respect to a
    claim filed under part C of this subchapter on or after the
    effective date of the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981, of a
    miner who is receiving benefits under this part at the time of his
    death or who was totally disabled by pneumoconiosis at the time of
    death, and who is not survived at the time of his death by a widow
    or a child, in the case of the dependent surviving brother(s) or
    sister(s) of such a miner who is not survived at the time of his
    death by a widow, child, or parent, in the case of the dependent
    parent or parents of a miner (who is not survived at the time of
    his or her death by a widow or a child) who are entitled to the
    payment of benefits under paragraph (5) of section 921(c) of this
    title, or in the case of the dependent surviving brother(s) or
    sister(s) of a miner (who is not survived at the time of his or her
    death by a widow, child, or parent) who are entitled to the payment
    of benefits under paragraph (5) of section 921(c) of this title,
    benefits shall be paid under this part to such parent(s), or to
    such brother(s), or sister(s), at the rate specified in paragraph
    (3) (as if such parent(s) or such brother(s) or sister(s), were the
    children of such miner). In determining for purposes of this
    paragraph whether a claimant bears the relationship as the miner's
    parent, brother, or sister, the Secretary shall apply legal
    standards consistent with those applicable to relationship
    determination under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.
    401 et seq.]. No benefits to a sister or brother shall be payable
    under this paragraph for any month beginning with the month in
    which he or she receives support from his or her spouse, or
    marries. Benefits shall be payable under this paragraph to a
    brother only if he is - 
        (1)(A) under eighteen years of age, or
        (B) under a disability as defined in section 223(d) of the
      Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 423(d)] which began before the age
      specified in section 202(d)(1)(B)(ii) of such Act [42 U.S.C.
      402(d)(1)(B)(ii)], or in the case of a student, before he ceased
      to be a student, or
        (C) a student as defined in section 902(g) of this title; or
        (2) who is, at the time of the miner's death, disabled as
      determined in accordance with section 223(d) of the Social
      Security Act [42 U.S.C. 423(d)], during such disability. Any
      benefit under this paragraph for a month prior to the month in
      which a claim for such benefit is filed shall be reduced to any
      extent that may be necessary, so that it will not render
      erroneous any benefit which, before the filing of such claim, the
      Secretary has certified for payment for such prior months. As
      used in this paragraph, "dependent" means that during the one
      year period prior to and ending with such miner's death, such
      parent, brother, or sister was living in the miner's household,
      and was, during such period, totally dependent on the miner for
      support. Proof of such support shall be filed by such claimant
      within two years after May 1972, or within two years after the
      miner's death, whichever is the later. Any such proof which is
      filed after the expiration of such period shall be deemed to have
      been filed within such period if it is shown to the satisfaction
      of the Secretary that there was good cause for failure to file
      such proof within such period. The determination of what
      constitutes "living in the miner's household", "totally dependent
      upon the miner for support," and "good cause," shall for purposes
      of this paragraph be made in accordance with regulations of the
      Secretary. Benefit payments under this paragraph to a parent,
      brother, or sister, shall be reduced by the amount by which such
      payments would be reduced on account of excess earnings of such
      parent, brother, or sister, respectively, under section 203(b)-
      (l) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 403(b)-(l)], as if the
      benefit under this paragraph were a benefit under section 202 of
      such Act [42 U.S.C. 402].

      (6) If an individual's benefits would be increased under
    paragraph (4) of this subsection because he or she has one or more
    dependents, and it appears to the Secretary that it would be in the
    interest of any such dependent to have the amount of such increase
    in benefits (to the extent attributable to such dependent)
    certified to a person other than such individual, then the
    Secretary may, under regulations prescribed by him, certify the
    amount of such increase in benefits (to the extent so attributable)
    not to such individual but directly to such dependent or to another
    person for the use and benefit of such dependent; and any payment
    made under this clause, if otherwise valid under this subchapter,
    shall be a complete settlement and satisfaction of all claims,
    rights, and interests in and to such payment.
    (b) Reduction of benefits
      Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, benefit payments
    under this section to a miner or his widow, child, parent, brother,
    or sister shall be reduced, on a monthly or other appropriate
    basis, by an amount equal to any payment received by such miner or
    his widow, child, parent, brother, or sister under the workmen's
    compensation, unemployment compensation, or disability insurance
    laws of his State on account of the disability of such miner due to
    pneumoconiosis, and the amount by which such payment would be
    reduced on account of excess earnings of such miner under section
    203(b) through (l) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 403(b) to
    (l)] if the amount paid were a benefit payable under section 202 of
    such Act [42 U.S.C. 402]. This part shall not be considered a
    workmen's compensation law or plan for purposes of section 224 of
    such Act [42 U.S.C. 424a].
    (c) Reporting of income
      Benefits payable under this part shall be deemed not to be income
    for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 923. Filing of notice of claim

-STATUTE-
    (a) Promulgation of regulations; time requirement
      Except as otherwise provided in section 924 of this title, no
    payment of benefits shall be made under this part except pursuant
    to a claim filed therefor on or before December 31, 1973, in such
    manner, in such form, and containing such information, as the
    Secretary shall by regulation prescribe.
    (b) Utilization of personnel and procedures; evidence required to
      establish claim; medical evidence; affidavits; autopsy reports;
      reimbursement of expenses
      No claim for benefits under this part shall be denied solely on
    the basis of the results of a chest roentgenogram. In determining
    the validity of claims under this part, all relevant evidence shall
    be considered, including, where relevant, medical tests such as
    blood gas studies, X-ray examination, electrocardiogram, pulmonary
    function studies, or physical performance tests, and any medical
    history, evidence submitted by the claimant's physician, or his
    wife's affidavits, and in the case of a deceased miner, other
    appropriate affidavits of persons with knowledge of the miner's
    physical condition, and other supportive materials. Where there is
    no medical or other relevant evidence in the case of a deceased
    miner, such affidavits, from persons not eligible for benefits in
    such case with respect to claims filed on or after the effective
    date of the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981, shall be
    considered to be sufficient to establish that the miner was totally
    disabled due to pneumoconiosis or that his or her death was due to
    pneumoconiosis. In any case, other than that involving a claim
    filed on or after the effective date of the Black Lung Benefits
    Amendments of 1981, in which there is other evidence that a miner
    has a pulmonary or respiratory impairment, the Secretary shall
    accept a board certified or board eligible radiologist's
    interpretation of a chest roentgenogram which is of a quality
    sufficient to demonstrate the presence of pneumoconiosis submitted
    in support of a claim for benefits under this subchapter if such
    roentgenogram has been taken by a radiologist or qualified
    technician, except where the Secretary has reason to believe that
    the claim has been fraudulently represented. In order to insure
    that any such roentgenogram is of adequate quality to demonstrate
    the presence of pneumoconiosis, and in order to provide for uniform
    quality in the roentgenograms, the Secretary of Labor may, by
    regulation, establish specific requirements for the techniques used
    to take roentgenograms of the chest. Unless the Secretary has good
    cause to believe that an autopsy report is not accurate, or that
    the condition of the miner is being fraudulently misrepresented,
    the Secretary shall accept such autopsy report concerning the
    presence of pneumoconiosis and the stage of advancement of
    pneumoconiosis. Claimants under this part shall be reimbursed for
    reasonable medical expenses incurred by them in establishing their
    claims. For purposes of determining total disability under this
    part, the provisions of subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), and (g) of
    section 221 of such Act [42 U.S.C. 421(a) to (d), (g)] shall be
    applicable. The provisions of sections 204, 205(a), (b), (d), (e),
    (g), (h), (j), (k), (l), and (n), 206, 207, and 208 of the Social
    Security Act [42 U.S.C. 404, 405(a), (b), (d), (e), (g), (h), (j),
    (k), (l), and (n), 406, 407, 408] shall be applicable under this
    part with respect to a miner, widow, child, parent, brother,
    sister, or dependent, as if benefits under this part were benefits
    under title II of such Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.]. Each miner who
    files a claim for benefits under this subchapter shall upon request
    be provided an opportunity to substantiate his or her claim by
    means of a complete pulmonary evaluation.
    (c) Filing of claim for workmen's compensation; necessity;
      exceptions
      No claim for benefits under this section shall be considered
    unless the claimant has also filed a claim under the applicable
    State workmen's compensation law prior to or at the same time his
    claim was filed for benefits under this section; except that the
    foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall not apply in any case
    in which the filing of a claim under such law would clearly be
    futile because the period within which such a claim may be filed
    thereunder has expired or because pneumoconiosis is not compensable
    under such law, or in any other situation in which, in the opinion
    of the Secretary, the filing of a claim would clearly be futile.
    (d) Employment termination and benefits entitlement
      No miner who is engaged in coal mine employment shall (except as
    provided in section 921(c)(3) of this title) be entitled to any
    benefits under this part while so employed. Any miner who has been
    determined to be eligible for benefits pursuant to a claim filed
    while such miner was engaged in coal mine employment shall be
    entitled to such benefits if his or her employment terminates
    within one year after the date such determination becomes final.

    Sec. 924. Time for filing claims

-STATUTE-
    (a) Claims filed before December 31, 1973
      (1) No claim for benefits under this part on account of total
    disability of a miner shall be considered unless it is filed on or
    before December 31, 1973, or, in the case of a claimant who is a
    widow, within six months after the death of her husband or by
    December 31, 1973, whichever is the later.
      (2) In the case of a claim by a child this paragraph shall apply,
    notwithstanding any other provision of this part.
      (A) If such claim is filed within six months following May 1972,
    and if entitlement to benefits is established pursuant to such
    claim, such entitlement shall be effective retroactively from
    December 30, 1969, or from the date such child would have been
    first eligible for such benefit payments had section 922(a)(3) of
    this title been applicable since December 30, 1969, whichever is
    the lesser period. If on the date such claim is filed the claimant
    is not eligible for benefit payments, but was eligible at any
    period of time during the period from December 30, 1969, to the
    date such claim is filed, entitlement shall be effective for the
    duration of eligibility during such period.
      (B) If such claim is filed after six months following May 1972,
    and if entitlement to benefits is established pursuant to such
    claim, such entitlement shall be effective retroactively from a
    date twelve months preceding the date such claim is filed, or from
    the date such child would have been first eligible for such benefit
    payments had section 922(a)(3) of this title been applicable since
    December 30, 1969, whichever is the lesser period. If on the date
    such claim is filed the claimant is not eligible for benefit
    payments, but was eligible at any period of time during the period
    from a date twelve months preceding the date such claim is filed,
    to the date such claim is filed, entitlement shall be effective for
    the duration of eligibility during such period.
      (C) No claim for benefits under this part, in the case of a
    claimant who is a child, shall be considered unless it is filed
    within six months after the death of his father or mother
    (whichever last occurred) or by December 31, 1973, whichever is the
    later.
      (D) Any benefit under subparagraph (A) or (B) for a month prior
    to the month in which a claim is filed shall be reduced, to any
    extent that may be necessary, so that it will not render erroneous
    any benefit which, before the filing of such claim, the Secretary
    has certified for payment for such prior month.
      (3) No claim for benefits under this part, in the case of a
    claimant who is a parent, brother, or sister shall be considered
    unless it is filed within six months after the death of the miner
    or by December 31, 1973, whichever is the later.
    (b) Filing of claims after June 30, 1973
      No benefits shall be paid under this part after December 31,
    1973, if the claim therefor was filed after June 30, 1973.
    (c) Effective date of claims
      No benefits under this part shall be payable for any period prior
    to the date a claim therefor is filed.
    (d) Reduction of State benefits
      No benefits shall be paid under this part to the residents of any
    State which, after December 30, 1969, reduces the benefits payable
    to persons eligible to receive benefits under this part, under its
    State laws which are applicable to its general work force with
    regard to workmen's compensation, unemployment compensation, or
    disability insurance.
    (e) Conditions upon payment
      No benefits shall be payable to a widow, child, parent, brother,
    or sister under this part on account of the death of a miner unless
    (1) benefits under this part were being paid to such miner with
    respect to disability due to pneumoconiosis prior to his death, (2)
    the death of such miner occurred prior to January 1, 1974, or (3)
    any such individual is entitled to benefits under paragraph (5) of
    section 921(c) of this title.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Notwithstanding any other provision in this subchapter, for
    the purpose of assuring the uninterrupted receipt of benefits by
    claimants at such time as responsibility for administration of the
    benefits program is assumed by either a State workmen's
    compensation agency or the Secretary of Labor, any claim for
    benefits under this part filed during the period from July 1, 1973
    to December 31, 1973, shall be considered and determined in
    accordance with the procedures of this section. With respect to any
    such claim - 
        (1) Such claim shall be determined and, where appropriate under
      this part or section 9501(d) of title 26, benefits shall be paid
      with respect to such claim by the Secretary of Labor.
        (2) The Secretary of Labor shall promptly notify any operator
      who he believes, on the basis of information contained in the
      claim, or any other information available to him, may be liable
      to pay benefits to the claimant under part C of this subchapter
      for any month after December 31, 1973.
        (3) In determining such claims, the Secretary of Labor shall,
      to the extent appropriate, follow the procedures described in
      subsections (b), (c), and (d) of section 919 of title 33.
        (4) Any operator who has been notified of the pendency of a
      claim under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be bound by
      the determination of the Secretary of Labor on such claim as if
      the claim had been filed pursuant to part C of this subchapter
      and section 932 of this title had been applicable to such
      operator. Nothing in this paragraph shall require any operator to
      pay any benefits for any month prior to January 1, 1974.

      (b) The Secretary of Labor may issue such regulations as are
    necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose of this section.

    Sec. 931. Benefits under State workmen's compensation laws

-STATUTE-
    (a) Filing
      On and after January 1, 1974, any claim for benefits for death or
    total disability due to pneumoconiosis shall be filed pursuant to
    the applicable State workmen's compensation law, except that during
    any period when miners or their surviving widows, children,
    parents, brothers, or sisters, as the case may be, are not covered
    by a State workmen's compensation law which provides adequate
    coverage for pneumoconiosis, and in any case in which benefits
    based upon eligibility under paragraph (5) of section 921(c) of
    this title are involved.(!1) they shall be entitled to claim
    benefits under this part.

    (b) Adequacy of compensation; listing of States providing adequate
      compensation; requisites for listing
      (1) For purposes of this section, a State workmen's compensation
    law shall not be deemed to provide adequate coverage for
    pneumoconiosis during any period unless it is included in the list
    of State laws found by the Secretary to provide such adequate
    coverage during such period. The Secretary shall, no later than
    October 1, 1972, publish in the Federal Register a list of State
    workmen's compensation laws which provide adequate coverage for
    pneumoconiosis and shall revise and republish in the Federal
    Register such list from time to time, as may be appropriate to
    reflect changes in such State laws due to legislation or judicial
    or administrative interpretation.
      (2) The Secretary shall include a State workmen's compensation
    law on such list during any period only if he finds that during
    such period under such law - 
        (A) benefits must be paid for total disability or death of a
      miner due to pneumoconiosis, except that (i) such law shall not
      be required to provide such benefits where the miner's last
      employment in a coal mine terminated before the Secretary's
      approval of the State law pursuant to this section; and (ii) each
      operator of a coal mine shall secure the payment of benefits
      pursuant to section 933 of this title with respect to any miner
      whose last employment in a coal mine terminated before the
      Secretary's approval of the State law pursuant to this section;
        (B) the amount of such cash benefits is substantially
      equivalent to or greater than the amount of benefits prescribed
      by section 922(a) of this title;
        (C) the standards for determining death or total disability due
      to pneumoconiosis are substantially equivalent to section 902(f)
      of this title and to those standards established under this part,
      and by the regulations of the Secretary promulgated under this
      part;
        (D) any claim for benefits on account of total disability of a
      miner due to pneumoconiosis is deemed to be timely filed if such
      claim is filed within three years after a medical determination
      of total disability due to pneumoconiosis;
        (E) there are in effect provisions with respect to prior and
      successor operators which are substantially equivalent to the
      provisions contained in section 932(i) of this title; and
        (F) there are applicable such other provisions, regulations or
      interpretations, which are consistent with the provisions
      contained in Public Law 803, 69th Congress (44 Stat. 1424,
      approved March 4, 1927), as amended [33 U.S.C. 901 et seq.],
      which are applicable under section 932(a) of this title, but are
      not inconsistent with any of the criteria set forth in
      subparagraphs (A) through (E) of this paragraph, as the
      Secretary, in accordance with regulations promulgated by him,
      determines to be necessary or appropriate to assure adequate
      compensation for total disability or death due to pneumoconiosis.

    The action of the Secretary in including or failing to include any
    State workmen's compensation law on such list shall be subject to
    judicial review exclusively in the United States court of appeals
    for the circuit in which the State is located or the United States
    Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
    (c) Publication in Federal Register; review of listings
      Final regulations required for implementation of any amendments
    to this part shall be promulgated and published in the Federal
    Register at the earliest practicable date after the date of
    enactment of such amendments, and in no event later than the end of
    the sixth month following the month in which such amendments are
    enacted.

    payments shall be equal to the amounts specified in section 922(a)
    of this title. If payment is not made within the time required,
    interest shall accrue to such amounts at the rates set forth in
    section 934(b)(5) of this title for interest owed to the fund. With
    respect to payments withheld pending final adjudication of
    liability, in the case of claims filed on or after the effective
    date of the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981, such interest
    shall commence to accumulate 30 days after the date of the
    determination that such an award should be made.
    (e) Conditions upon payment
      No payment of benefits shall be required under this section:
        (1) except pursuant to a claim filed therefor in such manner,
      in such form, and containing such information, as the Secretary
      shall by regulation prescribe; or
        (2) for any period prior to January 1, 1974.
    (f) Limitation on filing of claims
      Any claim for benefits by a miner under this section shall be
    filed within three years after whichever of the following occurs
    later - 
        (1) a medical determination of total disability due to
      pneumoconiosis; or
        (2) March 1, 1978.
    (g) Reduction of monthly benefits
      The amount of benefits payable under this section shall be
    reduced, on a monthly or other appropriate basis, by the amount of
    any compensation received under or pursuant to any Federal or State
    workmen's compensation law because of death or disability due to
    pneumoconiosis. In addition, the amount of benefits payable under
    this section with respect to any claim filed on or after the
    effective date of the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981 shall
    be reduced, on a monthly or other appropriate basis, by the amount
    by which such benefits would be reduced on account of excess
    earnings of such miner under section 403(b) through (l) of title 42
    if the amount paid were a benefit payable under section 402 of
    title 42.
    (h) Promulgation of regulations
      The Secretary of Labor shall by regulation establish standards,
    which may include appropriate presumptions, for determining whether
    pneumoconiosis arose out of employment in a particular coal mine or
    mines. The Secretary may also, by regulation, establish standards
    for apportioning liability for benefits under this subsection among
    more than one operator, where such apportionment is appropriate.
    (i) Subsequent operators' liability for benefit payments
      (1) During any period in which this section is applicable to the
    operator of a coal mine who on or after January 1, 1970, acquired
    such mine or substantially all the assets thereof, from a person
    (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as a "prior operator")
    who was an operator of such mine, or owner of such assets on or
    after January 1, 1970, such operator shall be liable for and shall,
    in accordance with section 933 of this title, secure the payment of
    all benefits which would have been payable by the prior operator
    under this section with respect to miners previously employed by
    such prior operator as if the acquisition had not occurred and the
    prior operator had continued to be an operator of a coal mine.
      (2) Nothing in this subsection shall relieve any prior operator
    of any liability under this section.
      (3)(A) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the
    provisions of this paragraph shall apply to corporate
    reorganizations, liquidations, and such other transactions as are
    specified in this paragraph.
      (B) If an operator ceases to exist by reason of a reorganization
    or other transaction or series of transactions which involves a
    change in identity, form, or place of business or organization,
    however effected, the successor operator or other corporate or
    business entity resulting from such reorganization or other change
    shall be treated as the operator to whom this section applies.
      (C) If an operator ceases to exist by reason of a liquidation
    into a parent or successor corporation, the parent or successor
    corporation shall be treated as the operator to whom this section
    applies.
      (D) If an operator ceases to exist by reason of a sale of
    substantially all his or her assets, or as the result of a merger,
    consolidation, or division, the successor operator, corporation, or
    other business entity shall be treated as the operator to whom this
    section applies.
      (4) In any case in which there is a determination under section
    9501(d) of title 26 that no operator is liable for the payment of
    benefits to a claimant, nothing in this subsection may be construed
    to require the payment of benefits to a claimant by or on behalf of
    any operator.
    (j) Failure of operators to secure benefits
      Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, section 9501 of
    title 26 shall govern the payment of benefits in cases - 
        (1) described in section 9501(d)(1) of title 26;
        (2) in which the miner's last coal mine employment was before
      January 1, 1970; or
        (3) in which there was a claim denied before March 1, 1978, and
      such claim is or has been approved in accordance with the
      provisions of section 945 (!2) of this title.
    (k) Secretary as party in claim proceedings
      The Secretary shall be a party in any proceeding relative to a
    claim for benefits under this part.
    (l) Filing of new claims or refiling or revalidation of claims of
      miners already determined eligible at time of death
      In no case shall the eligible survivors of a miner who was
    determined to be eligible to receive benefits under this subchapter
    at the time of his or her death be required to file a new claim for
    benefits, or refile or otherwise revalidate the claim of such
    miner, except with respect to a claim filed under this part on or
    after the effective date of the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of
    1981,.(!3)

    under this subchapter to such miner or his or her dependents, shall
    be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be

    TITLE 30 - MINERAL LANDS AND MINING
    CHAPTER 22 - MINE SAFETY AND HEALTH
    SUBCHAPTER IV - BLACK LUNG BENEFITS
    Part C - Claims for Benefits After December 31, 1973

-HEAD-
    Sec. 934. "Fund" defined; liability of operators to United States
      for repayments to fund; procedures applicable; rate of interest

-STATUTE-
      (a) For purposes of this section, the term "fund" has the meaning
    set forth in section 902(h) of this title.
      (b)(1) If - 
        (A) an amount is paid out of the fund to an individual entitled
      to benefits under section 932 of this title, and
        (B) the Secretary determines, under the provisions of sections
      932 and 933 of this title, that an operator was required to
      secure the payment of all or a portion of such benefits,

    then the operator is liable to the United States for repayment to
    the fund of the amount of such benefits the payment of which is
    properly attributed to him plus interest thereon. No operator or
    representative of operators may bring any proceeding, or intervene
    in any proceeding, held for the purpose of determining claims for
    benefits to be paid by the fund, except that nothing in this
    section shall affect the rights, duties, or liabilities of any
    operator in proceedings under section 932 or section 933 of this
    title. In a case where no operator responsibility is assigned
    pursuant to sections 932 and 933 of this title, a determination by
    the Secretary that the fund is liable for the payment of benefits
    shall be final.
      (2) If any operator liable to the fund under paragraph (1)
    refuses to pay, after demand, the amount of such liability
    (including interest), then there shall be a lien in favor of the
    United States for such amount upon all property and rights to
    property, whether real or personal, belonging to such operator. The
    lien arises on the date on which such liability is finally
    determined, and continues until it is satisfied or becomes
    unenforceable by reason of lapse of time.
      (3)(A) Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, the
    priority of the lien shall be determined in the same manner as
    under section 6323 of title 26. That section shall be applied for
    such purposes - 
        (i) by substituting "lien imposed by section 424(b)(2) of the
      Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977" for "lien imposed by
      section 6321"; "operator liability lien" for "tax lien";
      "operator" for "taxpayer"; "lien arising under section 424(b)(2)
      of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977" for
      "assessment of the tax"; "payment of the liability is made to the
      Black Lung Disability Trust Fund" for "satisfaction of a levy
      pursuant to section 6332(b)"; and "satisfaction of operator
      liability" for "collection of any tax under this title" each
      place such terms appear; and
        (ii) by treating all references to the "Secretary" as
      references to the Secretary of Labor.

      (B) In the case of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, the
    lien imposed under paragraph (2) shall be treated in the same
    manner as a lien for taxes due and owing to the United States for
    purposes of the Bankruptcy Act or section 3713(a) of title 31.
      (C) For purposes of applying section 6323(a) of title 26 to
    determine the priority between the lien imposed under paragraph (2)
    and the Federal tax lien, each lien shall be treated as a judgment
    lien arising as of the time notice of such lien is filed.
      (D) For purposes of this subsection, notice of the lien imposed
    under paragraph (2) shall be filed in the same manner as under
    subsections (f) and (g) of section 6323 of title 26.
      (4)(A) In any case where there has been a refusal or neglect to
    pay the liability imposed under paragraph (2), the Secretary may
    bring a civil action in a district court of the United States to
    enforce the lien of the United States under this section with
    respect to such liability or to subject any property, of whatever
    nature, of the operator, or in which he has any right, title, or
    interest, to the payment of such liability.
      (B) The liability imposed by paragraph (1) may be collected at a
    proceeding in court if the proceeding is commenced within 6 years
    after the date on which the liability was finally determined, or
    before the expiration of any period for collection agreed upon in
    writing by the operator and the United States before the expiration
    of such 6-year period. The running of the period of limitation
    provided under this subparagraph shall be suspended for any period
    during which the assets of the operator are in the custody or
    control of any court of the United States, or of any State, or the
    District of Columbia, and for 6 months thereafter, and for any
    period during which the operator is outside the United States if
    such period of absence is for a continuous period of at least 6
    months.
      (5) The rate of interest under this subsection - 
        (A) for any period during calendar year 1982, shall be 15
      percent, and
        (B) for any period after calendar year 1982, shall be the rate
      established by section 6621 of title 26 which is in effect for
      such period.

    Sec. 938. Miners suffering from pneumoconiosis; discrimination
      prohibited

-STATUTE-
    (a) Mine operators
      No operator shall discharge or in any other way discriminate
    against any miner employed by him by reason of the fact that such
    miner is suffering from pneumoconiosis. No person shall cause or
    attempt to cause an operator to violate this section. For the
    purposes of this subsection the term "miner" shall not include any
    person who has been found to be totally disabled.
    (b) Determination by Secretary; procedure
      Any miner who believes that he has been discharged or otherwise
    discriminated against by any person in violation of subsection (a)
    of this section, or any representative of such miner may, within
    ninety days after such violation occurs, apply to the Secretary for
    a review of such alleged discharge or discrimination. A copy of the
    application shall be sent to such person who shall be the
    respondent. Upon receipt of such application, the Secretary shall
    cause such investigation to be made as he deems appropriate. Such
    investigation shall provide an opportunity for a public hearing at
    the request of any party to enable the parties to present
    information relating to such violation. The parties shall be given
    written notice of the time and place of the hearing at least five
    days prior to the hearing. Any such hearing shall be of record and
    shall be subject to section 554 of title 5. Each administrative law
    judge presiding under this section and under the provisions of
    subchapters I, II and III of this chapter shall receive
    compensation at a rate determined under section 5372 of title 5.
    Upon receiving the report of such investigation, the Secretary
    shall make findings of fact. If he finds that such violation did
    occur, he shall issue a decision, incorporating an order therein,
    requiring the person committing such violation to take such
    affirmative action as the Secretary deems appropriate, including,
    but not limited to, the rehiring or reinstatement of the miner to
    his former position with back pay. If he finds that there was no
    such violation, he shall issue an order denying the application.
    Such order shall incorporate the Secretary's findings therein.
    (c) Costs and penalties
      Whenever an order is issued under this subsection granting relief
    to a miner at the request of such miner, a sum equal to the
    aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including the
    attorney's fees) as determined by the Secretary to have been
    reasonably incurred by such miner for, or in connection with, the
    institution and prosecution of such proceedings, shall be assessed
    against the person committing the violation.

    this title.
    (b) Non-availability of other insurance coverage

    with the requirements of section 933 of this title with respect to
    the risks covered by such agreement.

      operator or facility which may be advisable;
        (3) appropriate premiums for different classifications of
      operators or facilities;
        (4) appropriate loss deductibles;
        (5) experience rating; and

      The Secretary may undertake and carry out such studies and
    investigations, and receive or exchange such information, as may be
    necessary to formulate a premium schedule which will enable the
    insurance and reinsurance authorized by this section to be provided
    on a basis which is (1) in accordance with accepted actuarial
    principles; and (2) fair and equitable.
    (f) Regulations relating to premium rates

    terms and conditions under which, and the area within which, such
    insurance or reinsurance shall be available and such rates shall
    apply.

    the risks involved, taking into account differences, if any, in
    risks based on location, type of operations, facilities, type of
    coal, experience, and any other matter which may be considered
    under accepted actuarial principles; and (B) adequate, on the basis
    of accepted actuarial principles, to provide reserves for
    anticipated losses.
      (3) All premiums received by the Secretary shall be paid into the
    insurance fund.
    (g) Black Lung Compensation Insurance Fund
      (1) The Secretary may establish in the Department of Labor a

    (b) Application for grants; contents
      The Secretary shall approve any application or any modification
    thereof, submitted under this section by a State, through its
    official coal or other mine inspection or safety agency, which - 
        (1) sets forth the programs, policies, and methods to be
      followed in carrying out the application in accordance with the
      purposes of subsection (a) of this section;
        (2) provides research and planning studies to carry out plans
      designed to improve State workmen's compensation and occupational
      disease laws and programs, as they relate to compensation to
      miners for occupationally caused diseases and injuries arising
      out of employment in any coal or other mine;
        (3) designates such State coal or other mine inspection or
      safety agency as the sole agency responsible for administering

    shall hear such appeal on the record made before the Secretary. The
    decision of the Secretary incorporating his findings of fact
    therein, if supported by substantial evidence on the record
    considered as a whole, shall be conclusive. The court may affirm,
    vacate, or remand the proceedings to the Secretary for such further
    action as it directs. The filing of a petition under this
    subsection shall not stay the application of the decision of the
    Secretary, unless the court so orders. The provisions of section

    experience in mining or by experience as a practical mining
    engineer or by education: Provided, however, That, to the maximum
    extent feasible, in the selection of persons for appointment as
    mine inspectors, no person shall be so selected unless he has the
    basic qualification of at least five years practical mining
    experience and in assigning mine inspectors to the inspection and
    investigation of individual mines, due consideration shall be given
    to the extent possible to their previous experience in the
    particular type of mining operation where such inspections are to
    be made. Persons appointed to assist such representatives in the
    taking of samples of respirable dust for the purpose of enforcing

-STATUTE-
    (a) Transfer of functions to Secretary of Labor
      Except with respect to the functions assigned to the Secretary of
    the Interior pursuant to section 501 of the Federal Coal Mine
    Health and Safety Act of 1969 [30 U.S.C. 951], the functions of the
    Secretary of the Interior under the Federal Coal Mine Health and
    Safety Act of 1969, as amended [30 U.S.C. 801 et seq.], and the
    Federal Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safety Act [30 U.S.C. 721 et
    seq.] are transferred to the Secretary of Labor, except those which
    are expressly transferred to the Commission by this Act. Effective
    on the date of enactment of this Act, Health (!1) and Safety
    Academy is transferred to the Secretary of Labor.

    (b) Existing mandatory standards; review by advisory committee;
      recommendations
      (1) The mandatory standards relating to mines, issued by the
    Secretary of the Interior under the Federal Metal and Nonmetallic
    Mine Safety Act [30 U.S.C. 721 et seq.] and standards and
    regulations under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of
    1969 [30 U.S.C. 801 et seq.] which are in effect on November 9,
    1977, shall remain in effect as mandatory health or safety
    standards applicable to metal and nonmetallic mines and to coal
    mines respectively under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of
    1977 [30 U.S.C. 801 et seq.] until such time as the Secretary of
    Labor shall issue new or revised mandatory health or safety
    standards applicable to metal and nonmetallic mines and new or
    revised mandatory health or safety standards applicable to coal
    mines.
      (2) Within 60 days after November 9, 1977, the Secretary of Labor
    in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior shall establish
    an advisory committee under section 102 of the Federal Mine Safety
    and Health Act of 1977 [30 U.S.C. 812] which shall, within 180 days
    after the date of the establishment of such advisory committee,
    review the advisory health and safety standards issued by the
    Secretary of the Interior under the Federal Metal and Nonmetallic
    Mine Safety Act and recommend to the Secretary of Labor which of
    those standards (or any modifications of such standards which do
    not substantially diminish the health and safety of miners) should
    be promulgated as mandatory health or safety standards. The
    Secretary of Labor shall publish, within 60 days after any
    recommendations of the advisory committee under this paragraph,
    each of the standards so recommended for adoption with or without
    modifications as a proposed mandatory health or safety standard
    under this section by publication of such standard in the Federal
    Register, and afford interested persons a period of 25 days after
    publication to submit written data or comment. Within 30 days after
    the close of the comment period specified in the preceding
    sentence, the Secretary of Labor shall promulgate by publication in
    the Federal Register mandatory health or safety standards based
    upon the advisory committee recommendation with or without
    modification, and the data and comments received thereon, unless
    the Secretary of Labor determines that such standards will not
    promote the health and safety of miners and publishes an
    explanation of that determination in the Federal Register.
    (c) Unexpended appropriations; personnel; property; records;
      obligations; commitments; savings provisions; pending proceedings
      and suits
      (1) All unexpended balances of appropriations, personnel,
    property, records, obligations, and commitments which are used
    primarily with respect to any functions transferred under the
    provisions of subsection (a) of this section to the Secretary of
    Labor shall be transferred to the Department of Labor or the
    Commission, as appropriate. The transfer of personnel pursuant to
    this paragraph shall be without reduction in classification or
    compensation for one year after such transfer, except that the
    Secretary of Labor shall have full authority to assign personnel
    during such one-year period in order to efficiently carry out
    functions transferred to him under this Act.
      (2) All orders, decisions, determinations, rules, regulations,
    permits, contracts, certificates, licenses, and privileges (A)
    which have been issued, made, granted, or allowed to become
    effective in the exercise of functions which are transferred under
    this section by any department or agency, any functions of which
    are transferred by this section, and (B) which are in effect at the
    time this section takes effect, shall continue in effect according
    to their terms until modified, terminated, superseded, set aside,
    revoked, or repealed by the Secretary of Labor, the Federal Mine
    Safety and Health Review Commission or other authorized officials,
    by any court of competent jurisdiction, or by operation of law.
      (3) The provisions of this section shall not affect any
    proceedings pending at the time this section takes effect before
    any department, agency, or component thereof, functions of which
    are transferred by this section, except that such proceedings, to
    the extent that they relate to functions so transferred, shall be
    continued before the Secretary of Labor or the Federal Mine Safety
    and Health Review Commission. Orders shall be issued in such
    proceedings, appeals shall be taken therefrom, and payments shall
    be made pursuant to such orders, as if this section had not been
    enacted; and orders issued in any such proceedings shall continue
    in effect until modified, terminated, superseded, revoked, or
    repealed by the Secretary of Labor, the Federal Mine Safety and
    Health Review Commission, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or
    by operation of law. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to
    prohibit the discontinuance or modification of any proceeding under
    the same terms and conditions and to the same extent that such
    proceeding could have been discontinued if this section had not
    been enacted.
      (4) The provisions of this section shall not affect suits
    commenced prior to the date this section takes effect and in all
    such suits proceedings shall be had, appeals taken, and judgments
    rendered, in the same manner and effect as if this section had not
    been enacted; except that if before the date on which this section
    takes effect, any department or agency (or officer thereof in his
    official capacity) is a party to a suit involving functions
    transferred to the Secretary, then such suit shall be continued by
    the Secretary of Labor. No cause of action, and no suit, action, or
    other proceeding, by or against any department or agency (or
    officer thereof in his official capacity) functions of which are
    transferred by this section, shall abate by reason of the enactment
    of this section. Causes of actions, suits, actions, or other
    proceedings may be asserted by or against the United States or the
    Secretary as may be appropriate and, in any litigation pending when
    this section takes effect, the court may at any time, on its own
    motion or that of any party, enter an order which will give effect
    to the provisions of this paragraph.
    (d) "Function" defined
      For purposes of this section, (1) the term "function" includes
    power and duty, and (2) the transfer of a function, under any
    provision of law, of an agency or the head of a department shall
    also be a transfer of all functions under such law which are
    exercised by any officer (!2) or officer of such agency or
    department.

    (e) Determinations by Director of Office of Management and Budget
      The Director of the Office of Management and Budget in
    consultation with the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of the
    Interior is authorized and directed to make such determinations as
    may be necessary with regard to the dispositions of personnel,
    personnel positions, property, records, assets, liabilities,
    contracts, obligations, commitments, unexpended balances of
    appropriations, authorizations, allocations, and other funds
    employed, held, used, arising from, available or to be made
    available, in connection with the functions transferred by this Act
    as he may deem necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Act.

      prospects for extraction of geothermal steam or associated
      geothermal resources are good enough to warrant expenditures of
      money for that purpose.

      subsection to the highest responsible qualified bidder, as
      determined by the Secretary.
      (2) Competitive lease sales
        The Secretary shall hold a competitive lease sale at least once
      every 2 years for land in a State that has nominations pending
      under subsection (a) of this section if the land is otherwise
      available for leasing.
      (3) Lands subject to mining claims
        Lands that are subject to a mining claim for which a plan of

    competitive lease sale.
    (d) Pending lease applications
      (1) In general
        It shall be a priority for the Secretary, and for the Secretary
      of Agriculture with respect to National Forest Systems land, to
      ensure timely completion of administrative actions, including

        this section as in effect on August 8, 2005.
    (e) Leases sold as a block
      If information is available to the Secretary indicating a
    geothermal resource that could be produced as 1 unit can reasonably
    be expected to underlie more than 1 parcel to be offered in a
    competitive lease sale, the parcels for such a resource may be
    offered for bidding as a block in the competitive lease sale.
    (f) Leasing for direct use of geothermal resources
      Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may
    identify areas in which the land to be leased under this chapter
    exclusively for direct use of geothermal resources, without sale
    for purposes other than commercial generation of electricity, may
    be leased to any qualified applicant that first applies for such a
    lease under regulations issued by the Secretary, if the Secretary -
    
        (1) publishes a notice of the land proposed for leasing not
      later than 90 days before the date of the issuance of the lease;
        (2) does not receive during the 90-day period beginning on the
      date of the publication any nomination to include the land
      concerned in the next competitive lease sale; and

    Sec. 1004. Rents and royalties

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      Geothermal leases shall provide for - 
        (1) a royalty on electricity produced using geothermal
      resources, other than direct use of geothermal resources, that
      shall be - 
          (A) not less than 1 percent and not more than 2.5 percent of
        the gross proceeds from the sale of electricity produced from
        such resources during the first 10 years of production under
        the lease; and
          (B) not less than 2 and not more than 5 percent of the gross
        proceeds from the sale of electricity produced from such
        resources during each year after such 10-year period;

        (2) a royalty on any byproduct that is a mineral specified in
      the first section of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181), and
      that is derived from production under the lease, at the rate of
      the royalty that applies under that Act [30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.]
      to production of the mineral under a lease under that Act; and
        (3) payment in advance of an annual rental of not less than - 
          (A) for each of the 1st through 10th years of the lease - 
            (i) in the case of a lease awarded in a noncompetitive
          lease sale, $1 per acre or fraction thereof; or
            (ii) in the case of a lease awarded in a competitive lease
          sale, $2 per acre or fraction thereof for the 1st year and $3
          per acre or fraction thereof for each of the 2nd through 10th
          years; and

          (B) for each year after the 10th year of the lease, $5 per
        acre or fraction thereof; (!1)

    (b) Direct use
      (1) In general
        Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1) of this section, the
      Secretary shall establish a schedule of fees, in lieu of
      royalties for geothermal resources, that a lessee or its
      affiliate - 
          (A) uses for a purpose other than the commercial generation
        of electricity; and
          (B) does not sell.
      (2) Schedule of fees
        The schedule of fees - 
          (A) may be based on the quantity or thermal content, or both,
        of geothermal resources used;
          (B) shall ensure a fair return to the United States for use
        of the resource; and
          (C) shall encourage development of the resource.
      (3) State, tribal, or local governments
        If a State, tribal, or local government is the lessee and uses
      geothermal resources without sale and for public purposes other
      than commercial generation of electricity, the Secretary shall
      charge only a nominal fee for use of the resource.
      (4) Final regulation
        In issuing any final regulation establishing a schedule of fees
      under this subsection, the Secretary shall seek - 
          (A) to provide lessees with a simplified administrative
        system;
          (B) to facilitate development of direct use of geothermal
        resources; and
          (C) to contribute to sustainable economic development
        opportunities in the area.
    (c) Final regulation establishing royalty rates
      In issuing any final regulation establishing royalty rates under
    this section, the Secretary shall seek - 
        (1) to provide lessees a simplified administrative system;
        (2) to encourage new development; and
        (3) to achieve the same level of royalty revenues over a 10-
      year period as the regulation in effect on August 8, 2005.
    (d) Credits for in-kind payments of electricity
      The Secretary may provide to a lessee a credit against royalties
    owed under this chapter, in an amount equal to the value of
    electricity provided under contract to a State or county government
    that is entitled to a portion of such royalties under section 1019
    of this title, section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C.
    191), except as otherwise provided by this section, or section 355
    of this title, if - 
        (1) the Secretary has approved in advance the contract between
      the lessee and the State or county government for such in-kind
      payments;
        (2) the contract establishes a specific methodology to
      determine the value of such credits; and
        (3) the maximum credit will be equal to the royalty value owed
      to the State or county that is a party to the contract and the
      electricity received will serve as the royalty payment from the
      Federal Government to that entity.
    (e) Crediting of rental toward royalty
      Any annual rental under this section that is paid with respect to
    a lease before the first day of the year for which the annual
    rental is owed shall be credited to the amount of royalty that is
    required to be paid under the lease for that year.
    (f) Advanced royalties required for cessation of production
      (1) In general
        Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), if, at any time after
      commercial production under a lease is achieved, production
      ceases for any reason, the lease shall remain in full force and
      effect for a period of not more than an aggregate number of 10
      years beginning on the date production ceases, if, during the
      period in which production is ceased, the lessee pays royalties
      in advance at the monthly average rate at which the royalty was
      paid during the period of production.
      (2) Reduction
        The amount of any production royalty paid for any year shall be
      reduced (but not below 0) by the amount of any advanced royalties
      paid under the lease to the extent that the advance royalties
      have not been used to reduce production royalties for a prior
      year.
      (3) Exceptions
        Paragraph (1) shall not apply if the cessation in production is
      required or otherwise caused by - 
          (A) the Secretary;
          (B) the Secretary of the Air Force;
          (C) the Secretary of the Army;
          (D) the Secretary of the Navy;
          (E) a State or a political subdivision of a State; or
          (F) a force majeure.
    (g) Termination of lease for failure to pay rental
      (1) In general
        The Secretary shall terminate any lease with respect to which
      rental is not paid in accordance with this chapter and the terms
      of the lease under which the rental is required, on the
      expiration of the 45-day period beginning on the date of the
      failure to pay the rental.
      (2) Notification
        The Secretary shall promptly notify a lessee that has not paid
      rental required under the lease that the lease will be terminated
      at the end of the period referred to in paragraph (1).
      (3) Reinstatement
        A lease that would otherwise terminate under paragraph (1)
      shall not terminate under that paragraph if the lessee pays to
      the Secretary, before the end of the period referred to in
      paragraph (1), the amount of rental due plus a late fee equal to
      10 percent of the amount.

      (1) Primary term
        A geothermal lease shall be for a primary term of 10 years.
      (2) Initial extension
        The Secretary shall extend the primary term of a geothermal
      lease for 5 years if, for each year after the 10th year of the
      lease - 
          (A) the Secretary determined under subsection (b) of this
        section that the lessee satisfied the work commitment
        requirements that applied to the lease for that year; or
          (B) the lessee paid in annual payments accordance with
        subsection (c) of this section.
      (3) Additional extension
        The Secretary shall extend the primary term of a geothermal
      lease (after an initial extension under paragraph (2)) for an
      additional 5 years if, for each year of the initial extension
      under paragraph (2), the Secretary determined under subsection
      (b) of this section that the lessee satisfied the minimum work
      requirements that applied to the lease for that year.
    (b) Requirement to satisfy annual minimum work requirement
      (1) In general
        The lessee for a geothermal lease shall, for each year after
      the 10th year of the lease, satisfy minimum work requirements
      prescribed by the Secretary that apply to the lease for that
      year.
      (2) Prescription of minimum work requirements
        The Secretary shall issue regulations prescribing minimum work
      requirements for geothermal leases, that - 
          (A) establish a geothermal potential; and
          (B) if a geothermal potential has been established, confirm
        the existence of producible geothermal resources.
    (c) Payments in lieu of minimum work requirements
      In lieu of the minimum work requirements set forth in subsection
    (b)(2) of this section, the Secretary shall by regulation establish
    minimum annual payments which may be made by the lessee for a
    limited number of years that the Secretary determines will not
    impair achieving diligent development of the geothermal resource,
    but in no event shall the number of years exceed the duration of
    the extension period provided in subsection (a) of this section.
    (d) Transition rules for leases issued prior to August 8, 2005
      The Secretary shall by regulation establish transition rules for
    leases issued before August 8, 2005, including terms under which a
    lease that is near the end of its term on August 8, 2005, may be
    extended for up to 2 years - 
        (1) to allow achievement of production under the lease; or
        (2) to allow the lease to be included in a producing unit.
    (e) Geothermal lease overlying mining claim
      (1) Exemption
        The lessee for a geothermal lease of an area overlying an area
      subject to a mining claim for which a plan of operations has been
      approved by the relevant Federal land management agency is exempt
      from annual work requirements established under this chapter, if
      development of the geothermal resource subject to the lease would
      interfere with the mining operations under such claim.
      (2) Termination of exemption
        An exemption under this paragraph expires upon the termination
      of the mining operations.
    (f) Termination of application of requirements
      Minimum work requirements prescribed under this section shall not
    apply to a geothermal lease after the date on which the geothermal
    resource is utilized under the lease in commercial quantities.
    (g) Cooperative or unit plan for drilling operations; extension of
      term; renewal
      Any lease for land on which, or for which under an approved
    cooperative or unit plan of development or operation, actual
    drilling operations were commenced prior to the end of its primary
    term and are being diligently prosecuted at that time shall be
    extended for five years and so long thereafter, but not more than
    thirty-five years, as geothermal steam is produced or utilized in
    commercial quantities. If, at the end of such extended term, steam
    is being produced or utilized in commercial quantities and the
    lands are not needed for other purposes, the lessee shall have a
    preferential right to a renewal of such lease for a second term in
    accordance with such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems
    appropriate.
    (h) "Produced or utilized in commercial quantities" defined
      Except as otherwise provided for in this section, for purposes of
    this section the term "produced or utilized in commercial
    quantities" means the completion of a well producing geothermal
    steam in commercial quantities. Such term shall also include the
    completion of a well capable of producing geothermal steam in
    commercial quantities so long as the Secretary determines that
    diligent efforts are being made toward the utilization of the
    geothermal steam.
    (i) Principles for location of minerals under mining laws when
      minerals are not associated with geothermal resources
      Minerals locatable under the mining laws of the United States in
    lands subject to a geothermal lease issued under the provisions of
    this chapter which are not associated with the geothermal resources
    of such lands as defined in section 1001(c) of this title shall be
    locatable under said mining laws in accordance with the principles
    of the Multiple Mineral Development Act (68 Stat. 708; found in 30
    U.S.C. 521 et seq.).

      "Yellowstone National Park;
      "Bering Land Bridge National Preserve;
      "Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve;
      "Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve;
      "Katmai National Park;
      "Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve;
      "Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve;
      "Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve;
      "Denali National Park and Preserve;
      "Lake Clark National Park and Preserve;
      "Hot Springs National Park;
      "Sequoia National Park;
      "Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park;
      "Lake Mead National Recreation Area;
      "Big Bend National Park;
      "Olympic National Park;
      "Grand Teton National Park;
      "John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway;
      "Haleakala National Park; and
      "Crater Lake National Park.
    The Secretary shall include with such list the basis for his
    determination with respect to each thermal feature on the list.
    Based on public comment on such list, the Secretary is authorized
    to make additions to or deletions from the list. Not later than the
    60th day from the date on which the proposed list was published in
    the Federal Register, the Secretary shall transmit the list to the
    Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the
    Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs of the House of
    Representatives together with copies of all public comments which
    he has received and indicating any additions to or deletions from
    the list with a statement of the reasons therefor and the basis for
    inclusion of each thermal feature on the list. The Secretary shall
    consider the following criteria in determining the significance of
    thermal features:
        "(1) size, extent, and uniqueness;
        "(2) scientific and geologic significance;
        "(3) the extent to which such features remain in a natural,
      undisturbed condition; and
        "(4) significance of thermal features to the authorized
      purposes for which the National Park System unit was created.
    The Secretary shall not issue any geothermal lease pursuant to the
    Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-581, 84 Stat. 1566), as
    amended [30 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.], until such time as the Secretary
    has transmitted the list to the Committees of Congress as provided
    in this section.
      "(b) The Secretary shall maintain a monitoring program for those
    significant thermal features listed pursuant to subsection (a) of
    this section.
      "(c) Upon receipt of an application for a geothermal lease the
    Secretary shall determine on the basis of scientific evidence if
    exploration, development, or utilization of the lands subject to
    the geothermal lease application is reasonably likely to result in
    a significant adverse effect on a significant thermal feature
    listed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. Such
    determination shall be subject to notice and public comment. If the
    Secretary determines on the basis of scientific evidence that the
    exploration, development, or utilization of the land subject to the
    geothermal lease application is reasonably likely to result in a
    significant adverse effect on a significant thermal feature listed
    pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall not
    issue such geothermal lease. In addition, the Secretary shall
    withdraw from leasing under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, as
    amended, those lands, or portion thereof, subject to the
    application for geothermal lease, the exploration, development, or
    utilization of which is reasonably likely to result, based on the
    Secretary's determination, in a significant adverse effect on a
    significant thermal feature listed pursuant to subsection (a) of
    this section.
      "(d) With respect to all geothermal leases issued after the date
    of enactment of this section [Oct. 18, 1986] the Secretary shall
    include stipulations in leases necessary to protect significant
    thermal features listed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section
    where a determination is made based on scientific evidence that the
    exploration, development, or utilization of the lands subject to
    the lease is reasonably likely to adversely affect such significant
    features. Such stipulations shall include, but are not limited to:
        "(1) requiring the lessee to reinject geothermal fluids into
      the rock formations from which they originate;
        "(2) requiring the lessee to report annually to the Secretary
      on its activities;
        "(3) requiring the lessee to continuously monitor geothermal
      production and injection wells; and
        "(4) requiring the lessee to suspend activity, temporarily or
      permanently, on the lease if the Secretary determines that
      ongoing exploration, development, or utilization activities are
      having a significant adverse effect on significant thermal
      features listed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section until
      such time as the significant adverse effect is eliminated.
      "(e) The Secretary of Agriculture shall consider the effects on
    significant thermal features of those units of the National Park
    System identified in subsection (a) of this section in determining
    whether to consent to leasing under the Geothermal Steam Act of

-STATUTE-
    (a) Initial readjustment; periodic intervals; notice; objections,
      relinquishment, and termination
      The Secretary may readjust the terms and conditions, except as
    otherwise provided herein, of any geothermal lease issued under
    this chapter at not less than ten-year intervals beginning ten
    years after the date the geothermal steam is produced, as
    determined by the Secretary. Each geothermal lease issued under
    this chapter shall provide for such readjustment. The Secretary
    shall give notice of any proposed readjustment of terms and
    conditions, and, unless the lessee files with the Secretary
    objection to the proposed terms or relinquishes the lease within
    thirty days after receipt of such notice, the lessee shall
    conclusively be deemed to have agreed with such terms and
    conditions. If the lessee files objections, and no agreement can be
    reached between the Secretary and the lessee within a period of not
    less than sixty days, the lease may be terminated by either party.
    (b) Rentals and royalties; initial readjustment; periodic
      intervals; limitation on increases and on royalties; notice;
      objections, relinquishment, and termination
      The Secretary may readjust the rentals and royalties of any
    geothermal lease issued under this chapter at not less than twenty-
    year intervals beginning thirty-five years after the date
    geothermal steam is produced, as determined by the Secretary. In
    the event of any such readjustment neither the rental nor royalty
    may be increased by more than 50 per centum over the rental or
    royalty paid during the preceding period. Each geothermal lease
    issue (!1) under this chapter shall provide for such readjustment.
    The Secretary shall give notice of any proposed readjustment of
    rentals and royalties, and, unless the lessee files with the
    Secretary objection to the proposed rentals and royalties or
    relinquishes the lease within thirty days after receipt of such
    notice, the lessee shall conclusively be deemed to have agreed with
    such terms and conditions. If the lessee files objections, and no
    agreement can be reached between the Secretary and the lessee
    within a period of not less than sixty days, the lease may be
    terminated by either party.

    (c) Surface use, protection, or restoration of lands withdrawn or
      acquired for Federal agency; notice; approval of agency
      Any readjustment of the terms and conditions as to use,
    protection, or restoration of the surface of any lease of lands
    withdrawn or acquired in aid of a function of a Federal department
    or agency other than the Department of the Interior may be made
    only upon notice to, and with the approval of, such department or
    agency.

    to the lands relinquished, but no such relinquishment shall release
    such lessee, or his surety or bond, from any liability for breach
    of any obligation of the lease, other than an obligation to drill,
    accrued at the date of the relinquishment, or from the continued

      including direct use resources, if determined and certified by
      the Secretary to be necessary or advisable in the public
      interest.
      (2) Majority interest of single leases
        A majority interest of owners of any single lease shall have
      the authority to commit the lease to a unit agreement.
      (3) Initiative of Secretary
        The Secretary may also initiate the formation of a unit
      agreement, or require an existing Federal lease to commit to a
      unit agreement, if in the public interest.
      (4) Modification of lease requirements by Secretary
        (A) In general
          The Secretary may, in the discretion of the Secretary and
        with the consent of the holders of leases involved, establish,
        alter, change, or revoke rates of operations (including
        drilling, operations, production, and other requirements) of
        the leases and make conditions with respect to the leases, with
        the consent of the lessees, in connection with the creation and
        operation of any such unit agreement as the Secretary may
        consider necessary or advisable to secure the protection of the
        public interest.
        (B) Unlike terms or rates
          Leases with unlike lease terms or royalty rates shall not be
        required to be modified to be in the same unit.
    (b) Requirement of plans under new leases
      The Secretary may - 
        (1) provide that geothermal leases issued under this chapter
      shall contain a provision requiring the lessee to operate under a
      unit agreement; and
        (2) prescribe the unit agreement under which the lessee shall
      operate, which shall adequately protect the rights of all parties
      in interest, including the United States.
    (c) Modification of rate of prospecting, development, and
      production
      The Secretary may require that any unit agreement authorized by
    this section that applies to land owned by the United States
    contain a provision under which authority is vested in the
    Secretary, or any person, committee, or State or Federal officer or
    agency as may be designated in the unit agreement to alter or
    modify, from time to time, the rate of prospecting and development
    and the quantity and rate of production under the unit agreement.
    (d) Exclusion from determination of holding or control
      Any land that is subject to a unit agreement approved or
    prescribed by the Secretary under this section shall not be
    considered in determining holdings or control under section 1006 of
    this title.
    (e) Pooling of certain land
      If separate tracts of land cannot be independently developed and
    operated to use geothermal resources pursuant to any section of
    this chapter - 
        (1) the land, or a portion of the land, may be pooled with
      other land, whether or not owned by the United States, for
      purposes of development and operation under a communitization
      agreement providing for an apportionment of production or
      royalties among the separate tracts of land comprising the
      production unit, if the pooling is determined by the Secretary to
      be in the public interest; and
        (2) operation or production pursuant to the communitization
      agreement shall be treated as operation or production with
      respect to each tract of land that is subject to the
      communitization agreement.
    (f) Unit agreement review
      (1) In general
        Not later than 5 years after the date of approval of any unit
      agreement and at least every 5 years thereafter, the Secretary
      shall - 
          (A) review each unit agreement; and
          (B) after notice and opportunity for comment, eliminate from
        inclusion in the unit agreement any land that the Secretary
        determines is not reasonably necessary for unit operations
        under the unit agreement.
      (2) Basis for elimination
        The elimination shall - 
          (A) be based on scientific evidence; and
          (B) occur only if the elimination is determined by the
        Secretary to be for the purpose of conserving and properly
        managing the geothermal resource.
      (3) Extension
        Any land eliminated under this subsection shall be eligible for
      an extension under section 1005(g) of this title if the land
      meets the requirements for the extension.
    (g) Drilling or development contracts
      (1) In general
        The Secretary may, on such conditions as the Secretary may
      prescribe, approve drilling or development contracts made by one
      or more lessees of geothermal leases, with one or more persons,
      associations, or corporations if, in the discretion of the
      Secretary, the conservation of natural resources or the public
      convenience or necessity may require or the interests of the
      United States may be best served by the approval.
      (2) Holdings or control
        Each lease operated under an approved drilling or development
      contract, and interest under the contract, shall be excepted in
      determining holdings or control under section 1006 of this title.
    (h) Coordination with State governments
      The Secretary shall coordinate unitization and pooling activities
    with appropriate State agencies.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1101. Congressional findings

-STATUTE-
      The Congress hereby finds that - 
        (1) the Nation is currently suffering a critical shortage of
      environmentally acceptable forms of energy;
        (2) the inadequate organizational structures and levels of
      funding for energy research have limited the Nation's current and
      future options for meeting energy needs;
        (3) electric energy is a clean and convenient form of energy at
      the location of its use and is the only practicable form of
      energy in some modern applications, but the demand for electric
      energy in every region of the United States is taxing all of the
      alternative energy sources presently available and is projected
      to increase; some of the sources available for electric power
      generation are already in short supply, and the development and
      use of other sources presently involve undesirable environmental
      impacts;
        (4) the Nation's critical energy problems can be solved only if
      a national commitment is made to dedicate the necessary financial
      resources, and enlist the cooperation of the private and public
      sectors, in developing geothermal resources and other
      nonconventional sources of energy;
        (5) the conventional geothermal resources which are presently
      being used have limited total potential; but geothermal resources
      which are different from those presently being used, and which
      have extremely large energy content, are known to exist;
        (6) some geothermal resources contain energy in forms other
      than heat; examples are methane and extremely high pressures
      available upon release as kinetic energy;
        (7) some geothermal resources contain valuable byproducts such
      as potable water and mineral compounds which should be processed
      and recovered as national resources;
        (8) technologies are not presently available for the
      development of most of these geothermal resources, but
      technologies for the generation of electric energy from
      geothermal resources are potentially economical and
      environmentally desirable, and the development of geothermal
      resources offers possibilities of process energy and other
      nonelectric applications;
        (9) much of the known geothermal resources exist on the public
      lands;
        (10) Federal financial assistance is necessary to encourage the
      extensive exploration, research, and development in geothermal
      resources which will bring these technologies to the point of
      commercial application;
        (11) the advancement of technology with the cooperation of
      private industry for the production of useful forms of energy
      from geothermal resources is important with respect to the
      Federal responsibility for the general welfare, to facilitate
      commerce, to encourage productive harmony between man and his
      environment, and to protect the public interest; and
        (12) the Federal Government should encourage and assist private
      industry through Federal assistance for the development and
      demonstration of practicable means to produce useful energy from
      geothermal resources with environmentally acceptable processes.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1141. Establishment of loan guaranty program

-STATUTE-
    (a) Congressional declaration of policy
      It is the policy of the Congress to encourage and assist in the
    commercial development of practicable means to produce useful
    energy from geothermal resources with environmentally acceptable
    processes. Accordingly, it is the policy of the Congress to
    facilitate such commercial development by authorizing the Chairman
    of the Project to designate an appropriate Federal agency to
    guarantee loans for such purposes.
    (b) Authorization of heads of designated agencies to guarantee
      loans
      In order to encourage the commercial production of energy from
    geothermal resources, the head of the designated agency is
    authorized to, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury,
    guarantee, and to enter into commitments to guarantee, lenders
    against loss of principal or interest on loans made by such lenders
    to qualified borrowers for the purposes of - 
        (1) the determination and evaluation of the resource base;
        (2) research and development with respect to extraction and
      utilization technologies;
        (3) acquiring rights in geothermal resources;
        (4) development, construction, and operation of facilities for
      the demonstration or commercial production of energy using
      geothermal resources; or
        (5) construction and operation of a new commercial,
      agricultural, or industrial structure or facility or modification
      and operation of an existing commercial, agricultural, or
      industrial structure or facility, when geothermal hot water or
      steam is to be used within or by such structure or facility, or
      modification thereto, for the purposes of space heating or
      cooling, industrial or agricultural processes, onsite generation
      of electricity for use other than for sale or resale in commerce,
      other commercial applications, or combinations of applications
      separately eligible under this subchapter for loan guarantee
      assistance.
    (c) Extent of guarantee
      Any guaranty under this subchapter shall apply only to so much of
    the principal amount of any loan as does not exceed 75 percent of
    the aggregate cost of the project with respect to which the loan is
    made, except that any guarantee made for a loan to an electric,
    housing, or other cooperative, or to a municipality (as defined in
    section 796(7) of title 16), may apply to so much of the principal
    amount of the loan as does not exceed 90 percent of the aggregate
    cost of the project. In determining the aggregate cost of a project
    for purposes of the preceding sentence, there shall be excluded the
    cost of constructing electrical transmission lines to the extent
    that the cost of constructing such lines exceeds 25 percent of the
    aggregate cost of the project (as determined without regard to this
    sentence); except that the Secretary may waive or limit the
    application of this sentence with respect to any project located in
    the State of Hawaii upon a finding that such project is remote from
    the area of primary consumption, that a transmission line is
    required before the geothermal reservoir can be developed, and that
    the particular transmission line involved will be used for more
    than the plant which is the subject of the loan guarantee. In the
    case of a guaranty for the purposes specified in subsection (b)(5)
    of this section, the aggregate cost of the project shall be deemed
    to be that portion of the total cost of construction and operation
    which is directly related to the utilization of geothermal energy
    within the structure or facility in question, except that the
    aggregate cost of the project with respect to which the loan is
    made may be the total cost including construction and operation in
    cases where the facility or structure has been located near a
    geothermal energy resource predominantly for the purpose of
    utilizing geothermal energy, or as determined by the Secretary of
    Energy the economic viability of the project is substantially
    dependent upon the performance of the geothermal reservoir.
    (d) Terms and conditions of guaranties
      Loan guaranties under this subchapter shall be on such terms and
    conditions as the head of the designated agency determines, except
    that a guaranty shall be made under this subchapter only if - 
        (1) the loan bears interest at a rate not to exceed such annual
      per centum on the principal obligation outstanding as the head of
      the designated agency determines to be reasonable, taking into
      account the range of interest rates prevailing in the private
      sector for similar loans and risks by the United States;
        (2) the terms of such loan require full repayment over a period
      not to exceed thirty years, or the useful life of any physical
      asset to be financed by such loan, whichever is less (as
      determined by the head of the designated agency);
        (3) in the judgment of the head of the designated agency, the
      amount of the loan (when combined with amounts available to the
      qualified borrower from other sources) will be sufficient to
      carry out the project; and
        (4) in the judgment of the head of the designated agency, there
      is reasonable assurance of repayment of the loan by the qualified
      borrower of the guaranteed indebtedness.
    (e) Limitations on amount of guaranty; exceptions; procedures
      applicable
      The amount of the guaranty for any loan for a project shall not
    exceed $100,000,000: Provided, That in the case of a guaranty under
    subsection (b)(5) of this section, the amount of the guaranty for
    any loan for a project shall not exceed $50,000,000 and the amount
    of the guaranty for any combination of loans for any single
    qualified borrower shall not exceed $200,000,000, unless the
    Secretary of Energy determines in writing that a guaranty in excess
    of these amounts is in the national interest. Any such
    determination shall be submitted to the Speaker of the House and
    the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of
    Representatives, and to the President of the Senate and the
    Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate,
    accompanied by a full and complete report on the proposed project
    and guaranty. The proposed guaranty or commitment to guarantee
    shall not be finalized under authority granted by this chapter
    prior to the expiration of thirty calendar days (not including any
    date on which either House of Congress is not in session) from the
    date on which such report is received by the Speaker of the House
    and the President of the Senate.
    (f) "Qualified borrower" defined
      As used in this subchapter, the term "qualified borrower" means
    any public or private agency, institution, association,
    partnership, corporation, political subdivision, or other legal
    entity which (as determined by the head of the designated agency)
    has presented satisfactory evidence of an interest in geothermal
    resources and is capable of performing research or completing the
    development and production of energy in an acceptable manner.
    (g) Payment of interest; criteria
      With respect to any guaranty which is issued after February 25,
    1978, by, or in behalf of, any State, political subdivision, or
    Indian tribe and which is either guaranteed under, or supported by
    taxes levied by said issuer which are guaranteed under this
    subchapter and for which the interest paid on such obligation and
    received by the purchaser thereof is included in gross income for
    the purposes of chapter 1 of title 26, the Secretary of Energy
    shall pay to such issuer out of the fund established by this
    subchapter such portion of the interest on such obligations, as
    determined by the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the
    Secretary of the Treasury, to be appropriated after taking into
    account current market yields (1) on obligations of such issuer, if
    any, or (2) on other obligations with similar terms and conditions,
    the interest on which is not so included in gross income for
    purposes of chapter 1 of title 26, and in accordance with such
    terms and conditions as the Secretary of Energy shall require in
    consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury.
    (h) Pledge of full faith and credit of United States to guaranties
      The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the
    payment of all guaranties issued under this subchapter with respect
    to principal and interest.
    (i) Fees for guaranties; amount, collection, etc.
      The Secretary of Energy shall charge and collect fees for
    guaranties in amounts sufficient in his judgment to cover
    applicable administrative costs and probable losses on guaranteed
    obligations, but in any event not to exceed 1 per centum per annum
    of the outstanding indebtedness covered by each guaranty. Fees
    collected under this subsection shall be deposited in the fund
    established by this subchapter.
    (j) Minimization of capital market impact of guaranties
      The Secretary of the Treasury shall insure to the maximum extent
    feasible that the timing, interest rate, and substantial terms and
    conditions of any guaranty exceeding $25,000,000 will have the
    minimum possible impact on the capital markets of the United
    States, taking into account other Federal direct and indirect
    commercial securities activities.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Default by borrower and demand by holder of obligation of
      unpaid amount; amount of payment by Secretary of Energy; defenses
      available; forebearance by holder of obligation
      If there is a default by the borrower, as defined in regulations
    promulgated by the Secretary of Energy and set forth in the
    guarantee contract, the holder of the obligation shall have the
    right to demand payment of the unpaid amount from the Secretary of
    Energy. Within such period as may be specified in the guarantee or
    related agreements, the Secretary of Energy shall pay to the holder
    of the obligation the unpaid interest on, and unpaid principal of
    the guaranteed obligation as to which the borrower has defaulted,
    unless the Secretary of Energy finds that there was no default by
    the borrower in the payment of interest or principal or that such
    default has been remedied. Nothing in this section shall be
    construed to preclude any forebearance by the holder of the
    obligation for the benefit of the borrower which may be agreed upon
    by the parties to the guaranteed obligation and approved by the
    Secretary of Energy.
    (b) Rights and authorities of Secretary of Energy upon payment
      If the Secretary of Energy makes a payment under subsection (a)
    of this subsection,(!1) the Secretary of Energy shall be subrogated
    to the rights of the recipient of such payment as specified in the
    guarantee or related agreements including, where appropriate, the
    authority (notwithstanding any other provision of law) to complete,
    maintain, operate, lease, or otherwise dispose of any property
    acquired pursuant to such guarantee or related agreements, or to
    permit the borrower, pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary of
    Energy, to continue to pursue the purposes of the project if the
    Secretary of Energy determines this to be in the public interest.
    The rights of the Secretary of Energy with respect to any property
    acquired pursuant to such guarantee or related agreements, shall be
    superior to the rights of any other person with respect to such
    property.

    (c) Rights and authorities of Attorney General upon default on any
      guarantee
      In the event of a default on any guarantee under this subchapter,
    the Secretary of Energy shall notify the Attorney General, who
    shall take such action as may be appropriate to recover the amounts
    of any payments made under subsection (a) of this section,
    including any payment of principal and interest under subsection
    (d) of this section, from such assets of the defaulting borrower as
    are associated with the project, or from any other security
    included in the terms of the guarantee.
    (d) Contracts to pay, and payment, from Geothermal Resources
      Development Fund of principal and interest of unpaid balance of
      obligation; preconditions
      With respect to any obligation guaranteed under this subchapter,
    the Secretary of Energy is authorized to enter into a contract to
    pay, and to pay, holders of the obligation, for and on behalf of
    the borrower, from the Geothermal Resources Development Fund, the
    principal and interest payments which become due and payable on the
    unpaid balance of such obligation if the Secretary of Energy finds
    that - 
        (1) the borrower is unable to meet such payments and is not in
      default; it is in the public interest to permit the borrower to
      continue to pursue the purposes of such project; and the probable
      net benefit to the Federal Government in paying such principal
      and interest will be greater than that which would result in the
      event of a default;
        (2) the amount of such payment which the Secretary of Energy is
      authorized to pay shall be no greater than the amount of
      principal and interest which the borrower is obligated to pay
      under the loan agreement; and
        (3) the borrower agrees to reimburse the Secretary of Energy
      for such payment on terms and conditions, including interest,
      which are satisfactory to the Secretary of Energy.

    Sec. 1144. Geothermal Resources Development Fund

-STATUTE-
    (a) Establishment; purposes for which Fund moneys may be expended
      There is established in the Treasury of the United States a
    Geothermal Resources Development Fund, which shall be available to
    the head of the designated agency for carrying out the loan
    guaranty and interest assistance program authorized by this
    subchapter, including the payment of administrative expenses
    incurred in connection therewith. Moneys in the fund not needed for
    current operations may, with the approval of the Secretary of the
    Treasury, be invested in bonds or other obligations of, or
    guaranteed by, the United States.
    (b) Deposits into the Fund
      There shall be paid into the fund the amounts appropriated
    pursuant to section 1164(c) of this title and such amounts as may
    be returned to the United States pursuant to section 1142(b) of
    this title, and the amounts in the fund shall remain available
    until expended, except that after the expiration of the ten-year
    period established by section 1143 of this title, such amounts in
    the fund which are not required to secure outstanding guaranty
    obligations shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury.
    (c) Borrowing authority of Secretary of Energy
      If at any time the moneys available in the fund are insufficient
    to enable the Secretary of Energy to discharge his responsibilities
    under this subchapter, he shall issue to the Secretary of the
    Treasury notes or other obligations in such forms and denominations
    bearing such maturities, and subject to such terms and conditions,
    as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. This
    borrowing authority shall be effective only to such extent or in
    such amounts as are specified in appropriation Acts. Such
    authorizations may be without fiscal year limitations. Redemption
    of such notes or obligations shall be made by the Secretary of
    Energy from appropriations or other moneys available under this
    section. Such notes or other obligations shall bear interest at a
    rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, which shall not
    be less than a rate determined by taking into consideration the
    average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the
    United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding
    the issuance of the notes or other obligations. The Secretary of
    the Treasury shall purchase any notes or other obligations issued
    hereunder and for that purpose he is authorized to use as a public
    debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities
    issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which
    securities may be issued under that chapter are extended to include
    any purchase of such notes or obligations. The Secretary of the
    Treasury may at any time sell any of the notes or other obligations
    acquired by him under this subsection. All redemptions, purchases,
    and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes or other
    obligations shall be treated as public debt transactions of the
    United States.
    (d) Omitted

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1145. Community impact assistance functions of Secretary of
      Energy

-STATUTE-
    (a) Determination of adequacy of community planning and development
      financing in covered project localities; review of State and
      local actions and sufficiency of available financing for projects
      on leased Federal lands
      The Secretary of Energy, for any project which has a guarantee
    under this subchapter of not less than $50,000,000 and which will
    have an intended operating life of not less than five years to
    satisfy the purposes under this subchapter for which the guarantee
    has been made, shall endeavor to insure that, taking into
    consideration appropriate local community action and all reasonably
    available forms of assistance under this section and other Federal
    and State statutes, that (!1) the impacts resulting from the
    proposed project have been fully evaluated by the borrower, the
    Secretary of Energy, and the Governor of the affected State, and
    that effective steps have been taken or will be taken in a timely
    manner to finance community planning and development costs
    resulting from such project under this section, if applicable under
    other provisions of law, or by other means. When the project will
    be located on leased Federal lands, the Secretary of Energy shall
    specifically review State and local actions under section 9(a) of
    the Mineral Leasing Act Amendments of 1976 (Public Law 94-377) and
    insure that any funds made available to the State pursuant to such
    section 9(a) are used to finance such planning and development
    costs before any Federal assistance under subsection (c) of this
    section is considered or authorized.

    (b) Discretionary activities for communities with projects not
      subject to coverage
      The Secretary of Energy, for projects not included under
    subsection (a) of this section, may in his discretion consider the
    community impacts which may result from such projects, and may take
    such actions, under authority directly available to him under other
    statutes or in coordination with other Federal agencies or the
    State, as he considers necessary and appropriate to insure timely
    and effective planning and financing for such community impacts.
    (c) Guarantees, commitments to guarantee, direct loans, and grants;
      scope, terms and conditions, amount, etc.
      (1) In order to discharge his responsibilities under subsection
    (a) of this section, and in accordance with such rules and
    regulations as the Secretary of Energy in consultation with the
    Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe, and subject to such
    terms and conditions as he deems appropriate, the Secretary of
    Energy is authorized, for the purposes of financing essential
    community development and planning which directly result from, or
    are necessitated by, a project under subsection (a) of this
    section, to - 
        (A) guarantee and make commitments to guarantee the payment of
      interest on, and the principal balance of, obligations for such
      financing issued by eligible States, political subdivisions, or
      Indian tribes,
        (B) guarantee and make commitments to guarantee the payment of
      taxes imposed on such project by eligible non-Federal taxing
      authorities which taxes are earmarked by such authorities to
      support the payment of interest and principal on obligations for
      such financing, and
        (C) require that the qualified borrower receiving assistance
      for a project under this section advance sums to eligible States,
      political subdivisions, and Indian tribes to pay for the
      financing of such development and planning: Provided, That the
      State, political subdivision, or Indian tribe agrees to provide
      tax abatement credits over the life of the project for such
      payments by such applicant.

      (2) No guarantee or commitment to guarantee under paragraph (1)
    of this subsection shall exceed $1,000,000.
      (3) In the event of any default by the borrower in the payment of
    taxes guaranteed by the Secretary of Energy under this section, the
    Secretary of Energy shall pay out of the fund established by this
    subchapter such taxes at the time or times they may fall due, and
    shall have by reason of such payment a claim against the borrower
    for all sums paid plus interest.
      (4) If after consultation with (!2) State, political subdivision,
    or Indian tribe, the Secretary of Energy finds that the financial
    assistance programs of paragraph (1) of this section will not
    result in sufficient funds to carry out the purposes of this
    subsection, then the Secretary of Energy may - 

        (A) make direct loans to the eligible States, political
      subdivisions, or Indian tribes for such purposes: Provided, That
      such loans shall be made on such reasonable terms and conditions
      as the Secretary of Energy shall prescribe: Provided further,
      That the Secretary of Energy may waive repayment of all or part
      of a loan made under this paragraph, including interest, if the
      State or political subdivision or Indian tribe involved
      demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Energy that
      due to a change in circumstances there will be net adverse
      impacts resulting from such project that would probably cause
      such State, subdivision, or tribe to default on the loan; or
        (B) require that any community development and planning costs
      which are associated with, or result from, such project, and
      which are determined by the Secretary of Energy to be appropriate
      for such inclusion, shall be included in the aggregate costs of
      the project.

      (5) The Secretary of Energy is further authorized to make grants
    to States, political subdivisions, or Indian tribes for studying
    and planning for the potential economic, environmental, and social
    consequences of projects and for establishing related management
    expertise.
      (6) At any time the Secretary of Energy may, in consultation with
    the Secretary of the Treasury, redeem, in whole or in part, out of
    the fund established by this section, the debt obligations
    guaranteed or the debt obligations for which tax payments are
    guaranteed under this subsection.
      (7) When one or more States, political subdivisions, or Indian
    tribes would be eligible for assistance under this subsection, but
    for the fact that construction and operation of the project occurs
    outside its jurisdiction, the Secretary of Energy is authorized to
    provide, to the greatest extent possible, arrangements for
    equitable sharing of such assistance.
      (8) Such amounts as may be necessary for direct loans and grants
    pursuant to this subsection shall be available as provided in
    annual authorization Acts.
      (9) The Secretary of Energy, if appropriate, shall provide
    assistance in the financing of up to 100 per centum of the costs of
    the required community development and planning pursuant to this
    section.
      (10) In carrying out the provisions of this section, the
    Secretary of Energy shall provide that title to any facility
    receiving financial assistance under this section shall vest in the
    applicable State, political subdivision, or Indian tribe, as
    appropriate, and in the case of default by the borrower on a loan
    guarantee made or committed under subsection (b) of this section,
    such facility shall not be considered a project asset for the
    purposes of section 1142 of this title.
      (11) The Secretary of Energy shall not use his authority under
    this subsection to provide Federal assistance unless any Federal
    funds transferred pursuant to section 9(a) of the Mineral Leasing
    Act Amendments of 1976 (Public Law 94-377) to the State from the
    lease of Federal land for or associated with the project have been
    or, with assurance, will be committed, to the maximum extent
    allowable under Federal statutes, to financing such essential
    community development or planning directly resulting from, or
    necessitated by, a project on leased Federal lands.

    the United States (or within sixty days after September 3, 1974, if
    the effective date of such law occurs prior to September 3, 1974),
    all of the research, development, and demonstration functions
    (including the loan guaranty program) vested in the Project under
    this chapter, along with related records, documents, personnel,
    obligations, and other items to the extent necessary or
    appropriate, shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by
    the Office of Management and Budget, be transferred to and vested
    in such organization or agency.
      (b) Upon the establishment of a permanent Federal organization or
    agency having jurisdiction over the energy research and development
    functions of the United States, and when all research and
    development (and other) functions of the Project are transferred,
    the members of the Project may provide advice and counsel to the
    head of such organization or agency, in accordance with
    arrangements made at that time.

    CHAPTER 25 - SURFACE MINING CONTROL AND RECLAMATION
    SUBCHAPTER I - STATEMENT OF FINDINGS AND POLICY

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1201. Congressional findings

-STATUTE-
      The Congress finds and declares that - 
        (a) extraction of coal and other minerals from the earth can be
      accomplished by various methods of mining, including surface
      mining;
        (b) coal mining operations presently contribute significantly
      to the Nation's energy requirements; surface coal mining
      constitutes one method of extraction of the resource; the
      overwhelming percentage of the Nation's coal reserves can only be
      extracted by underground mining methods, and it is, therefore,
      essential to the national interest to insure the existence of an
      expanding and economically healthy underground coal mining
      industry;
        (c) many surface mining operations result in disturbances of
      surface areas that burden and adversely affect commerce and the
      public welfare by destroying or diminishing the utility of land
      for commercial, industrial, residential, recreational,
      agricultural, and forestry purposes, by causing erosion and
      landslides, by contributing to floods, by polluting the water, by
      destroying fish and wildlife habitats, by impairing natural
      beauty, by damaging the property of citizens, by creating hazards
      dangerous to life and property by degrading the quality of life
      in local communities, and by counteracting governmental programs
      and efforts to conserve soil, water, and other natural resources;
        (d) the expansion of coal mining to meet the Nation's energy
      needs makes even more urgent the establishment of appropriate
      standards to minimize damage to the environment and to
      productivity of the soil and to protect the health and safety of
      the public.(!1)

        (e) surface mining and reclamation technology are now developed
      so that effective and reasonable regulation of surface coal
      mining operations by the States and by the Federal Government in
      accordance with the requirements of this chapter is an
      appropriate and necessary means to minimize so far as practicable
      the adverse social, economic, and environmental effects of such
      mining operations;
        (f) because of the diversity in terrain, climate, biologic,
      chemical, and other physical conditions in areas subject to
      mining operations, the primary governmental responsibility for
      developing, authorizing, issuing, and enforcing regulations for
      surface mining and reclamation operations subject to this chapter
      should rest with the States;
        (g) surface mining and reclamation standards are essential in
      order to insure that competition in interstate commerce among
      sellers of coal produced in different States will not be used to
      undermine the ability of the several States to improve and
      maintain adequate standards on coal mining operations within
      their borders;
        (h) there are a substantial number of acres of land throughout
      major regions of the United States disturbed by surface and
      underground coal on which little or no reclamation was conducted,
      and the impacts from these unreclaimed lands impose social and
      economic costs on residents in nearby and adjoining areas as well
      as continuing to impair environmental quality;
        (i) while there is a need to regulate surface mining operations
      for minerals other than coal, more data and analyses are needed
      to serve as a basis for effective and reasonable regulation of
      such operations;
        (j) surface and underground coal mining operations affect
      interstate commerce, contribute to the economic well-being,
      security, and general welfare of the Nation and should be
      conducted in an environmentally sound manner; and
        (k) the cooperative effort established by this chapter is
      necessary to prevent or mitigate adverse environmental effects of
      present and future surface coal mining operations.

      to achieve the purposes of this chapter;
        (h) promote the reclamation of mined areas left without
      adequate reclamation prior to August 3, 1977, and which continue,
      in their unreclaimed condition, to substantially degrade the
      quality of the environment, prevent or damage the beneficial use
      of land or water resources, or endanger the health or safety of
      the public;
        (i) assure that appropriate procedures are provided for the

    Sec. 1221. Authorization of State allotments to institutes

-STATUTE-
      (a)(1) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary
    of the Interior (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as the
    "Secretary") funds adequate to provide for each participating State
    $400,000 for each of the fiscal years ending September 30, 1990,
    through September 30, 1994, to assist the States in carrying on the
    work of a competent and qualified mining and mineral resources
    research institute or center (hereafter in this subchapter referred
    to as the "institute") at one public college or university in the
    State which meets the eligibility criteria established in section
    1230 of this title.
      (2)(A) Funds appropriated under this section shall be made
    available for grants to be matched on a basis of no less than 2 non-
    Federal dollars for each Federal dollar.
      (B) If there is more than one such eligible college or university
    in a State, funds appropriated under this subchapter shall, in the
    absence of a designation to the contrary by act of the legislature
    of the State, be granted to one such college or university
    designated by the Governor of the State.
      (C) Where a State does not have a public college or university
    eligible under section 1230 of this title, the Committee on Mining
    and Mineral Resources Research established in section 1229 of this

    than $1,800,000 for each of the fiscal years after fiscal year 1996
    to be made available by the Secretary to an institute or institutes
    experienced in investigating the continental shelf regions of the
    United States, the deep seabed and near shore environments of
    islands, and the Arctic and cold water regions as a source for
    nonfuel minerals. Such funds are to be used by the institute or
    institutes to assist in developing domestic technological
    capabilities required for the location of, and the efficient and
    environmentally sound recovery of, minerals (other than oil and
    gas) from the Nation's shallow and deep seabed.
    (b) Application for funds; contents
      Each application for funds under subsection (a) of this section
    shall state, among other things, the nature of the project to be
    undertaken; the period during which it will be pursued; the
    qualifications of the personnel who will direct and conduct it; the
    estimated costs; the importance of the project to the Nation,
    region, or State concerned; its relation to other known research
    projects theretofore pursued or being pursued; the extent to which
    the proposed project will provide opportunity for the training of
    mining and mineral engineers and scientists; and the extent of
    participation by nongovernmental sources in the project.
    (c) Research facilities; selection of institutes; designation of
      funds for scholarships and fellowships
      The Committee shall review all such funding applications and
    recommend to the Secretary the use of the institutes, insofar as
    practicable, to perform special research. Recommendations shall be
    made without regard to the race, religion, or sex of the personnel
    who will conduct and direct the research, and on the basis of the
    facilities available in relation to the particular needs of the

    (a) Coordination with existing programs; availability of
      information to public
      The Secretary shall obtain the continuing advice and cooperation
    of all agencies of the Federal Government concerned with mining and
    mineral resources, of State and local governments, and of private
    institutions and individuals to assure that the programs authorized
    by this subchapter will supplement and not be redundant with
    respect to established mining and minerals research programs, and
    to stimulate research in otherwise neglected areas, and to
    contribute to a comprehensive nationwide program of mining and
    minerals research, with due regard for the protection and
    conservation of the environment. The Secretary shall make generally
    available information and reports on projects completed, in
    progress, or planned under the provisions of this subchapter, in
    addition to any direct publication of information by the institutes
    themselves.
    (b) Effect on Federal agencies
      Nothing in this subchapter is intended to give or shall be
    construed as giving the Secretary any authority over mining and
    mineral resources research conducted by any agency of the Federal
    Government, or as repealing or diminishing existing authorities or
    responsibilities of any agency of the Federal Government to plan
    and conduct, contract for, or assist in research in its area of
    responsibility and concern with regard to mining and mineral
    resources.
    (c) Availability of results to public
      No research, demonstration, or experiment shall be carried out
    under this subchapter by an institute financed by grants under this
    subchapter, unless all uses, products, processes, patents, and
    other developments resulting therefrom, with such exception or
    limitation, if any, as the Secretary may find necessary in the
    public interest, are made available promptly to the general public.
    Patentable inventions shall be governed by the provisions of Public
    Law 96-517. Nothing contained in this section shall deprive the
    owner of any background patent relating to any such activities of
    any rights which that owner may have under that patent.
    (d) Authorization of appropriations
      (1) There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary
    $450,000 for each of the fiscal years ending September 30, 1990,
    through September 30, 1994, to administer this subchapter. No funds
    may be withheld by the Secretary for administrative expenses from
    those authorized to be appropriated by sections 1221 and 1222 of
    this title.
      (2) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary such
    sums as are necessary for the printing and publishing of the
    results of activities carried out by institutes and generic mineral
    technology centers under this subchapter, but such appropriations
    shall not exceed $550,000 in any single fiscal year.

    For purposes of performing such audits the Secretary (or any duly
    designated officer, employee, or representative of the Secretary)
    shall, at all reasonable times, upon request, have access to, and
    may copy, all books, papers, and other documents of any person
    subject to the provisions of this subchapter. The Secretary may at
    any time conduct audits of any surface coal mining and reclamation
    operation, including without limitation, tipples and preparation
    plants, as may be necessary in the judgment of the Secretary to
    ensure full and complete payment of the fees under this subchapter.
    (e) Civil action to recover fee
      Any portion of the reclamation fee not properly or promptly paid
    pursuant to this section shall be recoverable, with statutory
    interest, from coal mine operators, in any court of competent
    jurisdiction in any action at law to compel payment of debts.
    (f) Cooperation from other agencies
      All Federal and State agencies shall fully cooperate with the
    Secretary of the Interior in the enforcement of this section.

    the Secretary shall notify the Federal agency responsible for
    ensuring compliance with the provisions of section 4121 of title
    26.

        section 1240a(b) of this title (in the case of a tribe
        certified under section 1240a(a) of this title).

        (C) The funds allocated by the Secretary under this paragraph
      to States and Indian tribes shall only be used for annual
      reclamation project construction and program administration
      grants.
        (D) To the extent not expended within 3 years after the date of
      any grant award under this paragraph (except for grants awarded
      during fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010 to the extent not
      expended within 5 years), such grant shall be available for
      expenditure by the Secretary under paragraph (5).

      (2) In making the grants referred to in paragraph (1)(C) and the
    grants referred to in paragraph (5), the Secretary shall ensure
    strict compliance by the States and Indian tribes with the
    priorities described in section 1233(a) of this title until a
    certification is made under section 1240a(a) of this title.
      (3) Amounts available in the fund which are not allocated to
    States and Indian tribes under paragraph (1) or allocated under
    paragraph (5) are authorized to be expended by the Secretary for
    any of the following:
        (A) For the purpose of section 1257(c) of this title, either

      waters pursuant to section 1234 of this title in States and on
      Indian lands where the State or Indian tribe does not have an
      approved abandoned mine reclamation program pursuant to section
      1235 of this title.
        (D) For the administration of this subchapter by the Secretary.
        (E) For the purpose of paragraph (8).

      (4)(A) Amounts available in the fund which are not allocated
    under paragraphs (1), (2), and (5) or expended under paragraph (3)
    in any fiscal year are authorized to be expended by the Secretary
    under this paragraph for the reclamation or drainage abatement of
    lands and waters within unreclaimed sites which are mined for coal
    or which were affected by such mining, wastebanks, coal processing
    or other coal mining processes and left in an inadequate
    reclamation status.
      (B) Funds made available under this paragraph may be used for
    reclamation or drainage abatement at a site referred to in
    subparagraph (A) if the Secretary makes either of the following
    findings:
        (i) A finding that the surface coal mining operation occurred
      during the period beginning on August 4, 1977, and ending on or
      before the date on which the Secretary approved a State program
      pursuant to section 1253 of this title for a State in which the
      site is located, and that any funds for reclamation or abatement
      which are available pursuant to a bond or other form of financial
      guarantee or from any other source are not sufficient to provide
      for adequate reclamation or abatement at the site.
        (ii) A finding that the surface coal mining operation occurred
      during the period beginning on August 4, 1977, and ending on or
      before November 5, 1990, and that the surety of such mining
      operator became insolvent during such period, and as of November
      5, 1990, funds immediately available from proceedings relating to
      such insolvency, or from any financial guarantee or other source
      are not sufficient to provide for adequate reclamation or
      abatement at the site.

      (C) In determining which sites to reclaim pursuant to this
    paragraph, the Secretary shall follow the priorities stated in
    paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 1233(a) of this title. The
    Secretary shall ensure that priority is given to those sites which
    are in the immediate vicinity of a residential area or which have
    an adverse economic impact upon a local community.
      (D) Amounts collected from the assessment of civil penalties
    under section 1268 of this title are authorized to be appropriated
    to carry out this paragraph.
      (E) Any State may expend grants made available under paragraphs
    (1) and (5) for reclamation and abatement of any site referred to
    in subparagraph (A) if the State, with the concurrence of the
    Secretary, makes either of the findings referred to in clause (i)
    or (ii) of subparagraph (B) and if the State determines that the
    reclamation priority of the site is the same or more urgent than
    the reclamation priority for eligible lands and waters pursuant to
    section 1234 of this title under the priorities stated in
    paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 1233(a) of this title.
      (F) For the purposes of the certification referred to in section
    1240a(a) of this title, sites referred to in subparagraph (A) of
    this paragraph shall be considered as having the same priorities as
    those stated in section 1233(a) of this title for eligible lands
    and waters pursuant to section 1234 of this title. All sites
    referred to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph within any State
    shall be reclaimed prior to such State making the certification
    referred to in section 1240a(a) of this title.
      (5)(A) The Secretary shall allocate 60 percent of the amount in
    the fund after making the allocation referred to in paragraph (1)
    for making additional annual grants to States and Indian tribes
    which are not certified under section 1240a(a) of this title to
    supplement grants received by such States and Indian tribes
    pursuant to paragraph (1)(C) until the priorities stated in
    paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 1233(a) of this title have been
    achieved by such State or Indian tribe. The allocation of such
    funds for the purpose of making such expenditures shall be through
    a formula based on the amount of coal historically produced in the
    State or from the Indian lands concerned prior to August 3, 1977.
    Funds made available under paragraph (3) or (4) of this subsection
    for any State or Indian tribe shall not be deducted against any
    allocation of funds to the State or Indian tribe under paragraph
    (1) or under this paragraph.
      (B) Any amount that is reallocated and available under section
    1240a(h)(3) of this title shall be in addition to amounts that are
    allocated under subparagraph (A).
      (6)(A) Any State with an approved abandoned mine reclamation
    program pursuant to section 1235 of this title may receive and
    retain, without regard to the 3-year limitation referred to in
    paragraph (1)(D), up to 30 percent of the total of the grants made
    annually to the State under paragraphs (1) and (5) if those amounts
    are deposited into an acid mine drainage abatement and treatment
    fund established under State law, from which amounts (together with
    all interest earned on the amounts) are expended by the State for
    the abatement of the causes and the treatment of the effects of
    acid mine drainage in a comprehensive manner within qualified
    hydrologic units affected by coal mining practices.
      (B) In this paragraph, the term "qualified hydrologic unit" means
    a hydrologic unit - 
        (i) in which the water quality has been significantly affected
      by acid mine drainage from coal mining practices in a manner that
      adversely impacts biological resources; and
        (ii) that contains land and water that are - 
          (I) eligible pursuant to section 1234 of this title and
        include any of the priorities described in section 1233(a) of
        this title; and
          (II) the subject of expenditures by the State from the
        forfeiture of bonds required under section 1259 of this title
        or from other States sources to abate and treat acid mine
        drainage.

      (7) In complying with the priorities described in section 1233(a)
    of this title, any State or Indian tribe may use amounts available
    in grants made annually to the State or tribe under paragraphs (1)
    and (5) for the reclamation of eligible land and water described in
    section 1233(a)(3) of this title before the completion of
    reclamation projects under paragraphs (1) and (2) of section
    1233(a) of this title only if the expenditure of funds for the
    reclamation is done in conjunction with the expenditure before, on,
    or after December 20, 2006, of funds for reclamation projects under
    paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 1233(a) of this title.
      (8)(A) In making funds available under this subchapter, the
    Secretary shall ensure that the grant awards total not less than
    $3,000,000 annually to each State and each Indian tribe having an
    approved abandoned mine reclamation program pursuant to section
    1235 of this title and eligible land and water pursuant to section
    1234 of this title, so long as an allocation of funds to the State
    or tribe is necessary to achieve the priorities stated in
    paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 1233(a) of this title.
      (B) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this paragraph
    applies to the States of Tennessee and Missouri.

        paid to the fund during the fiscal year (reduced by the amount
        used under subparagraph (A)) to make the transfers described in

          such amount does not exceed the amounts described in
          subsection (i)(1)(A) that the Secretary estimates will be
          available to pay such estimated expenditures.

          (i)(1) are insufficient to make the maximum payments
          described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (i)(1),

            contribute to the plan referred to in paragraph (2)(C)
            shall be obligated, collectively, to make contributions

            was unconstitutional as applied to the operator; and

            (ii) on or before September 7, 2000, the signatory operator
          (or any related person to the operator) had paid to the
          Combined Fund any premium amount that had not been refunded.

          In a case in which the amount required to be transferred
        without regard to this paragraph exceeds the maximum annual
        limitation in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall adjust the

          the amount described;
            (ii) the amount is determined without regard to subsection

-STATUTE-
    (a) Priorities
      Expenditure of moneys from the fund on lands and water eligible
    pursuant to section 1234 of this title for the purposes of this
    subchapter, except as provided for under section 1240a of this
    title, shall reflect the following priorities in the order stated:
        (1)(A) the protection; (!1) of public health, safety, and
      property from extreme danger of adverse effects of coal mining
      practices;

        (B) the restoration of land and water resources and the
      environment that - 
          (i) have been degraded by the adverse effects of coal mining
        practices; and
          (ii) are adjacent to a site that has been or will be
        remediated under subparagraph (A);

        (2)(A) the protection of public health and safety from adverse
      effects of coal mining practices;
        (B) the restoration of land and water resources and the
      environment that - 
          (i) have been degraded by the adverse effects of coal mining
        practices; and
          (ii) are adjacent to a site that has been or will be
        remediated under subparagraph (A); and

        (3) the restoration of land and water resources and the
      environment previously degraded by adverse effects of coal mining
      practices including measures for the conservation and development
      of soil, water (excluding channelization), woodland, fish and
      wildlife, recreation resources, and agricultural productivity.
    (b) Water supply restoration
      (1) Any State or Indian tribe not certified under section
    1240a(a) of this title may expend funds allocated to such State or
    Indian tribe in any year through the grants made available under
    paragraphs (1) and (5) of section 1232(g) of this title for the
    purpose of protecting, repairing, replacing, constructing, or
    enhancing facilities relating to water supply, including water
    distribution facilities and treatment plants, to replace water
    supplies adversely affected by coal mining practices.
      (2) If the adverse effect on water supplies referred to in this
    subsection occurred both prior to and after August 3, 1977, or as
    the case may be, the dates (and under the criteria) set forth under
    section 1232(g)(4)(B) of this title, section 1234 of this title
    shall not be construed to prohibit a State or Indian tribe referred
    to in paragraph (1) from using funds referred to in such paragraph
    for the purposes of this subsection if the State or Indian tribe
    determines that such adverse effects occurred predominantly prior
    to August 3, 1977, or as the case may be, the dates (and under the
    criteria) set forth under section 1232(g)(4)(B) of this title.
    (c) Inventory
      For the purposes of assisting in the planning and evaluation of
    reclamation projects pursuant to section 1235 of this title, and
    assisting in making the certification referred to in section
    1240a(a) of this title, the Secretary shall maintain an inventory
    of eligible lands and waters pursuant to section 1234 of this title
    which meet the priorities stated in paragraphs (1) and (2) of
    subsection (a) of this section. Under standardized procedures
    established by the Secretary, States and Indian tribes with
    approved abandoned mine reclamation programs pursuant to section
    1235 of this title may offer amendments, subject to the approval of
    the Secretary, to update the inventory as it applies to eligible
    lands and waters under the jurisdiction of such States or tribes.
    The Secretary shall provide such States and tribes with the
    financial and technical assistance necessary for the purpose of
    making inventory amendments. The Secretary shall compile and
    maintain an inventory for States and Indian lands in the case when
    a State or Indian tribe does not have an approved abandoned mine

-STATUTE-
      Lands and water eligible for reclamation or drainage abatement
    expenditures under this subchapter are those which were mined for
    coal or which were affected by such mining, wastebanks, coal
    processing, or other coal mining processes, except as provided for
    under section 1240a of this title, and abandoned or left in an
    inadequate reclamation status prior to August 3, 1977, and for
    which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility under State
    or other Federal laws. For other provisions relating to lands and
    waters eligible for such expenditures, see section 1232(g)(4) of
    this title, section 1233(b)(1) of this title, and section 1239 of
    this title. Surface coal mining operations on lands eligible for
    remining shall not affect the eligibility of such lands for
    reclamation and restoration under this subchapter after the release
    of the bond or deposit for any such operation as provided under
    section 1269 of this title. In the event the bond or deposit for a
    surface coal mining operation on lands eligible for remining is
    forfeited, funds available under this subchapter may be used if the
    amount of such bond or deposit is not sufficient to provide for
    adequate reclamation or abatement, except that if conditions
    warrant the Secretary shall immediately exercise his authority
    under section 1240 of this title.

    Sec. 1236. Reclamation of rural lands

-STATUTE-
    (a) Agreements with landowners for conservation treatment
      In order to provide for the control and prevention of erosion and
    sediment damages from unreclaimed mined lands, and to promote the
    conservation and development of soil and water resources of
    unreclaimed mined lands and lands affected by mining, the Secretary
    of Agriculture is authorized to enter into agreements of not more
    than ten years with landowners (including owners of water rights),
    residents, and tenants, and individually or collectively,
    determined by him to have control for the period of the agreement
    of lands in question therein, providing for land stabilization,
    erosion, and sediment control, and reclamation through conservation
    treatment, including measures for the conservation and development
    of soil, water (excluding stream channelization), woodland,
    wildlife, and recreation resources, and agricultural productivity
    of such lands. Such agreements shall be made by the Secretary with
    the owners, including owners of water rights, residents, or tenants
    (collectively or individually) of the lands in question.
    (b) Conservation and development plans
      The landowner, including the owner of water rights, resident, or
    tenant shall furnish to the Secretary of Agriculture a conservation
    and development plan setting forth the proposed land uses and
    conservation treatment which shall be mutually agreed by the
    Secretary of Agriculture and the landowner, including owner of
    water rights, resident, or tenant to be needed on the lands for
    which the plan was prepared. In those instances where it is
    determined that the water rights or water supply of a tenant,
    landowner, including owner of water rights, resident, or tenant
    have been adversely affected by a surface or underground coal mine
    operation which has removed or disturbed a stratum so as to
    significantly affect the hydrologic balance, such plan may include
    proposed measures to enhance water quality or quantity by means of
    joint action with other affected landowners, including owner of
    water rights, residents, or tenants in consultation with
    appropriate State and Federal agencies.
    (c) Agreement to effect plan
      Such plan shall be incorporated in an agreement under which the
    landowner, including owner of water rights, resident, or tenant
    shall agree with the Secretary of Agriculture to effect the land
    uses and conservation treatment provided for in such plan on the
    lands described in the agreement in accordance with the terms and
    conditions thereof.
    (d) Financial and other assistance; determination by Secretary
      In return for such agreement by the landowner, including owner of
    water rights, resident, or tenant, the Secretary of Agriculture is
    authorized to furnish financial and other assistance to such
    landowner, including owner of water rights, resident, or tenant, in
    such amounts and subject to such conditions as the Secretary of
    Agriculture determines are appropriate in the public interest for
    carrying out the land use and conservation treatment set forth in
    the agreement. Grants made under this section, depending on the
    income-producing potential of the land after reclaiming, shall
    provide up to 80 per centum of the cost of carrying out such land
    uses and conservation treatment on not more than one hundred and
    twenty acres of land occupied by such owner, including water rights
    owners, resident, or tenant, or on not more than one hundred and
    twenty acres of land which has been purchased jointly by such
    landowners, including water rights owners, residents, or tenants,
    under an agreement for the enhancement of water quality or quantity
    or on land which has been acquired by an appropriate State or local
    agency for the purpose of implementing such agreement; except the
    Secretary may reduce the matching cost share where he determines
    that (1) the main benefits to be derived from the project are
    related to improving offsite water quality, offsite esthetic
    values, or other offsite benefits, and (2) the matching share
    requirement would place a burden on the landowner which would
    probably prevent him from participating in the program: Provided,
    however, That the Secretary of Agriculture may allow for land use
    and conservation treatment on such lands occupied by any such owner
    in excess of such one hundred and twenty acre limitation up to
    three hundred and twenty acres, but in such event the amount of the
    grant to such landowner to carry out such reclamation on such lands
    shall be reduced proportionately. Notwithstanding any other
    provision of this section with regard to acreage limitations, the
    Secretary of Agriculture may carry out reclamation treatment
    projects to control erosion and improve water quality on all lands
    within a hydrologic unit, consisting of not more than 25,000 acres,
    if the Secretary determines that treatment of such lands as a
    hydrologic unit will achieve greater reduction in the adverse
    effects of past surface mining practices than would be achieved if
    reclamation was done on individual parcels of land.
    (e) Termination of agreements
      The Secretary of Agriculture may terminate any agreement with a
    landowner including water rights owners, operator, or occupier by
    mutual agreement if the Secretary of Agriculture determines that
    such termination would be in the public interest, and may agree to
    such modification of agreements previously entered into hereunder
    as he deems desirable to carry out the purposes of this section or
    to facilitate the practical administration of the program
    authorized herein.
    (f) Preservation and surrender of history and allotments
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of
    Agriculture, to the extent he deems it desirable to carry out the
    purposes of this section, may provide in any agreement hereinunder
    for (1) preservation for a period not to exceed the period covered
    by the agreement and an equal period thereafter of the cropland,
    crop acreage, and allotment history applicable to land covered by
    the agreement for the purpose of any Federal program under which
    such history is used as a basis for an allotment or other
    limitation on the production of such crop; or (2) surrender of any
    such history and allotments.
    (g) Rules and regulations
      The Secretary of Agriculture shall be authorized to issue such
    rules and regulations as he determines are necessary to carry out
    the provisions of this section.
    (h) Utilization of Natural Resources Conservation Service
      In carrying out the provisions of this section, the Secretary of
    Agriculture shall utilize the services of the Natural Resources
    Conservation Service.
    (i) Authorization of appropriations
      There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of
    Agriculture, from amounts in the Treasury other than amounts in the
    fund, such sums as may be necessary to carry out this section.

    reclamation treatment projects to control erosion and improve water
    quality on all lands within a hydrologic unit, consisting of not
    more than 25,000 acres, if the Secretary determines that treatment
    of such lands as a hydrologic unit will achieve greater reduction
    in the adverse effects of past surface mining practices than would
    be achieved if reclamation was done on individual parcels of land.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1237. Acquisition and reclamation of land adversely affected
      by past coal mining practices

-STATUTE-
    (a) Findings of fact; notice; right of entry
      If the Secretary or the State pursuant to an approved State
    program, makes a finding of fact that - 
        (1) land or water resources have been adversely affected by
      past coal mining practices; and
        (2) the adverse effects are at a stage where, in the public
      interest, action to restore, reclaim, abate, control, or prevent
      should be taken; and
        (3) the owners of the land or water resources where entry must
      be made to restore, reclaim, abate, control, or prevent the
      adverse effects of past coal mining practices are not known, or
      readily available; or
        (4) the owners will not give permission for the United States,
      the States, political subdivisions, their agents, employees, or
      contractors to enter upon such property to restore, reclaim,
      abate, control, or prevent the adverse effects of past coal
      mining practices;

    then, upon giving notice by mail to the owners if known or if not
    known by posting notice upon the premises and advertising once in a
    newspaper of general circulation in the municipality in which the
    land lies, the Secretary, his agents, employees, or contractors, or
    the State pursuant to an approved State program, shall have the
    right to enter upon the property adversely affected by past coal
    mining practices and any other property to have access to such
    property to do all things necessary or expedient to restore,
    reclaim, abate, control, or prevent the adverse effects. Such entry
    shall be construed as an exercise of the police power for the
    protection of public health, safety, and general welfare and shall
    not be construed as an act of condemnation of property nor of
    trespass thereon. The moneys expended for such work and the
    benefits accruing to any such premises so entered upon shall be
    chargeable against such land and shall mitigate or offset any claim
    in or any action brought by any owner of any interest in such
    premises for any alleged damages by virtue of such entry: Provided,
    however, That this provision is not intended to create new rights
    of action or eliminate existing immunities.
    (b) Studies or exploratory work
      The Secretary, his agents, employees, or contractors or the State
    pursuant to an approved State program, shall have the right to
    enter upon any property for the purpose of conducting studies or
    exploratory work to determine the existence of adverse effects of
    past coal mining practices and to determine the feasibility of
    restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or prevention of such
    adverse effects. Such entry shall be construed as an exercise of
    the police power for the protection of public health, safety, and
    general welfare and shall not be construed as an act of
    condemnation of property nor trespass thereon.
    (c) Requirements for acquisition of affected land
      The Secretary or the State pursuant to an approved State program,
    may acquire any land, by purchase, donation, or condemnation, which
    is adversely affected by past coal mining practices if the
    Secretary determines that acquisition of such land is necessary to
    successful reclamation and that - 
        (1) the acquired land, after restoration, reclamation,
      abatement, control, or prevention of the adverse effects of past
      coal mining practices, will serve recreation and historic
      purposes, conservation and reclamation purposes or provide open
      space benefits; and
        (2) permanent facilities such as a treatment plant or a
      relocated stream channel will be constructed on the land for the
      restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or prevention of
      the adverse effects of past coal mining practices; or
        (3) acquisition of coal refuse disposal sites and all coal
      refuse thereon will serve the purposes of this subchapter or that
      public ownership is desirable to meet emergency situations and
      prevent recurrences of the adverse effects of past coal mining
      practices.
    (d) Title to affected land; value
      Title to all lands acquired pursuant to this section shall be in
    the name of the United States or, if acquired by a State pursuant
    to an approved program, title shall be in the name of the State.
    The price paid for land acquired under this section shall reflect
    the market value of the land as adversely affected by past coal
    mining practices.
    (e) State participation; grants
      States are encouraged as part of their approved State programs,
    to reclaim abandoned and unreclaimed mined lands within their
    boundaries and, if necessary, to acquire or to transfer such lands
    to the Secretary or the appropriate State regulatory authority
    under appropriate Federal regulations. The Secretary is authorized
    to make grants on a matching basis to States in such amounts as he
    deems appropriate for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of
    this subchapter but in no event shall any grant exceed 90 per
    centum of the cost of acquisition of the lands for which the grant
    is made. When a State has made any such land available to the
    Federal Government under this subchapter, such State shall have a
    preference right to purchase such lands after reclamation at fair
    market value less the State portion of the original acquisition
    price. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of
    subsection (c) of this section, reclaimed land may be sold to the
    State or local government in which it is located at a price less
    than fair market value, which in no case shall be less than the
    cost to the United States of the purchase and reclamation of the
    land, as negotiated by the Secretary, to be used for a valid public
    purpose. If any land sold to a State or local government under this
    paragraph is not used for a valid public purpose as specified by
    the Secretary in the terms of the sales agreement then all right,
    title, and interest in such land shall revert to the United States.
    Money received from such sale shall be deposited in the fund.
    (f) Rules and regulations
      The Secretary, in formulating regulations for making grants to
    the States to acquire land pursuant to this section, shall specify
    that acquired land meet the criteria provided for in subsections
    (c) and (d) of this section. The Secretary may provide by
    regulation that money derived from the lease, rental, or user
    charges of such acquired land and facilities thereon will be
    deposited in the fund.
    (g) Public sale; notice and hearing
      (1) Where land acquired pursuant to this section is deemed to be
    suitable for industrial, commercial, residential, or recreational
    development, the Secretary may sell or authorize the States to sell
    such land by public sale under a system of competitive bidding, at
    not less than fair market value and under such other regulations
    promulgated to insure that such lands are put to proper use
    consistent with local and State land use plans, if any, as
    determined by the Secretary.
      (2) The Secretary or the State pursuant to an approved State
    program, when requested after appropriate public notice shall hold
    a public hearing, with the appropriate notice, in the county or
    counties or the appropriate subdivisions of the State in which
    lands acquired pursuant to this section are located. The hearings
    shall be held at a time which shall afford local citizens and
    governments the maximum opportunity to participate in the decision
    concerning the use or disposition of the lands after restoration,
    reclamation, abatement, control, or prevention of the adverse
    effects of past coal mining practices.
    (h) Construction or rehabilitation of housing for disabled,
      displaced, or dislocated persons; grants
      In addition to the authority to acquire land under subsection (d)
    of this section the Secretary is authorized to use money in the
    fund to acquire land by purchase, donation, or condemnation, and to
    reclaim and transfer acquired land to any State or to a political
    subdivision thereof, or to any person, firm, association, or
    corporation, if he determines that such is an integral and
    necessary element of an economically feasible plan for the project
    to construct or rehabilitate housing for persons disabled as the
    result of employment in the mines or work incidental thereto,
    persons displaced by acquisition of land pursuant to this section,
    or persons dislocated as the result of adverse effects of coal
    mining practices which constitute an emergency as provided in
    section 1240 of this title or persons dislocated as the result of
    natural disasters or catastrophic failures from any cause. Such
    activities shall be accomplished under such terms and conditions as
    the Secretary shall require, which may include transfers of land
    with or without monetary consideration: Provided, That, to the
    extent that the consideration is below the fair market value of the
    land transferred, no portion of the difference between the fair
    market value and the consideration shall accrue as a profit to such
    persons, firm, association, or corporation. No part of the funds
    provided under this subchapter may be used to pay the actual
    construction costs of housing. The Secretary may carry out the
    purposes of this subsection directly or he may make grants and
    commitments for grants, and may advance money under such terms and
    conditions as he may require to any State, or any department,
    agency, or instrumentality of a State, or any public body or
    nonprofit organization designated by a State.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Filing of statement and appraisal
      Within six months after the completion of projects to restore,
    reclaim, abate, control, or prevent adverse effects of past coal
    mining practices on privately owned land, the Secretary or the
    State, pursuant to an approved State program, shall itemize the
    moneys so expended and may file a statement thereof in the office
    of the county in which the land lies which has the responsibility
    under local law for the recording of judgments against land,
    together with a notarized appraisal by an independent appraiser of
    the value of the land before the restoration, reclamation,
    abatement, control, or prevention of adverse effects of past coal
    mining practices if the moneys so expended shall result in a
    significant increase in property value. Such statement shall
    constitute a lien upon the said land. The lien shall not exceed the
    amount determined by the appraisal to be the increase in the market
    value of the land as a result of the restoration, reclamation,
    abatement, control, or prevention of the adverse effects of past
    coal mining practices. No lien shall be filed against the property
    of any person, in accordance with this subsection, who neither
    consented to nor participated in nor exercised control over the
    mining operation which necessitated the reclamation performed
    hereunder.
    (b) Petition
      The landowner may proceed as provided by local law to petition
    within sixty days of the filing of the lien, to determine the
    increase in the market value of the land as a result of the
    restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or prevention of the
    adverse effects of past coal mining practices. The amount reported
    to be the increase in value of the premises shall constitute the
    amount of the lien and shall be recorded with the statement herein
    provided. Any party aggrieved by the decision may appeal as
    provided by local law.
    (c) Recordation
      The lien provided in this section shall be entered in the county
    office in which the land lies and which has responsibility under
    local law for the recording of judgments against land. Such
    statement shall constitute a lien upon the said land as of the date
    of the expenditure of the moneys and shall have priority as a lien
    second only to the lien of real estate taxes imposed upon said
    land.

    Sec. 1239. Filling voids and sealing tunnels

-STATUTE-
    (a) Congressional declaration of hazardous conditions
      The Congress declares that voids, and open and abandoned tunnels,
    shafts, and entryways resulting from any previous mining operation,
    constitute a hazard to the public health or safety and that surface
    impacts of any underground or surface mining operation may degrade
    the environment. The Secretary, at the request of the Governor of
    any State, or the the (!1) governing body of an Indian tribe, is
    authorized to fill such voids, seal such abandoned tunnels, shafts,
    and entryways, and reclaim surface impacts of underground or
    surface mines which the Secretary determines could endanger life
    and property, constitute a hazard to the public health and safety,
    or degrade the environment. State regulatory authorities are
    authorized to carry out such work pursuant to an approved abandoned
    mine reclamation program.

    (b) Limitation on funds
      Funds available for use in carrying out the purpose of this
    section shall be limited to those funds which must be allocated to
    the respective States or Indian tribes under the provisions of
    paragraphs (1) and (5) of section 1232(g) of this title.
    (c) Limitation on expenditures
      (1) The Secretary may make expenditures and carry out the
    purposes of this section in such States where requests are made by
    the Governor or governing body of an Indian tribe for those
    reclamation projects which meet the priorities stated in section
    1233(a)(1) of this title, except that for the purposes of this
    section the reference to coal in section 1233(a)(1) of this title
    shall not apply.
      (2) The provisions of section 1234 of this title shall apply to
    this section, with the exception that such mined lands need not
    have been mined for coal.
      (3) The Secretary shall not make any expenditures for the
    purposes of this section in those States which have made the
    certification referred to in section 1240a(a) of this title.
    (d) Disposal of mine wastes
      In those instances where mine waste piles are being reworked for
    conservation purposes, the incremental costs of disposing of the
    wastes from such operations by filling voids and sealing tunnels
    may be eligible for funding providing that the disposal of these
    wastes meets the purposes of this section.
    (e) Land acquisition
      The Secretary may acquire by purchase, donation, easement, or
    otherwise such interest in land as he determines necessary to carry
    out the provisions of this section.

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Secretary is authorized to expend moneys from the fund
    for the emergency restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or
    prevention of adverse effects of coal mining practices, on eligible
    lands, if the Secretary makes a finding of fact that - 
        (1) an emergency exists constituting a danger to the public
      health, safety, or general welfare; and
        (2) no other person or agency will act expeditiously to
      restore, reclaim, abate, control, or prevent the adverse effects
      of coal mining practices.

      (b) The Secretary, his agents, employees, and contractors shall
    have the right to enter upon any land where the emergency exists
    and any other land to have access to the land where the emergency
    exists to restore, reclaim, abate, control, or prevent the adverse
    effects of coal mining practices and to do all things necessary or
    expedient to protect the public health, safety, or general welfare.
    Such entry shall be construed as an exercise of the police power
    and shall not be construed as an act of condemnation of property
    nor of trespass thereof. The moneys expended for such work and the
    benefits accruing to any such premises so entered upon shall be
    chargeable against such land and shall mitigate or offset any claim
    in or any action brought by any owner of any interest in such
    premises for any alleged damages by virtue of such entry: Provided,
    however, That this provision is not intended to create new rights
    of action or eliminate existing immunities.

    grants made available under section 1232(g)(1) of this title to
    carry out such activities or construction.
    (g) Application of other provisions
      The provisions of sections 1237 and 1238 of this title shall

    Sec. 1244. Remining incentives

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the
    Secretary may, after opportunity for public comment, promulgate
    regulations that describe conditions under which amounts in the
    fund may be used to provide incentives to promote remining of
    eligible land under section 1234 of this title in a manner that
    leverages the use of amounts from the fund to achieve more
    reclamation with respect to the eligible land than would be
    achieved without the incentives.
    (b) Requirements
      Any regulations promulgated under subsection (a) shall specify
    that the incentives shall apply only if the Secretary determines,
    with the concurrence of the State regulatory authority referred to
    in subchapter V, that, without the incentives, the eligible land
    would not be likely to be remined and reclaimed.
    (c) Incentives
      (1) In general
        Incentives that may be considered for inclusion in the
      regulations promulgated under subsection (a) include, but are not
      limited to - 
          (A) a rebate or waiver of the reclamation fees required under
        section 1232(a) of this title; and
          (B) the use of amounts in the fund to provide financial
        assurance for remining operations in lieu of all or a portion
        of the performance bonds required under section 1259 of this
        title.
      (2) Limitations
        (A) Use
          A rebate or waiver under paragraph (1)(A) shall be used only
        for operations that - 
            (i) remove or reprocess abandoned coal mine waste; or
            (ii) conduct remining activities that meet the priorities
          specified in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1233(a) of this
          title.
        (B) Amount
          The amount of a rebate or waiver provided as an incentive
        under paragraph (1)(A) to remine or reclaim eligible land shall
        not exceed the estimated cost of reclaiming the eligible land
        under this section.

    regulatory procedure for surface coal mining and reclamation
    operations setting mining and reclamation performance standards
    based on and incorporating the provisions set out in section
    1252(c) of this title. The issuance of the interim regulations
    shall be deemed not to be a major Federal action within the meaning
    of section 4332(2)(c) (!1) of title 42. Such regulations, which
    shall be concise and written in plain, understandable language
    shall not be promulgated and published by the Secretary until he
    has - 

        (A) published proposed regulations in the Federal Register and
      afforded interested persons and State and local governments a
      period of not less than thirty days after such publication to
      submit written comments thereon;
        (B) obtained the written concurrence of the Administrator of
      the Environmental Protection Agency with respect to those
      regulations promulgated under this section which relate to air or

    Sec. 1251a. Abandoned coal refuse sites

-STATUTE-
      (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Surface Mining
    Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 [30 U.S.C. 1201 et seq.] to the
    contrary, the Secretary of the Interior shall, within one year
    after October 24, 1992, publish proposed regulations in the Federal
    Register, and after opportunity for public comment publish final
    regulations, establishing environmental protection performance and
    reclamation standards, and separate permit systems applicable to
    operations for the on-site reprocessing of abandoned coal refuse
    and operations for the removal of abandoned coal refuse on lands
    that would otherwise be eligible for expenditure under section 404
    and section 402(g)(4) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation
    Act of 1977 [30 U.S.C. 1234, 1232(g)(4)].
      (2) The standards and permit systems referred to in paragraph (1)
    shall distinguish between those operations which reprocess
    abandoned coal refuse on-site, and those operations which
    completely remove abandoned coal refuse from a site for the direct
    use of such coal refuse, or for the reprocessing of such coal
    refuse, at another location. Such standards and permit systems
    shall be premised on the distinct differences between operations
    for the on-site reprocessing, and operations for the removal, of
    abandoned coal refuse and other types of surface coal mining
    operations.
      (3) The Secretary of the Interior may devise a different standard
    than any of those set forth in section 515 and section 516 of the
    Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 [30 U.S.C. 1265,
    1266], and devise a separate permit system, if he determines, on a
    standard-by-standard basis, that a different standard may
    facilitate the on-site reprocessing, or the removal, of abandoned
    coal refuse in a manner that would provide the same level of
    environmental protection as under section 515 and section 516.
      (4) Not later than 30 days prior to the publication of the
    proposed regulations referred to in this section, the Secretary
    shall submit a report to the Committee on Interior and Insular
    Affairs of the United States House of Representatives, and the
    Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States
    Senate containing a detailed description of any environmental
    protection performance and reclamation standards, and separate
    permit systems, devised pursuant to this section.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1252. Initial regulatory procedures

-STATUTE-
    (a) State regulation
      No person shall open or develop any new or previously mined or
    abandoned site for surface coal mining operations on lands on which
    such operations are regulated by a State unless such person has
    obtained a permit from the State's regulatory authority.
    (b) Interim standards
      All surface coal mining operations on lands on which such
    operations are regulated by a State which commence operations
    pursuant to a permit issued on or after six months from August 3,
    1977, shall comply, and such permits shall contain terms requiring
    compliance with, the provisions set out in subsection (c) of this
    section. Prior to final disapproval of a State program or prior to
    promulgation of a Federal program or a Federal lands program
    pursuant to this chapter, a State may issue such permits.
    (c) Full compliance with environmental protection performance
      standards
      On and after nine months from August 3, 1977, all surface coal
    mining operations on lands on which such operations are regulated
    by a State shall comply with the provisions of subsections (b)(2),
    (b)(3), (b)(5), (b)(10), (b)(13), (b)(15), (b)(19), and (d) of
    section 1265 of this title or, where a surface coal mining
    operation will remove an entire coal seam or seams running through
    the upper fraction of a mountain, ridge, or hill by removing all of
    the overburden and creating a level plateau or a gently rolling
    contour with no highwalls remaining, such operation shall comply
    with the requirements of section 1265(c)(4) and (5) of this title
    without regard to the requirements of section 1265(b)(3) or (d)(2)
    and (3) of this title, with respect to lands from which overburden
    and the coal seam being mined have not been removed: Provided,
    however, That surface coal mining operations in operation pursuant
    to a permit issued by a State before August 3, 1977, issued to a
    person as defined in section 1291(19) of this title in existence
    prior to May 2, 1977 and operated by a person whose total annual
    production of coal from surface and underground coal mining
    operations does not exceed one hundred thousand tons shall not be
    subject to the provisions of this subsection except with reference
    to the provision of section 1265(d)(1) of this title until January
    1, 1979.
    (d) Permit application
      Not later than two months following the approval of a State
    program pursuant to section 1253 of this title or the
    implementation of a Federal program pursuant to section 1254 of
    this title, regardless of litigation contesting that approval or
    implementation, all operators of surface coal mines in expectation
    of operating such mines after the expiration of eight months from
    the approval of a State program or the implementation of a Federal
    program, shall file an application for a permit with the regulatory
    authority. Such application shall cover those lands to be mined
    after the expiration of eight months from the approval of a State
    program or the implementation of a Federal program. The regulatory
    authority shall process such applications and grant or deny a
    permit within eight months after the date of approval of the State
    program or the implementation of the Federal program, unless
    specially enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction, but in no
    case later than forty-two months from August 3, 1977.
    (e) Federal enforcement program
      Within six months after August 3, 1977, the Secretary shall
    implement a Federal enforcement program which shall remain in
    effect in each State as surface coal mining operations are required
    to comply with the provisions of this chapter, until the State
    program has been approved pursuant to this chapter or until a
    Federal program has been implemented pursuant to this chapter. The
    enforcement program shall - 
        (1) include inspections of surface coal mine sites which may be
      made (but at least one inspection for every site every six
      months), without advance notice to the mine operator and for the
      purpose of ascertaining compliance with the standards of
      subsections (b) and (c) above. The Secretary shall order any
      necessary enforcement action to be implemented pursuant to the
      Federal enforcement provision of this subchapter to correct
      violations identified at the inspections;
        (2) provide that upon receipt of inspection reports indicating
      that any surface coal mining operation has been found in
      violation of subsections (b) and (c) above, during not less than
      two consecutive State inspections or upon receipt by the
      Secretary of information which would give rise to reasonable
      belief that such standards are being violated by any surface coal
      mining operation, the Secretary shall order the immediate
      inspection of such operation by Federal inspectors and the
      necessary enforcement actions, if any, to be implemented pursuant
      to the Federal enforcement provisions of this subchapter. When
      the Federal inspection results from information provided to the
      Secretary by any person, the Secretary shall notify such person
      when the Federal inspection is proposed to be carried out and
      such person shall be allowed to accompany the inspector during
      the inspection;
        (3) provide that the State regulatory agency file with the
      Secretary and with a designated Federal office centrally located
      in the county or area in which the inspected surface coal mine is
      located copies of inspection reports made;
        (4) provide that moneys authorized by section 1302 of this
      title shall be available to the Secretary prior to the approval
      of a State program pursuant to this chapter to reimburse the
      State for conducting those inspections in which the standards of
      this chapter are enforced and for the administration of this
      section.(!1)

        (5) for purposes of this section, the term "Federal inspector"
      means personnel of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and
      Enforcement and such additional personnel of the United States
      Geological Survey, Bureau of Land Management, or of the Mining
      Enforcement and Safety Administration so designated by the
      Secretary, or such other personnel of the Forest Service, Soil
      Conservation Service, or the Agricultural Stabilization and
      Conservation Service as arranged by appropriate agreement with
      the Secretary on a reimbursable or other basis; (!2)

    (f) Interim period
      Following the final disapproval of a State program, and prior to
    promulgation of a Federal program or a Federal lands program
    pursuant to this chapter, including judicial review of such a
    program, existing surface coal mining operations may continue
    surface mining operations pursuant to the provisions of this
    section. During such period no new permits shall be issued by the
    State whose program has been disapproved. Permits which lapse
    during such period may continue in full force and effect until
    promulgation of a Federal program or a Federal lands program.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations;
      submittal to Secretary; time limit; demonstration of
      effectiveness
      Each State in which there are or may be conducted surface coal
    mining operations on non-Federal lands, and which wishes to assume
    exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of surface coal mining
    and reclamation operations, except as provided in sections 1271 and
    1273 of this title and subchapter IV of this chapter, shall submit
    to the Secretary, by the end of the eighteenth-month (!1) period
    beginning on August 3, 1977, a State program which demonstrates
    that such State has the capability of carrying out the provisions
    of this chapter and meeting its purposes through - 

        (1) a State law which provides for the regulation of surface
      coal mining and reclamation operations in accordance with the
      requirements of this chapter;
        (2) a State law which provides sanctions for violations of
      State laws, regulations, or conditions of permits concerning
      surface coal mining and reclamation operations, which sanctions
      shall meet the minimum requirements of this chapter, including
      civil and criminal actions, forfeiture of bonds, suspensions,
      revocations, and withholding of permits, and the issuance of
      cease-and-desist orders by the State regulatory authority or its
      inspectors;
        (3) a State regulatory authority with sufficient administrative
      and technical personnel, and sufficient funding to enable the
      State to regulate surface coal mining and reclamation operations
      in accordance with the requirements of this chapter;
        (4) a State law which provides for the effective
      implementations,(!1) maintenance, and enforcement of a permit
      system, meeting the requirements of this subchapter for the
      regulations (!1) of surface coal mining and reclamation
      operations for coal on lands within the State;
        (5) establishment of a process for the designation of areas as
      unsuitable for surface coal mining in accordance with section
      1272 of this title provided that the designation of Federal lands
      unsuitable for mining shall be performed exclusively by the
      Secretary after consultation with the State; and (!1)
        (6) establishment for the purposes of avoiding duplication, of
      a process for coordinating the review and issuance of permits for
      surface coal mining and reclamation operations with any other
      Federal or State permit process applicable to the proposed
      operations; and
        (7) rules and regulations consistent with regulations issued by
      the Secretary pursuant to this chapter.
    (b) Approval of program
      The Secretary shall not approve any State program submitted under
    this section until he has - 
        (1) solicited and publicly disclosed the views of the
      Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the
      Secretary of Agriculture, and the heads of other Federal agencies
      concerned with or having special expertise pertinent to the
      proposed State program;
        (2) obtained the written concurrence of the Administrator of
      the Environmental Protection Agency with respect to those aspects
      of a State program which relate to air or water quality standards
      promulgated under the authority of the Federal Water Pollution
      Control Act, as amended [33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.], and the Clean
      Air Act, as amended [42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.];
        (3) held at least one public hearing on the State program
      within the State; and
        (4) found that the State has the legal authority and qualified
      personnel necessary for the enforcement of the environmental
      protection standards.

    The Secretary shall approve or disapprove a State program, in whole
    or in part, within six full calendar months after the date such
    State program was submitted to him.
    (c) Notice of disapproval
      If the Secretary disapproves any proposed State program in whole
    or in part, he shall notify the State in writing of his decision
    and set forth in detail the reasons therefor. The State shall have
    sixty days in which to resubmit a revised State program or portion
    thereof. The Secretary shall approve or disapprove the resubmitted
    State program or portion thereof within sixty days from the date of
    resubmission.
    (d) Inability of State to take action
      For the purposes of this section and section 1254 of this title,
    the inability of a State to take any action the purpose of which is
    to prepare, submit or enforce a State program, or any portion
    thereof, because the action is enjoined by the issuance of an
    injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction shall not result
    in a loss of eligibility for financial assistance under subchapters
    IV and VII of this chapter or in the imposition of a Federal
    program. Regulation of the surface coal mining and reclamation
    operations covered or to be covered by the State program subject to
    the injunction shall be conducted by the State pursuant to section
    1252 of this title, until such time as the injunction terminates or
    for one year, whichever is shorter, at which time the requirements
    of this section and section 1254 of this title shall again be fully
    applicable.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1254. Federal programs

-STATUTE-
    (a) Promulgation and implementation by Secretary for State
      The Secretary shall prepare and, subject to the provisions of
    this section, promulgate and implement a Federal program for a
    State no later than thirty-four months after August 3, 1977, if
    such State - 
        (1) fails to submit a State program covering surface coal
      mining and reclamation operations by the end of the eighteen-
      month period beginning on August 3, 1977;
        (2) fails to resubmit an acceptable State program within sixty
      days of disapproval of a proposed State program: Provided, That
      the Secretary shall not implement a Federal program prior to the
      expiration of the initial period allowed for submission of a
      State program as provided for in clause (1) of this subsection;
      or
        (3) fails to implement, enforce, or maintain its approved State
      program as provided for in this chapter.

    If State compliance with clause (1) of this subsection requires an
    act of the State legislature, the Secretary may extend the period
    of submission of a State program up to an additional six months.
    Promulgation and implementation of a Federal program vests the
    Secretary with exclusive jurisdiction for the regulation and
    control of surface coal mining and reclamation operations taking
    place on lands within any State not in compliance with this
    chapter. After promulgation and implementation of a Federal program
    the Secretary shall be the regulatory authority. If a Federal
    program is implemented for a State, section 1272(a), (c), and (d)
    of this title shall not apply for a period of one year following
    the date of such implementation. In promulgating and implementing a
    Federal program for a particular State the Secretary shall take
    into consideration the nature of that State's terrain, climate,
    biological, chemical, and other relevant physical conditions.
    (b) Federal enforcement of State program
      In the event that a State has a State program for surface coal
    mining, and is not enforcing any part of such program, the
    Secretary may provide for the Federal enforcement, under the
    provisions of section 1271 of this title, of that part of the State
    program not being enforced by such State.
    (c) Notice and hearing
      Prior to promulgation and implementation of any proposed Federal
    program, the Secretary shall give adequate public notice and hold a
    public hearing in the affected State.
    (d) Review of permits
      Permits issued pursuant to a previously approved State program
    shall be valid but reviewable under a Federal program. Immediately
    following promulgation of a Federal program, the Secretary shall
    undertake to review such permits to determine that the requirements
    of this chapter are not violated. If the Secretary determines any
    permit to have been granted contrary to the requirements of this
    chapter, he shall so advise the permittee and provide him an
    opportunity for hearing and a reasonable opportunity for submission
    of a new application and reasonable time, within a time limit
    prescribed in regulations promulgated pursuant to section 1251(b)
    of this title, to conform ongoing surface mining and reclamation
    operations to the requirements of the Federal program.
    (e) Submission of State program after implementation of Federal
      program
      A State which has failed to obtain the approval of a State
    program prior to implementation of a Federal program may submit a
    State program at any time after such implementation. Upon the
    submission of such a program, the Secretary shall follow the
    procedures set forth in section 1253(b) of this title and shall
    approve or disapprove the State program within six months after its
    submittal. Approval of a State program shall be based on the
    determination that the State has the capability of carrying out the
    provisions of this chapter and meeting its purposes through the
    criteria set forth in section 1253(a)(1) through (6) of this title.
    Until a State program is approved as provided under this section,
    the Federal program shall remain in effect and all actions taken by
    the Secretary pursuant to such Federal program, including the terms
    and conditions of any permit issued thereunder shall remain in
    effect.
    (f) Validity of Federal program permits under superseding State
      program
      Permits issued pursuant to the Federal program shall be valid
    under any superseding State program: Provided, That the Federal
    permittee shall have the right to apply for a State permit to
    supersede his Federal permit. The State regulatory authority may
    review such permits to determine that the requirements of this
    chapter and the approved State program are not violated. Should the
    State program contain additional requirements not contained in the
    Federal program, the permittee will be provided opportunity for
    hearing and a reasonable time, within a time limit prescribed in
    regulations promulgated pursuant to section 1251 of this title, to
    conform ongoing surface mining and reclamation operations to the
    additional State requirements.
    (g) Preemption of State statutes or regulations
      Whenever a Federal program is promulgated for a State pursuant to
    this chapter, any statutes or regulations of such State which are
    in effect to regulate surface mining and reclamation operations
    subject to this chapter shall, insofar as they interfere with the
    achievement of the purposes and the requirements of this chapter
    and the Federal program, be preempted and superseded by the Federal
    program. The Secretary shall set forth any State law or regulation
    which is preempted and superseded by the Federal program.
    (h) Coordination of issuance and review of Federal program permits
      with any other Federal or State permit process
      Any Federal program shall include a process for coordinating the
    review and issuance of permits for surface mining and reclamation
    operations with any other Federal or State permit process
    applicable to the proposed operation.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1256. Permits

-STATUTE-
    (a) Persons engaged in surface coal mining within State; time
      limit; exception
      No later than eight months from the date on which a State program
    is approved by the Secretary, pursuant to section 1253 of this
    title, or no later than eight months from the date on which the
    Secretary has promulgated a Federal program for a State not having
    a State program pursuant to section 1254 of this title, no person
    shall engage in or carry out on lands within a State any surface
    coal mining operations unless such person has first obtained a
    permit issued by such State pursuant to an approved State program
    or by the Secretary pursuant to a Federal program; except a person
    conducting surface coal mining operations under a permit from the
    State regulatory authority, issued in accordance with the
    provisions of section 1252 of this title, may conduct such
    operations beyond such period if an application for a permit has
    been filed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, but
    the initial administrative decision has not been rendered.
    (b) Term
      All permits issued pursuant to the requirements of this chapter
    shall be issued for a term not to exceed five years: Provided, That
    if the applicant demonstrates that a specified longer term is
    reasonably needed to allow the applicant to obtain necessary
    financing for equipment and the opening of the operation and if the
    application is full and complete for such specified longer term,
    the regulatory authority may grant a permit for such longer term. A
    successor in interest to a permittee who applies for a new permit
    within thirty days of succeeding to such interest and who is able
    to obtain the bond coverage of the original permittee may continue
    surface coal mining and reclamation operations according to the
    approved mining and reclamation plan of the original permittee
    until such successor's application is granted or denied.
    (c) Termination
      A permit shall terminate if the permittee has not commenced the
    surface coal mining operations covered by such permit within three
    years of the issuance of the permit: Provided, That the regulatory
    authority may grant reasonable extensions of time upon a showing
    that such extensions are necessary by reason of litigation
    precluding such commencement or threatening substantial economic
    loss to the permittee, or by reason of conditions beyond the
    control and without the fault or negligence of the permittee:
    Provided further, That in the case of a coal lease issued under the
    Federal Mineral Leasing Act, as amended [30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.],
    extensions of time may not extend beyond the period allowed for
    diligent development in accordance with section 7 of that Act [30
    U.S.C. 207]: Provided further, That with respect to coal to be
    mined for use in a synthetic fuel facility or specific major
    electric generating facility, the permittee shall be deemed to have
    commenced surface mining operations at such time as the
    construction of the synthetic fuel or generating facility is
    initiated.
    (d) Renewal
      (1) Any valid permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall carry
    with it the right of successive renewal upon expiration with
    respect to areas within the boundaries of the existing permit. The
    holders of the permit may apply for renewal and such renewal shall
    be issued (provided that on application for renewal the burden
    shall be on the opponents of renewal), subsequent to fulfillment of
    the public notice requirements of sections 1263 and 1264 of this
    title unless it is established that and written findings by the
    regulatory authority are made that - 
        (A) the terms and conditions of the existing permit are not
      being satisfactorily met;
        (B) the present surface coal mining and reclamation operation
      is not in compliance with the environmental protection standards
      of this chapter and the approved State plan or Federal program
      pursuant to this chapter; or
        (C) the renewal requested substantially jeopardizes the
      operator's continuing responsibility on existing permit areas;
        (D) the operator has not provided evidence that the performance
      bond in effect for said operation will continue in full force and
      effect for any renewal requested in such application as well as
      any additional bond the regulatory authority might require
      pursuant to section 1259 of this title; or
        (E) any additional revised or updated information required by
      the regulatory authority has not been provided. Prior to the
      approval of any renewal of permit the regulatory authority shall
      provide notice to the appropriate public authorities.

      (2) If an application for renewal of a valid permit includes a
    proposal to extend the mining operation beyond the boundaries
    authorized in the existing permit, the portion of the application
    for renewal of a valid permit which addresses any new land areas
    shall be subject to the full standards applicable to new
    applications under this chapter: Provided, however, That if the
    surface coal mining operations authorized by a permit issued
    pursuant to this chapter were not subject to the standards
    contained in section 1260(b)(5)(A) and (B) of this title by reason
    of complying with the proviso of section 1260(b)(5) of this title,
    then the portion of the application for renewal of the permit which
    addresses any new land areas previously identified in the
    reclamation plan submitted pursuant to section 1258 of this title
    shall not be subject to the standards contained in section
    1260(b)(5)(A) and (B) of this title.
      (3) Any permit renewal shall be for a term not to exceed the
    period of the original permit established by this chapter.
    Application for permit renewal shall be made at least one hundred
    and twenty days prior to the expiration of the valid permit.

      sections of the overburden; and chemical analysis of the stratum
      lying immediately underneath the coal to be mined except that the
      provisions of this paragraph (15) may be waived by the regulatory
      authority with respect to the specific application by a written
      determination that such requirements are unnecessary;
        (16) for those lands in the permit application which a
      reconnaissance inspection suggests may be prime farm lands, a
      soil survey shall be made or obtained according to standards
      established by the Secretary of Agriculture in order to confirm
      the exact location of such prime farm lands, if any; and
        (17) information pertaining to coal seams, test borings, core
      samplings, or soil samples as required by this section shall be
      made available to any person with an interest which is or may be
      adversely affected: Provided, That information which pertains

      elemental content which is potentially toxic in the environment)
      shall be kept confidential and not made a matter of public
      record.
    (c) Assistance to small coal operators
      (1) If the regulatory authority finds that the probable total
    annual production at all locations of a coal surface mining
    operator will not exceed 300,000 tons, the cost of the following
    activities, which shall be performed by a qualified public or
    private laboratory or such other public or private qualified entity
    designated by the regulatory authority, shall be assumed by the
    regulatory authority upon the written request of the operator in
    connection with a permit application:
        (A) The determination of probable hydrologic consequences
      required by subsection (b)(11) of this section, including the
      engineering analyses and designs necessary for the determination.
        (B) The development of cross-section maps and plans required by
      subsection (b)(14) of this section.
        (C) The geologic drilling and statement of results of test
      borings and core samplings required by subsection (b)(15) of this
      section.
        (D) The collection of archaeological information required by
      subsection (b)(13) of this section and any other archaeological
      and historical information required by the regulatory authority,

      this title.
        (F) The collection of site-specific resource information and
      production of protection and enhancement plans for fish and
      wildlife habitats and other environmental values required by the
      regulatory authority under this chapter.

      (2) The Secretary shall provide or assume the cost of training
    coal operators that meet the qualifications stated in paragraph (1)
    concerning the preparation of permit applications and compliance
    with the regulatory program, and shall ensure that qualified coal
    operators are aware of the assistance available under this
    subsection.
    (d) Reclamation plan
      Each applicant for a permit shall be required to submit to the
    regulatory authority as part of the permit application a
    reclamation plan which shall meet the requirements of this chapter.
    (e) Public inspection
      Each applicant for a surface coal mining and reclamation permit
    shall file a copy of his application for public inspection with the
    recorder at the courthouse of the county or an appropriate public
    office approved by the regulatory authority where the mining is
    proposed to occur, except for that information pertaining to the
    coal seam itself.
    (f) Insurance certificate
      Each applicant for a permit shall be required to submit to the
    regulatory authority as part of the permit application a
    certificate issued by an insurance company authorized to do
    business in the United States certifying that the applicant has a
    public liability insurance policy in force for the surface mining
    and reclamation operations for which such permit is sought, or
    evidence that the applicant has satisfied other State or Federal
    self-insurance requirements. Such policy shall provide for personal
    injury and property damage protection in an amount adequate to
    compensate any persons damaged as a result of surface coal mining
    and reclamation operations including use of explosives and entitled
    to compensation under the applicable provisions of State law. Such
    policy shall be maintained in full force and effect during the
    terms of the permit or any renewal, including the length of all
    reclamation operations.
    (g) Blasting plan
      Each applicant for a surface coal mining and reclamation permit
    shall submit to the regulatory authority as part of the permit
    application a blasting plan which shall outline the procedures and
    standards by which the operator will meet the provisions of section
    1265(b)(15) of this title.
    (h) Reimbursement of costs
      A coal operator that has received assistance pursuant to
    subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section shall reimburse the
    regulatory authority for the cost of the services rendered if the

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1259. Performance bonds

-STATUTE-
    (a) Filing with regulatory authority; scope; number and amount
      After a surface coal mining and reclamation permit application
    has been approved but before such a permit is issued, the applicant
    shall file with the regulatory authority, on a form prescribed and
    furnished by the regulatory authority, a bond for performance
    payable, as appropriate, to the United States or to the State, and
    conditional upon faithful performance of all the requirements of
    this chapter and the permit. The bond shall cover that area of land
    within the permit area upon which the operator will initiate and
    conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations within the
    initial term of the permit. As succeeding increments of surface
    coal mining and reclamation operations are to be initiated and
    conducted within the permit area, the permittee shall file with the
    regulatory authority an additional bond or bonds to cover such
    increments in accordance with this section. The amount of the bond
    required for each bonded area shall depend upon the reclamation
    requirements of the approved permit; shall reflect the probable
    difficulty of reclamation giving consideration to such factors as
    topography, geology of the site, hydrology, and revegetation
    potential, and shall be determined by the regulatory authority. The
    amount of the bond shall be sufficient to assure the completion of
    the reclamation plan if the work had to be performed by the
    regulatory authority in the event of forfeiture and in no case
    shall the bond for the entire area under one permit be less than
    $10,000.
    (b) Liability period; execution
      Liability under the bond shall be for the duration of the surface
    coal mining and reclamation operation and for a period coincident
    with operator's responsibility for revegetation requirements in
    section 1265 of this title. The bond shall be executed by the
    operator and a corporate surety licensed to do business in the
    State where such operation is located, except that the operator may
    elect to deposit cash, negotiable bonds of the United States
    Government or such State, or negotiable certificates of deposit of
    any bank organized or transacting business in the United States.
    The cash deposit or market value of such securities shall be equal
    to or greater than the amount of the bond required for the bonded
    area.
    (c) Bond of applicant without separate surety; alternate system
      The regulatory authority may accept the bond of the applicant
    itself without separate surety when the applicant demonstrates to
    the satisfaction of the regulatory authority the existence of a
    suitable agent to receive service of process and a history of
    financial solvency and continuous operation sufficient for
    authorization to self-insure or bond such amount or in lieu of the
    establishment of a bonding program, as set forth in this section,
    the Secretary may approve as part of a State or Federal program an
    alternative system that will achieve the objectives and purposes of
    the bonding program pursuant to this section.
    (d) Deposit of cash or securities
      Cash or securities so deposited shall be deposited upon the same
    terms as the terms upon which surety bonds may be deposited. Such
    securities shall be security for the repayment of such negotiable
    certificate of deposit.
    (e) Adjustments
      The amount of the bond or deposit required and the terms of each
    acceptance of the applicant's bond shall be adjusted by the
    regulatory authority from time to time as affected land acreages
    are increased or decreased or where the cost of future reclamation
    changes.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1260. Permit approval or denial

-STATUTE-
    (a) Basis for decision; notification of applicant and local
      government officials; burden of proof
      Upon the basis of a complete mining application and reclamation
    plan or a revision or renewal thereof, as required by this chapter
    and pursuant to an approved State program or Federal program under
    the provisions of this chapter, including public notification and
    an opportunity for a public hearing as required by section 1263 of
    this title, the regulatory authority shall grant, require
    modification of, or deny the application for a permit in a
    reasonable time set by the regulatory authority and notify the
    applicant in writing. The applicant for a permit, or revision of a
    permit, shall have the burden of establishing that his application
    is in compliance with all the requirements of the applicable State
    or Federal program. Within ten days after the granting of a permit,
    the regulatory authority shall notify the local governmental
    officials in the local political subdivision in which the area of
    land to be affected is located that a permit has been issued and
    shall describe the location of the land.
    (b) Requirements for approval
      No permit or revision application shall be approved unless the
    application affirmatively demonstrates and the regulatory authority
    finds in writing on the basis of the information set forth in the
    application or from information otherwise available which will be
    documented in the approval, and made available to the applicant,
    that - 
        (1) the permit application is accurate and complete and that
      all the requirements of this chapter and the State or Federal
      program have been complied with;
        (2) the applicant has demonstrated that reclamation as required
      by this chapter and the State or Federal program can be
      accomplished under the reclamation plan contained in the permit
      application;
        (3) the assessment of the probable cumulative impact of all
      anticipated mining in the area on the hydrologic balance
      specified in section 1257(b) of this title has been made by the
      regulatory authority and the proposed operation thereof has been
      designed to prevent material damage to hydrologic balance outside
      permit area;
        (4) the area proposed to be mined is not included within an
      area designated unsuitable for surface coal mining pursuant to
      section 1272 of this title or is not within an area under study
      for such designation in an administrative proceeding commenced
      pursuant to section 1272(a)(4)(D) or section 1272(c) of this
      title (unless in such an area as to which an administrative
      proceeding has commenced pursuant to section 1272(a)(4)(D) of
      this title, the operator making the permit application
      demonstrates that, prior to January 1, 1977, he has made
      substantial legal and financial commitments in relation to the
      operation for which he is applying for a permit);
        (5) the proposed surface coal mining operation, if located west
      of the one hundredth meridian west longitude, would - 
          (A) not interrupt, discontinue, or preclude farming on
        alluvial valley floors that are irrigated or naturally
        subirrigated, but, excluding undeveloped range lands which are
        not significant to farming on said alluvial valley floors and
        those lands as to which the regulatory authority finds that if
        the farming that will be interrupted, discontinued, or
        precluded is of such small acreage as to be of negligible
        impact on the farm's agricultural production, or
          (B) not materially damage the quantity or quality of water in
        surface or underground water systems that supply these valley
        floors in (A) of subsection (b)(5) of this section:

      Provided, That this paragraph (5) shall not affect those surface
      coal mining operations which in the year preceding August 3,
      1977, (I) produced coal in commercial quantities, and were
      located within or adjacent to alluvial valley floors or (II) had
      obtained specific permit approval by the State regulatory
      authority to conduct surface coal mining operations within said
      alluvial valley floors.

    With respect to such surface mining operations which would have
    been within the purview of the foregoing proviso but for the fact
    that no coal was so produced in commercial quantities and no such
    specific permit approval was so received, the Secretary, if he
    determines that substantial financial and legal commitments were
    made by an operator prior to January 1, 1977, in connection with
    any such operation, is authorized, in accordance with such
    regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, to enter into an
    agreement with that operator pursuant to which the Secretary may,
    notwithstanding any other provision of law, lease other Federal
    coal deposits to such operator in exchange for the relinquishment
    by such operator of his Federal lease covering coal deposits
    involving such mining operations, or pursuant to section 1716 of
    title 43, convey to the fee holder of any such coal deposits
    involving such mining operations the fee title to other available
    Federal coal deposits in exchange for the fee title to such
    deposits so involving such mining operations. It is the policy of
    the Congress that the Secretary shall develop and carry out a coal
    exchange program to acquire private fee coal precluded from being
    mined by the restrictions of this paragraph (5) in exchange for
    Federal coal which is not so precluded. Such exchanges shall be
    made under section 1716 of title 43;
        (6) in cases where the private mineral estate has been severed
      from the private surface estate, the applicant has submitted to
      the regulatory authority - 
          (A) the written consent of the surface owner to the
        extraction of coal by surface mining methods; or
          (B) a conveyance that expressly grants or reserves the right
        to extract the coal by surface mining methods; or
          (C) if the conveyance does not expressly grant the right to
        extract coal by surface mining methods, the surface-subsurface
        legal relationship shall be determined in accordance with State
        law: Provided, That nothing in this chapter shall be construed
        to authorize the regulatory authority to adjudicate property
        rights disputes.
    (c) Schedule of violations
      The applicant shall file with his permit application a schedule
    listing any and all notices of violations of this chapter and any
    law, rule, or regulation of the United States, or of any department
    or agency in the United States pertaining to air or water
    environmental protection incurred by the applicant in connection
    with any surface coal mining operation during the three-year period
    prior to the date of application. The schedule shall also indicate
    the final resolution of any such notice of violation. Where the
    schedule or other information available to the regulatory authority
    indicates that any surface coal mining operation owned or
    controlled by the applicant is currently in violation of this
    chapter or such other laws referred to (!1) this subsection, the
    permit shall not be issued until the applicant submits proof that
    such violation has been corrected or is in the process of being
    corrected to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority,
    department, or agency which has jurisdiction over such violation
    and no permit shall be issued to an applicant after a finding by
    the regulatory authority, after opportunity for hearing, that the
    applicant, or the operator specified in the application, controls
    or has controlled mining operations with a demonstrated pattern of
    willful violations of this chapter of such nature and duration with
    such resulting irreparable damage to the environment as to indicate
    an intent not to comply with the provisions of this chapter.

    (d) Prime farmland mining permit
      (1) In addition to finding the application in compliance with
    subsection (b) of this section, if the area proposed to be mined
    contains prime farmland pursuant to section 1257(b)(16) of this
    title, the regulatory authority shall, after consultation with the
    Secretary of Agriculture, and pursuant to regulations issued
    hereunder by the Secretary of (!2) Interior with the concurrence of
    the Secretary of Agriculture, grant a permit to mine on prime
    farmland if the regulatory authority finds in writing that the
    operator has the technological capability to restore such mined
    area, within a reasonable time, to equivalent or higher levels of
    yield as non-mined prime farmland in the surrounding area under
    equivalent levels of management and can meet the soil
    reconstruction standards in section 1265(b)(7) of this title.
    Except for compliance with subsection (b) of this section, the
    requirements of this paragraph (1) shall apply to all permits
    issued after August 3, 1977.

      (2) Nothing in this subsection shall apply to any permit issued
    prior to August 3, 1977, or to any revisions or renewals thereof,
    or to any existing surface mining operations for which a permit was
    issued prior to August 3, 1977.
    (e) Modification of prohibition
      After October 24, 1992, the prohibition of subsection (c) of this
    section shall not apply to a permit application due to any
    violation resulting from an unanticipated event or condition at a
    surface coal mining operation on lands eligible for remining under
    a permit held by the person making such application. As used in
    this subsection, the term "violation" has the same meaning as such
    term has under subsection (c) of this section.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Application and revised reclamation plan; requirements;
      extensions to area covered
      (1) During the term of the permit the permittee may submit an
    application for a revision of the permit, together with a revised
    reclamation plan, to the regulatory authority.
      (2) An application for a revision of a permit shall not be
    approved unless the regulatory authority finds that reclamation as
    required by this chapter and the State or Federal program can be
    accomplished under the revised reclamation plan. The revision shall
    be approved or disapproved within a period of time established by
    the State or Federal program. The regulatory authority shall
    establish guidelines for a determination of the scale or extent of
    a revision request for which all permit application information
    requirements and procedures, including notice and hearings, shall
    apply: Provided, That any revisions which propose significant
    alterations in the reclamation plan shall, at a minimum, be subject
    to notice and hearing requirements.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1263. Public notice and public hearings

-STATUTE-
    (a) Submittal of advertisement to regulatory authority;
      notification of local governmental bodies
      At the time of submission of an application for a surface coal
    mining and reclamation permit, or revision of an existing permit,
    pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or an approved State
    program, the applicant shall submit to the regulatory authority a
    copy of his advertisement of the ownership, precise location, and
    boundaries of the land to be affected. At the time of submission
    such advertisement shall be placed by the applicant in a local
    newspaper of general circulation in the locality of the proposed
    surface mine at least once a week for four consecutive weeks. The
    regulatory authority shall notify various local governmental
    bodies, planning agencies, and sewage and water treatment
    authorities, of (!1) water companies in the locality in which the
    proposed surface mining will take place, notifying them of the
    operator's intention to surface mine a particularly described tract
    of land and indicating the application's permit number and where a
    copy of the proposed mining and reclamation plan may be inspected.
    These local bodies, agencies, authorities, or companies may submit
    written comments within a reasonable period established by the
    regulatory authority on the mining applications with respect to the
    effect of the proposed operation on the environment which are
    within their area of responsibility. Such comments shall
    immediately be transmitted to the applicant by the regulatory
    authority and shall be made available to the public at the same
    locations as are the mining applications.

    (b) Objections to permit applications; informal conference; record
      Any person having an interest which is or may be adversely
    affected or the officer or head of any Federal, State, or local
    governmental agency or authority shall have the right to file
    written objections to the proposed initial or revised application
    for a permit for surface coal mining and reclamation operation with
    the regulatory authority within thirty days after the last
    publication of the above notice. Such objections shall immediately
    be transmitted to the applicant by the regulatory authority and
    shall be made available to the public. If written objections are
    filed and an informal conference requested, the regulatory
    authority shall then hold an informal conference in the locality of
    the proposed mining, if requested within a reasonable time of the
    receipt of such objections or request. The date, time and location
    of such informal conference shall be advertised by the regulatory
    authority in a newspaper of general circulation in the locality at
    least two weeks prior to the scheduled conference date. The
    regulatory authority may arrange with the applicant upon request by
    any party to the administrative proceeding access to the proposed
    mining area for the purpose of gathering information relevant to
    the proceeding. An electronic or stenographic record shall be made
    of the conference proceeding, unless waived by all parties. Such
    record shall be maintained and shall be accessible to the parties
    until final release of the applicant's performance bond. In the
    event all parties requesting the informal conference stipulate
    agreement prior to the requested informal conference and withdraw
    their request, such informal conference need not be held.
    (c) Prior Federal coal lease hearing as evidence
      Where the lands included in an application for a permit are the
    subject of a Federal coal lease in connection with which hearings
    were held and determinations were made under section 201(a)(3)(A),
    (B) and (C) of this title, such hearings shall be deemed as to the
    matters covered to satisfy the requirements of this section and
    section 1264 of this title and such determinations shall be deemed
    to be a part of the record and conclusive for purposes of sections
    1260, 1264 of this title and this section.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1264. Decisions of regulatory authority and appeals

-STATUTE-
    (a) Issuance of findings within 60 days after informal conference
      If an informal conference has been held pursuant to section
    1263(b) of this title, the regulatory authority shall issue and
    furnish the applicant for a permit and persons who are parties to
    the administrative proceedings with the written finding of the
    regulatory authority, granting or denying the permit in whole or in
    part and stating the reasons therefor, within the sixty days of
    said hearings.
    (b) Decision without informal conference; notification within a
      reasonable time
      If there has been no informal conference held pursuant to section
    1263(b) of this title, the regulatory authority shall notify the
    applicant for a permit within a reasonable time as determined by
    the regulatory authority and set forth in regulations, taking into
    account the time needed for proper investigation of the site, the
    complexity of the permit application, and whether or not written
    objection to the application has been filed, whether the
    application has been approved or disapproved in whole or part.
    (c) Request for rehearing on reasons for final determination; time;
      issuance of decision
      If the application is approved, the permit shall be issued. If
    the application is disapproved, specific reasons therefor must be
    set forth in the notification. Within thirty days after the
    applicant is notified of the final decision of the regulatory
    authority on the permit application, the applicant or any person
    with an interest which is or may be adversely affected may request
    a hearing on the reasons for the final determination. The
    regulatory authority shall hold a hearing within thirty days of
    such request and provide notification to all interested parties at
    the time that the applicant is so notified. If the Secretary is the
    regulatory authority the hearing shall be of record and governed by
    section 554 of title 5. Where the regulatory authority is the
    State, such hearing shall be of record, adjudicatory in nature and
    no person who presided at a conference under section 1263(b) of
    this title shall either preside at the hearing or participate in
    this decision thereon or in any administrative appeal therefrom.
    Within thirty days after the hearing the regulatory authority shall
    issue and furnish the applicant, and all persons who participated
    in the hearing, with the written decision of the regulatory
    authority granting or denying the permit in whole or in part and
    stating the reasons therefor.
    (d) Temporary relief
      Where a hearing is requested pursuant to subsection (c) of this
    section, the Secretary, where the Secretary is the regulatory
    authority, or the State hearing authority may, under such
    conditions as it may prescribe, grant such temporary relief as it
    deems appropriate pending final determination of the proceedings if
    - 
        (1) all parties to the proceedings have been notified and given
      an opportunity to be heard on a request for temporary relief;
        (2) the person requesting such relief shows that there is a
      substantial likelihood that he will prevail on the merits of the
      final determination of the proceeding; and
        (3) such relief will not adversely affect the public health or
      safety or cause significant imminent environmental harm to land,
      air, or water resources.
    (e) Power of regulatory authority with respect to rehearing
      For the purpose of such hearing, the regulatory authority may
    administer oaths, subpoena witnesses, or written or printed
    materials, compel attendance of the witness, or production of the
    materials, and take evidence including but not limited to site
    inspections of the land to be affected and other surface coal
    mining operations carried on by the applicant in the general
    vicinity of the proposed operation. A verbatim record of each
    public hearing required by this chapter shall be made, and a
    transcript made available on the motion of any party or by order of
    the regulatory authority.
    (f) Right to appeal in accordance with section 1276 of this title
      Any applicant or any person with an interest which is or may be
    adversely affected who has participated in the administrative
    proceedings as an objector, and who is aggrieved by the decision of
    the regulatory authority, or if the regulatory authority fails to
    act within the time limits specified in this chapter shall have the
    right to appeal in accordance with section 1276 of this title.

    Sec. 1265. Environmental protection performance standards

-STATUTE-
    (a) Permit requirement
      Any permit issued under any approved State or Federal program
    pursuant to this chapter to conduct surface coal mining operations
    shall require that such surface coal mining operations will meet
    all applicable performance standards of this chapter, and such
    other requirements as the regulatory authority shall promulgate.
    (b) General standards
      General performance standards shall be applicable to all surface
    coal mining and reclamation operations and shall require the
    operation as a minimum to - 
        (1) conduct surface coal mining operations so as to maximize
      the utilization and conservation of the solid fuel resource being
      recovered so that reaffecting the land in the future through
      surface coal mining can be minimized;
        (2) restore the land affected to a condition capable of
      supporting the uses which it was capable of supporting prior to
      any mining, or higher or better uses of which there is reasonable
      likelihood, so long as such use or uses do not present any actual
      or probable hazard to public health or safety or pose any actual
      or probable threat of water diminution or pollution, and the
      permit applicants' declared proposed land use following
      reclamation is not deemed to be impractical or unreasonable,
      inconsistent with applicable land use policies and plans,
      involves unreasonable delay in implementation, or is violative of
      Federal, State, or local law;
        (3) except as provided in subsection (c) of this section with
      respect to all surface coal mining operations backfill, compact
      (where advisable to insure stability or to prevent leaching of
      toxic materials), and grade in order to restore the approximate
      original contour of the land with all highwalls, spoil piles, and
      depressions eliminated (unless small depressions are needed in
      order to retain moisture to assist revegetation or as otherwise
      authorized pursuant to this chapter): Provided, however, That in
      surface coal mining which is carried out at the same location
      over a substantial period of time where the operation transects
      the coal deposit, and the thickness of the coal deposits relative
      to the volume of the overburden is large and where the operator
      demonstrates that the overburden and other spoil and waste
      materials at a particular point in the permit area or otherwise
      available from the entire permit area is insufficient, giving due
      consideration to volumetric expansion, to restore the approximate
      original contour, the operator, at a minimum, shall backfill,
      grade, and compact (where advisable) using all available
      overburden and other spoil and waste materials to attain the
      lowest practicable grade but not more than the angle of repose,
      to provide adequate drainage and to cover all acid-forming and
      other toxic materials, in order to achieve an ecologically sound
      land use compatible with the surrounding region: And provided
      further, That in surface coal mining where the volume of
      overburden is large relative to the thickness of the coal deposit
      and where the operator demonstrates that due to volumetric
      expansion the amount of overburden and other spoil and waste
      materials removed in the course of the mining operation is more
      than sufficient to restore the approximate original contour, the
      operator shall after restoring the approximate contour, backfill,
      grade, and compact (where advisable) the excess overburden and
      other spoil and waste materials to attain the lowest grade but
      not more than the angle of repose, and to cover all acid-forming
      and other toxic materials, in order to achieve an ecologically
      sound land use compatible with the surrounding region and that
      such overburden or spoil shall be shaped and graded in such a way
      as to prevent slides, erosion, and water pollution and is
      revegetated in accordance with the requirements of this chapter;
        (4) stabilize and protect all surface areas including spoil
      piles affected by the surface coal mining and reclamation
      operation to effectively control erosion and attendant air and
      water pollution;
        (5) remove the topsoil from the land in a separate layer,
      replace it on the backfill area, or if not utilized immediately,
      segregate it in a separate pile from other spoil and when the
      topsoil is not replaced on a backfill area within a time short
      enough to avoid deterioration of the topsoil, maintain a
      successful cover by quick growing plant or other means thereafter
      so that the topsoil is preserved from wind and water erosion,
      remains free of any contamination by other acid or toxic
      material, and is in a usable condition for sustaining vegetation
      when restored during reclamation, except if topsoil is of
      insufficient quantity or of poor quality for sustaining
      vegetation, or if other strata can be shown to be more suitable
      for vegetation requirements, then the operator shall remove,
      segregate, and preserve in a like manner such other strata which
      is best able to support vegetation;
        (6) restore the topsoil or the best available subsoil which is
      best able to support vegetation;
        (7) for all prime farm lands as identified in section
      1257(b)(16) of this title to be mined and reclaimed,
      specifications for soil removal, storage, replacement, and
      reconstruction shall be established by the Secretary of
      Agriculture, and the operator shall, as a minimum, be required to
      - 
          (A) segregate the A horizon of the natural soil, except where
        it can be shown that other available soil materials will create
        a final soil having a greater productive capacity; and if not
        utilized immediately, stockpile this material separately from
        other spoil, and provide needed protection from wind and water
        erosion or contamination by other acid or toxic material;
          (B) segregate the B horizon of the natural soil, or
        underlying C horizons or other strata, or a combination of such
        horizons or other strata that are shown to be both texturally
        and chemically suitable for plant growth and that can be shown
        to be equally or more favorable for plant growth than the B
        horizon, in sufficient quantities to create in the regraded
        final soil a root zone of comparable depth and quality to that
        which existed in the natural soil; and if not utilized
        immediately, stockpile this material separately from other
        spoil, and provide needed protection from wind and water
        erosion or contamination by other acid or toxic material;
          (C) replace and regrade the root zone material described in
        (B) above with proper compaction and uniform depth over the
        regraded spoil material; and
          (D) redistribute and grade in a uniform manner the surface
        soil horizon described in subparagraph (A);

        (8) create, if authorized in the approved mining and
      reclamation plan and permit, permanent impoundments of water on
      mining sites as part of reclamation activities only when it is
      adequately demonstrated that - 
          (A) the size of the impoundment is adequate for its intended
        purposes;
          (B) the impoundment dam construction will be so designed as
        to achieve necessary stability with an adequate margin of
        safety compatible with that of structures constructed under
        Public Law 83-566 (16 U.S.C. 1006);
          (C) the quality of impounded water will be suitable on a
        permanent basis for its intended use and that discharges from
        the impoundment will not degrade the water quality below water
        quality standards established pursuant to applicable Federal
        and State law in the receiving stream;
          (D) the level of water will be reasonably stable;
          (E) final grading will provide adequate safety and access for
        proposed water users; and
          (F) such water impoundments will not result in the diminution
        of the quality or quantity of water utilized by adjacent or
        surrounding landowners for agricultural, industrial (!1)
        recreational, or domestic uses;


        (9) conducting (!2) any augering operation associated with
      surface mining in a manner to maximize recoverability of mineral
      reserves remaining after the operation and reclamation are
      complete; and seal all auger holes with an impervious and
      noncombustible material in order to prevent drainage except where
      the regulatory authority determines that the resulting
      impoundment of water in such auger holes may create a hazard to
      the environment or the public health or safety: Provided, That
      the permitting authority may prohibit augering if necessary to
      maximize the utilization, recoverability or conservation of the
      solid fuel resources or to protect against adverse water quality
      impacts;

        (10) minimize the disturbances to the prevailing hydrologic
      balance at the mine-site and in associated offsite areas and to
      the quality and quantity of water in surface and ground water
      systems both during and after surface coal mining operations and
      during reclamation by - 
          (A) avoiding acid or other toxic mine drainage by such
        measures as, but not limited to - 
            (i) preventing or removing water from contact with toxic
          producing deposits;
            (ii) treating drainage to reduce toxic content which
          adversely affects downstream water upon being released to
          water courses;
            (iii) casing, sealing, or otherwise managing boreholes,
          shafts, and wells and keep (!3) acid or other toxic drainage
          from entering ground and surface waters;


          (B)(i) conducting surface coal mining operations so as to
        prevent, to the extent possible using the best technology
        currently available, additional contributions of suspended

    requirements as he deems to be necessary.
      (6) All permits granted under the provisions of this subsection
    shall be reviewed not more than three years from the date of
    issuance of the permit, unless the applicant affirmatively
    demonstrates that the proposed development is proceeding in
    accordance with the terms of the approved schedule and reclamation
    plan.
    (d) Steep-slope surface coal mining standards
      The following performance standards shall be applicable to steep-
    slope surface coal mining and shall be in addition to those
    general performance standards required by this section: Provided,
    however, That the provisions of this subsection (d) shall not apply
    to those situations in which an operator is mining on flat or
    gently rolling terrain, on which an occasional steep slope is
    encountered through which the mining operation is to proceed,
    leaving a plain or predominantly flat area or where an operator is
    in compliance with provisions of subsection (c) hereof:
      (1) Insure that when performing surface coal mining on steep
    slopes, no debris, abandoned or disabled equipment, spoil material,
    or waste mineral matter be placed on the downslope below the bench
    or mining cut: Provided, That spoil material in excess of that
    required for the reconstruction of the approximate original contour
    under the provisions of subsection (b)(3) or (d)(2) of this section
    shall be permanently stored pursuant to subsection (b)(22) of this
    section.
      (2) Complete backfilling with spoil material shall be required to
    cover completely the highwall and return the site to the
    appropriate original contour, which material will maintain
    stability following mining and reclamation.
      (3) The operator may not disturb land above the top of the
    highwall unless the regulatory authority finds that such
    disturbance will facilitate compliance with the environmental
    protection standards of this section: Provided, however, That the
    land disturbed above the highwall shall be limited to that amount
    necessary to facilitate said compliance.
      (4) For the purposes of this subsection (d), the term "steep
    slope" is any slope above twenty degrees or such lesser slope as
    may be defined by the regulatory authority after consideration of
    soil, climate, and other characteristics of a region or State.
    (e) Variances to original contour restoration requirements
      (1) Each State program may and each Federal program shall include
    procedures pursuant to which the regulatory authority may permit
    variances for the purposes set forth in paragraph (3) of this
    subsection, provided that the watershed control of the area is
    improved; and further provided complete backfilling with spoil
    material shall be required to cover completely the highwall which
    material will maintain stability following mining and reclamation.
      (2) Where an applicant meets the requirements of paragraphs (3)
    and (4) of this subsection a variance from the requirement to
    restore to approximate original contour set forth in subsection
    (d)(2) of this section may be granted for the surface mining of
    coal where the owner of the surface knowingly requests in writing,
    as a part of the permit application that such a variance be granted
    so as to render the land, after reclamation, suitable for an
    industrial, commercial, residential, or public use (including
    recreational facilities) in accord with the further provisions of
    (3) and (4) of this subsection.
      (3)(A) After consultation with the appropriate land use planning
    agencies, if any, the potential use of the affected land is deemed
    to constitute an equal or better economic or public use;
      (B) is designed and certified by a qualified registered
    professional engineer in conformance with professional standards
    established to assure the stability, drainage, and configuration
    necessary for the intended use of the site; and
      (C) after approval of the appropriate State environmental
    agencies, the watershed of the affected land is deemed to be
    improved.
      (4) In granting a variance pursuant to this subsection the
    regulatory authority shall require that only such amount of spoil
    will be placed off the mine bench as is necessary to achieve the
    planned postmining land use, insure stability of the spoil retained
    on the bench, meet all other requirements of this chapter, and all
    spoil placement off the mine bench must comply with subsection
    (b)(22) of this section.
      (5) The regulatory authority shall promulgate specific
    regulations to govern the granting of variances in accord with the
    provisions of this subsection, and may impose such additional
    requirements as he deems to be necessary.
      (6) All exceptions granted under the provisions of this
    subsection shall be reviewed not more than three years from the
    date of issuance of the permit, unless the permittee affirmatively
    demonstrates that the proposed development is proceeding in
    accordance with the terms of the reclamation plan.
    (f) Standards and criteria for coal mine waste piles
      The Secretary, with the written concurrence of the Chief of
    Engineers, shall establish within one hundred and thirty-five days
    from August 3, 1977, standards and criteria regulating the design,
    location, construction, operation, maintenance, enlargement,
    modification, removal, and abandonment of new and existing coal
    mine waste piles referred to in subsection (b)(13) of this section
    and section 1266(b)(5) of this title. Such standards and criteria
    shall conform to the standards and criteria used by the Chief of
    Engineers to insure that flood control structures are safe and
    effectively perform their intended function. In addition to
    engineering and other technical specifications the standards and
    criteria developed pursuant to this subsection must include
    provisions for: review and approval of plans and specifications
    prior to construction, enlargement, modification, removal, or
    abandonment; performance of periodic inspections during
    construction; issuance of certificates of approval upon completion
    of construction; performance of periodic safety inspections; and
    issuance of notices for required remedial or maintenance work.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1266. Surface effects of underground coal mining operations

-STATUTE-
    (a) Rules and regulations
      The Secretary shall promulgate rules and regulations directed
    toward the surface effects of underground coal mining operations,
    embodying the following requirements and in accordance with the
    procedures established under section 1251 of this title: Provided,
    however, That in adopting any rules and regulations the Secretary
    shall consider the distinct difference between surface coal mining
    and underground coal mining. Such rules and regulations shall not
    conflict with nor supersede any provision of the Federal Coal Mine
    Health and Safety Act of 1969 [30 U.S.C. 801 et seq.] nor any
    regulation issued pursuant thereto, and shall not be promulgated
    until the Secretary has obtained the written concurrence of the
    head of the department which administers such Act.
    (b) Permit requirements
      Each permit issued under any approved State or Federal program
    pursuant to this chapter and relating to underground coal mining
    shall require the operator to - 
        (1) adopt measures consistent with known technology in order to
      prevent subsidence causing material damage to the extent
      technologically and economically feasible, maximize mine
      stability, and maintain the value and reasonably foreseeable use
      of such surface lands, except in those instances where the mining
      technology used requires planned subsidence in a predictable and
      controlled manner: Provided, That nothing in this subsection
      shall be construed to prohibit the standard method of room and
      pillar mining;
        (2) seal all portals, entryways, drifts, shafts, or other
      openings between the surface and underground mine working when no
      longer needed for the conduct of the mining operations;
        (3) fill or seal exploratory holes no longer necessary for
      mining, maximizing to the extent technologically and economically
      feasible return of mine and processing waste, tailings, and any
      other waste incident to the mining operation, to the mine
      workings or excavations;
        (4) with respect to surface disposal of mine wastes, tailings,
      coal processing wastes, and other wastes in areas other than the
      mine workings or excavations, stabilize all waste piles created
      by the permittee from current operations through construction in
      compacted layers including the use of incombustible and
      impervious materials if necessary and assure that the leachate
      will not degrade below water quality standards established
      pursuant to applicable Federal and State law surface or ground
      waters and that the final contour of the waste accumulation will
      be compatible with natural surroundings and that the site is
      stabilized and revegetated according to the provisions of this
      section;
        (5) design, locate, construct, operate, maintain, enlarge,
      modify, and remove, or abandon, in accordance with the standards
      and criteria developed pursuant to section 1265(f) of this title,
      all existing and new coal mine waste piles consisting of mine
      wastes, tailings, coal processing wastes, or other liquid and
      solid wastes and used either temporarily or permanently as dams
      or embankments;
        (6) establish on regraded areas and all other lands affected, a
      diverse and permanent vegetative cover capable of self-
      regeneration and plant succession and at least equal in extent
      of cover to the natural vegetation of the area;
        (7) protect offsite areas from damages which may result from
      such mining operations;
        (8) eliminate fire hazards and otherwise eliminate conditions
      which constitute a hazard to health and safety of the public;
        (9) minimize the disturbances of the prevailing hydrologic
      balance at the minesite and in associated offsite areas and to
      the quantity of water in surface ground water systems both during
      and after coal mining operations and during reclamation by - 
          (A) avoiding acid or other toxic mine drainage by such
        measures as, but not limited to - 
            (i) preventing or removing water from contact with toxic
          producing deposits;
            (ii) treating drainage to reduce toxic content which
          adversely affects downstream water upon being released to
          water courses;
            (iii) casing, sealing, or otherwise managing boreholes,
          shafts, and wells to keep acid or other toxic drainage from
          entering ground and surface waters; and

          (B) conducting surface coal mining operations so as to
        prevent, to the extent possible using the best technology
        currently available, additional contributions of suspended
        solids to streamflow or runoff outside the permit area (but in
        no event shall such contributions be in excess of requirements
        set by applicable State or Federal law), and avoiding channel
        deepening or enlargement in operations requiring the discharge
        of water from mines;

        (10) with respect to other surface impacts not specified in
      this subsection including the construction of new roads or the
      improvement or use of existing roads to gain access to the site
      of such activities and for haulage, repair areas, storage areas,
      processing areas, shipping areas, and other areas upon which are
      sited structures, facilities, or other property or materials on
      the surface, resulting from or incident to such activities,
      operate in accordance with the standards established under
      section 1265 of this title for such effects which result from
      surface coal mining operations: Provided, That the Secretary
      shall make such modifications in the requirements imposed by this
      paragraph as are necessary to accommodate the distinct difference
      between surface and underground coal mining;
        (11) to the extent possible using the best technology currently
      available, minimize disturbances and adverse impacts of the
      operation on fish, wildlife, and related environmental values,
      and achieve enhancement of such resources where practicable;
        (12) locate openings for all new drift mines working acid-
      producing or iron-producing coal seams in such a manner as to
      prevent a gravity discharge of water from the mine.
    (c) Suspension of underground coal mining operations in urbanized
      areas
      In order to protect the stability of the land, the regulatory
    authority shall suspend underground coal mining under urbanized
    areas, cities, towns, and communities and adjacent to industrial or
    commercial buildings, major impoundments, or permanent streams if
    he finds imminent danger to inhabitants of the urbanized areas,
    cities, towns, and communities.
    (d) Applicability of this subchapter to surface operations and
      surface impacts incident to underground coal mining operations
      The provisions of this subchapter relating to State and Federal
    programs, permits, bonds, inspections and enforcement, public
    review, and administrative and judicial review shall be applicable
    to surface operations and surface impacts incident to an
    underground coal mine with such modifications to the permit
    application requirements, permit approval or denial procedures, and
    bond requirements as are necessary to accommodate the distinct
    difference between surface and underground coal mining. The
    Secretary shall promulgate such modifications in accordance with
    the rulemaking procedure established in section 1251 of this title.

      authority shall prescribe, and (E) provide such other information
      relative to surface coal mining and reclamation operations as the
      regulatory authority deems reasonable and necessary;
        (2) for those surface coal mining and reclamation operations
      which remove or disturb strata that serve as aquifers which
      significantly insure the hydrologic balance of water use either
      on or off the mining site, the regulatory authority shall specify
      those - 
          (A) monitoring sites to record the quantity and quality of
        surface drainage above and below the minesite as well as in the
        potential zone of influence;
          (B) monitoring sites to record level, amount, and samples of
        ground water and aquifers potentially affected by the mining
        and also directly below the lowermost (deepest) coal seam to be
        mined;
          (C) records of well logs and borehole data to be maintained;
        and
          (D) monitoring sites to record precipitation.

      The monitoring data collection and analysis required by this
      section shall be conducted according to standards and procedures
      set forth by the regulatory authority in order to assure their
      reliability and validity; and

      premises in which any records required to be maintained under
      paragraph (1) of this subsection are located; and (B) may at
      reasonable times, and without delay, have access to and copy any
      records, inspect any monitoring equipment or method of operation
      required under this chapter.
    (c) Inspection intervals
      The inspections by the regulatory authority shall (1) occur on an
    irregular basis averaging not less than one partial inspection per
    month and one complete inspection per calendar quarter for the
    surface coal mining and reclamation operation covered by each
    permit; (2) occur without prior notice to the permittee or his
    agents or employees except for necessary onsite meetings with the
    permittee; and (3) include the filing of inspection reports
    adequate to enforce the requirements of and to carry out the terms
    and purposes of this chapter.
    (d) Maintenance of sign
      Each permittee shall conspicuously maintain at the entrances to
    the surface coal mining and reclamation operations a clearly
    visible sign which sets forth the name, business address, and phone
    number of the permittee and the permit number of the surface coal
    mining and reclamation operations.
    (e) Violations
      Each inspector, upon detection of each violation of any
    requirement of any State or Federal program or of this chapter,
    shall forthwith inform the operator in writing, and shall report in
    writing any such violation to the regulatory authority.
    (f) Availability of information to public
      Copies of any records, reports, inspection materials, or
    information obtained under this subchapter by the regulatory
    authority shall be made immediately available to the public at
    central and sufficient locations in the county, multicounty, and
    State area of mining so that they are conveniently available to
    residents in the areas of mining.
    (g) Conflict of interest; penalty; publication of regulations;
      report to Congress
      No employee of the State regulatory authority performing any
    function or duty under this chapter shall have a direct or indirect
    financial interest in any underground or surface coal mining
    operation. Whoever knowingly violates the provisions of this
    subsection shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not
    more than $2,500, or by imprisonment of not more than one year, or
    by both. The Secretary shall (1) within sixty days after August 3,
    1977, publish in the Federal Register, in accordance with section
    553 of title 5, regulations to establish methods by which the
    provisions of this subsection will be monitored and enforced by the
    Secretary and such State regulatory authority, including
    appropriate provisions for the filing by such employees and the
    review of statements and supplements thereto concerning any
    financial interest which may be affected by this subsection, and

    1296 of this title) on actions taken and not taken during the
    preceding year under this subsection.
    (h) Review; procedures for inspections
      (1) Any person who is or may be adversely affected by a surface
    mining operation may notify the Secretary or any representative of
    the Secretary responsible for conducting the inspection, in
    writing, of any violation of this chapter which he has reason to
    believe exists at the surface mining site. The Secretary shall, by
    regulation, establish procedures for informal review of any refusal
    by a representative of the Secretary to issue a citation with
    respect to any such alleged violation. The Secretary shall furnish
    such persons requesting the review a written statement of the
    reasons for the Secretary's final disposition of the case.
      (2) The Secretary shall also, by regulation, establish procedures
    to insure that adequate and complete inspections are made. Any such
    person may notify the Secretary of any failure to make such
    inspections, after which the Secretary shall determine whether
    adequate and complete inspections have been made. The Secretary
    shall furnish such persons a written statement of the reasons for
    the Secretary's determination that adequate and complete
    inspections have or have not been conducted.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1268. Penalties

-STATUTE-
    (a) Civil penalties for violations of permit conditions and
      provisions of this subchapter
      In the enforcement of a Federal program or Federal lands program,
    or during Federal enforcement pursuant to section 1252 of this
    title or during Federal enforcement of a State program pursuant to
    section 1271 of this title, any permittee who violates any permit
    condition or who violates any other provision of this subchapter,
    may be assessed a civil penalty by the Secretary, except that if
    such violation leads to the issuance of a cessation order under
    section 1271 of this title, the civil penalty shall be assessed.
    Such penalty shall not exceed $5,000 for each violation. Each day
    of continuing violation may be deemed a separate violation for
    purposes of penalty assessments. In determining the amount of the
    penalty, consideration shall be given to the permittee's history of
    previous violations at the particular surface coal mining
    operation; the seriousness of the violation, including any
    irreparable harm to the environment and any hazard to the health or
    safety of the public; whether the permittee was negligent; and the
    demonstrated good faith of the permittee charged in attempting to
    achieve rapid compliance after notification of the violation.
    (b) Hearing
      A civil penalty shall be assessed by the Secretary only after the
    person charged with a violation described under subsection (a) of
    this section has been given an opportunity for a public hearing.
    Where such a public hearing has been held, the Secretary shall make
    findings of fact, and he shall issue a written decision as to the
    occurrence of the violation and the amount of the penalty which is
    warranted, incorporating, when appropriate, an order therein
    requiring that the penalty be paid. When appropriate, the Secretary
    shall consolidate such hearings with other proceedings under
    section 1271 of this title. Any hearing under this section shall be
    of record and shall be subject to section 554 of title 5. Where the
    person charged with such a violation fails to avail himself of the
    opportunity for a public hearing, a civil penalty shall be assessed
    by the Secretary after the Secretary has determined that a
    violation did occur, and the amount of the penalty which is
    warranted, and has issued an order requiring that the penalty be
    paid.
    (c) Notice of violation; action required of violator; waiver of
      legal rights
      Upon the issuance of a notice or order charging that a violation
    of this chapter has occurred, the Secretary shall inform the
    operator within thirty days of the proposed amount of said penalty.
    The person charged with the penalty shall then have thirty days to
    pay the proposed penalty in full or, if the person wishes to
    contest either the amount of the penalty or the fact of the
    violation, forward the proposed amount to the Secretary for
    placement in an escrow account. If through administrative or
    judicial review of the proposed penalty, it is determined that no
    violation occurred, or that the amount of the penalty should be
    reduced, the Secretary shall within thirty days remit the
    appropriate amount to the person, with interest at the rate of 6
    percent, or at the prevailing Department of the Treasury rate,
    whichever is greater. Failure to forward the money to the Secretary
    within thirty days shall result in a waiver of all legal rights to
    contest the violation or the amount of the penalty.
    (d) Civil action to recover civil penalties
      Civil penalties owed under this chapter, may be recovered in a
    civil action brought by the Attorney General at the request of the
    Secretary in any appropriate district court of the United States.
    (e) Willful violations
      Any person who willfully and knowingly violates a condition of a
    permit issued pursuant to a Federal program, a Federal lands
    program or Federal enforcement pursuant to section 1252 of this
    title or during Federal enforcement of a State program pursuant to
    section 1271 of this title or fails or refuses to comply with any
    order issued under section 1271 or section 1276 of this title, or
    any order incorporated in a final decision issued by the Secretary
    under this chapter, except an order incorporated in a decision
    issued under subsection (b) of this section or section 1294 of this
    title, shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more
    than $10,000, or by imprisonment for not more than one year or
    both.
    (f) Corporate violations
      Whenever a corporate permittee violates a condition of a permit
    issued pursuant to a Federal program, a Federal lands program or
    Federal enforcement pursuant to section 1252 of this title or
    Federal enforcement of a State program pursuant to section 1271 of
    this title or fails or refuses to comply with any order issued
    under section 1271 of this title, or any order incorporated in a
    final decision issued by the Secretary under this chapter except an
    order incorporated in a decision issued under subsection (b) of
    this section or section 1293 of this title, any director, officer,
    or agent of such corporation who willfully and knowingly
    authorized, ordered, or carried out such violation, failure, or
    refusal shall be subject to the same civil penalties, fines, and
    imprisonment that may be imposed upon a person under subsections
    (a) and (e) of this section.
    (g) False statements, representations, or certifications
      Whoever knowingly makes any false statement, representation, or
    certification, or knowingly fails to make any statement,
    representation, or certification in any application, record,
    report, plant, or other document filed or required to be maintained
    pursuant to a Federal program or a Federal lands program or any
    order of decision issued by the Secretary under this chapter,
    shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than
    $10,000, or by imprisonment for not more than one year or both.
    (h) Failure to correct violation
      Any operator who fails to correct a violation for which a
    citation has been issued under section 1271(a) of this title within
    the period permitted for its correction (which period shall not end
    until the entry of a final order by the Secretary, in the case of
    any review proceedings under section 1275 of this title initiated
    by the operator wherein the Secretary orders, after an expedited
    hearing, the suspension of the abatement requirements of the
    citation after determining that the operator will suffer
    irreparable loss or damage from the application of those
    requirements, or until the entry of an order of the court, in the
    case of any review proceedings under section 1276 of this title
    initiated by the operator wherein the court orders the suspension
    of the abatement requirements of the citation), shall be assessed a
    civil penalty of not less than $750 for each day during which such
    failure or violation continues.
    (i) Effect on additional enforcement right or procedure available
      under State law

    and shall contain the same or similar procedural requirements
    relating thereto. Nothing herein shall be construed so as to
    eliminate any additional enforcement right or procedures which are
    available under State law to a State regulatory authority but which
    are not specifically enumerated herein.

    Sec. 1269. Release of performance bonds or deposits

-STATUTE-
    (a) Filing of request; submittal of copy of advertisement;
      notification by letter of intent to seek release
      The permittee may file a request with the regulatory authority
    for the release of all or part of a performance bond or deposit.
    Within thirty days after any application for bond or deposit
    release has been filed with the regulatory authority, the operator
    shall submit a copy of an advertisement placed at least once a week
    for four successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in
    the locality of the surface coal mining operation. Such
    advertisement shall be considered part of any bond release
    application and shall contain a notification of the precise
    location of the land affected, the number of acres, the permit and
    the date approved, the amount of the bond filed and the portion
    sought to be released, and the type and appropriate dates of
    reclamation work performed, and a description of the results
    achieved as they relate to the operator's approved reclamation
    plan. In addition, as part of any bond release application, the
    applicant shall submit copies of letters which he has sent to
    adjoining property owners, local governmental bodies, planning
    agencies, and sewage and water treatment authorities, or water
    companies in the locality in which the surface coal mining and
    reclamation activities took place, notifying them of his intention
    to seek release from the bond.
    (b) Inspection and evaluation; notification of decision
      Upon receipt of the notification and request, the regulatory
    authority shall within thirty days conduct an inspection and
    evaluation of the reclamation work involved. Such evaluation shall
    consider, among other things, the degree of difficulty to complete
    any remaining reclamation, whether pollution of surface and
    subsurface water is occurring, the probability of continuance of
    future occurrence of such pollution, and the estimated cost of
    abating such pollution. The regulatory authority shall notify the
    permittee in writing of its decision to release or not to release
    all or part of the performance bond or deposit within sixty days
    from the filing of the request, if no public hearing is held
    pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, and if there has been a
    public hearing held pursuant to subsection (f) of this section,
    within thirty days thereafter.
    (c) Requirements for release
      The regulatory authority may release in whole or in part said
    bond or deposit if the authority is satisfied the reclamation
    covered by the bond or deposit or portion thereof has been
    accomplished as required by this chapter according to the following
    schedule:
        (1) When the operator completes the backfilling, regrading, and
      drainage control of a bonded area in accordance with his approved
      reclamation plan, the release of 60 per centum of the bond or
      collateral for the applicable permit area.
        (2) After revegetation has been established on the regraded
      mined lands in accordance with the approved reclamation plan.
      When determining the amount of bond to be released after
      successful revegetation has been established, the regulatory
      authority shall retain that amount of bond for the revegetated
      area which would be sufficient for a third party to cover the
      cost of reestablishing revegetation and for the period specified
      for operator responsibility in section 1265 of this title of
      reestablishing revegetation. No part of the bond or deposit shall
      be released under this paragraph so long as the lands to which
      the release would be applicable are contributing suspended solids
      to streamflow or runoff outside the permit area in excess of the
      requirements set by section 1265(b)(10) of this title or until
      soil productivity for prime farm lands has returned to equivalent
      levels of yield as nonmined land of the same soil type in the
      surrounding area under equivalent management practices as
      determined from the soil survey performed pursuant to section
      1257(b)(16) of this title. Where a silt dam is to be retained as
      a permanent impoundment pursuant to section 1265(b)(8) of this
      title, the portion of bond may be released under this paragraph
      so long as provisions for sound future maintenance by the
      operator or the landowner have been made with the regulatory
      authority.
        (3) When the operator has completed successfully all surface
      coal mining and reclamation activities, the release of the
      remaining portion of the bond, but not before the expiration of
      the period specified for operator responsibility in section 1265
      of this title: Provided, however, That no bond shall be fully
      released until all reclamation requirements of this chapter are
      fully met.
    (d) Notice of disapproval
      If the regulatory authority disapproves the application for
    release of the bond or portion thereof, the authority shall notify
    the permittee, in writing, stating the reasons for disapproval and
    recommending corrective actions necessary to secure said release
    and allowing opportunity for a public hearing.
    (e) Notice to municipality
      When any application for total or partial bond release is filed
    with the regulatory authority, the regulatory authority shall
    notify the municipality in which a surface coal mining operation is
    located by certified mail at least thirty days prior to the release
    of all or a portion of the bond.
    (f) Objections to release; hearing
      Any person with a valid legal interest which might be adversely
    affected by release of the bond or the responsible officer or head
    of any Federal, State, or local governmental agency which has
    jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any
    environmental, social, or economic impact involved in the
    operation, or is authorized to develop and enforce environmental
    standards with respect to such operations shall have the right to
    file written objections to the proposed release from bond to the
    regulatory authority within thirty days after the last publication
    of the above notice. If written objections are filed, and a hearing
    requested, the regulatory authority shall inform all the interested
    parties, of the time and place of the hearing, and hold a public
    hearing in the locality of the surface coal mining operation
    proposed for bond release within thirty days of the request for
    such hearing. The date, time, and location of such public hearings
    shall be advertised by the regulatory authority in a newspaper of
    general circulation in the locality for two consecutive weeks, and
    shall hold a public hearing in the locality of the surface coal
    mining operation proposed for bond release or at the State capital
    at the option of the objector, within thirty days of the request
    for such hearing.
    (g) Informal conference
      Without prejudice to the rights of the objectors, the applicant,
    or the responsibilities of the regulatory authority pursuant to
    this section, the regulatory authority may establish an informal
    conference as provided in section 1263 of this title to resolve
    such written objections.
    (h) Power of regulatory authority with respect to informal
      conference
      For the purpose of such hearing the regulatory authority shall
    have the authority and is hereby empowered to administer oaths,
    subpena witnesses, or written or printed materials, compel the
    attendance of witnesses, or production of the materials, and take
    evidence including but not limited to inspections of the land
    affected and other surface coal mining operations carried on by the
    applicant in the general vicinity. A verbatim record of each public
    hearing required by this chapter shall be made, and a transcript
    made available on the motion of any party or by order of the
    regulatory authority.

    commence a civil action on his own behalf to compel compliance with
    this chapter - 
        (1) against the United States or any other governmental
      instrumentality or agency to the extent permitted by the eleventh
      amendment to the Constitution which is alleged to be in violation
      of the provisions of this chapter or of any rule, regulation,
      order or permit issued pursuant thereto, or against any other
      person who is alleged to be in violation of any rule, regulation,
      order or permit issued pursuant to this subchapter; or
        (2) against the Secretary or the appropriate State regulatory
      authority to the extent permitted by the eleventh amendment to
      the Constitution where there is alleged a failure of the
      Secretary or the appropriate State regulatory authority to
      perform any act or duty under this chapter which is not
      discretionary with the Secretary or with the appropriate State
      regulatory authority.

    The district courts shall have jurisdiction, without regard to the
    amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties.
    (b) Limitation on bringing of action
      No action may be commenced - 
        (1) under subsection (a)(1) of this section - 
          (A) prior to sixty days after the plaintiff has given notice
        in writing of the violation (i) to the Secretary, (ii) to the
        State in which the violation occurs, and (iii) to any alleged
        violator; or
          (B) if the Secretary or the State has commenced and is
        diligently prosecuting a civil action in a court of the United
        States or a State to require compliance with the provisions of
        this chapter, or any rule, regulation, order, or permit issued
        pursuant to this chapter, but in any such action in a court of

        right; or

        (2) under subsection (a)(2) of this section prior to sixty days
      after the plaintiff has given notice in writing of such action to
      the Secretary, in such manner as the Secretary shall by
      regulation prescribe, or to the appropriate State regulatory
      authority, except that such action may be brought immediately
      after such notification in the case where the violation or order
      complained of constitutes an imminent threat to the health or
      safety of the plaintiff or would immediately affect a legal
      interest of the plaintiff.
    (c) Venue; intervention
      (1) Any action respecting a violation of this chapter or the
    regulations thereunder may be brought only in the judicial district

    injunction is sought require the filing of a bond or equivalent
    security in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
    (e) Effect on other enforcement methods

    regulations thereunder, or to seek any other relief (including
    relief against the Secretary or the appropriate State regulatory
    authority).

    Sec. 1271. Enforcement

-STATUTE-
    (a) Notice of violation; Federal inspection; waiver of notification
      period; cessation order; affirmative obligation on operator;
      suspension or revocation of permits; contents of notices and
      orders
      (1) Whenever, on the basis of any information available to him,
    including receipt of information from any person, the Secretary has
    reason to believe that any person is in violation of any
    requirement of this chapter or any permit condition required by
    this chapter, the Secretary shall notify the State regulatory
    authority, if one exists, in the State in which such violation
    exists. If no such State authority exists or the State regulatory
    authority fails within ten days after notification to take
    appropriate action to cause said violation to be corrected or to
    show good cause for such failure and transmit notification of its
    action to the Secretary, the Secretary shall immediately order
    Federal inspection of the surface coal mining operation at which
    the alleged violation is occurring unless the information available
    to the Secretary is a result of a previous Federal inspection of
    such surface coal mining operation. The ten-day notification period
    shall be waived when the person informing the Secretary provides
    adequate proof that an imminent danger of significant environmental
    harm exists and that the State has failed to take appropriate
    action. When the Federal inspection results from information
    provided to the Secretary by any person, the Secretary shall notify
    such person when the Federal inspection is proposed to be carried
    out and such person shall be allowed to accompany the inspector
    during the inspection.
      (2) When, on the basis of any Federal inspection, the Secretary
    or his authorized representative determines that any condition or
    practices exist, or that any permittee is in violation of any
    requirement of this chapter or any permit condition required by
    this chapter, which condition, practice, or violation also creates
    an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public, or is
    causing, or can reasonably be expected to cause significant,
    imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, the
    Secretary or his authorized representative shall immediately order
    a cessation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations or
    the portion thereof relevant to the condition, practice, or
    violation. Such cessation order shall remain in effect until the
    Secretary or his authorized representative determines that the
    condition, practice, or violation has been abated, or until
    modified, vacated, or terminated by the Secretary or his authorized
    representative pursuant to paragraph (5) of this subsection. Where
    the Secretary finds that the ordered cessation of surface coal
    mining and reclamation operations, or any portion thereof, will not
    completely abate the imminent danger to health or safety of the
    public or the significant imminent environmental harm to land, air,
    or water resources, the Secretary shall, in addition to the
    cessation order, impose affirmative obligations on the operator
    requiring him to take whatever steps the Secretary deems necessary
    to abate the imminent danger or the significant environmental harm.
      (3) When, on the basis of a Federal inspection which is carried
    out during the enforcement of a Federal program or a Federal lands
    program, Federal inspection pursuant to section 1252, or section
    1254(b) of this title, or during Federal enforcement of a State
    program in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, the
    Secretary or his authorized representative determines that any
    permittee is in violation of any requirement of this chapter or any
    permit condition required by this chapter; but such violation does
    not create an imminent danger to the health or safety of the
    public, or cannot be reasonably expected to cause significant,
    imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, the
    Secretary or authorized representative shall issue a notice to the
    permittee or his agent fixing a reasonable time but not more than
    ninety days for the abatement of the violation and providing
    opportunity for public hearing.
      If, upon expiration of the period of time as originally fixed or
    subsequently extended, for good cause shown and upon the written
    finding of the Secretary or his authorized representative, the
    Secretary or his authorized representative finds that the violation
    has not been abated, he shall immediately order a cessation of
    surface coal mining and reclamation operations or the portion
    thereof relevant to the violation. Such cessation order shall
    remain in effect until the Secretary or his authorized
    representative determines that the violation has been abated, or
    until modified, vacated, or terminated by the Secretary or his
    authorized representative pursuant to paragraph (5) of this
    subsection. In the order of cessation issued by the Secretary under
    this subsection, the Secretary shall determine the steps necessary
    to abate the violation in the most expeditious manner possible, and
    shall include the necessary measures in the order.
      (4) When, on the basis of a Federal inspection which is carried
    out during the enforcement of a Federal program or a Federal lands
    program, Federal inspection pursuant to section 1252 or section
    1254 of this title or during Federal enforcement of a State program
    in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary or
    his authorized representative determines that a pattern of
    violations of any requirements of this chapter or any permit
    conditions required by this chapter exists or has existed, and if
    the Secretary or his authorized representative also find that such
    violations are caused by the unwarranted failure of the permittee
    to comply with any requirements of this chapter or any permit
    conditions, or that such violations are willfully caused by the
    permittee, the Secretary or his authorized representative shall
    forthwith issue an order to the permittee to show cause as to why
    the permit should not be suspended or revoked and shall provide
    opportunity for a public hearing. If a hearing is requested the
    Secretary shall inform all interested parties of the time and place
    of the hearing. Upon the permittee's failure to show cause as to
    why the permit should not be suspended or revoked, the Secretary or
    his authorized representative shall forthwith suspend or revoke the
    permit.
      (5) Notices and orders issued pursuant to this section shall set
    forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the violation and
    the remedial action required, the period of time established for
    abatement, and a reasonable description of the portion of the
    surface coal mining and reclamation operation to which the notice
    or order applies. Each notice or order issued under this section
    shall be given promptly to the permittee or his agent by the
    Secretary or his authorized representative who issues such notice
    or order, and all such notices and orders shall be in writing and
    shall be signed by such authorized representatives. Any notice or
    order issued pursuant to this section may be modified, vacated, or
    terminated by the Secretary or his authorized representative. A
    copy of any such order or notice shall be sent to the State
    regulatory authority in the State in which the violation occurs:
    Provided, That any notice or order issued pursuant to this section
    which requires cessation of mining by the operator shall expire
    within thirty days of actual notice to the operator unless a public
    hearing is held at the site or within such reasonable proximity to
    the site that any viewings of the site can be conducted during the
    course of public hearing.
    (b) Inadequate State enforcement; notice and hearing
      Whenever on the basis of information available to him, the
    Secretary has reason to believe that violations of all or any part
    of an approved State program result from a failure of the State to
    enforce such State program or any part thereof effectively, he
    shall after public notice and notice to the State, hold a hearing
    thereon in the State within thirty days of such notice. If as a
    result of said hearing the Secretary finds that there are
    violations and such violations result from a failure of the State
    to enforce all or any part of the State program effectively, and if
    he further finds that the State has not adequately demonstrated its
    capability and intent to enforce such State program, he shall give
    public notice of such finding. During the period beginning with
    such public notice and ending when such State satisfies the
    Secretary that it will enforce this chapter, the Secretary shall
    enforce, in the manner provided by this chapter, any permit
    condition required under this chapter, shall issue new or revised
    permits in accordance with requirements of this chapter, and may
    issue such notices and orders as are necessary for compliance
    therewith: Provided, That in the case of a State permittee who has
    met his obligations under such permit and who did not willfully
    secure the issuance of such permit through fraud or collusion, the
    Secretary shall give the permittee a reasonable time to conform
    ongoing surface mining and reclamation to the requirements of this
    chapter before suspending or revoking the State permit.
    (c) Civil action for relief
      The Secretary may request the Attorney General to institute a
    civil action for relief, including a permanent or temporary
    injunction, restraining order, or any other appropriate order in
    the district court of the United States for the district in which
    the surface coal mining and reclamation operation is located or in
    which the permittee thereof has his principal office, whenever such
    permittee or his agent (A) violates or fails or refuses to comply
    with any order or decision issued by the Secretary under this
    chapter, or (B) interferes with, hinders, or delays the Secretary
    or his authorized representatives in carrying out the provisions of
    this chapter, or (C) refuses to admit such authorized
    representative to the mine, or (D) refuses to permit inspection of
    the mine by such authorized representative, or (E) refuses to
    furnish any information or report requested by the Secretary in
    furtherance of the provisions of this chapter, or (F) refuses to
    permit access to, and copying of, such records as the Secretary
    determines necessary in carrying out the provisions of this
    chapter. Such court shall have jurisdiction to provide such relief
    as may be appropriate. Temporary restraining orders shall be issued
    in accordance with rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
    as amended. Any relief granted by the court to enforce an order
    under clause (A) of this section shall continue in effect until the
    completion or final termination of all proceedings for review of
    such order under this subchapter, unless, prior thereto, the
    district court granting such relief sets it aside or modifies it.
    (d) Sanctions; effect on additional enforcement rights under State
      law
      As a condition of approval of any State program submitted
    pursuant to section 1253 of this title, the enforcement provisions
    thereof shall, at a minimum, incorporate sanctions no less
    stringent than those set forth in this section, and shall contain
    the same or similar procedural requirements relating thereto.
    Nothing herein shall be construed so as to eliminate any additional
    enforcement rights or procedures which are available under State
    law to a State regulatory authority but which are not specifically
    enumerated herein.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1272. Designating areas unsuitable for surface coal mining

-STATUTE-
    (a) Establishment of State planning process; standards; State
      process requirements; integration with present and future land
      use planning and regulation processes; savings provisions
      (1) To be eligible to assume primary regulatory authority
    pursuant to section 1253 of this title, each State shall establish
    a planning process enabling objective decisions based upon
    competent and scientifically sound data and information as to
    which, if any, land areas of a State are unsuitable for all or
    certain types of surface coal mining operations pursuant to the
    standards set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection
    but such designation shall not prevent the mineral exploration
    pursuant to the chapter of any area so designated.
      (2) Upon petition pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the
    State regulatory authority shall designate an area as unsuitable
    for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations if the
    State regulatory authority determines that reclamation pursuant to
    the requirements of this chapter is not technologically and
    economically feasible.
      (3) Upon petition pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, a
    surface area may be designated unsuitable for certain types of
    surface coal mining operations if such operations will - 
        (A) be incompatible with existing State or local land use plans
      or programs; or
        (B) affect fragile or historic lands in which such operations
      could result in significant damage to important historic,
      cultural, scientific, and esthetic values and natural systems; or
        (C) affect renewable resource lands in which such operations
      could result in a substantial loss or reduction of long-range
      productivity of water supply or of food or fiber products, and
      such lands to include aquifers and aquifer recharge areas; or
        (D) affect natural hazard lands in which such operations could
      substantially endanger life and property, such lands to include
      areas subject to frequent flooding and areas of unstable geology.

      (4) To comply with this section, a State must demonstrate it has
    developed or is developing a process which includes - 
        (A) a State agency responsible for surface coal mining lands
      review;
        (B) a data base and an inventory system which will permit
      proper evaluation of the capacity of different land areas of the
      State to support and permit reclamation of surface coal mining
      operations;
        (C) a method or methods for implementing land use planning
      decisions concerning surface coal mining operations; and
        (D) proper notice, opportunities for public participation,
      including a public hearing prior to making any designation or
      redesignation, pursuant to this section.

      (5) Determinations of the unsuitability of land for surface coal
    mining, as provided for in this section, shall be integrated as
    closely as possible with present and future land use planning and
    regulation processes at the Federal, State, and local levels.
      (6) The requirements of this section shall not apply to lands on
    which surface coal mining operations are being conducted on August
    3, 1977, or under a permit issued pursuant to this chapter, or
    where substantial legal and financial commitments in such operation
    were in existence prior to January 4, 1977.
    (b) Review of Federal lands
      The Secretary shall conduct a review of the Federal lands to
    determine, pursuant to the standards set forth in paragraphs (2)
    and (3) of subsection (a) of this section, whether there are areas
    on Federal lands which are unsuitable for all or certain types of
    surface coal mining operations: Provided, however, That the
    Secretary may permit surface coal mining on Federal lands prior to
    the completion of this review. When the Secretary determines an
    area on Federal lands to be unsuitable for all or certain types of
    surface coal mining operations, he shall withdraw such area or
    condition any mineral leasing or mineral entries in a manner so as
    to limit surface coal mining operations on such area. Where a
    Federal program has been implemented in a State pursuant to section
    1254 of this title, the Secretary shall implement a process for
    designation of areas unsuitable for surface coal mining for non-
    Federal lands within such State and such process shall incorporate
    the standards and procedures of this section. Prior to designating
    Federal lands unsuitable for such mining, the Secretary shall
    consult with the appropriate State and local agencies.
    (c) Petition; intervention; decision
      Any person having an interest which is or may be adversely
    affected shall have the right to petition the regulatory authority
    to have an area designated as unsuitable for surface coal mining
    operations, or to have such a designation terminated. Such a
    petition shall contain allegations of facts with supporting
    evidence which would tend to establish the allegations. Within ten
    months after receipt of the petition the regulatory authority shall
    hold a public hearing in the locality of the affected area, after
    appropriate notice and publication of the date, time, and location
    of such hearing. After a person having an interest which is or may
    be adversely affected has filed a petition and before the hearing,
    as required by this subsection, any person may intervene by filing
    allegations of facts with supporting evidence which would tend to
    establish the allegations. Within sixty days after such hearing,
    the regulatory authority shall issue and furnish to the petitioner
    and any other party to the hearing, a written decision regarding
    the petition, and the reasons therefore.(!1) In the event that all
    the petitioners stipulate agreement prior to the requested hearing,
    and withdraw their request, such hearing need not be held.

    (d) Statement
      Prior to designating any land areas as unsuitable for surface
    coal mining operations, the regulatory authority shall prepare a
    detailed statement on (i) the potential coal resources of the area,
    (ii) the demand for coal resources, and (iii) the impact of such
    designation on the environment, the economy, and the supply of
    coal.
    (e) Prohibition on certain Federal public and private surface coal
      mining operations
      After August 3, 1977, and subject to valid existing rights no
    surface coal mining operations except those which exist on August
    3, 1977, shall be permitted - 
        (1) on any lands within the boundaries of units of the National
      Park System, the National Wildlife Refuge Systems, the National
      System of Trails, the National Wilderness Preservation System,
      the Wild and Scenic Rivers System, including study rivers
      designated under section 1276(a) of title 16 and National
      Recreation Areas designated by Act of Congress;
        (2) on any Federal lands within the boundaries of any national
      forest: Provided, however, That surface coal mining operations
      may be permitted on such lands if the Secretary finds that there
      are no significant recreational, timber, economic, or other
      values which may be incompatible with such surface mining
      operations and - 
          (A) surface operations and impacts are incident to an
        underground coal mine; or
          (B) where the Secretary of Agriculture determines, with
        respect to lands which do not have significant forest cover
        within those national forests west of the 100th meridian, that
        surface mining is in compliance with the Multiple-Use Sustained-
        Yield Act of 1960 [16 U.S.C. 528-531], the Federal Coal
        Leasing Amendments Act of 1975, the National Forest Management
        Act of 1976, and the provisions of this chapter: And provided
        further, That no surface coal mining operations may be
        permitted within the boundaries of the Custer National Forest;

        (3) which will adversely affect any publicly owned park or
      places included in the National Register of Historic Sites unless
      approved jointly by the regulatory authority and the Federal,
      State, or local agency with jurisdiction over the park or the
      historic site;
        (4) within one hundred feet of the outside right-of-way line of
      any public road, except where mine access roads or haulage roads
      join such right-of-way line and except that the regulatory
      authority may permit such roads to be relocated or the area
      affected to lie within one hundred feet of such road, if after
      public notice and opportunity for public hearing in the locality
      a written finding is made that the interests of the public and
      the landowners affected thereby will be protected; or
        (5) within three hundred feet from any occupied dwelling,
      unless waived by the owner thereof, nor within three hundred feet
      of any public building, school, church, community, or
      institutional building, public park, or within one hundred feet
      of a cemetery.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1273. Federal lands

-STATUTE-
    (a) Promulgation and implementation of Federal lands program
      No later than one year after August 3, 1977, the Secretary shall
    promulgate and implement a Federal lands program which shall be
    applicable to all surface coal mining and reclamation operations
    taking place pursuant to any Federal law on any Federal lands:
    Provided, That except as provided in section 1300 of this title the
    provisions of this chapter shall not be applicable to Indian lands.
    The Federal lands program shall, at a minimum, incorporate all of
    the requirements of this chapter and shall take into consideration
    the diverse physical, climatological, and other unique
    characteristics of the Federal lands in question. Where Federal
    lands in a State with an approved State program are involved, the
    Federal lands program shall, at a minimum, include the requirements
    of the approved State program: Provided, That the Secretary shall
    retain his duties under sections 201(a), (2)(B) (!1) and 201(a)(3)
    of this title, and shall continue to be responsible for designation
    of Federal lands as unsuitable for mining in accordance with
    section 1272(b) of this title.

    (b) Incorporation of requirements into any lease, permit, or
      contract issued by Secretary which may involve surface coal
      mining and reclamation operations
      The requirements of this chapter and the Federal lands program or
    an approved State program for State regulation of surface coal
    mining on Federal lands under subsection (c) of this section,
    whichever is applicable, shall be incorporated by reference or
    otherwise in any Federal mineral lease, permit, or contract issued
    by the Secretary which may involve surface coal mining and
    reclamation operations. Incorporation of such requirements shall
    not, however, limit in any way the authority of the Secretary to
    subsequently issue new regulations, revise the Federal lands
    program to deal with changing conditions or changed technology, and
    to require any surface mining and reclamation operations to conform
    with the requirements of this chapter and the regulations issued
    pursuant to this chapter.
    (c) State cooperative agreements
      Any State with an approved State program may elect to enter into
    a cooperative agreement with the Secretary to provide for State
    regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on
    Federal lands within the State, provided the Secretary determines
    in writing that such State has the necessary personnel and funding
    to fully implement such a cooperative agreement in accordance with
    the provision of this chapter. States with cooperative agreements
    existing on August 3, 1977, may elect to continue regulation on
    Federal lands within the State, prior to approval by the Secretary
    of their State program, or imposition of a Federal program,
    provided that such existing cooperative agreement is modified to
    fully comply with the initial regulatory procedures set forth in
    section 1252 of this title. Nothing in this subsection shall be
    construed as authorizing the Secretary to delegate to the States
    his duty to approve mining plans on Federal lands, to designate
    certain Federal lands as unsuitable for surface coal mining
    pursuant to section 1272 of this title, or to regulate other
    activities taking place on Federal lands.
    (d) Development of program to assure no unreasonable denial to any
      class of coal purchasers
      The Secretary shall develop a program to assure that with respect
    to the granting of permits, leases, or contracts for coal owned by
    the United States, that no class of purchasers of the mined coal
    shall be unreasonably denied purchase thereof.

    Sec. 1275. Review by Secretary

-STATUTE-
    (a) Application for review of order or notice; investigation;
      hearing; notice
      (1) A permittee issued a notice or order by the Secretary
    pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection
    (a) of section 1271 of this title, or pursuant to a Federal program
    or the Federal lands program or any person having an interest which
    is or may be adversely affected by such notice or order or by any
    modification, vacation, or termination of such notice or order, may
    apply to the Secretary for review of the notice or order within
    thirty days of receipt thereof or within thirty days of its
    modification, vacation, or termination. Upon receipt of such
    application, the Secretary shall cause such investigation to be
    made as he deems appropriate. Such investigation shall provide an
    opportunity for a public hearing, at the request of the applicant
    or the person having an interest which is or may be adversely
    affected, to enable the applicant or such person to present
    information relating to the issuance and continuance of such notice
    or order or the modification, vacation, or termination thereof. The
    filing of an application for review under this subsection shall not
    operate as a stay of any order or notice.
      (2) The permittee and other interested persons shall be given
    written notice of the time and place of the hearing at least five
    days prior thereto. Any such hearing shall be of record and shall
    be subject to section 554 of title 5.
    (b) Findings of fact; issuance of decision
      Upon receiving the report of such investigation, the Secretary
    shall make findings of fact, and shall issue a written decision,
    incorporating therein an order vacating, affirming, modifying, or
    terminating the notice or order, or the modification, vacation, or
    termination of such notice or order complained of and incorporate
    his findings therein. Where the application for review concerns an
    order for cessation of surface coal mining and reclamation
    operations issued pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (2) or
    (3) of subsection (a) of section 1271 of this title, the Secretary
    shall issue the written decision within thirty days of the receipt
    of the application for review, unless temporary relief has been
    granted by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (c) of this section
    or by the court pursuant to subsection (c) of section 1276 of this
    title.
    (c) Temporary relief; issuance of order or decision granting or
      denying relief
      Pending completion of the investigation and hearing required by
    this section, the applicant may file with the Secretary a written
    request that the Secretary grant temporary relief from any notice
    or order issued under section 1271 of this title, a Federal program
    or the Federal lands program together with a detailed statement
    giving reasons for granting such relief. The Secretary shall issue
    an order or decision granting or denying such relief expeditiously:
    Provided, That where the applicant requests relief from an order
    for cessation of coal mining and reclamation operations issued
    pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3) of subsection (a) of section 1271
    of this title, the order or decision on such a request shall be
    issued within five days of its receipt. The Secretary may grant
    such relief, under such conditions as he may prescribe, if - 
        (1) a hearing has been held in the locality of the permit area
      on the request for temporary relief in which all parties were
      given an opportunity to be heard;
        (2) the applicant shows that there is substantial likelihood
      that the findings of the Secretary will be favorable to him; and
        (3) such relief will not adversely affect the health or safety
      of the public or cause significant, imminent environmental harm
      to land, air, or water resources.
    (d) Notice and hearing with respect to section 1271 order to show
      cause
      Following the issuance of an order to show cause as to why a
    permit should not be suspended or revoked pursuant to section 1271
    of this title, the Secretary shall hold a public hearing after
    giving written notice of the time, place, and date thereof. Any
    such hearing shall be of record and shall be subject to section 554
    of title 5. Within sixty days following the public hearing, the
    Secretary shall issue and furnish to the permittee and all other
    parties to the hearing a written decision, and the reasons
    therefor, concerning suspension or revocation of the permit. If the
    Secretary revokes the permit, the permittee shall immediately cease
    surface coal mining operations on the permit area and shall
    complete reclamation within a period specified by the Secretary, or
    the Secretary shall declare as forfeited the performance bonds for
    the operation.
    (e) Costs
      Whenever an order is issued under this section, or as a result of
    any administrative proceeding under this chapter, at the request of
    any person, a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and
    expenses (including attorney fees) as determined by the Secretary
    to have been reasonably incurred by such person for or in
    connection with his participation in such proceedings, including
    any judicial review of agency actions, may be assessed against
    either party as the court, resulting from judicial review or the
    Secretary, resulting from administrative proceedings, deems proper.

    Sec. 1276. Judicial review

-STATUTE-
    (a) Review by United States District Court; venue; filing of
      petition; time
      (1) Any action of the Secretary to approve or disapprove a State
    program or to prepare or promulgate a Federal program pursuant to
    this chapter shall be subject to judicial review by the United
    States District Court for the District which includes the capital
    of the State whose program is at issue. Any action by the Secretary
    promulgating national rules or regulations including standards
    pursuant to sections 1251, 1265, 1266, and 1273 of this title shall
    be subject to judicial review in the United States District Court
    for the District of Columbia Circuit. Any other action constituting
    rulemaking by the Secretary shall be subject to judicial review
    only by the United States District Court for the District in which
    the surface coal mining operation is located. Any action subject to
    judicial review under this subsection shall be affirmed unless the
    court concludes that such action is arbitrary, capricious, or
    otherwise inconsistent with law. A petition for review of any
    action subject to judicial review under this subsection shall be
    filed in the appropriate Court within sixty days from the date of
    such action, or after such date if the petition is based solely on
    grounds arising after the sixtieth day. Any such petition may be
    made by any person who participated in the administrative
    proceedings and who is aggrieved by the action of the Secretary.
      (2) Any order or decision issued by the Secretary in a civil
    penalty proceeding or any other proceeding required to be conducted
    pursuant to section 554 of title 5 shall be subject to judicial
    review on or before 30 days from the date of such order or decision
    in accordance with subsection (b) of this section in the United
    States District Court for the district in which the surface coal
    mining operation is located. In the case of a proceeding to review
    an order or decision issued by the Secretary under the penalty
    section of this chapter, the court shall have jurisdiction to enter
    an order requiring payment of any civil penalty assessment enforced
    by its judgment. This availability of review established in this
    subsection shall not be construed to limit the operations of rights
    established in section 1270 of this title.
    (b) Evidence; conclusiveness of findings; orders
      The court shall hear such petition or complaint solely on the
    record made before the Secretary. Except as provided in subsection
    (a) of this section, the findings of the Secretary if supported by
    substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be
    conclusive. The court may affirm, vacate, or modify any order or
    decision or may remand the proceedings to the Secretary for such
    further action as it may direct.
    (c) Temporary relief; prerequisites
      In the case of a proceeding to review any order or decision
    issued by the Secretary under this chapter, including an order or
    decision issued pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) of section 1275
    of this title pertaining to any order issued under paragraph (2),
    (3), or (4) of subsection (a) of section 1271 of this title for
    cessation of coal mining and reclamation operations, the court may,
    under such conditions as it may prescribe, grant such temporary
    relief as it deems appropriate pending final determination of the
    proceedings if - 
        (1) all parties to the proceedings have been notified and given
      an opportunity to be heard on a request for temporary relief;
        (2) the person requesting such relief shows that there is a
      substantial likelihood that he will prevail on the merits of the
      final determination of the proceeding; and
        (3) such relief will not adversely affect the public health or
      safety or cause significant imminent environmental harm to land,
      air, or water resources.
    (d) Stay of action, order, or decision of Secretary
      The commencement of a proceeding under this section shall not,
    unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the
    action, order, or decision of the Secretary.
    (e) Action of State regulatory authority
      Action of the State regulatory authority pursuant to an approved
    State program shall be subject to judicial review by a court of
    competent jurisdiction in accordance with State law, but the
    availability of such review shall not be construed to limit the
    operation of the rights established in section 1270 of this title
    except as provided therein.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1277. Special bituminous coal mines

-STATUTE-
    (a) Issuance of separate regulations; criteria
      The regulatory authority is authorized to issue separate
    regulations for those special bituminous coal surface mines located
    west of the 100th meridian west longitude which meet the following
    criteria:
        (1) the excavation of the specific mine pit takes place on the
      same relatively limited site for an extended period of time;
        (2) the excavation of the specific mine pit follows a coal seam
      having an inclination of fifteen degrees or more from the
      horizontal, and continues in the same area proceeding downward
      with lateral expansion of the pit necessary to maintain stability
      or as necessary to accommodate the orderly expansion of the total
      mining operation;
        (3) the excavation of the specific mine pit involves the mining
      of more than one coal seam and mining has been initiated on the
      deepest coal seam contemplated to be mined in the current
      operation;
        (4) the amount of material removed is large in proportion to
      the surface area disturbed;
        (5) there is no practicable alternative method of mining the
      coal involved;
        (6) there is no practicable method to reclaim the land in the
      manner required by this chapter; and
        (7) the specific mine pit has been actually producing coal
      since January 1, 1972, in such manner as to meet the criteria set
      forth in this section, and, because of past duration of mining,
      is substantially committed to a mode of operation which warrants
      exceptions to some provisions of this subchapter.
    (b) New bituminous coal surface mines
      Such separate regulations shall also contain a distinct part to
    cover and pertain to new bituminous coal surface mines which may be
    developed after August 3, 1977, on lands immediately adjacent to
    lands upon which are located special bituminous mines existing on
    January 1, 1972. Such new mines shall meet the criteria of
    subsection (a) of this section except for paragraphs (3) and (7),
    and all requirements of State law, notwithstanding in whole or part
    the regulations issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.
    In the event of an amendment or revision to the State's regulatory
    program, regulations, or decisions made thereunder governing such
    mines, the Secretary shall issue such additional regulations as
    necessary to meet the purposes of this chapter.
    (c) Scope of alternative regulations
      Such alternative regulations may pertain only to the standards
    governing onsite handling of spoils, elimination of depressions
    capable of collecting water, creation of impoundments, and
    regrading to the approximate original contour and shall specify
    that remaining highwalls are stable. All other performance
    standards in this subchapter shall apply to such mines.

    Sec. 1281. Designation procedures

-STATUTE-
    (a) Review of Federal land areas for unsuitability for noncoal
      mining
      With respect to Federal lands within any State, the Secretary of
    Interior may, and if so requested by the Governor of such State
    shall, review any area within such lands to assess whether it may
    be unsuitable for mining operations for minerals or materials other
    than coal, pursuant to the criteria and procedures of this section.
    (b) Criteria considered in determining designations
      An area of Federal land may be designated under this section as
    unsuitable for mining operations if (1) such area consists of
    Federal land of a predominantly urban or suburban character, used
    primarily for residential or related purposes, the mineral estate
    of which remains in the public domain, or (2) such area consists of
    Federal land where mining operations would have an adverse impact
    on lands used primarily for residential or related purposes.
    (c) Petition for exclusion; contents; hearing; temporary land
      withdrawal
      Any person having an interest which is or may be adversely
    affected shall have the right to petition the Secretary to seek
    exclusion of an area from mining operations pursuant to this
    section or the redesignation of an area or part thereof as suitable
    for such operations. Such petition shall contain allegations of
    fact with supporting evidence which would tend to substantiate the
    allegations. The petitioner shall be granted a hearing within a
    reasonable time and finding with reasons therefor upon the matter
    of their petition. In any instance where a Governor requests the
    Secretary to review an area, or where the Secretary finds the
    national interest so requires, the Secretary may temporarily
    withdraw the area to be reviewed from mineral entry or leasing
    pending such review: Provided, however, That such temporary
    withdrawal be ended as promptly as practicable and in no event
    shall exceed two years.
    (d) Limitation on designations; rights preservation; regulations
      In no event is a land area to be designated unsuitable for mining
    operations under this section on which mining operations are being
    conducted prior to the holding of a hearing on such petition in
    accordance with subsection (c) of this section. Valid existing
    rights shall be preserved and not affected by such designation.
    Designation of an area as unsuitable for mining operations under
    this section shall not prevent subsequent mineral exploration of
    such area, except that such exploration shall require the prior
    written consent of the holder of the surface estate, which consent
    shall be filed with the Secretary. The Secretary may promulgate,
    with respect to any designated area, regulations to minimize any
    adverse effects of such exploration.
    (e) Statement
      Prior to any designation pursuant to this section, the Secretary
    shall prepare a detailed statement on (i) the potential mineral
    resources of the area, (ii) the demand for such mineral resources,
    and (iii) the impact of such designation or the absence of such
    designation on the environment, economy, and the supply of such
    mineral resources.
    (f) Area withdrawal
      When the Secretary designates an area of Federal lands as
    unsuitable for all or certain types of mining operations for
    minerals and materials other than coal pursuant to this section he
    may withdraw such area from mineral entry or leasing, or condition
    such entry or leasing so as to limit such mining operations in
    accordance with his determination, if the Secretary also
    determines, based on his analysis pursuant to subsection (e) of
    this section, that the benefits resulting from such designation
    would be greater than the benefits to the regional or national
    economy which could result from mineral development of such area.
    (g) Right to appeal
      Any party with a valid legal interest who has appeared in the
    proceedings in connection with the Secretary's determination
    pursuant to this section and who is aggrieved by the Secretary's
    decision (or by his failure to act within a reasonable time) shall
    have the right of appeal for review by the United States district
    court for the district in which the pertinent area is located.

      of debris from sheet erosion, deposits by unconcentrated runoff
      or slope wash, together with talus, other mass movement
      accumulation and windblown deposits;
        (2) "approximate original contour" means that surface
      configuration achieved by backfilling and grading of the mined
      area so that the reclaimed area, including any terracing or
      access roads, closely resembles the general surface configuration
      of the land prior to mining and blends into and complements the
      drainage pattern of the surrounding terrain, with all highwalls
      and spoil piles eliminated; water impoundments may be permitted
      where the regulatory authority determines that they are in
      compliance with section 1265(b)(8) of this title;
        (3) "commerce" means trade, traffic, commerce, transportation,
      transmission, or communication among the several States, or

      interstate commerce;
        (4) "Federal lands" means any land, including mineral
      interests, owned by the United States without regard to how the
      United States acquired ownership of the land and without regard
      to the agency having responsibility for management thereof,
      except Indian lands: Provided, That for the purposes of this
      chapter lands or mineral interests east of the one hundredth
      meridian west longitude owned by the United States and entrusted
      to or managed by the Tennessee Valley Authority shall not be
      subject to sections 1304 (Surface Owner Protection) and 1305

      substantial physical harm to persons outside the permit area
      before such condition, practice, or violation can be abated. A
      reasonable expectation of death or serious injury before
      abatement exists if a rational person, subjected to the same

      expose himself or herself to the danger during the time necessary
      for abatement;
        (9) "Indian lands" means all lands, including mineral
      interests, within the exterior boundaries of any Federal Indian

      and those minerals which occur naturally in liquid or gaseous
      form;
        (15) "permit" means a permit to conduct surface coal mining and
      reclamation operations issued by the State regulatory authority
      pursuant to a State program or by the Secretary pursuant to a

    standards promulgated under sections 1265 and 1266 of this title.
    Such departures may be authorized if (i) the experimental practices
    are potentially more or at least as environmentally protective,
    during and after mining operations, as those required by
    promulgated standards; (ii) the mining operations approved for
    particular land-use or other purposes are not larger or more
    numerous than necessary to determine the effectiveness and economic
    feasibility of the experimental practices; and (iii) the
    experimental practices do not reduce the protection afforded public
    health and safety below that provided by promulgated standards.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1304. Surface owner protection

-STATUTE-
    (a) Applicability
      The provisions of this section shall apply where coal owned by
    the United States under land the surface rights to which are owned
    by a surface owner as defined in this section is to be mined by
    methods other than underground mining techniques.
    (b) Lease of coal deposits governed by section 201 of this title
      Any coal deposits subject to this section shall be offered for
    lease pursuant to section 201(a) of this title.
    (c) Consent to lease by surface owner
      The Secretary shall not enter into any lease of Federal coal
    deposits until the surface owner has given written consent to enter
    and commence surface mining operations and the Secretary has
    obtained evidence of such consent. Valid written consent given by
    any surface owner prior to August 3, 1977, shall be deemed
    sufficient for the purposes of complying with this section.
    (d) Preferences
      In order to minimize disturbance to surface owners from surface
    coal mining of Federal coal deposits and to assist in the
    preparation of comprehensive land-use plans required by section
    201(a) of this title, the Secretary shall consult with any surface
    owner whose land is proposed to be included in a leasing tract and
    shall ask the surface owner to state his preference for or against
    the offering of the deposit under his land for lease. The Secretary
    shall, in his discretion but to the maximum extent practicable,
    refrain from leasing coal deposits for development by methods other
    than underground mining techniques in those areas where a
    significant number of surface owners have stated a preference
    against the offering of the deposits for lease.
    (e) "Surface owner" defined
      For the purpose of this section the term "surface owner" means
    the natural person or persons (or corporation, the majority stock
    of which is held by a person or persons who meet the other
    requirements of this section) who - 
        (1) hold legal or equitable title to the land surface;
        (2) have their principal place of residence on the land; or
      personally conduct farming or ranching operations upon a farm or
      ranch unit to be affected by surface coal mining operations; or
      receive directly a significant portion of their income, if any,
      from such farming or ranching operations; and
        (3) have met the conditions of paragraphs (1) and (2) for a
      period of at least three years prior to the granting of the
      consent.

    In computing the three-year period the Secretary may include
    periods during which title was owned by a relative of such person
    by blood or marriage during which period such relative would have
    met the requirements of this subsection.
    (f) Exception
      This section shall not apply to Indian lands.
    (g) Effect on property rights of United States or any other
      landowner
      Nothing in this section shall be construed as increasing or
    diminishing any property rights by the United States or by any
    other landowner.

-STATUTE-
      In those instances where the coal proposed to be mined by surface
    coal mining operations is owned by the Federal Government and the
    surface is subject to a lease or a permit issued by the Federal
    Government, the application for a permit shall include either:
        (1) the written consent of the permittee or lessee of the
      surface lands involved to enter and commence surface coal mining
      operations on such land, or in lieu thereof;
        (2) evidence of the execution of a bond or undertaking to the
      United States or the State, whichever is applicable, for the use
      and benefit of the permittee or lessee of the surface lands
      involved to secure payment of any damages to the surface estate
      which the operations will cause to the crops, or to the tangible
      improvements of the permittee or lessee of the surface lands as
      may be determined by the parties involved, or as determined and
      fixed in an action brought against the operator or upon the bond
      in a court of competent jurisdiction. This bond is in addition to
      the performance bond required for reclamation under this chapter.

    CHAPTER 26 - DEEP SEABED HARD MINERAL RESOURCES

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1401. Congressional findings and declaration of purpose

-STATUTE-
    (a) Findings
      The Congress finds that - 
        (1) the United States' requirements for hard minerals to
      satisfy national industrial needs will continue to expand and the
      demand for such minerals will increasingly exceed the available
      domestic sources of supply;
        (2) in the case of certain hard minerals, the United States is
      dependent upon foreign sources of supply and the acquisition of
      such minerals from foreign sources is a significant factor in the
      national balance-of-payments position;
        (3) the present and future national interest of the United
      States requires the availability of hard mineral resources which
      is independent of the export policies of foreign nations;
        (4) there is an alternate source of supply, which is
      significant in relation to national needs, of certain hard
      minerals, including nickel, copper, cobalt, and manganese,
      contained in the nodules existing in great abundance on the deep
      seabed;
        (5) the nations of the world, including the United States, will
      benefit if the hard mineral resources of the deep seabed beyond
      limits of national jurisdiction can be developed and made
      available for their use;
        (6) in particular, future access to the nickel, copper, cobalt,
      and manganese resources of the deep seabed will be important to
      the industrial needs of the nations of the world, both developed
      and developing;
        (7) on December 17, 1970, the United States supported (by
      affirmative vote) the United Nations General Assembly Resolution
      2749 (XXV) declaring inter alia the principle that the mineral
      resources of the deep seabed are the common heritage of mankind,
      with the expectation that this principle would be legally defined
      under the terms of a comprehensive international Law of the Sea
      Treaty yet to be agreed upon;
        (8) it is in the national interest of the United States and
      other nations to encourage a widely acceptable Law of the Sea
      Treaty, which will provide a new legal order for the oceans
      covering a broad range of ocean interests, including exploration
      for and commercial recovery of hard mineral resources of the deep
      seabed;
        (9) the negotiations to conclude such a Treaty and establish
      the international regime governing the exercise of rights over,
      and exploration of, the resources of the deep seabed, referred to
      in General Assembly Resolution 2749 (XXV) are in progress but may
      not be concluded in the near future;
        (10) even if such negotiations are completed promptly, much
      time will elapse before such an international regime is
      established and in operation;
        (11) development of technology required for the exploration and
      recovery of hard mineral resources of the deep seabed will
      require substantial investment for many years before commercial
      production can occur, and must proceed at this time if deep
      seabed minerals are to be available when needed;
        (12) it is the legal opinion of the United States that
      exploration for and commercial recovery of hard mineral resources
      of the deep seabed are freedoms of the high seas subject to a
      duty of reasonable regard to the interests of other states in
      their exercise of those and other freedoms recognized by general
      principles of international law;
        (13) pending a Law of the Sea Treaty, and in the absence of
      agreement among states on applicable principles of international
      law, the uncertainty among potential investors as to the future
      legal regime is likely to discourage or prevent the investments
      necessary to develop deep seabed mining technology;
        (14) pending a Law of the Sea Treaty, the protection of the
      marine environment from damage caused by exploration or recovery
      of hard mineral resources of the deep seabed depends upon the
      enactment of suitable interim national legislation;
        (15) a Law of the Sea Treaty is likely to establish financial
      arrangements which obligate the United States or United States
      citizens to make payments to an international organization with
      respect to exploration or recovery of the hard mineral resources
      of the deep seabed; and
        (16) legislation is required to establish an interim legal
      regime under which technology can be developed and the
      exploration and recovery of the hard mineral resources of the
      deep seabed can take place until such time as a Law of the Sea
      Treaty enters into force with respect to the United States.
    (b) Purposes
      The Congress declares that the purposes of this chapter are - 
        (1) to encourage the successful conclusion of a comprehensive
      Law of the Sea Treaty, which will give legal definition to the
      principle that the hard mineral resources of the deep seabed are
      the common heritage of mankind and which will assure, among other
      things, nondiscriminatory access to such resources for all
      nations;
        (2) pending the ratification by, and entering into force with
      respect to, the United States of such a Treaty, to provide for
      the establishment of an international revenue-sharing fund the
      proceeds of which shall be used for sharing with the
      international community pursuant to such Treaty;
        (3) to establish, pending the ratification by, and entering
      into force with respect to, the United States of such a Treaty,
      an interim program to regulate the exploration for and commercial
      recovery of hard mineral resources of the deep seabed by United
      States citizens;
        (4) to accelerate the program of environmental assessment of
      exploration for and commercial recovery of hard mineral resources
      of the deep seabed and assure that such exploration and recovery
      activities are conducted in a manner which will encourage the
      conservation of such resources, protect the quality of the
      environment, and promote the safety of life and property at sea;
      and
        (5) to encourage the continued development of technology
      necessary to recover the hard mineral resources of the deep
      seabed.

    (a) Disclaimer of extraterritorial sovereignty
      By the enactment of this chapter, the United States - 
        (1) exercises its jurisdiction over United States citizens and
      vessels, and foreign persons and vessels otherwise subject to its
      jurisdiction, in the exercise of the high seas freedom to engage
      in exploration for, and commercial recovery of, hard mineral
      resources of the deep seabed in accordance with generally
      accepted principles of international law recognized by the United
      States; but
        (2) does not thereby assert sovereignty or sovereign or
      exclusive rights or jurisdiction over, or the ownership of, any
      areas or resources in the deep seabed.
    (b) Secretary of State
      (1) The Secretary of State is encouraged to negotiate
    successfully a comprehensive Law of the Sea Treaty which, among
    other things, provides assured and nondiscriminatory access to the
    hard mineral resources of the deep seabed for all nations, gives
    legal definition to the principle that the resources of the deep
    seabed are the common heritage of mankind, and provides for the
    establishment of requirements for the protection of the quality of
    the environment as stringent as those promulgated pursuant to this
    chapter.
      (2) Until such a Treaty is concluded, the Secretary of State is
    encouraged to promote any international actions necessary to
    adequately protect the environment from adverse impacts which may
    result from any exploration for and commercial recovery of hard
    mineral resources of the deep seabed carried out by persons not
    subject to this chapter.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1411. Prohibited activities by United States citizens

-STATUTE-
    (a) Prohibited activities and exceptions
      (1) No United States citizen may engage in any exploration or
    commercial recovery unless authorized to do so under - 
        (A) a license or a permit issued under this subchapter;
        (B) a license, permit, or equivalent authorization issued by a
      reciprocating state; or
        (C) an international agreement which is in force with respect
      to the United States.

      (2) The prohibitions of this subsection shall not apply to any of
    the following activities:
        (A) Scientific research, including that concerning hard mineral
      resources.
        (B) Mapping, or the taking of any geophysical, geochemical,
      oceanographic, or atmospheric measurements or random bottom
      samplings of the deep seabed, if such taking does not
      significantly alter the surface or subsurface of the deep seabed
      or significantly affect the environment.
        (C) The design, construction, or testing of equipment and
      facilities which will or may be used for exploration or
      commercial recovery, if such design, construction, or testing is
      conducted on shore, or does not involve the recovery of any but
      incidental hard mineral resources.
        (D) The furnishing of machinery, products, supplies, services,
      or materials for any exploration or commercial recovery conducted
      under a license or permit issued under this subchapter, a license
      or permit or equivalent authorization issued by a reciprocating
      state, or under an international agreement.
        (E) Activities, other than exploration or commercial recovery
      activities, of the Federal Government.
    (b) Existing exploration
      (1) Subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section shall not be deemed to
    prohibit any United States citizen who is engaged in exploration
    before June 28, 1980, from continuing to engage in such exploration
    - 
        (A) if such citizen applies for a license under section 1413(a)
      of this title with respect to such exploration within such
      reasonable period of time, after the date on which initial
      regulations to implement section 1413(a) of this title are
      issued, as the Administrator shall prescribe; and
        (B) until such license is issued to such citizen or a final
      administrative or judicial determination is made affirming the
      denial of certification of the application for, or issuance of,
      such license.

      (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if the President by Executive
    order determines that immediate suspension of exploration
    activities is necessary for the reasons set forth in section
    1416(a)(2)(B) of this title or the Administrator determines that
    immediate suspension of activities is necessary to prevent a
    significant adverse effect on the environment or to preserve the
    safety of life and property at sea, the Administrator is
    authorized, notwithstanding any other requirement of this chapter,
    to issue an emergency order requiring any United States citizen who
    is engaged in exploration before June 28, 1980, to immediately
    suspend exploration activities. The issuance of such emergency
    order is subject to judicial review as provided in chapter 7 of
    title 5.
      (3) The timely filing of any application for a license under
    paragraph (1)(A) shall entitle the applicant to priority of right
    for the issuance of such license under section 1413(b) of this
    title. In any case in which more than one application referred to
    in paragraph (1) is filed based on exploration plans required by
    section 1413(a)(2) of this title which refer to all or part of the
    same deep seabed area, the Administrator shall, in taking action on
    such applications, apply principles of equity which take into
    consideration, among other things, the date on which the applicants
    or predecessors in interest, or component organizations thereof,
    commenced exploration activities and the continuity and extent of
    such exploration and amount of funds expended with respect to such
    exploration.
    (c) Interference
      No United States citizen may interfere or participate in
    interference with any activity conducted by any licensee or
    permittee which is authorized to be undertaken under a license or
    permit issued by the United States to the licensee or permittee
    under this chapter or with any activity conducted by the holder of,
    and authorized to be undertaken under, a license or permit or
    equivalent authorization issued by a reciprocating state for the
    exploration or commercial recovery of hard mineral resources.
    United States citizens shall exercise their rights on the high seas
    with reasonable regard for the interests of other states in their
    exercise of the freedoms of the high seas.

    Sec. 1412. Licenses for exploration and permits for commercial
      recovery

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authority to issue
      Subject to the provisions of this chapter, the Administrator
    shall issue to applicants who are eligible therefor licenses for
    exploration and permits for commercial recovery.
    (b) Nature of licenses and permits
      (1) A license or permit issued under this subchapter shall
    authorize the holder thereof to engage in exploration or commercial
    recovery, as the case may be, consistent with the provisions of
    this chapter, the regulations issued by the Administrator to
    implement the provisions of this chapter, and the specific terms,
    conditions, and restrictions applied to the license or permit by
    the Administrator.
      (2) Any license or permit issued under this subchapter shall be
    exclusive with respect to the holder thereof as against any other
    United States citizen or any citizen, national or governmental
    agency of, or any legal entity organized or existing under the laws
    of, any reciprocating state.
      (3) A valid existing license shall entitle the holder, if
    otherwise eligible under the provisions of this chapter and
    regulations issued under this chapter, to a permit for commercial
    recovery. Such a permit recognizes the right of the holder to
    recover hard mineral resources, and to own, transport, use, and
    sell hard mineral resources recovered, under the permit and in
    accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
      (4) In the event of interference with the exploration or
    commercial recovery activities of a licensee or permittee by
    nationals of other states, the Secretary of State shall use all
    peaceful means to resolve the controversy by negotiation,
    conciliation, arbitration, or resort to agreed tribunals.
    (c) Restrictions
      (1) The Administrator may not issue - 
        (A) any license or permit after the date on which an
      international agreement is ratified by and enters into force with
      respect to the United States, except to the extent that issuance
      of such license or permit is not inconsistent with such
      agreement;
        (B) any license or permit the exploration plan or recovery plan
      of which, submitted pursuant to section 1413(a)(2) of this title,
      would apply to an area to which applies, or would conflict with,
      (i) any exploration plan or recovery plan submitted with any
      pending application to which priority of right for issuance
      applies under section 1413(b) of this title, (ii) any exploration
      plan or recovery plan associated with any existing license or
      permit, or (iii) any equivalent authorization which has been
      issued, or for which formal notice of application has been
      submitted, by a reciprocating state prior to the filing date of
      any relevant application for licenses or permits pursuant to this
      subchapter;
        (C) a permit authorizing commercial recovery within any area of
      the deep seabed in which exploration is authorized under a valid
      existing license if such permit is issued to other than the
      licensee for such area;
        (D) any exploration license before July 1, 1981, or any permit
      which authorizes commercial recovery to commence before January
      1, 1988;
        (E) any license or permit the exploration plan or recovery plan
      for which applies to any area of the deep seabed if, within the 3-
      year period before the date of application for such license or
      permit, (i) the applicant therefor surrendered or relinquished
      such area under an exploration plan or recovery plan associated
      with a previous license or permit issued to such applicant, or
      (ii) a license or permit previously issued to the applicant had
      an exploration plan or recovery plan which applied to such area
      and such license or permit was revoked under section 1416 of this
      title; or
        (F) a license or permit, or approve the transfer of a license
      or permit, except to a United States citizen.

      (2) No permittee may use any vessel for the commercial recovery
    of hard mineral resources or for the processing at sea of hard
    mineral resources recovered under the permit issued to the
    permittee unless the vessel is documented under the laws of the
    United States.
      (3) Each permittee shall use at least one vessel documented under
    the laws of the United States for the transportation from each
    mining site of hard mineral resources recovered under the permit
    issued to the permittee.
      (4) For purposes of the shipping laws of the United States, any
    vessel documented under the laws of the United States and used in
    the commercial recovery, processing, or transportation from any
    mining site of hard mineral resources recovered under a permit
    issued under this subchapter shall be deemed to be used in, and
    used in an essential service in, the foreign commerce or foreign
    trade of the United States, as defined in section 109 of title 46,
    and shall be deemed to be a vessel as defined in section 53701(13)
    of title 46.
      (5) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the
    processing on land of hard mineral resources recovered pursuant to
    a permit shall be conducted within the United States: Provided,
    That the President does not determine that such restrictions
    contravene the overriding national interests of the United States.
    The Administrator may allow the processing of hard mineral
    resources at a place other than within the United States if he
    finds, after opportunity for an agency hearing, that - 
        (A) the processing of the quantity concerned of such resource
      at a place other than within the United States is necessary for
      the economic viability of the commercial recovery activities of a
      permittee; and
        (B) satisfactory assurances have been given by the permittee
      that such resource, after processing, to the extent of the
      permittee's ownership therein, will be returned to the United
      States for domestic use, if the Administrator so requires after
      determining that the national interest necessitates such return.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1413. License and permit applications, review, and
      certification

-STATUTE-
    (a) Applications
      (1) Any United States citizen may apply to the Administrator for
    the issuance or transfer of a license for exploration or a permit
    for commercial recovery.
      (2)(A) Applications for issuance or transfer of licenses for
    exploration and permits for commercial recovery shall be made in
    such form and manner as the Administrator shall prescribe in
    general and uniform regulations and shall contain such relevant
    financial, technical, and environmental information as the
    Administrator may by regulations require as being necessary and
    appropriate for carrying out the provisions of this subchapter. In
    accordance with such regulations, each applicant for the issuance
    of a license shall submit an exploration plan as described in
    subparagraph (B), and each applicant for a permit shall submit a
    recovery plan as described in subparagraph (C).
      (B) The exploration plan for a license shall set forth the
    activities proposed to be carried out during the period of the
    license, describe the area to be explored, and include the intended
    exploration schedule and methods to be used, the development and
    testing of systems for commercial recovery to take place under the
    terms of the license, an estimated schedule of expenditures,
    measures to protect the environment and to monitor the
    effectiveness of environmental safeguards and monitoring systems
    for commercial recovery, and such other information as is necessary
    and appropriate to carry out the provisions of this subchapter. The
    area set forth in an exploration plan shall be of sufficient size
    to allow for intensive exploration.
      (C) The recovery plan for a permit shall set forth the activities
    proposed to be carried out during the period of the permit, and
    shall include the intended schedule of commercial recovery,
    environmental safeguards and monitoring systems, details of the
    area or areas proposed for commercial recovery, a resource
    assessment thereof, the methods and technology to be used for
    commercial recovery and processing, the methods to be used for
    disposal of wastes from recovery and processing, and such other
    information as is necessary and appropriate to carry out the
    provisions of this subchapter.
      (D) The applicant shall select the size and location of the area
    of the exploration plan or recovery plan, which area shall be
    approved unless the Administrator finds that - 
        (i) the area is not a logical mining unit; or
        (ii) commercial recovery activities in the proposed location
      would result in a significant adverse impact on the quality of
      the environment which cannot be avoided by the imposition of
      reasonable restrictions.

      (E) For purposes of subparagraph (D), "logical mining unit" means
    - 
        (i) in the case of a license for exploration, an area of the
      deep seabed which can be explored under the license in an
      efficient, economical, and orderly manner with due regard for
      conservation and protection of the environment, taking into
      consideration the resource data, other relevant physical and
      environmental characteristics, and the state of the technology of
      the applicant as set forth in the exploration plan; or
        (ii) in the case of a permit, an area of the deep seabed - 
          (I) in which hard mineral resources can be recovered in
        sufficient quantities to satisfy the permittee's estimated
        production requirements over the initial 20-year term of the
        permit in an efficient, economical, and orderly manner with due
        regard for conservation and protection of the environment,
        taking into consideration the resource data, other relevant
        physical and environmental characteristics, and the state of
        the technology of the applicant set out in the recovery plan;
          (II) which is not larger than is necessary to satisfy the
        permittee's estimated production requirements over the initial
        20-year term of the permit; and
          (III) in relation to which the permittee's estimated
        production requirements are not found by the Administrator to
        be unreasonable.
    (b) Priority of right for issuance
      Subject to section 1411(b) of this title, priority of right for
    the issuance of licenses to applicants shall be established on the
    basis of the chronological order in which license applications
    which are in substantial compliance with the requirements
    established under subsection (a)(2) of this section are filed with
    the Administrator. Priority of right shall not be lost in the case
    of any application filed which is in substantial but not full
    compliance with such requirements if the applicant thereafter
    brings the application into conformity with such requirements
    within such reasonable period of time as the Administrator shall
    prescribe in regulations.
    (c) Eligibility for certification
      Before the Administrator may certify any application for issuance
    or transfer of a license for exploration or permit for commercial
    recovery, the Administrator must find in writing, after
    consultation with other departments and agencies pursuant to
    subsection (e) of this section, that - 
        (1) the applicant has demonstrated that, upon issuance or
      transfer of the license or permit, the applicant will be
      financially responsible to meet all obligations which may be
      required of a licensee or permittee to engage in the exploration
      or commercial recovery proposed in the application;
        (2) the applicant has demonstrated that, upon issuance or
      transfer of the license or permit, the applicant will have the
      technological capability to engage in such exploration or
      commercial recovery;
        (3) the applicant has satisfactorily fulfilled all obligations
      under any license or permit previously issued or transferred to
      the applicant under this chapter; and
        (4) the proposed exploration plan or recovery plan of the
      applicant meets the requirements of this chapter and the
      regulations issued under this chapter.
    (d) Antitrust review
      (1) Whenever the Administrator receives any application for
    issuance or transfer of a license for exploration or permit for
    commercial recovery, the Administrator shall transmit promptly a
    complete copy of such application to the Attorney General of the
    United States and the Federal Trade Commission.
      (2) The Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission shall
    conduct such antitrust review of the application as they deem
    appropriate and shall, if they deem appropriate, advise the
    Administrator of the likely effects of such issuance or transfer on
    competition.
      (3) The Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission may
    make any recommendations they deem advisable to avoid any action
    upon such application by the Administrator which would create or
    maintain a situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws. Such
    recommendations may include, without limitation, the denial of
    issuance or transfer of the license or permit or issuance or
    transfer upon such terms and conditions as may be appropriate.
      (4) Any advice or recommendation submitted by the Attorney
    General or the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to this subsection
    shall be submitted within 90 days after receipt by them of the
    application. The Administrator shall not issue or transfer the
    license or permit during that 90-day period, except upon written
    confirmation by the Attorney General and the Federal Trade
    Commission that neither intends to submit any further advice or
    recommendation with respect to the application.
      (5) If the Administrator decides to issue or transfer the license
    or permit with respect to which denial of the issuance or transfer
    of the license or permit has been recommended by the Attorney
    General or the Federal Trade Commission, or to issue or transfer
    the license or permit without imposing those terms and conditions
    recommended by the Attorney General or the Federal Trade Commission
    as appropriate to prevent any situation inconsistent with the
    antitrust laws, the Administrator shall, prior to or upon issuance
    or transfer of the license or permit, notify the Attorney General
    and the Federal Trade Commission of the reasons for such decision.
      (6) The issuance or transfer of a license or permit under this
    subchapter shall not be admissible in any way as a defense to any
    civil or criminal action for violation of the antitrust laws of the
    United States, nor shall it in any way modify or abridge any
    private right of action under such laws.
      (7) As used in this subsection, the term "antitrust laws" means
    the Act of July 2, 1890 (commonly known as the Sherman Act; 15
    U.S.C. 1-7); sections 73 through 76 of the Act of August 27, 1894
    (commonly known as the Wilson Tariff Act; 15 U.S.C. 8-11); the
    Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.); the Act of June 19, 1936
    (commonly known as the Robinson-Patman Price Discrimination Act; 15
    U.S.C. 13-13b and 21a); and the Federal Trade Commission Act (15
    U.S.C. 41 et seq.).
    (e) Other Federal agencies
      The Administrator shall provide by regulation for full
    consultation and cooperation, prior to certification of an
    application for the issuance or transfer of any license for
    exploration or permit for commercial recovery and prior to the
    issuance or transfer of such a license or permit, with other
    Federal agencies or departments which have programs or activities
    within their statutory responsibilities which would be affected by
    the activities proposed in the application for the issuance or
    transfer of a license or permit. Not later than 30 days after June
    28, 1980, the heads of any Federal departments or agencies having
    expertise concerning, or jurisdiction over, any aspect of the
    recovery or processing of hard mineral resources shall transmit to
    the Administrator written comments as to their expertise or
    statutory responsibilities pursuant to this chapter or any other
    Federal law. To the extent possible, such agencies shall cooperate
    to reduce the number of separate actions required to satisfy the
    statutory responsibilities of these agencies. The Administrator
    shall transmit to each such agency or department a complete copy of
    each application and each such agency or department, based on its
    legal responsibilities and authorities, may, not later than 60 days
    after receipt of the application, recommend certification of the
    application, issuance or transfer of the license or permit, or
    denial of such certification, issuance, or transfer. In any case in
    which an agency or department recommends such a denial, it shall
    set forth in detail the manner in which the application does not
    comply with any law or regulation within its area of responsibility
    and shall indicate how the application may be amended, or how
    terms, conditions, or restrictions might be added to the license or
    permit, to assure compliance with such law or regulation.
    (f) Review period
      All time periods for the review of an application for issuance or
    transfer of a license or permit established pursuant to this
    section shall, to the maximum extent practicable, run concurrently
    from the date on which the application is received by the
    Administrator.
    (g) Application certification
      Upon making the applicable determinations and findings required
    in sections 1411, 1412 of this title, and this section with respect
    to any applicant for the issuance or transfer of a license or a
    permit and the exploration or commercial recovery proposed by such
    applicant, after completion of procedures for receiving the
    application required by this chapter, and upon payment by the
    applicant of the fee required under section 1414 of this title, the
    Administrator shall certify the application for the issuance or
    transfer of the license or permit. The Administrator, to the
    maximum extent possible, shall endeavor to complete certification
    action on the application within 100 days after its submission. If
    final certification or denial of certification has not occurred
    within 100 days after submission of the application, the
    Administrator shall inform the applicant in writing of the then
    pending unresolved issues, the Administrator's efforts to resolve
    them, and an estimate of the time required to do so.

    Sec. 1415. License and permit terms, conditions, and restrictions;
      issuance and transfer of licenses and permits

-STATUTE-
    (a) Eligibility for issuance or transfer of license or permit
      Before issuing or transferring a license for exploration or
    permit for commercial recovery, the Administrator must find in
    writing, after consultation with interested departments and
    agencies pursuant to section 1413(e) of this title, and upon
    considering public comments received with respect to the license or
    permit, that the exploration or commercial recovery proposed in the
    application - 
        (1) will not unreasonably interfere with the exercise of the
      freedoms of the high seas by other states, as recognized under
      general principles of international law;
        (2) will not conflict with any international obligation of the
      United States established by any treaty or international
      convention in force with respect to the United States;
        (3) will not create a situation which may reasonably be
      expected to lead to a breach of international peace and security
      involving armed conflict;
        (4) cannot reasonably be expected to result in a significant
      adverse effect on the quality of the environment, taking into
      account the analyses and information in any applicable
      environmental impact statement prepared pursuant to section
      1419(c) or 1419(d) of this title; and
        (5) will not pose an inordinate threat to the safety of life
      and property at sea.
    (b) Issuance and transfer of licenses and permits with terms,
      conditions, and restrictions
      (1) Within 180 days after certification of any application for
    the issuance or transfer of a license or permit under section
    1413(g) of this title, the Administrator shall propose terms and
    conditions for, and restrictions on, the exploration or commercial
    recovery proposed in the application which are consistent with the
    provisions of this chapter and regulations issued under this
    chapter. If additional time is needed, the Administrator shall
    notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for the delay and
    indicate the approximate date on which the proposed terms,
    conditions, and restrictions will be completed. The Administrator
    shall provide to each applicant a written statement of the proposed
    terms, conditions, and restrictions. Such terms, conditions, and
    restrictions shall be generally specified in regulations with
    general criteria and standards to be used in establishing such
    terms, conditions, and restrictions for a license or permit and
    shall be uniform in all licenses or permits, except to the extent
    that differing physical and environmental conditions require the
    establishment of special terms, conditions, and restrictions for
    the conservation of natural resources, protection of the
    environment, or the safety of life and property at sea.
      (2) After preparation and consideration of the final
    environmental impact statement pursuant to section 1419(d) of this
    title on the proposed issuance of a license or permit and subject
    to the other provisions of this chapter, the Administrator shall
    issue to the applicant the license or permit with the terms,
    conditions, and restrictions incorporated therein.
      (3) The licensee or permittee to whom a license or permit is
    issued or transferred shall be deemed to have accepted the terms,
    conditions, and restrictions in the license or permit if the
    licensee or permittee does not notify the Administrator within 60
    days after receipt of the license or permit of each term,
    condition, or restriction with which the licensee or permittee
    takes exception. The licensee or permittee may, in addition to such
    objections as may be raised under applicable provisions of law,
    object to any term, condition, or restriction on the ground that
    the term, condition, or restriction is inconsistent with this
    chapter or the regulations promulgated thereunder. If, after the
    Administrator takes final action on these objections, the licensee
    or permittee demonstrates that a dispute remains on a material
    issue of fact, the licensee or permittee is entitled to a decision
    on the record after the opportunity for an agency hearing pursuant
    to sections 556 and 557 of title 5. Any such decision made by the
    Administrator shall be subject to judicial review as provided in
    chapter 7 of title 5.
    (c) Modification and revision of terms, conditions, and
      restrictions
      (1) After the issuance or transfer of any license or permit under
    subsection (b) of this section, the Administrator, after
    consultation with interested agencies and the licensee or
    permittee, may modify any term, condition, or restriction in such
    license or permit - 
        (A) to avoid unreasonable interference with the interests of
      other states in their exercise of the freedoms of the high seas,
      as recognized under general principles of international law;
        (B) if relevant data and other information (including, but not
      limited to, data resulting from exploration or commercial
      recovery activities under the license or permit) indicate that
      modification is required to protect the quality of the
      environment or to promote the safety of life and property at sea
      and if such modification is consistent with the regulations
      issued to carry out section 1419(b) of this title;
        (C) to avoid a conflict with any international obligation of
      the United States, established by any treaty or convention in
      force with respect to the United States, as determined in writing
      by the President; or
        (D) to avoid any situation which may reasonably be expected to
      lead to a breach of international peace and security involving
      armed conflict, as determined in writing by the President.

      (2) During the term of a license or a permit, the licensee or
    permittee may submit to the Administrator an application for a
    revision of the license or permit or the exploration plan or
    recovery plan associated with the license or permit. The
    Administrator shall approve such application upon a finding in
    writing that the revision will comply with the requirements of this
    chapter and the regulations issued under this chapter.
      (3) The Administrator shall establish, by regulation, guidelines
    for a determination of the scale or extent of a proposed
    modification or revision for which any or all license or permit
    application requirements and procedures, including a public
    hearing, shall apply. Any increase in the size of the area, or any
    change in the location of an area, to which an exploration plan or
    a recovery plan applies, except an incidental increase or change,
    must be made by application for another license or permit.
      (4) The procedures set forth in subsection (b)(3) of this section
    shall apply with respect to any modification under this subsection
    in the same manner, and to the same extent, as if such modification
    were an initial term, condition, or restriction proposed by the
    Administrator.
    (d) Prior consultations
      Prior to making a determination to issue, transfer, modify, or
    renew a license or permit under this section, the Administrator

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1416. Denial of certification of applications and of issuance,
      transfer, suspension, and revocation of licenses and permits;
      suspension and modification of activities

-STATUTE-
    (a) Denial, suspension, modification, and revocation
      (1) The Administrator may deny certification of an application
    for the issuance or transfer of, and may deny the issuance or
    transfer of, a license for exploration or permit for commercial
    recovery if the Administrator finds that the applicant, or the
    activities proposed to be undertaken by the applicant, do not meet
    the requirements set forth in section 1413(c) of this title,
    section 1415(a) of this title, or in any other provision of this
    chapter, or any regulation issued under this chapter, for the
    issuance or transfer of a license or permit.
      (2) The Administrator may - 
        (A) in addition to, or in lieu of, the imposition of any civil
      penalty under section 1462(a) of this title, or in addition to
      the imposition of any fine under section 1463 of this title,
      suspend or revoke any license or permit issued under this
      chapter, or suspend or modify any particular activities under
      such a license or permit, if the licensee or permittee, as the
      case may be, substantially fails to comply with any provision of
      this chapter, any regulation issued under this chapter, or any
      term, condition, or restriction of the license or permit; and
        (B) suspend or modify particular activities under any license
      or permit, if the President determines that such suspension or
      modification is necessary (i) to avoid any conflict with any
      international obligation of the United States established by any
      treaty or convention in force with respect to the United States,
      or (ii) to avoid any situation which may reasonably be expected
      to lead to a breach of international peace and security involving
      armed conflict.

      (3) No action may be taken by the Administrator to deny issuance
    or transfer of or to revoke any license or permit or, except as
    provided in subsection (c) of this section, to suspend any license
    or permit or suspend or modify particular activities under a
    license or permit, unless the Administrator - 
        (A) publishes in the Federal Register and gives the applicant,
      licensee, or permittee, as the case may be, written notice of the
      intention of the Administrator to deny the issuance or transfer
      of or to suspend, modify, or revoke the license or permit and the
      reason therefor; and
        (B) if the reason for the proposed denial, suspension,
      modification, or revocation is a deficiency which the applicant,
      licensee, or permittee can correct, affords the applicant,
      licensee, or permittee a reasonable time, but not more than 180
      days from the date of the notice or such longer period as the
      Administrator may establish for good cause shown, to correct such
      deficiency.

      (4) The Administrator shall deny issuance or transfer of, or
    suspend or revoke, any license or permit or order the suspension or
    modification of particular activities under a license or permit - 
        (A) on the thirtieth day after the date of the notice given to
      the applicant, licensee, or permittee under paragraph (3)(A)
      unless before such day the applicant, licensee, or permittee
      requests a review of the proposed denial, suspension,
      modification, or revocation; or
        (B) on the last day of the period established under paragraph
      (3)(B) in which the applicant, licensee, or permittee must
      correct a deficiency, if such correction has not been made before
      such day.
    (b) Administrative review of proposed denial, suspension,
      modification, or revocation
      Any applicant, licensee, or permittee, as the case may be, who
    makes a timely request under subsection (a) of this section for
    review of a denial of issuance or transfer, or a suspension or
    revocation, of a license for exploration or permit for commercial
    recovery, or a suspension or modification of particular activities
    under such a license or permit, is entitled to an adjudication on
    the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing with respect
    to such denial or suspension, revocation, or modification.
    (c) Effect on activities; emergency orders
      The issuance of any notice of proposed suspension or revocation
    of a license for exploration or permit for commercial recovery or
    proposed suspension or modification of particular activities under
    such a license or permit shall not affect the continuation of
    exploration or commercial recovery activities by the licensee or
    permittee. The provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection
    (a) of this section and the first sentence of this subsection shall
    not apply when the President determines by Executive order that an
    immediate suspension of a license for exploration or permit for
    commercial recovery, or immediate suspension or modification of
    particular activities under such a license or permit, is necessary
    for the reasons set forth in subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section,
    or the Administrator determines that an immediate suspension of
    such a license or permit, or immediate suspension or modification
    of particular activities under such a license or permit, is
    necessary to prevent a significant adverse effect on the
    environment or to preserve the safety of life and property at sea,
    and the Administrator issues an emergency order requiring such
    immediate suspension.
    (d) Judicial review
      Any determination of the Administrator, after any appropriate
    administrative review under subsection (b) of this section, to
    certify or deny certification of an application for the issuance or
    transfer of, or to issue, deny issuance of, transfer, deny the
    transfer of, modify, renew, suspend, or revoke any license for
    exploration or permit for commercial recovery, or suspend or modify
    particular activities under such a license or permit, or any
    immediate suspension of such a license or permit, or immediate
    suspension or modification of particular activities under such a
    license or permit, pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, is
    subject to judicial review as provided in chapter 7 of title 5.

    Sec. 1417. Duration of licenses and permits

-STATUTE-
    (a) Duration of a license
      Each license for exploration shall be issued for a period of 10
    years. If the licensee has substantially complied with the license
    and the exploration plan associated therewith and has requested
    extensions of the license, the Administrator shall extend the
    license on terms, conditions, and restrictions consistent with this
    chapter and the regulations issued under this chapter for periods
    of not more than 5 years each.
    (b) Duration of a permit
      Each permit for commercial recovery shall be issued for a term of
    20 years and for so long thereafter as hard mineral resources are
    recovered annually in commercial quantities from the area to which
    the recovery plan associated with the permit applies. The permit of
    any permittee who is not recovering hard mineral resources in
    commercial quantities at the end of 10 years shall be terminated;
    except that the Administrator shall for good cause shown, including
    force majeure, adverse economic conditions, unavoidable delays in
    construction, major unanticipated vessel repairs that prevent the
    permittee from conducting commercial recovery activities during an
    annual period, or other circumstances beyond the control of the
    permittee, extend the 10-year period, but not beyond the initial 20-
    year term of the permit.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1418. Diligence requirements

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      The exploration plan or recovery plan and the terms, conditions,
    and restrictions of each license and permit issued under this
    subchapter shall be designed to assure diligent development. Each
    licensee shall pursue diligently the activities described in the
    exploration plan of the licensee, and each permittee shall pursue
    diligently the activities described in the recovery plan of the
    permittee.
    (b) Expenditures
      Each license shall require such periodic reasonable expenditures
    for exploration by the licensee as the Administrator shall
    establish, taking into account the size of the area of the deep
    seabed to which the exploration plan associated with the license
    applies and the amount of funds which is estimated by the
    Administrator to be required for commercial recovery of hard
    mineral resources to begin within the time limit established by the
    Administrator. Such required expenditures shall not be established
    at a level which would discourage exploration by persons with less
    costly technology than is prevalently in use.
    (c) Commercial recovery
      Once commercial recovery is achieved, the Administrator shall,
    within reasonable limits and taking into consideration all relevant
    factors, require the permittee to maintain commercial recovery
    throughout the period of the permit; except that the Administrator
    shall for good cause shown, including force majeure, adverse
    economic conditions, or other circumstances beyond the control of
    the permittee, authorize the temporary suspension of commercial
    recovery activities. The duration of such a suspension shall not
    exceed one year at any one time, unless the Administrator
    determines that conditions justify an extension of the suspension.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1419. Protection of the environment

-STATUTE-
    (a) Environmental assessment
      (1) Deep ocean mining environmental study (DOMES)
        The Administrator shall expand and accelerate the program
      assessing the effects on the environment from exploration and
      commercial recovery activities, including seabased processing and
      the disposal at sea of processing wastes, so as to provide an
      assessment, as accurate as practicable, of environmental impacts
      of such activities for the implementation of subsections (b),
      (c), and (d) of this section.
      (2) Supporting ocean research
        The Administrator also shall conduct a continuing program of
      ocean research to support environmental assessment activity
      through the period of exploration and commercial recovery
      authorized by this chapter. The program shall include the
      development, acceleration, and expansion, as appropriate, of
      studies of the ecological, geological, and physical aspects of
      the deep seabed in general areas of the ocean where exploration
      and commercial development under the authority of this chapter
      are likely to occur, including, but not limited to - 
          (A) natural diversity of the deep seabed biota;
          (B) life histories of major benthic, midwater, and surface
        organisms most likely to be affected by commercial recovery
        activities;
          (C) long- and short-term effects of commercial recovery on
        the deep seabed biota; and
          (D) assessment of the effects of seabased processing
        activities.

      Within 160 days after June 28, 1980, the Administrator shall
      prepare a plan to carry out the program described in this
      subsection, including necessary funding levels for the next five
      fiscal years, and shall submit the plan to the Congress.
    (b) Terms, conditions, and restrictions
      Each license and permit issued under this subchapter shall
    contain such terms, conditions, and restrictions, established by
    the Administrator, which prescribe the actions the licensee or
    permittee shall take in the conduct of exploration and commercial
    recovery activities to assure protection of the environment. The
    Administrator shall require in all activities under new permits,
    and wherever practicable in activities under existing permits, the
    use of the best available technologies for the protection of
    safety, health, and the environment wherever such activities would
    have a significant effect on safety, health, or the environment,
    except where the Administrator determines that the incremental
    benefits are clearly insufficient to justify the incremental costs
    of using such technologies. Before establishing such terms,
    conditions, and restrictions, the Administrator shall consult with
    the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the
    Secretary of State, and the Secretary of the department in which
    the Coast Guard is operating, concerning such terms, conditions,
    and restrictions, and the Administrator shall take into account and
    give due consideration to the information contained in each final
    environmental impact statement prepared with respect to such
    license or permit pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.
    (c) Programmatic environmental impact statement
      (1) If the Administrator, in consultation with the Administrator
    of the Environmental Protection Agency and with the assistance of
    other appropriate Federal agencies, determines that a programmatic
    environmental impact statement is required, the Administrator
    shall, as soon as practicable after June 28, 1980, with respect to
    the areas of the oceans in which any United States citizen is
    expected to undertake exploration and commercial recovery under the
    authority of this chapter - 
        (A) prepare and publish draft programmatic environmental impact
      statements which assess the environmental impacts of exploration
      and commercial recovery in such areas;
        (B) afford all interested parties a reasonable time after such
      dates of publication to submit comments to the Administrator on
      such draft statements; and
        (C) thereafter prepare (giving full consideration to all
      comments submitted under subparagraph (B)) and publish final
      programmatic environmental impact statements regarding such
      areas.

      (2) With respect to the area of the oceans in which exploration
    and commercial recovery by any United States citizen will likely
    first occur under the authority of this chapter, the Administrator
    shall prepare a draft and final programmatic environmental impact
    statement as required under paragraph (1), except that - 
        (A) the draft programmatic environmental impact statement shall
      be prepared and published as soon as practicable but not later
      than 270 days (or such longer period as the Administrator may
      establish for good cause shown) after June 28, 1980; and
        (B) the final programmatic environmental impact statement shall
      be prepared and published within 180 days (or such longer period
      as the Administrator may establish for good cause shown) after
      the date on which the draft statement is published.
    (d) Environmental impact statements on issuance of licenses and
      permits
      The issuance of, but not the certification of an application for,
    any license or permit under this subchapter shall be deemed to be a
    major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the
    human environment for purposes of section 4332 of title 42. In
    preparing an environmental impact statement pursuant to this
    subsection, the Administrator shall consult with the agency heads
    referred to in subsection (b) of this section and shall take into
    account, and give due consideration to, the relevant information
    contained in any applicable studies and any other environmental
    impact statement prepared pursuant to this section. Each draft
    environmental impact statement prepared pursuant to this subsection
    shall be published, with the terms, conditions, and restrictions
    proposed pursuant to section 1415(b) of this title, within 180 days
    (or such longer period as the Administrator may establish for good
    cause shown in writing) following the date on which the application
    for the license or permit concerned is certified by the
    Administrator. Each final environmental impact statement shall be
    published 180 days (or such longer period as the Administrator may
    establish for good cause shown in writing) following the date on
    which the draft environmental impact statement is published.
    (e) Effect on other law
      For the purposes of this chapter, any vessel or other floating
    craft engaged in commercial recovery or exploration shall not be
    deemed to be "a vessel or other floating craft" under section
    502(12)(B) of the Clean Water Act [33 U.S.C. 1362(12)(B)] and any
    discharge of a pollutant from such vessel or other floating craft
    shall be subject to the Clean Water Act [33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.].
    (f) Stable reference areas
      (1) Within one year after June 28, 1980, the Secretary of State
    shall, in cooperation with the Administrator and as part of the
    international consultations pursuant to section 1428(f) of this
    title, negotiate with all nations that are identified in such
    subsection for the purpose of establishing international stable
    reference areas in which no mining shall take place: Provided,
    however, That this subsection shall not be construed as requiring
    any substantial withdrawal of deep seabed areas from deep seabed
    mining authorized by this chapter.
      (2) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as authorizing the
    United States to unilaterally establish such reference area or
    areas nor shall the United States recognize the unilateral claim to
    such reference area or areas by any State.
      (3) Within four years after June 28, 1980, the Secretary of State
    shall submit a report to Congress on the progress of establishing
    such stable reference areas, including the designation of
    appropriate zones to insure a representative and stable biota of
    the deep seabed.
      (4) For purposes of this section "stable reference areas" shall
    mean an area or areas of the deep seabed to be used as a reference
    zone or zones for purposes of resource evaluation and environmental
    assessment of deep seabed mining in which no mining will occur.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1420. Conservation of natural resources

-STATUTE-
      For the purpose of conservation of natural resources, each
    license and permit issued under this subchapter shall contain, as
    needed, terms, conditions, and restrictions which have due regard
    for the prevention of waste and the future opportunity for the
    commercial recovery of the unrecovered balance of the hard mineral
    resources in the area to which the license or permit applies. In
    establishing these terms, conditions, and restrictions, the
    Administrator shall consider the state of the technology, the
    processing system utilized and the value and potential use of any
    waste, the environmental effects of the exploration or commercial
    recovery activities, economic and resource data, and the national
    need for hard mineral resources. As used in this chapter, the term
    "conservation of natural resources" is not intended to grant,
    imply, or create any inference of production controls or price

      such extent, as the Administrator deems reasonable and necessary
      to assess the effectiveness of the terms, conditions, and
      restrictions of the license or permit, and (B) to report to the
      Administrator whenever such officers or employees have reason to
      believe there is a failure to comply with such terms, conditions,

        (2) to cooperate with such officers and employees in the
      performance of monitoring functions; and
        (3) to monitor the environmental effects of the exploration and
      commercial recovery activities in accordance with guidelines
      issued by the Administrator and to submit such information as the
      Administrator finds to be necessary and appropriate to assess
      environmental impacts and to develop and evaluate possible
      methods of mitigating adverse environmental effects.

    the transferee proposes to conduct meet the requirements of this
    chapter and regulations issued under this chapter.

      Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, any person
    may commence a civil action for equitable relief on that person's
    behalf in the United States District Court for the District of
    Columbia - 
        (1) against any person who is alleged to be in violation of any
      provision of this chapter or any condition of a license or permit
      issued under this subchapter; or
        (2) against the Administrator when there is alleged a failure
      of the Administrator to perform any act or duty under this
      chapter which is not discretionary,

    if the person bringing the action has a valid legal interest which
    is or may be adversely affected by such alleged violation or
    failure to perform. In suits brought under this subsection, the
    district court shall have jurisdiction, without regard to the
    amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to enforce
    the provisions of this chapter, or any term, condition, or
    restriction of a license or permit issued under this subchapter, or
    to order the Administrator to perform such act or duty.
    (b) Notice
      No civil action may be commenced - 
        (1) under subsection (a)(1) of this section - 
          (A) prior to 60 days after the plaintiff has given notice of
        the alleged violation to the Administrator and to any alleged
        violator; or
          (B) if the Administrator or the Attorney General has
        commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil or criminal
        action with respect to the alleged violation in a court of the
        United States; except that in any such civil action, any person
        having a valid legal interest which is or may be adversely
        affected by the alleged violation may intervene; or

        (2) under subsection (a)(2) of this section, prior to 60 days
      after the plaintiff has given notice of such action to the
      Administrator.

    Notice under this subsection shall be given in such a manner as the
    Administrator shall prescribe by regulation.
    (c) Costs and fees
      The court, in issuing any final order in any action brought under
    subsection (a) of this section, may award costs of litigation,
    including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees, to any party
    whenever the court determines that such an award is appropriate.
    (d) Relationship to other law
      Nothing in this section shall restrict the rights which any
    person or class of persons may have under other law to seek
    enforcement or to seek any other relief. All vessel safety and
    environmental requirements of or under this chapter shall be in
    addition to other requirements of law.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1428. Reciprocating states

-STATUTE-
    (a) Designation
      The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of State
    and the heads of other appropriate departments and agencies, may
    designate any foreign nation as a reciprocating state if the
    Secretary of State finds that such foreign nation - 
        (1) regulates the conduct of its citizens and other persons
      subject to its jurisdiction engaged in exploration for, and
      commercial recovery of, hard mineral resources of the deep seabed
      in a manner compatible with that provided in this chapter and the
      regulations issued under this chapter, which includes adequate
      measures for the protection of the environment, the conservation
      of natural resources, and the safety of life and property at sea,
      and includes effective enforcement provisions;
        (2) recognizes licenses and permits issued under this
      subchapter to the extent that such nation, under its laws, (A)
      prohibits any person from engaging in exploration or commercial
      recovery which conflicts with that authorized under any such
      license or permit and (B) complies with the date for issuance of
      licenses and the effective date for permits provided in section
      1412(c)(1)(D) of this title;
        (3) recognizes, under its procedures, priorities of right,
      consistent with those provided in this chapter and the
      regulations issued under this chapter, for applications for
      licenses for exploration or permits for commercial recovery,
      which applications are made either under its procedures or under
      this chapter; and
        (4) provides an interim legal framework for exploration and
      commercial recovery which does not unreasonably interfere with
      the interests of other states in their exercise of the freedoms
      of the high seas, as recognized under general principles of
      international law.
    (b) Effect of designation
      No license or permit shall be issued under this subchapter
    permitting any exploration or commercial recovery which will
    conflict with any license, permit, or equivalent authorization
    issued by any foreign nation which is designated as a reciprocating
    state under subsection (a) of this section.
    (c) Notification
      Upon receipt of any application for a license or permit under
    this subchapter, the Administrator shall immediately notify all
    reciprocating states of such application. The notification shall
    include those portions of the exploration plan or recovery plan
    submitted with respect to the application, or a summary thereof,
    and any other appropriate information not required to be withheld
    from public disclosure by section 1423(c) of this title.
    (d) Revocation of reciprocating state status
      The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of State
    and the heads of other appropriate departments and agencies, shall
    revoke the designation of a foreign nation as a reciprocating state
    if the Secretary of State finds that such foreign nation no longer
    complies with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section.
    At the request of any holder of a license, permit, or equivalent
    authorization of such foreign nation, who obtained the license,
    permit, or equivalent authorization while such foreign nation was a
    reciprocating state, the Administrator, in consultation with the
    Secretary of State, may decide to recognize the license, permit, or
    equivalent authorization for purposes of subsection (b) of this
    section.
    (e) Authorization
      The President is authorized to negotiate agreements with foreign
    nations necessary to implement this section.
    (f) International consultations
      The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of State
    and the heads of other appropriate departments and agencies, shall
    consult with foreign nations which enact, or are preparing to
    enact, domestic legislation establishing an interim legal framework
    for exploration and commercial recovery of hard mineral resources.
    Such consultations shall be carried out with a view to facilitating
    the designation of such nations as reciprocating states and, as
    necessary, the negotiation of agreements with foreign nations
    authorized by subsection (e) of this section. In addition, the
    Administrator shall provide such foreign nations with information
    on environmental impacts of exploration and commercial recovery
    activities, and shall provide any technical assistance requested in

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1441. Declaration of Congressional intent

-STATUTE-
      It is the intent of Congress - 
        (1) that any international agreement to which the United States
      becomes a party should, in addition to promoting other national
      oceans objectives - 
          (A) provide assured and nondiscriminatory access, under
        reasonable terms and conditions, to the hard mineral resources
        of the deep seabed for United States citizens, and
          (B) provide security of tenure by recognizing the rights of
        United States citizens who have undertaken exploration or
        commercial recovery under subchapter I of this chapter before
        such agreement enters into force with respect to the United
        States to continue their operations under terms, conditions,
        and restrictions which do not impose significant new economic
        burdens upon such citizens with respect to such operations with
        the effect of preventing the continuation of such operations on
        a viable economic basis;

        (2) that the extent to which any such international agreement
      conforms to the provisions of paragraph (1) should be determined
      by the totality of the provisions of such agreement, including,
      but not limited to, the practical implications for the security
      of investments of any discretionary powers granted to an
      international regulatory body, the structures and decisionmaking
      procedures of such body, the availability of impartial and
      effective procedures for the settlement of disputes, and any
      features that tend to discriminate against exploration and
      commercial recovery activities undertaken by United States
      citizens; and
        (3) that this chapter should be transitional pending - 
          (A) the adoption of an international agreement at the Third
        United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, and the
        entering into force of such agreement, or portions thereof,
        with respect to the United States, or
          (B) if such adoption is not forthcoming, the negotiation of a
        multilateral or other treaty concerning the deep seabed, and
        the entering into force of such treaty with respect to the
        United States.

    Sec. 1442. Effect of international agreement

-STATUTE-
      If an international agreement enters into force with respect to
    the United States, any provision of subchapter I of this chapter,
    this subchapter, or subchapter III of this chapter, and any
    regulation issued under any such provision, which is not
    inconsistent with such international agreement shall continue in
    effect with respect to United States citizens. In the
    implementation of such international agreement the Administrator,
    in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall make every
    effort, to the maximum extent practicable consistent with the
    provisions of that agreement, to provide for the continued
    operation of exploration and commercial recovery activities
    undertaken by United States citizens prior to entry into force of
    the agreement. The Administrator shall submit to the Congress,
    within one year after the date of such entry into force, a report
    on the actions taken by the Administrator under this section, which
    report shall include, but not be limited to - 
        (1) a description of the status of deep seabed mining
      operations of United States citizens under the international
      agreement; and
        (2) an assessment of whether United States citizens who were
      engaged in exploration or commercial recovery on the date such
      agreement entered into force have been permitted to continue
      their operations.

      license or permit issued under this chapter, to engage in a
      particular exploration or commercial recovery activity during the
      period such activity has been suspended under this chapter, or to
      fail to modify a particular exploration or commercial recovery
      activity for which modification was required under this chapter;
        (3) to refuse to permit any Federal officer or employee
      authorized to monitor or enforce the provisions of this chapter,

    Sec. 1462. Civil penalties

-STATUTE-
    (a) Assessment of penalty
      Any person subject to section 1461 of this title who is found by
    the Administrator, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing in
    accordance with section 554 of title 5, to have committed any act
    prohibited by section 1461 of this title shall be liable to the
    United States for a civil penalty. The amount of the civil penalty
    shall not exceed $25,000 for each violation. Each day of a
    continuing violation shall constitute a separate offense. The
    amount of such civil penalty shall be assessed by the Administrator
    by written notice. In determining the amount of such penalty, the
    Administrator shall take into account the nature, circumstances,
    extent, and gravity of the prohibited act committed and, with
    respect to the violator, any history of prior offenses, good faith
    demonstrated in attempting to achieve timely compliance after being
    cited for the violation, and such other matters as justice may
    require.
    (b) Review of civil penalty
      Any person subject to section 1461 of this title against whom a
    civil penalty is assessed under subsection (a) of this section may
    obtain review thereof in an appropriate district court of the
    United States by filing a notice of appeal in such court within 30
    days from the date of such order and by simultaneously sending a
    copy of such notice by certified mail to the Administrator. The
    Administrator shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of
    the record upon which the particular violation was found and such
    penalty was imposed, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. The
    findings and order of the Administrator shall be set aside by such
    court if they are not found to be supported by substantial
    evidence, as provided in section 706(2)(E) of title 5.
    (c) Action upon failure to pay assessment
      If any person subject to section 1461 of this title fails to pay
    a civil penalty assessed against such person after the penalty has
    become final, or after the appropriate court has entered final
    judgment in favor of the Administrator, the Administrator shall
    refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States, who
    shall recover the civil penalty assessed in any appropriate
    district court of the United States. In such action, the validity
    and appropriateness of the final order imposing the civil penalty
    shall not be subject to review.
    (d) Compromise or other action by the Administrator
      The Administrator may compromise, modify, or remit, with or
    without conditions, any civil penalty which is subject to
    imposition or which has been imposed under this section unless an
    action brought under subsection (b) or (c) of this section is
    pending in a court of the United States.

      violation of any provision of this chapter;
        (3) arrest any person subject to section 1461 of this title if
      the officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person has
      committed a criminal offense under section 1463 of this title;
        (4) seize any such vessel together with its gear, furniture,
      appurtenances, stores, and cargo, used or employed in, or with
      respect to which it reasonably appears that such vessel was used
      or employed in, the violation of any provision of this chapter if
      such seizure is necessary to prevent evasion of the enforcement
      of this chapter;
        (5) seize any hard mineral resource recovered or processed in
      violation of any provision of this chapter;
        (6) seize any other evidence related to any violation of any

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      Any vessel subject to the provisions of sections 1464 and 1465 of
    this title, including its gear, furniture, appurtenances, stores,
    and cargo, which is used, in any manner, in connection with or as a
    result of the commission of any act prohibited by section 1461 of
    this title and any hard mineral resource which is recovered,
    processed, or retained, in any manner, in connection with or as a
    result of the commission of any such act, shall be subject to
    forfeiture to the United States. All or part of such vessel, and
    all such hard mineral resources, may be forfeited to the United
    States pursuant to a civil proceeding under this section. All
    provisions of law relating to the seizure, judicial forfeiture, and
    condemnation of a vessel or cargo for violation of the customs
    laws, and the disposition of the vessel, cargo, or proceeds from
    the sale thereof and the remission or mitigation of such
    forfeitures shall apply to seizures and forfeitures incurred or
    alleged to have been incurred under the provisions of this section
    insofar as such provisions of law are applicable and not
    inconsistent with this chapter.
    (b) Jurisdiction of courts
      Any district court of the United States which has jurisdiction
    under section 1467 of this title shall have jurisdiction, upon
    application by the Attorney General on behalf of the United States,
    to order any forfeiture authorized under subsection (a) of this
    section and any action provided for under subsection (d) of this
    section.
    (c) Judgment
      If a judgment is entered for the United States in a civil
    forfeiture proceeding under this section, the Attorney General may
    seize any property or other interest declared forfeited to the
    United States which has not previously been seized pursuant to this
    chapter or for which security has not previously been obtained
    under subsection (d) of this section.
    (d) Procedure
      Any officer authorized to serve any process in rem which is
    issued by a court having jurisdiction under section 1467 of this
    title shall stay the execution of such process, or discharge any
    property seized pursuant to such process, upon the receipt of a
    satisfactory bond or other security from any person subject to
    section 1461 of this title claiming such property. Such bond or
    other security shall be conditioned upon such person (1) delivering
    such property to the appropriate court upon order thereof, without
    any impairment of its value; or (2) paying the monetary value of
    such property pursuant to any order of such court. Judgment shall
    be recoverable on such bond or other security against both the
    principal and any sureties in the event that any condition thereof
    is breached, as determined by such court.
    (e) Rebuttable presumption
      For purposes of this section, it shall be a rebuttable
    presumption that all hard mineral resources found on board a vessel
    subject to the provisions of sections 1464 and 1465 of this title
    which is seized in connection with an act prohibited by section
    1461 of this title were recovered, processed, or retained in
    violation of this chapter.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1472. Deep Seabed Revenue Sharing Trust Fund; establishment

-STATUTE-
    (a) Creation of Trust Fund
      There is established in the Treasury of the United States a trust
    fund to be known as the "Deep Seabed Revenue Sharing Trust Fund"
    (hereinafter in this section referred to as the "Trust Fund"),
    consisting of such amounts as may be appropriated or credited to
    the Trust Fund as provided in this section.
    (b) Transfer to Trust Fund of amounts equivalent to certain taxes
      (1) In general
        There are hereby appropriated to the Trust Fund amounts
      determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be equivalent to
      the amounts of the taxes received in the Treasury under section
      4495 (!1) of title 26.

      (2) Method of transfer
        The amounts appropriated by paragraph (1) shall be transferred
      at least quarterly from the general fund of the Treasury to the
      Trust Fund on the basis of estimates made by the Secretary of the
      Treasury of the amounts referred to in paragraph (1) received in
      the Treasury. Proper adjustments shall be made in the amounts
      subsequently transferred to the extent prior estimates were in
      excess of or less than the amount required to be transferred.
    (c) Management of Trust Fund
      (1) Report
        It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to hold
      the Trust Fund, and to report to the Congress for the fiscal year
      ending September 30, 1980, and each fiscal year thereafter on the
      financial condition and the results of the operations of the
      Trust Fund during the preceding year and on its expected
      condition and operations during the fiscal year and the next five
      fiscal years after the fiscal year. Such report shall be printed
      as a House document of the session of the Congress to which the
      report is made.
      (2) Investment
        (A) In general
          It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to
        invest such portion of the Trust Fund as is not, in his
        judgment, required to meet current withdrawals. Such
        investments may be made only in interest-bearing obligations of
        the United States. For such purpose, such obligations may be
        acquired (i) on original issue at the issue price, or (ii) by
        purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price.
        (B) Sale of obligations
          Any obligation acquired by the Trust Fund may be sold by the
        Secretary at the market price.
        (C) Interest on certain proceeds
          The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption
        of, any obligations held in the Trust Fund shall be credited to
        and form a part of the Trust Fund.
    (d) Expenditures from Trust Fund
      If an international deep seabed treaty is ratified by and in
    effect with respect to the United States on or before the date ten
    years after June 28, 1980, amounts in the Trust Fund shall be
    available, as provided by appropriations Acts, for making
    contributions required under such treaty for purposes of the
    sharing among nations of the revenues from deep seabed mining.
    Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to authorize any program
    or other activity not otherwise authorized by law.
    (e) Use of funds
      If an international deep seabed treaty is not in effect with
    respect to the United States on or before the date ten years after
    June 28, 1980, amounts in the Trust Fund shall be available for
    such purposes as Congress may hereafter provide by law.
    (f) International deep seabed treaty
      For purposes of this section, the term "international deep seabed
    treaty" has the meaning given to such term by section 4498(b) (!1)
    of title 26.

-STATUTE-
      The Congress finds that - 
        (1) domestic geothermal reserves can be developed into
      regionally significant energy sources promoting the economic
      health and national security of the Nation;
        (2) there are institutional and economic barriers to the
      commercialization of geothermal technology; and
        (3) Federal agencies should consider the use of geothermal
      energy in the Government's buildings.

    Sec. 1511. Loans for geothermal reservoir confirmation

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authorization; purposes
      The Secretary of Energy (hereafter in this chapter referred to as
    the "Secretary") is authorized to make a loan to any person, from
    funds appropriated (pursuant to this subchapter) to the Geothermal
    Resources Development Fund established under section 1144 of this
    title, to assist such person in undertaking and carrying out a
    project which (1) is designed to explore for or determine the
    economic viability of a geothermal reservoir and (2) consists of
    surface exploration and the drilling of one or more exploratory
    wells.
    (b) Repayment rates
      Subject to subsection (c) of this section and to section 1513(b)
    of this title, any loan under subsection (a) of this section shall
    be repayable out of revenue from production of the geothermal
    energy reservoir with respect to which the loan was made, at a
    rate, in any year, not to exceed 20 per centum of the gross revenue
    from the reservoir in that year; except that if any disposition of
    the geothermal rights to the reservoir is made to one or more other
    persons by the borrower, the full amount of the loan balance
    outstanding, or so much of the loan balance outstanding as is equal
    to the full amount of the compensation realized by the borrower
    upon such disposition, whichever is less, shall be repaid
    immediately. In any case where the reservoir is confirmed (as
    determined by the Secretary), the Secretary may impute a reasonable
    revenue for purposes of determining repayment if - 
        (1) reasonable efforts are not made to put such reservoir in
      commercial operation,
        (2) the borrower (or any such other person) utilizes the
      resources of the reservoir without a sale of the energy or
      geothermal energy resources therefrom, or
        (3) a sale of energy or geothermal energy resources from the
      reservoir is made for an unreasonably low price;

    except that no such imputation of revenue shall be made during the
    three-year period immediately following such reservoir
    confirmation. In the event of failure to begin production of
    revenue (or, where no sale of energy or geothermal energy resources
    is made, to begin production of energy for commercial use) within
    five years after the date of such reservoir confirmation, the
    Secretary may take action to recover the value, not to exceed the
    amount of the unpaid balance of the loan plus any accrued interest
    thereon, of any assets of the project in question, including
    resource rights.
    (c) Cancellation of unpaid balance and accrued interest
      The Secretary may at any time cancel the unpaid balance and any
    accrued interest on any loan made under this section if he
    determines, on the basis of evidence presented by the loan
    recipient or otherwise, that the geothermal energy reservoir with
    respect to which the loan was made has characteristics which make
    that reservoir economically or technically unacceptable for
    commercial development.
    (d) "Person" defined
      As used in this subchapter, the term "person" includes
    municipalities, electric cooperatives, industrial development
    agencies, nonprofit organizations, and Indian tribes, as well as
    the entities included within such term under section 1 of title 1.

    appropriate, except that no loan term shall exceed twenty years
    beyond the date on which production of energy or geothermal energy
    resources begins from the reservoir involved. If revenues are
    inadequate (as determined by the Secretary) to fully repay the
    principal and accrued interest within twenty years after production
    begins, any remaining unpaid amounts shall be forgiven.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authorization; requirements; scope
      If the report of the Secretary submitted pursuant to section 1521
    of this title affirmatively recommends the establishment of the
    program and the Congress by law (after review of such
    recommendation) specifically authorizes the establishment of the
    program, the Secretary shall establish and implement within six
    months after the date of the enactment of such authorization a
    program, in cooperation with the insurance and reinsurance
    industry, to provide reservoir insurance to qualified eligible
    applicants in accordance with this section.
    (b) Definitions
      For the purpose of this section - 
        (1) the term "investment" means the expenditure of, and any
      irrevocable legal obligation to expend, funds (together with the
      reasonable interest costs thereof) for the purchase or
      construction of machinery, equipment, and facilities
      manufactured, or for services contracted to be furnished, for the
      development and utilization of a geothermal resource in the
      United States to provide energy in the form of heat for direct
      use or for generation of electricity;
        (2) the term "geothermal resource" means a resource in the
      United States including (A) all products of geothermal processes
      embracing indigenous steam, hot water, and hot brines; (B) steam
      and other gases, hot water and hot brines resulting from water,
      gas, or other fluids artificially introduced into geothermal
      formations; (C) heat or other associated energy found in
      geothermal formations; and (D) any byproducts derived from them,
      where "byproduct" means any mineral or minerals (exclusive of
      oil, hydrocarbon gas, and helium) which are found in solution or
      in association with other geothermal resources and which have a
      value of less than 75 per centum of the value of the geothermal
      steam or are not, because of quantity, quality, or technical
      difficulties in extraction and production, of sufficient value to
      warrant extraction and production by themselves;
        (3) the term "risk" means the hazard that a reservoir of
      geothermal resources will cease to provide sufficient quantities
      of geothermal resources at minimum conditions required to
      maintain an economically or technically viable operation for
      utilization of the geothermal resource;
        (4) the term "reasonable premiums" means premium amounts
      determined by the Secretary to be reasonable in light of the
      amount of investment subject to the risk and premiums charged in
      similar or analogous situations by private insurers where private
      insurance is concerned and by insurers or guarantors, both public
      and private, where public insurance is concerned;
        (5) the term "other insurance" means any combination of private
      or public insurance other than investment insurance provided by
      the Secretary under this section;
        (6) the term "reservoir" means the physical subsurface geologic
      structure which forms the natural repository for the undisturbed
      geothermal resource; and
        (7) the term "person" means any public or private agency,
      institution, association, partnership, corporation, political
      subdivision, or other legal entity which is a United States
      citizen as determined by application of the test for United
      States citizenship contained in section 50501 of title 46, or in
      the first sentence of section 27A of the Merchant Marine Act,
      1920 (46 U.S.C. 883-1(a)-(e)).(!1)

    (c) Eligibility for investment insurance
      Any person with a total direct investment of not less than
    $1,000,000 in the development and use, not including exploration
    and testing, of a geothermal resource associated with a reservoir,
    and unable to obtain other insurance at reasonable premiums for the
    amount of the investment subject to risk, as determined by the
    Secretary under this section, shall be eligible for investment
    insurance.
    (d) Application for investment insurance; contents, etc.
      Any eligible person seeking investment insurance under this
    section shall file an application with the Secretary setting forth
    (1) the total amount of the contemplated investment in a geothermal
    resource and associated reservoir; (2) the views of the applicant
    concerning the nature and extent of the risk, including a geologic,
    engineering, and financial assessment based on site specific
    results of exploration and testing of the geothermal resource and
    the reservoir, stated with as much specificity as is possible; (3)
    the status of all required Federal, State, and local approvals,
    permits, and leases for the proposed development and utilization
    operations at the site; (4) the extent to which the applicant has
    been able to obtain other insurance against the risk; and (5) such
    other information as the Secretary may require.
    (e) Determinations respecting application for insurance
      Unless the Secretary determines the risk proposed by the
    applicant is unreasonable, the Secretary, within ninety days after
    receipt of a satisfactory application, shall determine in writing
    and submit to the applicant (1) the risk which may cause loss of
    investment for the applicant; (2) the total investment subject to
    the risk; (3) the amount of the other insurance which is available
    at reasonable premiums for the purpose of indemnifying the
    applicant against the risk; (4) the amount of investment insurance
    available pursuant to this section, which shall be the difference
    between the total investment subject to the risk and the total
    other insurance determined to be available at reasonable premiums,
    but not in excess of the lesser of 90 per centum of, or $50,000,000
    of, the loss of investment subject to the risk; and (5) any
    reasonable terms and conditions necessary for the prudent
    administration of the program, including reasonable premiums for
    the insurance pursuant to this section (which shall be deposited in
    the Geothermal Resources Development Fund).
    (f) Certificate of insurance; issuance, etc.
      The Secretary, within ninety days after making and submitting the
    determinations under subsection (e) of this section, and upon
    agreement of the applicant to such determinations, shall issue a
    certificate of insurance containing such terms and conditions as
    the Secretary shall specify, which shall not be transferrable
    without the express approval of the Secretary for good cause shown,
    and shall execute a contract with the applicant setting forth the
    terms and conditions of the investment insurance and such other
    provisions as may be necessary to protect the interests of the
    United States, including provisions with respect to the ownership,
    use, and disposition of any currency, credits, assets, or
    investments on account of which payment under such insurance is to
    be made and any right, title, claim, or course of action existing
    in relation thereto.
    (g) Compensation payable to holder of certificate of insurance;
      amount, etc.
      Any holder of a certificate of insurance pursuant to subsection
    (f) of this section who claims a loss of value of his investment by
    reason of the specified risk shall receive compensation, to the
    extent the Secretary determines that the holder is eligible to
    receive compensation pursuant to the certificate and the contract,
    in the amount of the loss incurred by the holder which is subject
    to insurance and for which the holder has not received and will not
    receive compensation from other insurance.
    (h) Withdrawal and payment of compensation
      Any compensation received by the holder shall be withdrawn from
    the Geothermal Resources Development Fund. The full faith and
    credit of the United States is hereby pledged to the payment of any
    compensation under this section.
    (i) Denial of insurance
      A person shall not be denied insurance pursuant to this section
    solely because such person is the recipient of other Federal
    assistance under this or any other Act.
    (j) Appropriations
      There may be appropriated to the Geothermal Resources Development
    Fund (established pursuant to section 1144 of this title), for
    purposes of this section, such amounts as are authorized for such
    purposes in the law referred to in subsection (a) of this section
    or in other legislation hereafter enacted.
    (k) Reinsurance agreements; procedures applicable; criteria; report
      to Congress
      The Secretary may enter into agreements to reinsure any private
    insurer for any risk associated with insurance for the development
    and utilization of a geothermal resource and associated reservoir,
    using the procedures set forth in subsections (c) through (i) of
    this section, to the extent that he deems it appropriate in order
    to provide an incentive for the participation of the private
    insurance industry in geothermal development; and he may also use
    any other available authority to obtain such participation. The
    Secretary shall submit a report to the Congress, within one year
    after the enactment of the law referred to in subsection (a) of
    this section, on the need for any additional authority to obtain
    such participation.

    Sec. 1601. Congressional statement of findings; "materials" defined

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Congress finds that - 
        (1) the availability of materials is essential for national
      security, economic well-being, and industrial production;
        (2) the availability of materials is affected by the stability
      of foreign sources of essential industrial materials, instability
      of materials markets, international competition and demand for
      materials, the need for energy and materials conservation, and
      the enhancement of environmental quality;
        (3) extraction, production, processing, use, recycling, and
      disposal of materials are closely linked with national concerns
      for energy and the environment;
        (4) the United States is strongly interdependent with other
      nations through international trade in materials and other
      products;
        (5) technological innovation and research and development are
      important factors which contribute to the availability and use of
      materials;
        (6) the United States lacks a coherent national materials
      policy and a coordinated program to assure the availability of
      materials critical for national economic well-being, national
      defense, and industrial production, including interstate commerce
      and foreign trade; and
        (7) notwithstanding the enactment of section 21a of this title,
      the United States does not have a coherent national materials and
      minerals policy.

      (b) As used in this chapter, the term "materials" means
    substances, including minerals, of current or potential use that
    will be needed to supply the industrial, military, and essential
    civilian needs of the United States in the production of goods or
    services, including those which are primarily imported or for which
    there is a prospect of shortages or uncertain supply, or which
    present opportunities in terms of new physical properties, use,
    recycling, disposal or substitution, with the exclusion of food and
    of energy fuels used as such.

    Sec. 1701. Congressional statement of findings and purposes

-STATUTE-
      (a) Congress finds that - 
        (1) the Secretary of the Interior should enforce effectively
      and uniformly existing regulations under the mineral leasing laws
      providing for the inspection of production activities on lease
      sites on Federal and Indian lands;
        (2) the system of accounting with respect to royalties and
      other payments due and owing on oil and gas produced from such
      lease sites is archaic and inadequate;
        (3) it is essential that the Secretary initiate procedures to
      improve methods of accounting for such royalties and payments and
      to provide for routine inspection of activities related to the
      production of oil and gas on such lease sites; and
        (4) the Secretary should aggressively carry out his trust
      responsibility in the administration of Indian oil and gas.

      (b) It is the purpose of this chapter - 
        (1) to clarify, reaffirm, expand, and define the
      responsibilities and obligations of lessees, operators, and other
      persons involved in transportation or sale of oil and gas from
      the Federal and Indian lands and the Outer Continental Shelf;
        (2) to clarify, reaffirm, expand and define the authorities and
      responsibilities of the Secretary of the Interior to implement
      and maintain a royalty management system for oil and gas leases
      on Federal lands, Indian lands, and the Outer Continental Shelf;
        (3) to require the development of enforcement practices that
      ensure the prompt and proper collection and disbursement of oil
      and gas revenues owed to the United States and Indian lessors and
      those inuring to the benefit of States;
        (4) to fulfill the trust responsibility of the United States
      for the administration of Indian oil and gas resources; and
        (5) to effectively utilize the capabilities of the States and
      Indian tribes in developing and maintaining an efficient and
      effective Federal royalty management system.

    timely manner.
    (b) Annual inspection of lease sites; training
      The Secretary shall - 
        (1) establish procedures to ensure that authorized and properly
      identified representatives of the Secretary will inspect at least

      significant quantities of oil or gas in any year or which has a
      history of noncompliance with applicable provisions of law or
      regulations; and
        (2) establish and maintain adequate programs providing for the
      training of all such authorized representatives in methods and

    enter into a contract or other arrangement with any independent
    certified public accountant to audit any lessee or operator where
    such lessee or operator is a primary audit client of such certified
    public accountant.

      (3) All books, accounts, financial records, reports, files, and
    other papers of the Secretary, or used by the Secretary, which are

-STATUTE-
    (a) Liability for royalty payments
      In order to increase receipts and achieve effective collections
    of royalty and other payments, a lessee who is required to make any
    royalty or other payment under a lease or under the mineral leasing
    laws, shall make such payments in the time and manner as may be
    specified by the Secretary or the applicable delegated State. A
    lessee may designate a person to make all or part of the payments
    due under a lease on the lessee's behalf and shall notify the
    Secretary or the applicable delegated State in writing of such
    designation, in which event said designated person may, in its own

      standards as the Secretary may prescribe by rule, taking into
      account the variety of circumstances at lease sites;
        (2) develop and comply with such minimum site security measures
      as the Secretary deems appropriate to protect oil or gas produced
      or stored on a lease site or on the Outer Continental Shelf from
      theft; and
        (3) not later than the 5th business day after any well begins
      production anywhere on a lease site or allocated to a lease site,
      or resumes production in the case of a well which has been off of
      production for more than 90 days, notify the Secretary, in the
      manner prescribed by the Secretary, of the date on which such
      production has begun or resumed.
    (c) Possession of documentation by transporters of oil or gas by
      motor vehicle or pipeline
      (1) Any person engaged in transporting by motor vehicle any oil
    from any lease site, or allocated to any such lease site, shall

      Any person who -

    each day such violation continues.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Charge on late royalty payment or royalty payment deficiency
      In the case of oil and gas leases where royalty payments are not
    received by the Secretary on the date that such payments are due,
    or are less than the amount due, the Secretary shall charge
    interest on such late payments or underpayments at the rate
    applicable under section 6621 of title 26. In the case of an
    underpayment or partial payment, interest shall be computed and
    charged only on the amount of the deficiency and not on the total
    amount due.
    (b) Charge on late payment made by Secretary to States
      Any payment made by the Secretary to a State under section 191 of
    this title and any other payment made by the Secretary to a State
    from any oil or gas royalty received by the Secretary which is not
    paid on the date required under section 191 of this title shall
    include an interest charge computed at the rate applicable under
    section 6621 of title 26.
    (c) Deposit in royalty accounts of charges on royalties due and
      owing Indians
      All interest charges collected under this chapter or under other
    applicable laws because of nonpayment, late payment or underpayment
    of royalties due and owing an Indian tribe or an Indian allottee
    shall be deposited to the same account as the royalty with respect
    to which such interest is paid.
    (d) Charge on late deposit of royalty fund to an Indian account
      Any deposit of royalty funds made by the Secretary to an Indian
    account which is not made by the date required under section 1714
    of this title shall include an interest charge computed at the rate
    applicable under section 6621 of title 26.
    (e) Nonliability of States for Secretary's failure to comply with
      the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 or regulations
      thereunder
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no State will be
    assessed for any interest or penalties found to be due against the
    Secretary for failure to comply with the Emergency Petroleum
    Allocation Act of 1973 [15 U.S.C. 751 et seq.] or regulation of the
    Secretary of Energy thereunder concerning crude oil certification
    or pricing with respect to crude oil taken by the Secretary in kind
    as royalty. Any State share of an overcharge, resulting from such
    failure to comply, shall be assessed against moneys found to be due
    and owing to such State as a result of audits of royalty accounts
    for transactions which took place prior to January 12, 1983, except
    that if after the completion of such audits, sufficient moneys have
    not been found due and owing to any State, the State shall be
    assessed the balance of that State's share of the overcharge.
    (f) Limitation on interest charged
      Interest shall be charged under this section only for the number
    of days a payment is late.
    (g) Omitted
    (h) Lessee or designee interest
      Interest shall be allowed and paid or credited on any
    overpayment, with such interest to accrue from the date such
    overpayment was made, at the rate obtained by applying the
    provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 6621(a)(1) of
    title 26, but determined without regard to the sentence following
    subparagraph (B) of section 6621(a)(1). Interest which has accrued
    on any overpayment may be applied to reduce an underpayment. This
    subsection applies to overpayments made later than six months after
    August 13, 1996, or September 1, 1996, whichever is later. Such
    interest shall be paid from amounts received as current receipts
    from sales, bonuses, royalties (including interest charges
    collected under this section) and rentals of the public lands and
    the Outer Continental Shelf under the provisions of the Mineral
    Leasing Act [30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.], and the Outer Continental
    Shelf Lands Act [43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.], which are not payable to
    a State or the Reclamation Fund. The portion of any such interest
    payment attributable to any amounts previously disbursed to a
    State, the Reclamation Fund, or any other recipient designated by
    law shall be deducted from the next disbursements to that recipient
    made under the applicable law. Such amounts deducted from
    subsequent disbursements shall be credited to miscellaneous
    receipts in the Treasury.
    (i) Limitation on interest
      Upon a determination by the Secretary that an excessive
    overpayment (based upon all obligations of a lessee or its designee
    for a given reporting month) was made for the sole purpose of
    receiving interest, interest shall not be paid on the excessive
    amount of such overpayment. For purposes of this chapter, an
    "excessive overpayment" shall be the amount that any overpayment a
    lessee or its designee pays for a given reporting month (excluding
    payments for demands for obligations determined to be due as a
    result of judicial or administrative proceedings or agreed to be
    paid pursuant to settlement agreements) for the aggregate of all of
    its Federal leases exceeds 10 percent of the total royalties paid
    that month for those leases.
    (j) Estimated payment
      A lessee or its designee may make a payment for the approximate
    amount of royalties (hereinafter in this subsection "estimated
    payment") that would otherwise be due for such lease by the date
    royalties are due for that lease. When an estimated payment is
    made, actual royalties are payable at the end of the month
    following the month in which the estimated payment is made. If the
    estimated payment was less than the amount of actual royalties due,
    interest is owed on the underpaid amount. If the estimated payment
    exceeds the actual royalties due, interest is owed on the
    overpayment. If the lessee or its designee makes a payment for such
    actual royalties, the lessee or its designee may apply the
    estimated payment to future royalties. Any estimated payment may be
    adjusted, recouped, or reinstated at any time by the lessee or its
    designee.
    (k) Volume allocation of oil and gas production
      (1) Except as otherwise provided by this subsection - 
        (A) a lessee or its designee of a lease in a unit or
      communitization agreement which contains only Federal leases with
      the same royalty rate and funds distribution shall report and pay
      royalties on oil and gas production for each production month
      based on the actual volume of production sold by or on behalf of
      that lessee;
        (B) a lessee or its designee of a lease in any other unit or
      communitization agreement shall report and pay royalties on oil
      and gas production for each production month based on the volume
      of oil and gas produced from such agreement and allocated to the
      lease in accordance with the terms of the agreement; and
        (C) a lessee or its designee of a lease that is not contained
      in a unit or communitization agreement shall report and pay
      royalties on oil and gas production for each production month
      based on the actual volume of production sold by or on behalf of
      that lessee.

      (2) This subsection applies only to requirements for reporting
    and paying royalties. Nothing in this subsection is intended to
    alter a lessee's liability for royalties on oil or gas production
    based on the share of production allocated to the lease in
    accordance with the terms of the lease, a unit or communitization
    agreement, or any other agreement.
      (3) For any unit or communitization agreement if all lessees
    contractually agree to an alternative method of royalty reporting
    and payment, the lessees may submit such alternative method to the
    Secretary or the delegated State for approval and make payments in
    accordance with such approved alternative method so long as such
    alternative method does not reduce the amount of the royalty
    obligation.
      (4) The Secretary or the delegated State shall grant an exception
    from the reporting and payment requirements for marginal properties
    by allowing for any calendar year or portion thereof royalties to
    be paid each month based on the volume of production sold. Interest
    shall not accrue on the difference for the entire calendar year or
    portion thereof between the amount of oil and gas actually sold and
    the share of production allocated to the lease until the beginning
    of the month following such calendar year or portion thereof. Any
    additional royalties due or overpaid royalties and associated
    interest shall be paid, refunded, or credited within six months
    after the end of each calendar year in which royalties are paid
    based on volumes of production sold. For the purpose of this
    subsection, the term "marginal property" means a lease that
    produces on average the combined equivalent of less than 15 barrels
    of oil per well per day or 90 thousand cubic feet of gas per well
    per day, or a combination thereof, determined by dividing the
    average daily production of crude oil and natural gas from
    producing wells on such lease by the number of such wells, unless
    the Secretary, together with the State concerned, determines that a
    different production is more appropriate.
      (5) Not later than two years after August 13, 1996, the Secretary
    shall issue any appropriate demand for all outstanding royalty
    payment disputes regarding who is required to report and pay
    royalties on production from units and communitization agreements
    outstanding on August 13, 1996, and collect royalty amounts owed on
    such production.
    (l) Production allocation
      The Secretary shall issue all determinations of allocations of
    production for units and communitization agreements within 120 days
    of a request for determination. If the Secretary fails to issue a
    determination within such 120-day period, the Secretary shall waive
    interest due on obligations subject to the determination until the
    end of the month following the month in which the determination is
    made.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1721a. Adjustments and refunds

-STATUTE-
    (a) Adjustments to royalties paid to Secretary or a delegated State
      (1) If, during the adjustment period, a lessee or its designee
    determines that an adjustment or refund request is necessary to
    correct an underpayment or overpayment of an obligation, the lessee
    or its designee shall make such adjustment or request a refund
    within a reasonable period of time and only during the adjustment
    period. The filing of a royalty report which reflects the
    underpayment or overpayment of an obligation shall constitute prior
    written notice to the Secretary or the applicable delegated State
    of an adjustment.
      (2)(A) For any adjustment, the lessee or its designee shall
    calculate and report the interest due attributable to such
    adjustment at the same time the lessee or its designee adjusts the
    principle (!1) amount of the subject obligation, except as provided
    by subparagraph (B).

      (B) In the case of a lessee or its designee who determines that
    subparagraph (A) would impose a hardship, the Secretary or such
    delegated State shall calculate the interest due and notify the
    lessee or its designee within a reasonable time of the amount of
    interest due, unless such lessee or its designee elects to
    calculate and report interest in accordance with subparagraph (A).
      (3) An adjustment or a request for a refund for an obligation may
    be made after the adjustment period only upon written notice to and
    approval by the Secretary or the applicable delegated State, as
    appropriate, during an audit of the period which includes the
    production month for which the adjustment is being made. If an
    overpayment is identified during an audit, then the Secretary or
    the applicable delegated State, as appropriate, shall allow a
    credit or refund in the amount of the overpayment.
      (4) For purposes of this section, the adjustment period for any
    obligation shall be the six-year period following the date on which
    an obligation became due. The adjustment period shall be suspended,
    tolled, extended, enlarged, or terminated by the same actions as
    the limitation period in section 1724 of this title.
    (b) Refunds
      (1) In general
        A request for refund is sufficient if it - 
          (A) is made in writing to the Secretary and, for purposes of
        section 1724 of this title, is specifically identified as a
        demand;
          (B) identifies the person entitled to such refund;
          (C) provides the Secretary information that reasonably
        enables the Secretary to identify the overpayment for which
        such refund is sought; and
          (D) provides the reasons why the payment was an overpayment.
      (2) Payment by Secretary of the Treasury
        The Secretary shall certify the amount of the refund to be paid
      under paragraph (1) to the Secretary of the Treasury who shall
      make such refund. Such refund shall be paid from amounts received
      as current receipts from sales, bonuses, royalties (including
      interest charges collected under this section) and rentals of the
      public lands and the Outer Continental Shelf under the provisions
      of the Mineral Leasing Act [30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.] and the Outer
      Continental Shelf Lands Act [43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.], which are
      not payable to a State or the Reclamation Fund. The portion of
      any such refund attributable to any amounts previously disbursed
      to a State, the Reclamation Fund, or any recipient prescribed by
      law shall be deducted from the next disbursements to that
      recipient made under the applicable law. Such amounts deducted
      from subsequent disbursements shall be credited to miscellaneous
      receipts in the Treasury.
      (3) Payment period
        A refund under this subsection shall be paid or denied (with an
      explanation of the reasons for the denial) within 120 days of the
      date on which the request for refund is received by the
      Secretary. Such refund shall be subject to later audit by the
      Secretary or the applicable delegated State and subject to the
      provisions of this chapter.
      (4) Prohibition against reduction of refunds or credits
        In no event shall the Secretary or any delegated State directly
      or indirectly claim or offset any amount or amounts against, or
      reduce any refund or credit (or interest accrued thereon) by the
      amount of any obligation the enforcement of which is barred by
      section 1724 of this title.

      periods

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      The respective duties, responsibilities, and activities with
    respect to a lease shall be performed by the Secretary, delegated
    States, and lessees or their designees in a timely manner.
    (b) Limitation period
      (1) In general
        A judicial proceeding or demand which arises from, or relates
      to an obligation, shall be commenced within seven years from the
      date on which the obligation becomes due and if not so commenced
      shall be barred. If commencement of a judicial proceeding or
      demand for an obligation is barred by this section, the
      Secretary, a delegated State, or a lessee or its designee (A)
      shall not take any other or further action regarding that
      obligation, including (but not limited to) the issuance of any
      order, request, demand or other communication seeking any
      document, accounting, determination, calculation, recalculation,
      payment, principal, interest, assessment, or penalty or the
      initiation, pursuit or completion of an audit with respect to
      that obligation; and (B) shall not pursue any other equitable or
      legal remedy, whether under statute or common law, with respect
      to an action on or an enforcement of said obligation.
      (2) Rule of construction
        A judicial proceeding or demand that is timely commenced under
      paragraph (1) against a designee shall be considered timely
      commenced as to any lessee who is liable pursuant to section
      1712(a) of this title for the obligation that is the subject of
      the judicial proceeding or demand.
      (3) Application of certain limitations
        The limitations set forth in sections 2401, 2415, 2416, and
      2462 of title 28 and section 226-2 of this title shall not apply
      to any obligation to which this chapter applies. Section 3716 of
      title 31 may be applied to an obligation the enforcement of which
      is not barred by this chapter, but may not be applied to any
      obligation the enforcement of which is barred by this chapter.
    (c) Obligation becomes due
      (1) In general
        For purposes of this chapter, an obligation becomes due when
      the right to enforce the obligation is fixed.
      (2) Royalty obligations
        The right to enforce any royalty obligation for any given
      production month for a lease is fixed for purposes of this
      chapter on the last day of the calendar month following the month
      in which oil or gas is produced.
    (d) Tolling of limitation period
      The running of the limitation period under subsection (b) of this
    section shall not be suspended, tolled, extended, or enlarged for
    any obligation for any reason by any action, including an action by
    the Secretary or a delegated State, other than the following:
      (1) Tolling agreement
        A written agreement executed during the limitation period
      between the Secretary or a delegated State and a lessee or its
      designee (with notice to the lessee who designated the designee)
      shall toll the limitation period for the amount of time during
      which the agreement is in effect.
      (2) Subpoena
        (A) The issuance of a subpoena to a lessee or its designee
      (with notice to the lessee who designated the designee, which
      notice shall not constitute a subpoena to the lessee) in
      accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (B)(i) shall toll
      the limitation period with respect to the obligation which is the
      subject of a subpoena only for the period beginning on the date
      the lessee or its designee receives the subpoena and ending on
      the date on which (i) the lessee or its designee has produced
      such subpoenaed records for the subject obligation, (ii) the
      Secretary or a delegated State receives written notice that the
      subpoenaed records for the subject obligation are not in
      existence or are not in the lessee's or its designee's possession
      or control, or (iii) a court has determined in a final decision
      that such records are not required to be produced, whichever
      occurs first.
        (B)(i) A subpoena for the purposes of this section which
      requires a lessee or its designee to produce records necessary to
      determine the proper reporting and payment of an obligation due
      the Secretary may be issued only by an Assistant Secretary of the
      Interior or an Acting Assistant Secretary of the Interior who is
      a schedule C employee (as defined by section 213.3301 of title 5,
      Code of Federal Regulations), or the Director or Acting Director
      of the respective bureau or agency, and may not be delegated to
      any other person. If a State has been delegated authority
      pursuant to section 1735 of this title, the State, acting through
      the highest State official having ultimate authority over the
      collection of royalties from leases on Federal lands within the
      State, may issue such subpoena, but may not delegate such
      authority to any other person.
        (ii) A subpoena described in clause (i) may only be issued
      against a lessee or its designee during the limitation period
      provided in this section and only after the Secretary or a
      delegated State has in writing requested the records from the
      lessee or its designee related to the obligation which is the
      subject of the subpoena and has determined that - 
          (I) the lessee or its designee has failed to respond within a
        reasonable period of time to the Secretary's or the applicable
        delegated State's written request for such records necessary
        for an audit, investigation or other inquiry made in accordance
        with the Secretary's or such delegated State's responsibilities
        under this chapter; or
          (II) the lessee or its designee has in writing denied the
        Secretary's or the applicable delegated State's written request
        to produce such records in the lessee's or its designee's
        possession or control necessary for an audit, investigation or
        other inquiry made in accordance with the Secretary's or such
        delegated State's responsibilities under this chapter; or
          (III) the lessee or its designee has unreasonably delayed in
        producing records necessary for an audit, investigation or
        other inquiry made in accordance with the Secretary's or the
        applicable delegated State's responsibilities under this
        chapter after the Secretary's or delegated State's written
        request.

        (C) In seeking records, the Secretary or the applicable
      delegated State shall afford the lessee or its designee a
      reasonable period of time after a written request by the
      Secretary or such delegated State in which to provide such
      records prior to the issuance of any subpoena.
      (3) Misrepresentation or concealment
        The intentional misrepresentation or concealment of a material
      fact for the purpose of evading the payment of an obligation in
      which case the limitation period shall be tolled for the period
      of such misrepresentation or such concealment.
      (4) Order to perform restructured accounting
        (A)(i) The issuance of a notice under subparagraph (D) that the
      lessee or its designee has not substantially complied with the
      requirement to perform a restructured accounting shall toll the
      limitation period with respect to the obligation which is the
      subject of the notice only for the period beginning on the date
      the lessee or its designee receives the notice and ending 120
      days after the date on which (I) the Secretary or the applicable
      delegated State receives written notice that the accounting or
      other requirement has been performed, or (II) a court has
      determined in a final decision that the lessee is not required to
      perform the accounting, whichever occurs first.
        (ii) If the lessee or its designee initiates an administrative
      appeal or judicial proceeding to contest an order to perform a
      restructured accounting issued under subparagraph (B)(i), the
      limitation period in subsection (b) of this section shall be
      tolled from the date the lessee or its designee received the
      order until a final, nonappealable decision is issued in any such
      proceeding.
        (B)(i) The Secretary or the applicable delegated State may
      issue an order to perform a restructured accounting to a lessee
      or its designee when the Secretary or such delegated State
      determines during an audit of a lessee or its designee that the
      lessee or its designee should recalculate royalty due on an
      obligation based upon the Secretary's or the delegated State's
      finding that the lessee or its designee has made identified
      underpayments or overpayments which are demonstrated by the
      Secretary or the delegated State to be based upon repeated,
      systemic reporting errors for a significant number of leases or a
      single lease for a significant number of reporting months with
      the same type of error which constitutes a pattern of violations
      and which are likely to result in either significant
      underpayments or overpayments.
        (ii) The power of the Secretary to issue an order to perform a
      restructured accounting may not be delegated below the most
      senior career professional position having responsibility for the
      royalty management program, which position is currently
      designated as the "Associate Director for Royalty Management",
      and may not be delegated to any other person. If a State has been
      delegated authority pursuant to section 1735 of this title, the
      State, acting through the highest ranking State official having
      ultimate authority over the collection of royalties from leases
      on Federal lands within the State, may issue such order to
      perform, which may not be delegated to any other person. An order
      to perform a restructured accounting shall - 
          (I) be issued within a reasonable period of time from when
        the audit identifies the systemic, reporting errors;
          (II) specify the reasons and factual bases for such order;
          (III) be specifically identified as an "order to perform a
        restructured accounting";
          (IV) provide the lessee or its designee a reasonable period
        of time (but not less than 60 days) within which to perform the
        restructured accounting; and
          (V) provide the lessee or its designee 60 days within which
        to file an administrative appeal of the order to perform a
        restructured accounting.

        (C) An order to perform a restructured accounting shall not
      mean or be construed to include any other action by or on behalf
      of the Secretary or a delegated State.
        (D) If a lessee or its designee fails to substantially comply
      with the requirement to perform a restructured accounting
      pursuant to this subsection, a notice shall be issued to the
      lessee or its designee that the lessee or its designee has not
      substantially complied with the requirements to perform a
      restructured accounting. A lessee or its designee shall be given
      a reasonable time within which to perform the restructured
      accounting. Such notice may be issued under this section only by
      an Assistant Secretary of the Interior or an acting Assistant
      Secretary of the Interior who is a schedule C employee (as
      defined by section 213.3301 of title 5, Code of Federal
      Regulations) and may not be delegated to any other person. If a
      State has been delegated authority pursuant to section 1735 of
      this title, the State, acting through the highest State official
      having ultimate authority over the collection of royalties from
      leases on Federal lands within the State, may issue such notice,
      which may not be delegated to any other person.
    (e) Termination of limitations period
      An action or an enforcement of an obligation by the Secretary or
    delegated State or a lessee or its designee shall be barred under
    this section prior to the running of the seven-year period provided
    in subsection (b) of this section in the event - 
        (1) the Secretary or a delegated State has notified the lessee
      or its designee in writing that a time period is closed to
      further audit; or
        (2) the Secretary or a delegated State and a lessee or its
      designee have so agreed in writing.

    For purposes of this subsection, notice to, or an agreement by, the
    designee shall be binding on any lessee who is liable pursuant to
    section 1712(a) of this title for obligations that are the subject
    of the notice or agreement.
    (f) Records required for determining collections
      Records required pursuant to section 1713 of this title by the
    Secretary or any delegated State for the purpose of determining
    obligations due and compliance with any applicable mineral leasing
    law, lease provision, regulation or order with respect to oil and
    gas leases from Federal lands or the Outer Continental Shelf shall
    be maintained for the same period of time during which a judicial
    proceeding or demand may be commenced under subsection (b) of this
    section. If a judicial proceeding or demand is timely commenced,
    the record holder shall maintain such records until the final
    nonappealable decision in such judicial proceeding is made, or with
    respect to that demand is rendered, unless the Secretary or the
    applicable delegated State authorizes in writing an earlier release
    of the requirement to maintain such records. Notwithstanding
    anything herein to the contrary, under no circumstance shall a
    record holder be required to maintain or produce any record
    relating to an obligation for any time period which is barred by
    the applicable limitation in this section. In connection with any
    hearing, administrative proceeding, inquiry, investigation, or
    audit by the Secretary or a delegated State under this chapter, the
    Secretary or the delegated State shall minimize the submission of
    multiple or redundant information and make a good faith effort to
    locate records previously submitted by a lessee or a designee to
    the Secretary or the delegated State, prior to requiring the lessee
    or the designee to provide such records.
    (g) Timely collections
      In order to most effectively utilize resources available to the
    Secretary to maximize the collection of oil and gas receipts from
    lease obligations to the Treasury within the seven-year period of
    limitations, and consequently to maximize the State share of such
    receipts, the Secretary should not perform or require accounting,
    reporting, or audit activities if the Secretary and the State
    concerned determine that the cost of conducting or requiring the
    activity exceeds the expected amount to be collected by the
    activity, based on the most current 12 months of activity. This
    subsection shall not provide a defense to a demand or an order to
    perform a restructured accounting. To the maximum extent possible,
    the Secretary and delegated States shall reduce costs to the United
    States Treasury and the States by discontinuing requirements for
    unnecessary or duplicative data and other information, such as
    separate allowances and payor information, relating to obligations
    due. If the Secretary and the State concerned determine that
    collection will result sooner, the Secretary or the applicable
    delegated State may waive or forego interest in whole or in part.
    (h) Appeals and final agency action
      (1) 33-month period
        Demands or orders issued by the Secretary or a delegated State
      are subject to administrative appeal in accordance with the
      regulations of the Secretary. No State shall impose any
      conditions which would hinder a lessee's or its designee's
      immediate appeal of an order to the Secretary or the Secretary's
      designee. The Secretary shall issue a final decision in any
      administrative proceeding, including any administrative
      proceedings pending on August 13, 1996, within 33 months from the
      date such proceeding was commenced or 33 months from August 13,
      1996, whichever is later. The 33-month period may be extended by
      any period of time agreed upon in writing by the Secretary and
      the appellant.
      (2) Effect of failure to issue decision
        If no such decision has been issued by the Secretary within the
      33-month period referred to in paragraph (1) - 
          (A) the Secretary shall be deemed to have issued and granted
        a decision in favor of the appellant as to any nonmonetary
        obligation and any monetary obligation the principal amount of
        which is less than $10,000; and
          (B) the Secretary shall be deemed to have issued a final
        decision in favor of the Secretary, which decision shall be
        deemed to affirm those issues for which the agency rendered a
        decision prior to the end of such period, as to any monetary
        obligation the principal amount of which is $10,000 or more,
        and the appellant shall have a right to judicial review of such
        deemed final decision in accordance with title 5.
    (i) Collections of disputed amounts due
      To expedite collections relating to disputed obligations due
    within the seven-year period beginning on the date the obligation
    became due, the parties shall hold not less than one settlement
    consultation and the Secretary and the State concerned may take
    such action as is appropriate to compromise and settle a disputed
    obligation, including waiving or reducing interest and allowing
    offsetting of obligations among leases.
    (j) Enforcement of claim for judicial review
      In the event a demand subject to this section is properly and
    timely commenced, the obligation which is the subject of the demand
    may be enforced beyond the seven-year limitations period without
    being barred by this statute of limitations. In the event a demand
    subject to this section is properly and timely commenced, a
    judicial proceeding challenging the final agency action with
    respect to such demand shall be deemed timely so long as such
    judicial proceeding is commenced within 180 days from receipt of
    notice by the lessee or its designee of the final agency action.
    (k) Implementation of final decision
      In the event a judicial proceeding or demand subject to this
    section is timely commenced and thereafter the limitation period in
    this section lapses during the pendency of such proceeding, any
    party to such proceeding shall not be barred from taking such
    action as is required or necessary to implement a final
    unappealable judicial or administrative decision, including any
    action required or necessary to implement such decision by the
    recovery or recoupment of an underpayment or overpayment by means
    of refund or credit.
    (l) Stay of payment obligation pending review
      Any person ordered by the Secretary or a delegated State to pay
    any obligation (other than an assessment) shall be entitled to a
    stay of such payment without bond or other surety instrument
    pending an administrative or judicial proceeding if the person
    periodically demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that
    such person is financially solvent or otherwise able to pay the
    obligation. In the event the person is not able to so demonstrate,
    the Secretary may require a bond or other surety instrument
    satisfactory to cover the obligation. Any person ordered by the
    Secretary or a delegated State to pay an assessment shall be
    entitled to a stay without bond or other surety instrument.

    Sec. 1726. Alternatives for marginal properties

-STATUTE-
    (a) Determination of best interests of State concerned and United
      States
      The Secretary and the State concerned, acting in the best
    interests of the United States and the State concerned to promote
    production, reduce administrative costs, and increase net receipts
    to the United States and the States, shall jointly determine, on a
    case by case basis, the amount of what marginal production from a
    lease or leases or well or wells, or parts thereof, shall be
    subject to a prepayment under subsection (b) of this section or
    regulatory relief under subsection (c) of this section. If the
    State concerned does not consent, such prepayments or regulatory
    relief shall not be made available under this section for such
    marginal production: Provided, That if royalty payments from a
    lease or leases, or well or wells are not shared with any State,
    such determination shall be made solely by the Secretary.
    (b) Prepayment of royalty
      (1) In general
        Notwithstanding the provisions of any lease to the contrary,
      for any lease or leases or well or wells identified by the
      Secretary and the State concerned pursuant to subsection (a) of
      this section, the Secretary is authorized to accept a prepayment
      for royalties in lieu of monthly royalty payments under the lease
      for the remainder of the lease term if the affected lessee so
      agrees. Any prepayment agreed to by the Secretary, State
      concerned and lessee which is less than an average $500 per month
      in total royalties shall be effectuated under this section not
      earlier than two years after August 13, 1996, and, any prepayment
      which is greater than an average $500 per month in total
      royalties shall be effectuated under this section not earlier
      than three years after August 13, 1996. The Secretary and the
      State concerned may condition their acceptance of the prepayment
      authorized under this section on the lessee's agreeing to such
      terms and conditions as the Secretary and the State concerned
      deem appropriate and consistent with the purposes of this
      chapter. Such terms may - 
          (A) provide for prepayment that does not result in a loss of
        revenue to the United States in present value terms;
          (B) include provisions for receiving additional prepayments
        or royalties for developments in the lease or leases or well or
        wells that deviate significantly from the assumptions and facts
        on which the valuation is determined; and
          (C) require the lessee or its designee to provide such
        periodic production reports as may be necessary to allow the
        Secretary and the State concerned to monitor production for the
        purposes of subparagraph (B).
      (2) State share
        A prepayment under this section shall be shared by the
      Secretary with any State or other recipient to the same extent as
      any royalty payment for such lease.
      (3) Satisfaction of obligation
        Except as may be provided in the terms and conditions
      established by the Secretary under subsection (b) of this
      section, a lessee or its designee who makes a prepayment under
      this section shall have satisfied in full the lessee's obligation
      to pay royalty on the production stream sold from the lease or
      leases or well or wells.
    (c) Alternative accounting and auditing requirements
      Within one year after August 13, 1996, the Secretary or the
    delegated State shall provide accounting, reporting, and auditing
    relief that will encourage lessees to continue to produce and
    develop properties subject to subsection (a) of this section:
    Provided, That such relief will only be available to lessees in a
    State that concurs, which concurrence is not required if royalty
    payments from the lease or leases or well or wells are not shared
    with any State. Prior to granting such relief, the Secretary and,
    if appropriate, the State concerned shall agree that the type of
    marginal wells and relief provided under this paragraph is in the
    best interest of the United States and, if appropriate, the State
    concerned.

    State officer or employee who receives trade secrets, proprietary
    information, or other confidential information under this chapter
    may be required to disclose such information under State law.

    Sec. 1734. State suits under Federal law

-STATUTE-
    (a) Action for royalty, interest, or civil penalty; limitations;
      notice of suit; award of costs and fees
      (1) A State may commence a civil action under this section
    against any person to recover any royalty, interest, or civil
    penalty which the State believes is due, based upon credible
    evidence, with respect to any oil and gas lease on Federal lands
    located within the State.
      (2)(A) No action may be commenced under paragraph (1) prior to 90
    days after the State has given notice in writing to the Secretary
    of the payment required. Such 90-day limitation may be waived by
    the Secretary on a case-by-case basis.
      (B) If, within the 90-day period specified in subparagraph (A),
    the Secretary issues a demand for the payment concerned, no action
    may be commenced under paragraph (1) with respect to such payment
    during a 45-day period after issuance of such demand. If, during
    such 45-day period, the Secretary receives payment in full, no
    action may be commenced under paragraph (1).
      (C) If the Secretary refers the case to the Attorney General of
    the United States within the 45-day period referred to in
    subparagraph (B) or within 10 business days after the expiration of
    such 45-day period, no action may be commenced under paragraph (1)
    if the Attorney General, within 45 days after the date of such
    referral, commences, and thereafter diligently prosecutes, a civil
    action in a court of the United States with respect to the payment
    concerned.
      (3) The State shall notify the Secretary and the Attorney General
    of the United States of any suit filed by the State under this
    section.
      (4) A court in issuing any final order in any action brought
    under paragraph (1) may award costs of litigation including
    reasonable attorney and expert witness fees, to any party in such
    action if the court determines such an award is appropriate.
    (b) Venue; jurisdiction of district court
      An action brought under subsection (a) of this section may be
    brought only in a United States district court for the judicial
    district in which the lease site or the leasing activity complained
    of is located. Such district court shall have jurisdiction, without
    regard to the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the
    parties, to require compliance or order payment in any such action.
    (c) Recovery of civil penalty by State; deposit of rent, royalty,
      or interest recovery in Treasury of the United States
      (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any civil penalty
    recovered by a State under subsection (a) of this section shall be
    retained by the State and may be expended in such manner and for
    such purposes as the State deems appropriate.
      (2) Any rent, royalty, or interest recovered by a State under
    subsection (a) of this section shall be deposited in the Treasury
    of the United States in the same manner, and subject to the same
    requirements, as are applicable in the case of any rent, royalty,
    or interest collected by an officer or employee of the United
    States, except that such amounts shall be deposited in the Treasury
    not later than 10 days after receipt by the State.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1735. Delegation of royalty collections and related activities

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authorization of Secretary
      Upon written request of any State, the Secretary is authorized to
    delegate, in accordance with the provisions of this section, all or
    part of the authorities and responsibilities of the Secretary under
    this chapter to:
        (1) conduct inspections, audits, and investigations;
        (2) receive and process production and financial reports;
        (3) correct erroneous report data;
        (4) perform automated verification; and
        (5) issue demands, subpoenas, and orders to perform
      restructured accounting, for royalty management enforcement
      purposes,

    to any State with respect to all Federal land within the State.
    (b) Prerequisites
      After notice and opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary is
    authorized to delegate such authorities and responsibilities
    granted under this section as the State has requested, if the
    Secretary finds that - 
        (1) it is likely that the State will provide adequate resources
      to achieve the purposes of this chapter;
        (2) the State has demonstrated that it will effectively and
      faithfully administer the rules and regulations of the Secretary
      under this chapter in accordance with the requirements of
      subsections (c) and (d) of this section;
        (3) such delegation will not create an unreasonable burden on
      any lessee;
        (4) the State agrees to adopt standardized reporting procedures
      prescribed by the Secretary for royalty and production accounting
      purposes, unless the State and all affected parties (including
      the Secretary) otherwise agree;
        (5) the State agrees to follow and adhere to regulations and
      guidelines issued by the Secretary pursuant to the mineral
      leasing laws regarding valuation of production; and
        (6) where necessary for a State to have authority to carry out
      and enforce a delegated activity, the State agrees to enact such
      laws and promulgate such regulations as are consistent with
      relevant Federal laws and regulations

    with respect to the Federal lands within the State.
    (c) Ruling as to consistency of State's proposal
      After notice and opportunity for hearing, the Secretary shall
    issue a ruling as to the consistency of a State's proposal with the
    provisions of this section and regulations under subsection (d) of
    this section within 90 days after submission of such proposal. In
    any unfavorable ruling, the Secretary shall set forth the reasons
    therefor and state whether the Secretary will agree to delegate to
    the State if the State meets the conditions set forth in such
    ruling.
    (d) Promulgation of standards and regulations with respect to
      delegation
      After consultation with State authorities, the Secretary shall by
    rule promulgate, within 12 months after August 13, 1996, standards
    and regulations pertaining to the authorities and responsibilities
    to be delegated under subsection (a) of this section, including
    standards and regulations pertaining to - 
        (1) audits to be performed;
        (2) records and accounts to be maintained;
        (3) reporting procedures to be required by States under this
      section;
        (4) receipt and processing of production and financial reports;
        (5) correction of erroneous report data;
        (6) performance of automated verification;
        (7) issuance of standards and guidelines in order to avoid
      duplication of effort;
        (8) transmission of report data to the Secretary; and
        (9) issuance of demands, subpoenas, and orders to perform
      restructured accounting, for royalty management enforcement
      purposes.

    Such standards and regulations shall be designed to provide
    reasonable assurance that a uniform and effective royalty
    management system will prevail among the States. The records and
    accounts under paragraph (2) shall be sufficient to allow the
    Secretary to monitor the performance of any State under this
    section.
    (e) Revocation; issuance of demand or order by Secretary
      If, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary
    finds that any State to which any authority or responsibility of
    the Secretary has been delegated under this section is in violation
    of any requirement of this section or any rule thereunder, or that
    an affirmative finding by the Secretary under subsection (b) of
    this section can no longer be made, the Secretary may revoke such
    delegation. If, after providing written notice to a delegated State
    and a reasonable opportunity to take corrective action requested by
    the Secretary, the Secretary determines that the State has failed
    to issue a demand or order to a Federal lessee within the State,
    that such failure may result in an underpayment of an obligation
    due the United States by such lessee, and that such underpayment
    may be uncollected without Secretarial intervention, the Secretary
    may issue such demand or order in accordance with the provisions of
    this chapter prior to or absent the withdrawal of delegated
    authority.
    (f) Compensation to State for costs of delegation; allocation of
      costs
      Subject to appropriations, the Secretary shall compensate any
    State for those costs which may be necessary to carry out the
    delegated activities under this Section.(!1) Payment shall be made
    no less than every quarter during the fiscal year. Compensation to
    a State may not exceed the Secretary's reasonably anticipated
    expenditure for performance of such delegated activities by the
    Secretary. Such costs shall be allocable for the purposes of
    section 191(b) of this title to the administration and enforcement
    of laws providing for the leasing of any onshore lands or interests
    in land owned by the United States. Any further allocation of costs
    under section 191(b) of this title made by the Secretary for oil
    and gas activities, other than those costs to compensate States for
    delegated activities under this chapter, shall be only those costs
    associated with onshore oil and gas activities and may not include
    any duplication of costs allocated pursuant to the previous
    sentence. Nothing in this section affects the Secretary's authority
    to make allocations under section 191(b) of this title for non-oil
    and gas mineral activities. All moneys received from sales,
    bonuses, rentals, royalties, assessments and interest, including
    money claimed to be due and owing pursuant to a delegation under
    this section, shall be payable and paid to the Treasury of the
    United States.

    (g) Judicial review
      Any action of the Secretary to approve or disapprove a proposal
    submitted by a State under this section shall be subject to
    judicial review in the United States district court which includes
    the capital of the State submitting the proposal.
    (h) Existing delegation
      Any State operating pursuant to a delegation existing on August
    13, 1996, may continue to operate under the terms and conditions of
    the delegation, except to the extent that a revision of the
    existing agreement is adopted pursuant to this section.

    TITLE 30 - MINERAL LANDS AND MINING
    CHAPTER 30 - NATIONAL CRITICAL MATERIALS COUNCIL

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1801. Congressional findings and declaration of purposes

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Congress finds that - 
        (1) the availability of adequate supplies of strategic and
      critical industrial minerals and materials continues to be
      essential for national security, economic well-being, and
      industrial production;
        (2) the United States is increasingly dependent on foreign
      sources of materials and vulnerable to supply interruption in the
      case of many of those minerals and materials essential to the
      Nation's defense and economic well-being;
        (3) together with increasing import dependence, the Nation's
      industrial base, including the capacity to process minerals and
      materials, is deteriorating - both in terms of facilities and in
      terms of a trained labor force;
        (4) research, development, and technological innovation,
      especially related to improved materials and new processing
      technologies, are important factors which affect our long-term
      capability for economic competitiveness, as well as for
      adjustment to interruptions in supply of critical minerals and
      materials;
        (5) while other nations have developed and implemented specific
      long-term research and technology programs to develop high-
      performance materials, no such policy and program evolution has
      occurred in the United States;
        (6) establishing critical materials reserves, by both the
      public and private sectors and with proper organization and
      management, represents one means of responding to the genuine
      risks to our economy and national defense from dependency on
      foreign sources;
        (7) there exists no single Federal entity with the authority
      and responsibility for establishing critical materials policy and
      for coordinating and implementing that policy; and
        (8) the importance of materials to national goals requires an
      organizational means for establishing responsibilities for
      materials programs and for the coordination, within and at a
      suitably high level of the Executive Office of the President,
      with other existing policies within the Federal Government.

      (b) It is the purpose of this chapter - 
        (1) to establish a National Critical Materials Council under
      and reporting to the Executive Office of the President which
      shall - 
          (A) establish responsibilities for and provide for necessary
        coordination of critical materials policies, including all
        facets of research and technology, among the various agencies
        and departments of the Federal Government, and make
        recommendations for the implementation of such policies;
          (B) bring to the attention of the President, the Congress,
        and the general public such materials issues and concerns,
        including research and development, as are deemed critical to
        the economic and strategic health of the Nation; and
          (C) ensure adequate and continuing consultation with the
        private sector concerning critical materials, materials
        research and development, use of materials, Federal materials
        policies, and related matters;

        (2) to establish a national Federal program for advanced
      materials research and technology, including basic phenomena
      through processing and manufacturing technology; and
        (3) to stimulate innovation and technology utilization in basic
      as well as advanced materials industries.

-STATUTE-
      Congress finds that - 
        (1) in order to promote energy independence and meet the
      increasing demand for energy, the United States will require a
      diversified portfolio of substantially increased quantities of
      electricity, natural gas, and transportation fuels;
        (2) according to the report submitted to Congress by the
      National Research Council entitled "Charting the Future of
      Methane Hydrate Research in the United States", the total United
      States resources of gas hydrates have been estimated to be on the
      order of 200,000 trillion cubic feet;
        (3) according to the report of the National Commission on
      Energy Policy entitled "Ending the Energy Stalemate - A
      Bipartisan Strategy to Meet America's Energy Challenge", and
      dated December 2004, the United States may be endowed with over
      one-fourth of the methane hydrate deposits in the world;
        (4) according to the Energy Information Administration, a
      shortfall in natural gas supply from conventional and
      unconventional sources is expected to occur in or about 2020; and
        (5) the National Academy of Sciences states that methane
      hydrate may have the potential to alleviate the projected
      shortfall in the natural gas supply.
